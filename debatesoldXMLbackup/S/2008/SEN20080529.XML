	<P>I have received notice from Senator Diarmuid Wilson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to advise on the current position on the urgent need for a new school building at Laragh national school, Stradone, County Cavan; and to outline when it is proposed to begin this project and the current status of the application for this school.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the specific difficulties and solutions for acquiring a site for Monreagh national school, Carrigans, County Donegal, given the school was sanctioned in 2001 and that, four sites later, the school has not progressed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to exert maximum influence to ensure the final round of the Zimbabwean presidential elections is free and fair.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe<b> </b>of the following matter:</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received notice of a matter of concern from Senator Twomey under Standing Order 31, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Science and his colleague the Minister for Finance to alter the legislation regarding the registration of charities to shorten the interval between registration as a charity and the charitable status activation from <Col N="1120"/>two years to three months for all schools in the country to allow them benefit from this legislation to fund activities.  It will be taken at 12.50 p.m.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, referral to committee of four justice measures, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re Thornton prison, referral to committee; and No. 3, the substantive motion re development of a prison in the district electoral division of Kilsallaghan.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that No. 1, motion re (i) a proposal for a Council decision on the improvement of co-operation between the special intervention units of the member states of the European Union in crisis situations, (ii) a proposal for a Council framework decision on taking account of convictions in the member states of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings, (iii) draft Council decision on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, and (iv) a proposal for a Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings on No. 2 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m.  No. 3 shall be moved and discussed with No. 2 and shall stand adjourned at 1.30 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes, and Senators may share time, by leave of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is news we are hearing today that there will be a budget deficit of up to &euro;8 billion this year.  Given that growth rates are falling faster than a barometer reading before a storm, this is an issue of major concern.  The Taoiseach is stating the national development plan is being prioritised but this is another way of stating cutbacks are due.  To date, the collateral damage of the events the Taoiseach has been describing has affected sick children at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, and patients in day-care centres in his own constituency.  These are the ones who have been receiving this prioritised treatment so far.</P>
        <P>There is a serious need for this House to continue to have the range of debates it has been having on the economy.  It is the failure to reform and cut back wasteful expenditure over recent years that is putting us in this position today.  The Leader should arrange for regular debates on the economy so we can track what is happening.  This is a very serious issue.  The expected budget deficit this year of &euro;8 billion reflects very different circumstances to those that obtained even last December.  There is a predicted deficit next year of up to &euro;10 billion, which demonstrates a considerable change in the economic outlook.  Growth rates are dropping to 1% this year and there is a predicted growth rate of 2% for next year.  If the present downturn continues, we could see ourselves in a recession very soon.</P>

	<P>We are already in one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should wake up to what is happening.  The House should have regular debates on the economy.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to consider the possibility of using his party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion next week to discuss the issue of the Lisbon treaty.  For many ordinary people, one of its most important features will be the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I have been surprised that many of those who oppose the treaty do not make more of this issue because it is a matter that <Col N="1121"/>should be debated at length in the House.  As time is against Members, the Leader should give consideration to allowing his party to use its Private Members&rsquo; time purely to debate the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the attention of Members to one of the items that is being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  I refer to No. 22 on the Order Paper, which is based on section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  Members should consider this because it is a serious matter.  I have referred to this legislation many times, together with the Equal Status Act 2000.  It is the one that, to my horror, allows discrimination to take place.  When Members debated the Act during its passage through the Houses, I did not have a problem with the objective that they were trying to protect.  However, I find appalling the manner in which it has been done.  I do not object to what is being done in this case.  The Church of Ireland College of Education is informing the House that it intends to reserve 32 places in the college for people of that ethos for the next number of years.  No sane right-thinking person could object to that.  I always have maintained that this should be possible without introducing regressive forms of legislation.  I am not engaging in debate on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No. 22 is not being referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise as I thought it was one of the aforementioned four items.  The Order Paper is very long.  I was referring to No. 22 on the Order Paper, which was laid before the House yesterday.  As I presume Members will come to it next week, I will make my point then.  I apologise to the Cathaoirleach.  It is a case of being overly-organised.</P>
        <P>I completely agree with the point raised by Senator Twomey.  Members must look seriously at where the country is going.  The real test of a government is its performance when matters are going badly.  Problems will be created if the Government begins to pull back from the national development plan.  We must continue to build infrastructure to enable us get out of any recession and the national development plan should be given support.</P>
        <P>If aspects of the plan require reconsideration, this should be done in a proper way.  The national pay talks and partnership talks were set up to do so as they were born out of bad times in 1987.  At a time when people are sitting around the table, they should be obliged to listen to the problems that have arisen.  The Government should outline its problems, the other participants should do likewise and people should be obliged to listen to one another.  I will outline what should not happen.  Members may have heard a funny piece on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning when a representative from the Small Firms Association made an impassioned appeal in respect of the national development plan.  He advocated reforming and cutting back on the public services and suggested that money should not be spent on various aspects of it.  He suggested everyone else should be obliged to cut back and the Government should not spend money and should pull back on everything.  He then was asked what the members of the Small Firms Association intended to do.  Without a trace of irony and without drawing a second breath, he replied they would continue to do what they always did.</P>
        <P>Such an attitude will destroy this country.  Everyone should get stuck in to do his or her bit, the Small Firms Association included.  Everyone must listen to and share their problems to find a common solution.  National partnership talks are the ideal place in which to so do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>All Members were pleased to hear the wonderful news emanating from Croke Park that we appear to be in sight of introducing an international ban on cluster munitions, an issue that was debated in this House only last month.  Praise must be given to the Government for hosting this conference.  It was good to hear the Prime Minister <Col N="1122"/>of the United Kingdom, Mr. Gordon Brown, confirm on the radio this morning that the United Kingdom would sign up.  The United Kingdom&rsquo;s actions helped to influence others to come on board.  However, three superpowers have not signed up, namely, America, Russia and China.  They still lie outside the court of international opinion on this issue.  Ireland can take steps to put pressure on them.  For instance, our ambassadors in the aforementioned three countries can work on them through diplomatic channels.  Moreover, most Members will have received this morning a letter from Amnesty International, from a former Member of this House, asking them to sign a petition.  People also can contact their friends and families in the United States and ask them to try to contact the three remaining presidential candidates in an effort to include the issue in the presidential debate in that country.  We now are in sight of securing an international ban and everyone can do his or her bit to make it a reality.</P>
        <P>I read in Tuesday&rsquo;s edition of the<i> Financial Times</i> that Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s have stated there has been a sharp rise in the number of people who now are in mortgage arrears even though the economy remains quite strong.  However, with rising prices and increases in unemployment rates, there is a real concern that increasing numbers of people will fall into mortgage arrears.  People have been encouraged for years to buy their own houses and now they need help.</P>
        <P>I too am concerned about potential delays to the implementation of the national development plan.  If anything, investment in the national development plan should be increased. If this entails arguing with the European Central Bank for a temporary derogation in the percentage of money that can be borrowed, that should be done.  However, if investment is increased, it is important that it should be focused in certain areas.  We must invest in education, broadband and transport infrastructure.  Investment in those areas will bring more jobs and will guarantee that homeowners can pay their bills.</P>
        <P>In the past I have called for a debate on the responsiveness of emergency units to accidents and Members will have observed that Dublin already has experienced gridlock several times this year.  Another incident took place at 2.30 a.m. this morning when an accident occurred on the M1 at Swords.  It had not been cleared up six hours later and consequently, the M1 was closed at peak hour and people still are sitting in their cars.  As I speak, the tailbacks have reached Drogheda.  This probably is the first Irish traffic jam that can be seen from space.  People are missing business meetings and I spoke to one person this morning who was late for a hospital appointment.  Moreover, people trying to reach the airport have missed flights.  This issue must be tackled.  I am fed up asking for a debate on emergency services and the manner in which they respond.  It is vital to be able to clear up accidents as soon as possible.  I again ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on this subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Hannigan, I welcome the announcement that agreement was reached last night in Croke Park on the international treaty banning the use of cluster munitions or cluster bombs.  The central role played by Ireland in organising this conference and in pushing forward the issue must be acknowledged, as must the role the United Kingdom is playing.  It appears that its Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, is keen both to support the treaty and to try to persuade other significant world powers, such as the United States, China and Russia to consider embracing it.  The only issue that remains to be clarified fully and which is important, pertains to what happens in the case of joint operations.  My understanding from the news that broke this morning is that the ban on such cluster munitions in the 100 states that have signed up to it will have the effect of preventing them from participating in joint operations with other powers that use cluster munitions.  Clarity on this issue would be welcome and the Leader might ascertain whether this is the case.</P><Col N="1123"/>
        <P Just="Left">The other issue I wish to raise this morning is the Lisbon treaty, which is to the fore in everyone&rsquo;s mind.  Members may have noticed this morning that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has mentioned his concerns that failure to ratify the Lisbon treaty could derail the negotiations and progress made in respect of climate change agreements and talks.  This also pertains to agreements on emissions reductions that the European Union has pursued proactively.  Even in the short time that remains before the referendum on 12 June, the Leader should consider inviting the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources before the House to explain to Members the importance of the Lisbon treaty in addressing the issue of climate change, the present position of the negotiations and the direction in which he envisages them going, were the treaty to be ratified.  In addition, the Minister could explain the issue of energy policy because a significant provision in the Lisbon treaty gives the European Union new competence in this regard.  Ratification of the Lisbon treaty will result in significant attention and support being given to the promotion and development of the renewable energy sector across the European energy market.  In addition, there will be much greater action on energy conservation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made her point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the House should consider, as a matter of urgency, asking the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to address the House on this issue.  I believe he considers it to be such an important issue that he would be willing to do so despite his busy schedule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been, rightly, many calls in this House in recent weeks for a debate on the level of retail pricing in Ireland because consumers feel ripped off.  The debate was moved forward constructively yesterday, in terms of informing politicians of what is happening, by contributions made elsewhere on actions taken by the National Consumer Agency.  In light of this further information I again ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this subject in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is important that three points be covered in any debate that is organised.  First, the response of some agencies to this matter is to call on consumers to shop around but the big issue we face in Ireland is not the difference in prices between supermarkets but the difference between levels of pricing in Ireland and outside Ireland.  Calling on consumers to shop around misses the point and will not provide an adequate response to this matter.</P>
        <P>Second, more and more people refer to the fact that prices in corner stores and similar outlets are high compared with other stores.  It would be viciously ironic if those who paid the price for whatever happens in the future were the retailers in the small, independent, indigenous sector in Ireland.  By and large, they do not contribute to the issues we face and we must have balance in recognising their needs.</P>
        <P>The third and final point relates to the role of manufacturers in Ireland.  The level of profits created by multinational manufacturers in Ireland, due to changes in the euro&rsquo;s exchange rate, has gone through the roof in recent years.  Ensuring those profits are reinvested to deliver good value pricing in Ireland is probably the biggest thing any agency or Government could do to see that this issue is properly addressed.  When the pressure is on and the cost of living is increasing exponentially, a more forensic analysis of what is happening and a more detailed response to the issue are necessary.  I am concerned that some of these issues are being ignored at the moment and a debate could allow us to air them properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that in years to come the recent passing of the cluster munitions convention will be seen as an historic event.  In spite of the absence of some of the <Col N="1124"/>superpowers, I genuinely believe that a moral milestone has been laid down that will be difficult to ignore in years to come.  By hosting the event Ireland has enhanced its role as a moral beacon in world affairs and as a nation that is prepared to lay aside selfish ambitions for the common good and in defence of the human rights of people without a voice.</P>
        <P>One can only describe cluster munitions as official terrorism and by engaging in this the international community, on which we depend to create stability, prevent conflict and promote human rights and peace, undermines its credibility and authority.  Ireland can continue to play a role as 100 countries have now signed up to the convention.  It is important we use every opportunity in official circles to put an end not only to cluster munitions but the whole underground business of weaponry.  This area must be addressed because we all know some very shady deals have taken place over the years.</P>
        <P>I hope that in the same way we took a stand on the invasion of Iraq and on other issues that did not have the <i>imprimatur</i> of the United Nations, we will take a stand in this case.  Cluster munitions cause the indiscriminate killing and maiming of humans.  Even after the event, those who must clear the ground are exposed to grave danger.  We saw some of the victims at the convention in Croke Park.  This matter cries out for justice on behalf of all who have an interest in promoting the global welfare of all people.  I am glad that Ireland and Croke Park have been to the fore in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Leader for a debate on the level of integration of migrants in Ireland as this is an important issue.  In the past week we celebrated Africa day and I understand it was a huge success that saw great events held, especially in Dublin&rsquo;s city centre.  Last week, in light of Africa day, I had the pleasure to launch a report produced by AkiDwA, a network of African and other migrant women living in Ireland that has done great research work on the experiences of migrant women in Ireland and the ways in which integration could be improved for them.  The report was on gender-based violence, particularly its incidence in the African community in Ireland, and how services here can best deal with violence in particular communities.  One of the report&rsquo;s most important recommendations was that services here should be culturally specific when dealing with African women and women from other ethnic minorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In today&rsquo;s newspaper a further report, commissioned by the Immigrant Council of Ireland and published by UCD researchers, was referred to.  That report found, alarmingly, that there are very low levels of integration of immigrants in Ireland from a number of different communities.  It studied Nigerian, Chinese, Indian and Lithuanian communities in Ireland and made the point that many members of those communities would like greater social interaction with local residents but lacked the opportunity to do so.  This is something AkiDwA has also highlighted.  We have migrants living here with high levels of qualifications and skills but who are not using them.  The skills of migrants tend to be overlooked and they can be left working in jobs beneath their qualifications.  We need a debate on this matter to see how we can improve integration, upskill migrants and ensure they work in jobs appropriate to their skills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader of the House consider putting Senator Twomey&rsquo;s proposal relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights on the Order Paper for Private Members&rsquo; time next week?  Next week could be a Lisbon reform treaty week in the House.  Perhaps the Leader would agree that the issues we discussed yesterday could be debated on Thursday.</P>
        <P>Those opposed to the Lisbon reform treaty rely on posters depicting three monkeys and Dustin the turkey to damage the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  They are not using facts and figures and are <Col N="1125"/>not prepared to debate the reality of this situation.  When there is a downturn in the economy the last thing we could want is to be outside the influence of the European Union and to lose our influence in it.  One million jobs have been created here since 1973.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This can be included in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We have received &euro;58 billion in Common Agricultural Policy, Structural and Cohesion Funds since 1973.  The contribution has been huge.</P>
        <P>Ireland has held the European Union Presidency on numerous occasions and in this regard we proved one of the most successful of the 27 member states.  We can be proud of this.  What would we gain by throwing away all of this?  What has the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign said to convince any sane person to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June?  Two weeks from today we face a major decision and I ask that next week be Lisbon reform treaty week in the Seanad.  We will have the opportunity to discuss all of these issues and I hope people vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 12 June.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to follow up on what has been said regarding the Lisbon treaty.  A new element has been introduced by an organisation, C&oacute;ir, relating to the primacy of EU law.  Reference has been made by this organisation to a declaration 17 of the Lisbon treaty, which reiterates the existing position on the primacy of EU law.  This is what we signed up to when we joined the European Union in 1973.  The wording in our Constitution resulting from the referendum of 1972 states that no EU law can be invalidated if it is necessitated by our membership of the community.  That principle was established before we entered the community by a court judgment, Costa <i>v.</i> ENEL, in 1964.  The declaration refers to that case and implies that to have a community where EU law does not have primacy would be meaningless.  Why adopt laws at European level if they cannot be applied and enforced throughout the community?</P>
        <P>However, this has been misconstrued.  On the basis of that false premise the organisation has suggested that the European Court could introduce abortion in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s directions on that.  I have a question for the Leader.</P>
        <P>On the basis of this false premise this organisation is suggesting that abortion could be introduced by the European Court, although the court is in fact bound by the express wording of the Lisbon treaty, which specifically acknowledges the Irish constitutional prohibition of abortion.  The organisation also suggests that same-sex marriage may be introduced in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the wording of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which forms part of the Lisbon treaty, specifically states that such issues will be decided in accordance with national law.  Thus, it is for this House and the D&aacute;il to decide on same-sex marriage.</P>
        <P>It is also suggested that ratification of the Lisbon treaty could result in harmonisation of taxes, including corporation taxes.  Again, the European Court of Justice has already pronounced on this issue in the case of Cadbury Schweppes, in which it was judged that tax competition is a reality and that resolving it is a political rather than a legal matter.  In addition, we know that we have a veto on tax harmonisation.  Perhaps it would be useful if a statement could be made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We heard this in the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  I was looking for questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a specific question for the Leader.  This is a matter which has to do with the interpretation of the Constitution and the existing legal position.  It would be helpful if the Attorney General could issue a view on this and a statement clarifying the position.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris has a bee in his bonnet about the provisions on neutrality in the Lisbon treaty.  The President of the European Parliament, when he came to the House, confirmed that Ireland is entitled to maintain its neutrality.  There are express provisions in the Lisbon treaty to that effect.  There are provisions in our own Constitution.  In the debate next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are having it now, apparently.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in asking the Leader for an ongoing debate on the economy.  As we have seen from recent reports, these are the most challenging times we have experienced for almost the last 30 years.  I could not agree more with the point made by other speakers with regard to maintaining momentum on the national development plan.  The Taoiseach fully agrees with this.  His statement that we must prioritise the work of the national development plan to focus on those issues that will increase our competitiveness was most prudent.  At no point did he say we would in any way wind down our commitments under the plan, only that we would be more strategic in prioritising those projects that would help enhance and maintain our competitiveness into the future.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Toole in calling on all sections of society to play their parts in these challenging times.  I also refer to a previous proposal I made in the House to set up a committee to monitor social partnership.  I hope that workers and employers alike will see the realities that face us and play their parts.</P>

	<P>I welcome the comments of Senators Hannigan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others on the excellent news that more than 100 countries have agreed to sign up to a ban on cluster munitions.  I raised this issue a number of weeks ago.  It is disquieting that two members of the UN Security Council were absent from the negotiations.  However, that is balanced by the good news that the UK has come on board.  This is a significant development because, as we know, the UK has some leverage with various countries, particularly the USA.  It is important, however, that we not ignore our own responsibilities.  We have done excellently in hosting this conference and credit is due, but it is important that we not approach our international relationships &mdash; whether with the EU, China or the USA &mdash; in terms of what other countries can do for us economically.</P>
        <P>Ireland has done well to stress our special relationship with the USA in recent years.  We need to become a pestering friend.  We must make sure that in addition to seeking the best for our people in economic terms, we continue to aspire to being a moral voice also.  We must do our best at diplomatic level, in view of our neutrality and our status as a small and respected state, to keep bringing this issue to the fore until those countries that really can make a difference, such as the USA and China, accept the moral lead that has been given by more than 100 countries in banning cluster munitions.</P><Col N="1127"/>
        <P>Could I also mention briefly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate, along with my colleague Senator Bacik, on the integration of immigrants.  It is disquieting that according to a report by UCD researchers, as few as 12% of Chinese immigrants and as few as 22% of Lithuanians regard themselves as being highly integrated into Irish society.  I emphasise that being integrated is not the same as being employed.  Lithuanians, for example, have high rates of employment but are not highly integrated.  This imposes a major responsibility on Irish people to do what we can to respect the dignity of our immigrant population.</P>
        <P>I know of a number of cases in which Africans who came to this country as minors and have been here for a number of years, who have excellent characters and where people will give them references&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have this discussion during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;are now facing deportation, while they know of people who have been in trouble with the law but have still got their papers.  Is it not time we had a debate in this House about immigration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has sought the debate.  It is a matter for the Leader to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding now.  I ask that the debate on immigration include the question of an amnesty for people who came here as minors, who have been here for a number of years and who are of excellent character as testified by Irish people and others.  Given that they do not have contacts they can rely on in their home countries, these people should be given their papers and allowed to establish a new life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the fishermen in France who are protesting about high fuel costs by blocking ports.  This is having a direct impact on many fishermen on the west coast, particularly in my own county of Donegal.  Crab and lobster fishermen are being prevented from exporting their product to France.  France imports approximately 13 million tonnes of crab annually, a significant proportion of which comes from Ireland.  The Irish market in crab and lobster is being eroded by the blocking of French ports.  I spoke to fishermen this morning who are fishing out of four different ports in Donegal.  At present they have no livelihood because it has been eroded.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister with responsibility for the marine to come to the House next week, if possible, to discuss this important issue.</P>
        <P>Many of these fishermen were previously salmon fishermen who availed of the opportunity to leave the salmon fishing industry, and the only form of income they now have is from crab or lobster fishing.  However, this is now being eroded by events in another country.  Some of these fishermen have expressed concern to me that this may affect their votes in the referendum on the EU reform treaty.  This is something we should deal with in the House next week if possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Twomey and MacSharry in seeking regular debates on the economy.  This is something we must monitor at all times, especially given the possible growth rate of 1% to 1.5% this year.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the country needed a 4% growth rate in order to allow continued investment in the national development programme.  This is where politics comes into play.  We all have different philosophies, so our <Col N="1128"/>preferred prioritisation of the NDP and the areas in which we would like to see progress differ.  The priorities of my party differ from those of the other parties.</P>
        <P>While competitiveness has been referred to by the Government, I would welcome more detail.  I would like the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to prioritise and plan for broadband.  National development plan or no, broadband is the number one infrastructural issue.  Countries that are less wealthy than Ireland and as far afield as eastern Europe and Asia have been innovative.  Will the Leader arrange regular debates on financing so that the House can determine the Government&rsquo;s priorities from an NDP point of view?  Investment in education must be maintained in our changing economy.</P>
        <P>With the recent change in Ministers of State, it would be a good idea to invite to the House the new Minster of State at the Department of Education and Science with responsibility for science and technology so that he could express his opinions.  Given that almost 40% of exports are high value and knowledge oriented, I would welcome the opportunity to learn what new ideas the Minister of State has in that regard so that the House could contribute to the debate.  There is a divine trinity in terms of progress, but serious problems are being experienced in two of its elements, namely, the provision of infrastructure, which is linked holistically with broadband, and investment techniques to support start-up and medium-sized businesses, which are not getting bang for their buck from the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Twomey&rsquo;s call for ongoing debates on the economy.  We are all interested in the progress of the national development plan.  Given the frightening unfolding budgetary situation, it is important that the Leader allow periodic reviews of the matter in a general sense.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Lower House debated the recommendations of the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report.  There has been a significant delay in the introduction of the requisite legislation and, while the Minister stated that a Bill was on its way, I do not know when it will be published.  Will the Leader enlighten the House?  Members of all sides of both Houses have varying and divergent opinions on the recommendations.  We must be cognisant of the fact that Mr. Justice Clarke, in his 2007 judgment, stated that there should be a minimum delay in giving legislative effect to the independent commission&rsquo;s reports and findings.  Will the Leader comment or allow a debate in this regard?  It would be timely to consider the matter even in the absence of a Bill and to revert to it after the Bill&rsquo;s publication.  Will the Leader also arrange for a debate on the report on local electoral areas, which is due shortly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy that Senators are unanimous in welcoming the cluster munitions ban treaty.  We can be proud of the fact that it will forever have the name &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; attached to it.  We should compliment the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who took a direct, active and personal interest in this matter, and Pax Christi Ireland, which briefed Senators ahead of the debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, through which the House played its role.  At the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Higgins and I tabled a motion that was passed unanimously.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the United Kingdom came on board, largely through the efforts of Lord Alfred Dubs and Lord Elton of the Upper House of the British Parliament, who attended the parliamentarians&rsquo; conference several days ago.  I hope that the stigma that operated after the ban on landmines and that prevented even non-signatories such as the United States and others from using those weapons will act in this instance.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the interoperability clause introduced at the behest of France and the UK.  It must be made clear that Irish troops will never engage in military action in co-operation <Col N="1129"/>with an army deploying such filthy weapons.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an undertaking along these lines?  A lack of participation will force the remaining countries to stop using those weapons.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to a debate in the Lower House and to compliment Deputy Ulick Burke of Fine Gael who raised the matter of the promotion of so-called alcohol shot packs by an English firm.  They are targeted at young people and have an 80% alcohol content.  Young people are also targeted with Bullseye Baggies.  Despite MEAS, a ridiculous cover group, the drinks industry is targeting young people and using sporting events.  Given yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the Broadcasting Bill 2008, we should take our courage in our hands and ban alcohol advertising on the airwaves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We did so in respect of smoking, another health problem, and should be able to do so in this regard.  If necessary, we could estimate compensation for small and independent stations for lost revenue.</P>
        <P>The situation on the M1 was dreadful.  I also understand that a young woman may have been killed in a tragic accident on Parnell Street.  Despite Mr. Frank McDonald&rsquo;s comments in <i>The Irish Times</i>, some of these problems will be alleviated by metro north.</P>
        <P>I will not attempt to engage in a debate with the Cathaoirleach, the Leader or Senator Regan on the Lisbon treaty.  Were it true that the treaty advocates, endorses or promotes same sex marriages, I would vote for it.  However, it is not true and the people on that side who maintain that the treaty is a liberal charter are wrong.  For this reason, I will vote against the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make those comments during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Lisbon treaty has been mentioned by a number of colleagues.  The referendum will be on this day fortnight when people will have a fundamental decision to make.  We must concede that, so far, apathy and confusion have been winning.  In so far as Senators can, we have a duty to bring some degree of clarity to allow the electorate to reflect on the issues fully.  The statements on the treaty and a debate on the legislation were helpful, but new questions and concerns emerge as the debate evolves.  If possible, will the Leader set aside a full day for additional statements next week?  We could respond to some of the queries and concerns.  It is important that people have an opportunity to present their arguments, to ask their questions and to have them answered.  Some of the wilder allegations and claims could be responded to firmly and fully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>False information also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Given our political responsibility to the electorate, further debating time and clarity are necessary to wipe away confusion and apathy in so far as is possible and to maximise the number of people voting.  The majority of Senators hope the referendum will be carried and 100% of Senators hope for a high turnout, with the people coming out in their droves to cast their verdict.  However, this will only occur if we can provide answers to some of the questions still in the public arena.  All that the House can do is to provide more time for Senators on all sides of the debate to continue making statements and providing information and clarity.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader set aside substantial time next week?  There is no point in debating the matter in three weeks&rsquo; time and wondering what went right or wrong.  Next week will be our opportunity to play our part in advancing democracy and the people&rsquo;s knowledge of this <Col N="1130"/>important treaty.  We can then go back to debating other important issues such as the economy, the jobs crisis and so on.  However, the number one priority for next week must be the Lisbon treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader organise a debate on the proposed Green Paper on local government?  Such a debate would be welcomed by the vast majority of Members.  The issue of funding for local authorities must be debated as soon as possible.  A report in one of yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers referred to the proposal by the manager of Kerry County Council for a &euro;200 charge per household.  This was described by a Fine Gael councillor, Mr. Pat McCarthy, as rates by the back door.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator not to name persons outside the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for an urgent debate on the Green Paper on local government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Twomey, MacSharry, Kelly and Coghlan called for a debate on the economy.  As I said yesterday, I will endeavour to have this take place before the end of the session.  Senator MacSharry made a useful suggestion that a sub-committee of the House be established to monitor the progress of the national development plan and the social partnership agreement.  We will discuss this proposal at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see how it can be progressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly spoke about the need for improved broadband provision.  The difficulties in this regard represent a serious challenge for the State while also offering potential for significant job creation.  Business is not about turnover but rather about overheads.  Improved broadband provision will allow self-employed people to operate from home.  It will also offer women working in the home a way of earning a supplementary income.  All workers will be able to avail of modern technologies in their home, which may allow them to avoid the inconvenience of commuting to and from work.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed on this issue.  I have already given a commitment to the House to have this debate take place before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>I have received many calls in recent weeks for a debate on the Health Service Executive.  I compliment everybody who contributed to yesterday&rsquo;s debate.  In particular, I commend the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who once again excelled in displaying her absolute grasp of her portfolio.  There is never any difficulty in asking her to make time in her diary for us.  Yesterday was the fourth occasion since this Seanad was formed that she has taken part in a debate in this Chamber.  I am extremely grateful to Senators for their participation and for the informed way in which the Minister enlightened the House on the up-to-date position.  She faces a serious challenge in tackling the various difficulties in the health service.  We all wish to support her in any way we can.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to No. 22 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, which is a draft order for approval.  He correctly pointed out that the draft order was laid before the House last Tuesday, 27 May.  I hope to deal with this next week.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan, de B&uacute;rca, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Mullen and Norris welcomed the wonderful news from Croke Park that an agreement had been reached on the banning of cluster bombs.  This is a milestone decision by the 100 countries involved.  I congratulate the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on their initiative on this issue and their work in brining it to this stage.  I welcome this morning&rsquo;s <Col N="1131"/>confirmation by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, that his Government will sign the agreement.  I watched a television biography of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, last night.  The courageous stance she took on this issue helped to frame international opinion.  I congratulate everybody associated with the agreement.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, we can be proud that a decision of major international significance was made in Croke Park.  Senator Norris observed that it may come to be known as the Dublin agreement.  It represents a significant step forward in dealing with what is a serious challenge.</P>
        <P>I am willing to allow a debate on house prices, as called for by Senator Hannigan.  The current challenge is that there is an oversupply of some 50,000 houses.  Potential buyers can now avail of incredible value for money, with prices being reduced on a weekly basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is so in Oldcastle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are good opportunities for young couples.  People sometimes ask me about the good old days when house prices were much lower.  I always respond that the good days are now and that they were bad old days when people had to set aside some 38% of their disposable income to make mortgage repayments, even though their mortgage loan with the local authority might only be &pound;8,000 at 9%.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to join the eurozone means we are now enjoying the benefits of a strong currency.  If we had opted out of the euro, interest rates would be three percentage points higher.  First-time house buyers would be in far worse predicament in that scenario.</P>
        <P>A two-year period is minor in the lifetime of any property purchase.  People will experience a period of difficulty where more of their disposable income must be set aside to meet mortgage repayments, but they will soon recover from that.  For those of us who are fortunate enough to be in a position to receive them, the increases available under the national wage agreement are of great benefit.  The farming community has been well looked after by the EU and public servants are assured of significant increases, with 2.5% due in September.</P>
        <P>The real heroes of the Celtic tiger are the self-employed.  When the economic situation was poor and others took the boat or aeroplane, that option was not available to them, yet there is a widespread view that the self-employed were creaming it.  I wish to record my appreciation of what has been done and is still being done by the self-employed.  Anybody who survived the 1960s and 1970s deserves a gold medal for their efforts to keep family businesses going while paying income tax rates of up to 68%.  These people are heroes.  It is not the case that only one side is doing its bit.  Self-employed people have made a tremendous contribution, along with farmers and public servants.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the horrific five-vehicle crash which occurred early this morning on the M1.  We were all horrified to hear of the unfortunate motorist who went to assist the drivers in the first two vehicles and was struck by a truck.  We know it is a serious accident when the road is closed for more than 12 or 14 hours, particularly on a route of such significance.  I am familiar with the location in which the accident took place.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca, Leyden, Regan, Bradford and Twomey sought assurances that there will be another debate on the Lisbon treaty.  With the agreement of the House, I will propose next Wednesday that there be an extended Private Members&rsquo; time of three hours in which Fianna F&aacute;il will table a motion to debate the Lisbon treaty.  If this is insufficient to allow Members to put forward their views, I will propose that the debate be resumed on Thursday, after we have dispensed with legislation.  This will ensure every Member has an opportunity to express his or her views on this important treaty on which the public must adjudicate.  I hope this proposal will be agreed by all the leaders so that Fianna F&aacute;il can play its part in facilitating this debate.</P><Col N="1132"/>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for a debate on the National Consumer Agency and consumer issues, with particular reference to prices.  I am aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment had a meeting with the agency&rsquo;s representatives yesterday.  I will certainly allocate time for that debate in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill highlighted the plight of fishermen and the fishing industry, particularly in Donegal where crab and lobster fishermen have been affected by the protest in France.  One of the tragedies of a protest of this magnitude is how it can paralyse an industry practically overnight.  I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Minister and will invite the Minister to the House to discuss marine matters in general as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and Mullen sought a debate on integration of immigrants and the position of migrant women in Ireland.  I agree with the Senators&rsquo; sentiments with regard to eminently qualified people who come to this country, such as engineers, doctors and so forth, but are unable to seek jobs in their areas of expertise.  They must take on menial jobs in order that they can live in peace here with a little income to support their families until times improve in their native countries.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly called for a debate on innovation and technology.  That can be included in the debate on broadband and finance, which I will arrange before the end of this session.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan sought a debate on electoral boundaries, similar to the debate that took place in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The local election constituency review is taking place at present and its report must be on the Minister&rsquo;s desk by 22 June.  Perhaps we should wait and debate the two matters together.  To say I am interested in the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s findings is an understatement.  As Members are aware, that commission made the decision to move the north Westmeath area, which was my base, into the Meath West constituency.  Sometimes one thinks these events are an act of God but on this occasion it was an act of the commission.  I do not hold it against anybody but in its wisdom it has again left the same area in the Meath West constituency in its latest revision.  It might have been an accident the first time but I have my doubts about the second time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cassidy for his kind remarks.  He sometimes has marathon battles with an unmentionable relative of mine but I assure him I do not harbour similar thoughts to hers with regard to the Senator.  I know the Senator from the life I led before entering politics, during which he was very helpful and positive to me, which was most welcome.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak on the resolution placed on the Order Paper under section 26(1) of the Prisons Act 2007 approving the development of a prison in the district electoral division of Kilsallaghan in the county of Fingal.  This development is a major step forward for prisoners in the Dublin area.  It will do away with slopping out in Mountjoy Prison, sub-standard accommodation and overcrowding and it will provide state-of-the-art prison accommodation and facilities for education, training and, most importantly, rehabilitation of offenders.  The details of the proposal for a new prison development at Thornton Hall in Kilsallaghan were made public on 29 February 2007 as part of a public consultation process.  All the relevant papers were formally laid before the House on 14 May and the draft resolution was submitted on 15 May.  It was originally proposed to debate the resolution last week but, to facilitate the Opposition, it was agreed by the Government to defer the debate in both Houses to this week.  It was also agreed to refer the resolution to a joint committee for further consideration next week.</P>
        <P>The Prisons Act 2007 sets out a special procedure that may be applied for the purpose of determining whether consent should be granted to larger prison developments.  Prior to the Prisons Act 2007, the procedure for all prison developments was determined in accordance with Part 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Under those regulations, the Minister of the day was effectively the deciding authority for planning matters for prisons and until the enactment of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 there was no statutory provision for an environmental impact assessment for a prison development.  The purpose of the 2007 Act is to provide a more open and transparent mechanism for major prison developments under which an environmental impact assessment, EIA, meeting EC standards must be prepared and the Houses of the Oireachtas make the decision whether to grant development consent.  This is done in the form of a resolution, which must be then confirmed by an Act.  The confirming legislation can be presented to the House only after the appropriate resolution has been passed.</P><Col N="1138"/>
        <P Just="Left">The initial stages of the process have been already progressed.  On 29 May 2007, the provisions of Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 were applied to the proposed prison development in the district electoral division of Kilsallaghan.  The main development is at the site of Thornton Hall in the townland of Thorntown although part of the development, mainly the access route, goes through adjoining townlands, all in the Kilsallaghan area.  While the new development has not yet been given an official name, for the sake of convenience it is normally referred to as the development at Thornton Hall.  On 29 February 2008, and in compliance with the Prisons Act 2007, public notice was given of the proposed prison development.  Copies of the environmental impact assessment and visual representations of the proposed development were made available to the public and an invitation was extended to make observations and submissions on the matter to a rapporteur appointed by the previous Minister, former Deputy Michael McDowell, over a six week period which concluded at midnight on 11 April 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rapporteur received 130 submissions and has produced his report which has been recently published.  The purpose of the report of the rapporteur is to identify those who have made submissions, to identify the main issues raised and to provide a summary of the submissions and observations received.  Despite what some people have claimed, the rapporteur does not criticise the proposal in any way.  Rather he summarises and reports what others have said and that is clear from the introduction to his report.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his predecessor have had regard to both the environmental impact assessment and the report of the rapporteur in proposing the resolution before the House.  The environmental impact assessment had previously identified several measures to mitigate the impact of the development on the environment and further mitigation measures are now proposed in the context of the resolution to address concerns raised during the public consultation process. In addition to the report of the rapporteur, an electronic copy of all the submissions received has also been made available in the Library for the convenience of any Member who wishes to examine the original submissions.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set down in a document on 14 May his observations, pursuant to section 26(3) of the Prisons Act 2007, on the environmental impact assessment and rapporteur&rsquo;s report.  The document addresses each detailed point raised in the report and sets out the Minister&rsquo;s observations on it.</P>
        <P>The proposed development comprises eight separate and distinct institutions designed to hold a total of 1,400 prisoners on a single site of approximately 120 acres enclosed within a single perimeter with centralised stores, work training, educational and library facilities and visitor facilities.  All the buildings except the control centre will be two stories or less.  The existing boundary hedgerows are being maintained.  Inside this area there will be a planted area ten to 20 m in depth, then a fence, a patrol road and a wall approximately 7 m in height.  Inside the wall is the <i>cordon sanitaire</i> which will be generally 40 m in depth before the internal fencing of the development is reached.  Car parking for visitors and staff is outside the perimeter wall.  A dedicated public transport service to the development from the city centre will be provided for visitors.  The floor area of the prison is approximately 140,000 square metres.</P>
        <P>The development of the prison at Thornton Hall will be the single biggest step in improving standards for prisoners since the foundation of the State.  The development&rsquo;s main purpose is to replace existing sub-standard accommodation and to allow greater capacity to avoid overcrowding.  Advantages of the development include ending the practice of slopping out, which is a feature of life in the Mountjoy male prison, proper educational and rehabilitation services will be available, and the problems of overcrowding will be addressed.  Addressing overcrowding will not simply involve a short-term fix; the design of the prison will address this <Col N="1139"/>problem for the long term.  Cells are designed to be larger than normal in order that if there is a significant increase in the prison population, they can be sub-divided to provide for a greater number of inmates.  The development will also mean that instead of housing more than 990 prisoners on a 20 acre site, including 585 prisoners in one institution, we will have eight self-contained institutions with a total capacity of 1,400 prisoners on a 120 acre site.  The largest institution will hold only 192 prisoners.  The purpose of the design is to gain the maximum rehabilitative benefit from having a collection of small institutions, but to also maximise the operational benefits associated with larger prisons by having one perimeter wall and one central stores and maintenance service.</P>
        <P>The construction of the new prison will also improve matters for the existing prisons in the Dublin area in that it will give greater flexibility to developing the other prisons.  For example, it will allow younger male offenders to be located at Wheatfield Prison, which has the proper facilities for that age group.  It may allow Wheatfield Prison to house only young male offenders and not mix categories of prisoner.  The detention of persons under 18 years of age is no longer the responsibility of the Prison Service and the intention is to house all offenders under 18 in Oberstown.  I expect new facilities at Oberstown to be available before the closure of Mountjoy Prison, but if for any reason they are not, there are contingency plans to keep the young males in question in a separate facility at Thornton Hall where they will have no interaction with adult prisoners pending completion of the necessary works at Oberstown.  I emphasise this is a contingency plan and not a permanent arrangement.</P>
        <P>The resolution is the consent required for the prison development at Thornton Hall to proceed.  It represents the planning permission for the prison.  The format of the resolution complies with section 26 of the Prisons Act 2007, including addressing the requirement to list the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or offset any possible significant adverse effects of the development on the environment.  It also details some small, but for the people concerned potentially significant, alterations to the original proposals, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made in response to concerns expressed during the public consultation process.  It also sets out the conditions that are to be complied with in the construction of the prison.  Although the resolution represents the planning permission, it must still be confirmed by legislation before it takes effect.  If the necessary resolution is passed, the Minister will introduce a two section Bill to confirm the resolution and to give it statutory effect.</P>
        <P>Prisons, by and large, do not have significant adverse impacts on the general environment.  Nevertheless, the Prisons Act, 2007 takes a very proactive approach and requires an environmental impact assessment to be carried out in the case of every prison development that falls within its scope.  Any large-scale development, whether it be a prison or housing estate will affect those living in the immediate proximity of the site and, therefore, some impact is likely.  It is clear from the environmental impact assessment that the overall impact is not significant from a national or regional perspective.  However, it is also true that a number of residents, particularly those adjoining the main site, will be affected.  Considerable efforts have been made to minimise and mitigate the impact of the development.  For example, there is extensive use of tree screening and as previously stated, all the buildings are of two stories in height or less except for the control centre which will be three stories in height.  The environmental impact assessment goes into considerable detail on the mitigation measures proposed to minimise impact both during the construction and operational phase.  Notwithstanding this, the public consultation process and the rapporteur&rsquo;s report identified specific concerns and further measures are being taken to address these issues which I will outline. From the outset, the major concern of the local residents has related to the possible use of the R130 road, a secondary route, as the main access route to the new development.  The relevant section of the R130 is a straight stretch of road, approximately 1.5 km in length and it passes by a local national <Col N="1140"/>school.  While the R130 could support the traffic required for the development, there were concerns expressed about the implications for the safety of local school children and its impact on the local community, particularly during the construction phase.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recognising that these concerns were strongly held and in an effort to minimise the impact of the development on the local community, the Department arranged that additional lands should be purchased to construct a dedicated access road running from the former N2 main road, now the R135, direct to the main facility.  Once the new access route has been constructed, complete with underpass, all traffic to the development will use it, thereby removing the necessity to avail of the R130 road.  It had been intended to use the R130 in the initial phase of the development to allow the new access route to be completed as quickly as possible.  However, in the light of submissions received by the rapporteur and in recognition of the fact that there were genuine concerns locally, it is now proposed that the construction of this new access route should be prioritised.  No heavy construction vehicles will be allowed use the R130 road through Coolquay even during the construction of the access route itself.  I hope this reassures local people and especially locals present in the House.</P>

	<P>I am sure it will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was also some concerns expressed about certain emergency exits being used by service and delivery vehicles and this is also addressed in the draft resolution by ensuring that the emergency exits will never be used for deliveries or service vehicles.  Several people living in the immediate proximity of the prison are personally affected and alterations are also proposed in the resolution to alleviate their concerns.  In particular, the depth of the existing planting area which runs around the outer boundary and which currently stands at 10 m, will be increased in key areas by a further 4 m to 10 m.</P>
        <P>The planting of a number of mature trees will also greatly assist in screening the perimeter wall from residences in close proximity.  This will require the main security wall to be moved further back from the boundary in some areas.  Furthermore, a 3 m high timber fence will be installed around the car parks on the west side of the site.  The parking level will be lowered and light fixtures will be kept below the height of the fence to ensure that the noise and light impact on adjoining residences is minimised.  Visually conditioned concrete will also be used on the sections of the wall most visible to the public.</P>
        <P>The resolution includes a number of conditions, the first of which is a statement that the development to be constructed must be as described in the environmental impact assessment and planning notice.  As I have already noted, major concerns arose in regard to the use of roads, so the resolution imposes conditions requiring the new access route to be constructed first and makes it clear that heavy construction, delivery or removal vehicles must use the new access route rather than the existing R130 past the local national school.  The perimeter wall is itself an important measure in mitigating the effect of noise and dust on those living in the area.  Therefore, when general construction work begins, it is intended that the construction of the perimeter wall will be one of the first priorities.  The resolution also requires that a construction environmental management plan must be drawn up by the primary contractor before construction work begins and it must address the mitigation measures already identified in the environmental impact assessment.</P>
        <P>While not directly relevant to the issue of development consent for the prison complex at Thornton Hall, I wish to address the questions of a new Garda station for the area and the Central Mental Hospital.  The Garda Commissioner has agreed that construction of a new Garda station for the area will be given priority.  The station will serve the local community <Col N="1141"/>and will be accessible to the public from the existing R130 road rather than through the prison site.  In addition to providing added local security, it will deal with any criminal offences committed within the prison complex.  The construction of the Garda station is not covered by this development consent procedure and will be subject to the normal process as set out in part 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.</P>
        <P>Members will note from the maps and drawing before them that approximately 20 acres of the original Thornton Hall site has been excluded from the proposed prison development and reserved as a possible site for the construction of a new building to house the Central Mental Hospital.  That project is a matter for the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children.  The resolution before us has no effect on the future of the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>Today we are in a position to make significant progress on improving the Irish prison system.  This project will not only improve the lives of prisoners and prison staff but will also ensure an adequate level of secure and safe accommodation for the future, along with a tangible hope for improved rehabilitation work with prisoners.</P>
        <P>Once development consent has been granted we will be in a position to finalise and sign the contract.  A tender competition has already been held for a public private partnership to design, finance, build and maintain the prison complex at Thornton Hall.  A number of consortia were formed and a preferred bidder has been selected.  Negotiations are at advanced stage and the intention is to finalise matters after the decision on development consent has been made.  While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no reason to believe that negotiations will not be successfully concluded, he has emphasised that he is determined to get the best value for money and that other options are available if the preferred bidder does not meet the necessary requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank my Fine Gael colleagues, and Senator Regan in particular, for allowing me to speak first.  I declare a strong and abiding personal interest in this matter in that my house will adjoin the prison wall and my brother-in-law sold the land for the prison site.  I also want to make it clear that living beside a prison is not an issue for me.  If I was given a straight choice between living next door to 1,000 houses, a landfill, an incinerator or a prison, I would choose the prison.  I want the Prison Service, the Minister of State and the Department to understand that I have no difficulty with this aspect of the matter.  However, I believe it is the wrong location for an urban prison.  For some of the reasons I have outlined, I have not been involved in any agitation against the prison.  Despite my reservations over its location, I accept the decision was made democratically and I do not want to be seen to have NIMBY syndrome.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take a personal interest in the issues that I raise because I am speaking on behalf of local residents.  I would like to hear back from him, either on a one-to-one basis or in a meeting with some of the people concerned.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has stated:  &ldquo;While the new development has not yet been given any official name, for the sake of convenience it is normally referred to as the development at Thornton Hall&rdquo;.  I ask him to consider naming the prison at the earliest opportunity because the name &ldquo;Thornton Hall&rdquo; refers to a preserved building on the site which is not part of the prison complex.  The new name for the prison should not include &ldquo;Thornton&rdquo; because those of us whose addresses include that word do not want to be confused with the inmates, regardless of how good or bad they may be.  I am presenting this in a soft way but it is a serious point and I ask the Minister of State to have regard for it.  Perhaps he will revert to me on the issue.  A previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that it was his intention to <Col N="1142"/>use &ldquo;New Mountjoy&rdquo; as the working title for the project.  I ask this to be reflected in whatever legislation is introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will revert to the Minister of State on that.</P>
        <P>Even though it is less than 16 miles from this House, Kilsallaghan is a completely rural area.  It does not have a pub or a shop and its community comprises a couple of hundred people.  It is not a village or a hamlet; it is merely a spread of houses.  I ask Members to consider what this huge development will mean for the area.  As the Minister of State noted, we are acting as planning authority for this project.  Certain Members on the opposite side of the House regularly speak about the importance of planning.  This should be considered as a planning issue as well as a prison issue.  Today I am dealing with the local impact.</P>
        <P>Thus far, the project has brought no return to the local community.  Residents believe that they did not ask for a lot and that more should be offered to them.  I acknowledge that the access road, which allows entry to the site directly from the N2, will reduce direct pressure on local roads, although there will clearly be a considerable increase in local traffic.  The local community appreciates that provision.  In regard to the new Garda station, I have been burgled at least ten times in the 35 years I have lived in Kilsallaghan, so local security is important.  In recognising that the environment of the area will be irreversibly changed, I ask the Minister of State to address certain issues.  Local people are concerned and a decision should be taken by the Minister of State to the effect that their home security will be upgraded.  There is no reason this could not be done.</P>

If there are 1,000 inmates in the prison &mdash; questions have arisen as to what will be the final number &mdash; and 2,000 staff, this new facility will have a population larger than those of many towns.  Some locals asked that a perimeter footpath be put in place in order that people might walk in a safe environment.  There is also a need for a bridle path to be installed because there are some horse-riding facilities in the area.  People will not be able to ride their horses on the roads in the future and this will put some of the facilities to which I refer out of business.</P>
        <P>There is a reference to wind farms in the Minister&rsquo;s observations.  It is stated that the prison wall would not affect the operation of wind farms.  I do not know from where that observation came but I suspect it arose on foot of a point I made in my personal submission in respect of this matter to the effect that I had intended &mdash; and gone some substantial way towards &mdash; installing a 6 kilowatt wind generator adjacent to our home.  The man from County Cork who was installing the generator informed me &mdash; I want the Department to check the technical position in this regard &mdash; that I would need a clean sweep of 100 m around the generator and that a 7 m wall would create turbulence which would not allow for the proper generation of wind energy.  I am not an expert in this area but that is why I called a halt to the project.</P>
        <P>I was not being a smart alec when I made my submission and I did not refer therein to wind farms.  I made a point in respect of the installation of one wind generator.  Members will be aware that I am interested in this matter.  There are solar panels installed at our home and we are particularly interested in green initiatives.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the local authority.  A complex relationship exists among local authority planning, the county development plan and what is happening in this instance.  It is not sufficient to say  various things are being made available and that people should deal <Col N="1143"/>with the local authority.  The Irish Prison Service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should discuss matters with the local authority.  For example, the local authority should be informed that all houses in the area should be connected up to the sewerage system, that any homes requiring three-phase electricity should be connected to the relevant system and that broadband should be rolled out in the area.  Even though it is located only 17 miles from the House, the area does not have access to broadband.</P>
        <P>I am trying to raise simple, straightforward issues.  I could speak at length &mdash; my colleague, Senator Bacik will do so &mdash; about the philosophy behind imprisonment.  However, I do not have the luxury of doing so at this stage.</P>
        <P>It is not sufficient to consult local people in respect of this matter.  The community in the area will be changed forever.  It is not about consulting, it is about negotiating.  The Department and the Irish Prison Service must negotiate with local people and not merely listen to what they have to say and then make a decision.  An offer must be put to the locals, who must be allowed to indicate what they want and then an agreed position can be reached.  The same process must be followed in respect of the local authority.  The community in the area feels hard done by.  The prison authorities now have a good opportunity to put something back into that community.</P>

	<P>I am happy to support the Government&rsquo;s proposal in respect of this project.  We must face reality.  Mountjoy Prison, which was built in 1850, is a Victorian institution which lacks adequate basic facilities such as in-cell sanitation.  While the Irish Prison Service has made improvements at Mountjoy Prison, the reality is that conditions there still fall far short of what one would expect of a modern prison system.  There is little space in which to facilitate education, work, training programmes and the provision of rehabilitative support.</P>
        <P>We cannot expect the staff and others who work in our prisons to deliver a 21st century model of correctional excellence in a physical environment which dates from the 19th century.  In addition, the location of the prison has clear security implications, with the necessity for constant vigilance on the part of staff and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that contraband items, such as weapons and drugs, are not thrown over the perimeter walls and retrieved by prisoners.</P>
        <P>We must be honest enough to accept the criticism of conditions in Mountjoy Prison that have come from independent commentators and prison experts.  The Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment criticised the facilities and conditions at the Mountjoy complex following each of its visits in 1993, 1998, 2002 and 2006.  Similarly, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention has made frequent and strident criticisms in his reports of the facilities at Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has examined various options over the years to improve conditions at Mountjoy, ranging from basic refurbishment to the complete demolition and redevelopment of the site.  I am advised that these options did not prove feasible for a number of reasons, including the constraints imposed by the size of the Mountjoy site and its city centre location, with major housing developments located outside the perimeter wall.  For any serious attempt at redevelopment to proceed, it would have been necessary to close or severely reduce the capacity of the prison during the project at a time when prisons are operating at very close to full capacity nationally.  From any objective point of view, a move to a greenfield site presented the best option if the Irish Prison Service is to be allowed deliver the type of rehabilitation programmes for prisoners that one would expect in a 21st century prison, as well as a good work environment for staff and other support personnel.</P>
        <P>It is clear the decision by Government to acquire 150 acres at Thornton Hall was not taken lightly.  The recommendation in this regard followed the evaluation of approximately 31 sites <Col N="1144"/>that were offered to the Office of Public Works.  It was decided that Thornton Hall was the most satisfactory site on which to build a new prison to replace those on the Mountjoy campus.  In recommending the Thornton Hall site, I endorse the decision of site selection committee decision, which had the benefit of technical reports prepared by expert consultants.</P>
        <P>The principal advantages of the Thornton Hall site are clear and include its size, the fact that it is located within ten miles of O&rsquo;Connell Street, that it is some considerable distance from any significant population centre and that there is easy access to the national motorway network.  The proposed new prison at Thornton Hall will comprise eight individual facilities which will be practically self-contained.  Each facility will have its own unique and discrete regime and this will give members of the prison population housed within it access to the work, training, education and rehabilitative programmes and recreation areas and activities appropriate to them.</P>
        <P>Contrary to what has been said by some commentators, Thornton Hall will not be a super-prison.  The main accommodation blocks will comprise four wings, with two landings per wing.  There will be a range of other types of accommodation facilities.  Under this arrangement, there will be no more than ten rooms in each house in some of the accommodation units.  All of these facilities will be located within the secure perimeter.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service will employ the latest technology, including CCTV systems and electronic alarms systems, to ensure the security and safety of the facility.  The design will also make it more difficult for contraband to enter the prison over the perimeter walls.  This will be achieved by means of locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls and thus ensuring a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>.</P>
        <P>I commend the efforts taken by the Irish Prison Service to engage with and listen to the views of the local community.  Many concessions have been made to local people.  The process that has been followed is an excellent example of meaningful consultation.  However, I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s excellent suggestion that the name &ldquo;Thornton Hall&rdquo; should not be used in respect of the prison.  The Minister of State indicated that he would take on board the Senator&rsquo;s request that the name be changed.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestion to ensure proper development of the surrounding area, particularly because I come from a rural area.  The Senator&rsquo;s contribution was similar to one I made recently in respect of the decline of rural Ireland in which I sought the provision of footpaths, cycle lanes, etc.  These matters must be addressed in respect of all isolated areas.  The residents of the Thornton Hall area are at an advantage now because they can request that money be diverted from the financial contributions that will be made to the local council in order to develop the area.</P>
        <P>When the Thornton Hall site was purchased in 2005, the Irish Prison Service engaged a landscape architect to develop a boundary planting scheme.  As a result, a 10 m boundary planting scheme has been undertaken inside the existing hedgerow to minimise the visual impact of the proposed prison development.</P>
        <P>Following further discussions with the local community, it was decided that the prison accommodation or cell blocks would comprise two-storey buildings, thus minimising the visual impact on the landscape.  In addition, a separate dedicated access road to the prison is being provided, which the Minister of State has outlined in his speech.</P>
        <P>As a further assurance to the local residents that their quality of life will not be unfavourably affected by this development, it has been decided that a Garda station will be built at the perimeter of the development.  It is an excellent concession that will be greeted favourably.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has outlined that.</P><Col N="1145"/>
        <P>The key objective of this project is to accept the limitations of current prisons as highlighted by international experts and tackle them by raising the standards of prison accommodation to increase the chances of rehabilitation of offenders.  I congratulate the Irish Prison Service on undertaking such a lengthy and meaningful consultation process.  It is clear that many of the community&rsquo;s opinions have been taken on board.  The reality is that some opposition would be met no matter where the new site would be located but, on balance, we have got it right and I am happy to support this vital long-term investment in our prison facilities which are central to the proper administration of justice in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a project into which, in many respects, the Oireachtas was bounced.  It was a rushed job at the time and it was ill-thought through.  It is symptomatic of the waste of this Government and the expense incurred has been the subject of adverse comment by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The site secured was 50% bigger than originally intended and there was a lack of competition in the process.  While it is acknowledged that the facilities in Mountjoy and other prisons are below standard, to put it mildly, the Government cannot take a slap on the back for the project it put together at Thornton Hall.</P>
        <P>Having said that, we are dealing today with what is essentially a planning matter, as the Minister of State indicated.  It is not dissimilar to the Part VIII process with local authorities where a local authority is a planning authority.  The Prisons Act 2000 gives that authority to the Minister and Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>On the planning process, the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole on payback, <i>quid pro quo</i> or at least consideration for the local community in terms of its concerns on planning aspects should be taken on board.  It is a major project and any planning process, whether approved by a local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, would normally attach conditions dealing with the type of concerns raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I ask the Minister of State to bear that in mind.</P>
        <P>There is no question but that there is a need for increased capacity in our prison system and to improve the standard of accommodation and facilities for prisoners.  In particular, there is a need to end the sub-human and degrading practice of slopping out and the problems that arise from overcrowding in individual cells.  The fact prisoners will have individual cells is to be welcomed.  The proposal to have eight individual and self-contained accommodation blocks with different security levels also represents good practice.  There is no question this facility, as we understand it and as it has been outlined, will certainly provide the space for work training, education and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
        <P>It appears to be a facility which is too big for the purpose.  The Government is attempting to justify the choice of the site and the scale of the lands purchased by a number of measures.  It is ending the D&oacute;chas Centre in Mountjoy and transferring the female prisoners from there.  That is a ten-year-old modern facility so that move requires some explanation.  The suggestion of accommodating young offenders at Thornton Hall seems to be in breach of international practice.  There is also a move essentially to criminalise the mentally ill by moving the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall.  There is also the issue of detaining asylum seekers at the new complex.  All of these moves represent bad policy and are not supported by Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>While we are dealing with the planning process, given the scale of this project, we should outline the Government&rsquo;s prison policy.  That is what is disappointing in the justification of or rationalisation for this project.  We know from the reports of the prison inspectorate, prison chaplains and the European Council Committee for the Prevention of Torture that we have, to say the least, an inadequate current prison system.  Violence is rife and there is a continuity of criminal activity within the prison facilitated by the availability of mobile phones.  Illegal drugs are also available within the prison.  Almost 25% of the prison population is under protective custody and an average of one prisoner per month in 2007 died in custody.</P><Col N="1146"/>
        <P>What we really have is a warehousing prison policy where there are entirely inadequate rehabilitation programmes and where education programmes have been discontinued, notwithstanding the hard evidence that education programmes play a fundamental role in reducing reoffending by prisoners.  There is also the case of those entering prison because of crimes relating to drug addiction but they are given no opportunity to live in a drug-free environment in prison or avail of adequate drug treatment programmes.  This creates a system which makes hard criminals harder, more alienated and angry when they finish their sentences.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Oireachtas will return to this matter as a Bill must be passed by the Oireachtas in approving this project.  There should be a statutory obligation in the new Bill to make prison complexes drug-free.  There is reference to a perimeter, or <i>cordon sanitaire</i>, some 40 m deep around the prison to prevent drugs getting in.  There is also a need for screening of visitors, although I do not know if the Minister of State can address that.</P>
        <P>There is an <i>ad hoc</i> system of drug treatment.  In Mountjoy, only nine prisoners at a time can avail of the drug treatment programme.  There is also an obligation on the Government not only to provide facilities for rehabilitation but for programmes as well.  There is no evidence that exists at present.  Taking the cost of housing a prisoner for one year as almost &euro;100,000, that not only makes good policy but economic sense.</P>
        <P>There is a role for education in prisons in encouraging prisoners to enter society again without reoffending.  Some 50% of young offenders are illiterate and the figure for the adult prison population is 65%.  The problem will not be solved by bricks and mortar alone.  The extent of reoffending &mdash; 50% within four years and 27% re-entering prison within a year &mdash; underlines the problem that exists.  Society must have an effective legal system that penalises criminals for their offences.  However, without drug-free prisons and proper drug treatment facilities, as well as a greater emphasis on rehabilitation, the warehousing system we have will continue.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State one or two questions on a number of points he has made.  With regard to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated yesterday no concrete plans have, as yet, been drawn up for a new central mental hospital on this site.  The Minister said today that this is a matter for the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children but it appears we are passing the buck and not being forthright.  It is clear there is an intention, and it is for administrative reasons rather than any medical or good prison policy reasons, to relocate this hospital.</P>
        <P>On the economic aspect, we have good medical advice on that as well as the advice of economists such as Jim Power that this decision does not make economic sense.  Will the Minister provide greater clarity on the Government&rsquo;s intention on this matter?</P>
        <P>The preferred bidder in this project is the McNamara group, which has withdrawn from a number of public private partnership projects with Dublin City Council.  Is there a plan B regarding this project?  The Minister stated that if the project does not go ahead with this developer, other options can be pursued.  What are those other options?</P>
        <P>Is it envisaged that there will be court facilities at Thornton Hall to avoid trekking to and forth from the prison to court, tying up many human resources, including the police, and affecting the smooth running of the prison?</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to comment on those three points.</P>

	<P>It is an open secret that the Green Party had qualms about locating a new prison at Thornton Hall, and it formed some of the negotiations for the programme for Government.  However, it has been accepted as a policy that is in train and will be seen through to conclusion.</P><Col N="1147"/>
        <P Just="Left">There is no disagreement about the need for a new prison.  The existing prison infrastructure in this country is unacceptable and inhumane.  In many of the prisons the conditions are<?oasys _jy ?>Dickensian.  There is no doubt about the need to transfer much of the current prison population to a new facility; the need exists in other parts of the country also.  The most overcrowded prison in the Prison Service currently is Cork Prison and I would like some progress regarding a new prison in the Cork area.</P>

	<P>Spike Island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Spike Island has been taken off the agenda.  There had been talk of a new prison in the Kilworth area which, as a parallel, has many of the disadvantages highlighted in the debate on Thornton Hall <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Mountjoy in that it is 30 miles outside Cork city, does not have a dedicated public transport network and is compromised in terms of offering family support by way of visitation, which should be an essential part of a rehabilitation process in any prison sentence.  The Minister of State might indicate whether progress is possible in that area.</P>
        <P>The question of the nature of prisons is not proper for this debate.  It is a technical motion and as Senator Regan said, there will be a debate on the Bill itself but we need a debate in this House.  The issue of whether some prisoners should be serving sentences and the accommodation problem, which is causing difficulties at both ends in that prisoners who should get longer custodial sentences are not getting them because there is not enough space in our prisons, has been raised on the Order of Business on many occasions.  When we have that debate it will be informed by an appropriate contribution from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Even though my party is supportive of the construction of Thornton Hall, given the progress that has been made on the development of the site, I am concerned about some aspects of the way the development is to proceed. This technical motion refers only to the prison development.  We do not know the position regarding the reception centre for people seeking asylum and immigration status, which is open to debate and causes concern in wider society.</P>
        <P>The question of the Central Mental Hospital is also left open.  As a third area I am glad that is the case because the economics that inform the idea of selling the entire Dundrum site for the Central Mental Hospital and moving it to Thornton Hall no longer necessarily applies.  We should use the change in the economic circumstances and the uncertainty of the property market to question whether the move &mdash; which has questionable moral justification &mdash; from Dundrum to Thornton Hall can now best be considered by redevelopment of the Dundrum site.</P>
        <P>The Patients not Prisoners report published on Tuesday by the Irish Mental Health Coalition shows the way regarding a partial sale of the Dundrum site that would allow the full redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  Given that the Taoiseach in particular has said he is prepared to examine areas of public expenditure and certain policy areas, this is a good opportunity to do so in regard to an unnecessary linkage that exists between a health issue and a justice and prisons issue.  I hope he will take that opportunity.</P>
        <P>I share the concern articulated by Senator Regan about the preferred bidder in this site.  I have no questions about the tendering process, which has been done with as much efficacy as possible, but the fact that it has delivered a company that is currently under a critical eye raises questions about that very tendering process and the contracting that follows therefrom.  It should be an element of any contract with companies providing services to the State, particularly regarding capital infrastructure, that there is consistency in their dealings with the State.  If a company provides a large piece of infrastructure in the form of a prison and chooses not to provide other forms of infrastructure in the form of social housing, that raises serious ques<Col N="1148"/>tions about the nature of that contracting system.  I ask that the tendering process and contracts be examined in that regard.</P>
        <P>Regarding public private partnerships, I helped author a report on the need to tighten up many contracts in this area.  I am not talking about PPPs specifically but the principles are the same in that the State enters into a contractual relationship and too often the nature of those contracts are stand alone and they do not take into account the history of the company concerned in terms of working with the State and the ability to see through any contract agreed.</P>
        <P>I have expressed my reservations about the wider aspects of the Thornton Hall development while acknowledging my party&rsquo;s support for the motion before the House and envisaging the development of the prison.</P>
        <P>In response to points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, we need to improve the planning process but also recognise that when we propose projects of this nature, where at the very least there is a social inconvenience, we should promote the idea of community contracting.  It is not just a matter of the nuts and bolts of the planning process, walls of various heights and buildings at certain distances from each other.  There should be a parallel process of contracting services in the community and ensuring the community gets access to them &mdash; the point Senator O&rsquo;Toole made &mdash; as a result of living with what is a social inconvenience.  I hope the wider legislation that will come before us will deal with those points because it would help towards the long-term acceptance of a project where the local community is uncomfortable with what has been done to date and what is proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.I am pleased to speak on this motion, because the prison is just outside Ashbourne, County Meath, and I have been aware of the problems and complexities of this issue for some time.  Three years ago I was attending meetings of 400 and 500 people voicing their concerns.  Many questions still need to be answered and it is to be hoped that having the Minister of State present will mean some of them will be addressed today.  This will probably be the most expensive prison facility ever built on this island so it is important we get it right.</P>
        <P>I am still perplexed as to why the Government had to pay so much for the land.  It was a mistake and the Government has tried to put as many buildings on to the land as possible to try to recoup its investment.  That is a mistake.  It is not a suitable site for a women&rsquo;s prison and neither should the Central Mental Hospital be relocated there.</P>
        <P>However, we need to move away from the issue of how much it cost and how great a mistake was made and focus on other matters.  I shall shortly come to the issue of the size of the main prison, but first I shall talk briefly about proposals to relocate the women&rsquo;s prison and the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall.  I cannot see what benefits will be achieved by relocating the female prison to an overwhelmingly male dominated environment.  Instead, we should be re-examining the question of refurbishing the D&oacute;chas centre at Mountjoy.  It is a safer and more preferable option and ultimately more cost beneficial.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the proposal to move the Central Mental Hospital from its current home at Dundrum and organisations close to this issue, such as Schizophrenia Ireland, have seriously questioned whether this is a good idea.  We will all have seen the report by Mr. Jim Power, chief economist with Friends First, who suggests that the sale of just 14 acres of the land at Dundrum would raise about &euro;140 million.  That figure might be somewhat lower in the <Col N="1149"/>current market, but his point is that we could sell some of the site and build a completely new hospital at Dundrum.  It would mean that users would have access to the best facilities possible.  His report, Patients Not Prisoners, makes that point, as does <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Interestingly, the point was made in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that 100 years ago when the Central Mental Hospital was being built at Dundrum, it was decided not to build it adjoining a prison institution as this would not be the right message because of the potential stigma.  I ask the Minister of State to look again at this issue, and I am glad that some Members on the Government side of the House are admitting that perhaps this is not the thing to do.</P>
        <P>Neither do I believe that the case has sufficiently been made for a prison of this size.  My D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has made the point that at the moment Mountjoy holds about 900 prisoners.  This proposal is for a prison that would cater for up to 2,200.  I shall quote from a couple of pieces of research as regards prison size and I hope Members bear with me as I read these findings into the record.  A recent report by the Scottish prison service says:</P>
        <P LI="1">The effective management of a large prison population requires that prisoner groupings continually need to be broken up and dispersed as the most viable antidote for dealing with order problems.  A small number of very large prisons creates difficulties in splitting up prisoner groupings, such that there are no points of contact . . . Effective separation requires a reasonable number of moderately sized prisons to achieve this &mdash; again, this would be achievable with establishments at or around 700.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Security concerns were raised about prison size by Lord Woolf&rsquo;s report into the Strangeways riots in 1990 which many of us will remember.  That report recommended a maximum size of just 400, significantly lower than the Thornton Hall proposal.  The UK&rsquo;s chief inspector of prisons, Ms Anne Owers, has also commented on the issue of prison size.  She warns in her most recent annual report against the UK Government proposals for a vast expansion in so-called Titan prisons containing about 2,500 prisoners.  Such establishments fly in the face of experience to the effect that smaller prisons work better, Ms Owers says.  The larger prisons may be more efficient, she argues, but at the cost of being less effective.  These are two cases from across the water which cast serious doubt on these so-called super-prisons.</P>
        <P>At the same time I am aware that super-prisons exist elsewhere.  The Rikers Island prison complex in New York, for example, has 17,000 inmates.  It consists of ten penal institutions for young offenders, male and female, all split up separately and contained in different parts of the complex.  It has been operating successfully since 1985.   Singapore, too, has started to implement its Changi prison complex which could eventually house more than 20,000 prisoners in 20 different penal institutions on the one site.  The operators in Singapore say the infrastructure, design and technology would enable economies of scale and allow enhanced security and better rehabilitation for prisoners.  I am fully prepared to accept, therefore, that there is a debate about what the optimal size of a prison should be.  I do not know the answer but I want to hear a clear rationale for why 2,200 is the right size for us.  People deserve to know this and I also want to know how the prison will be segmented, clustered and operated.</P>
        <P>I have further detailed issues with the operation of the prison that need to be sorted out, probably before the design stage.  For instance, it must be accessible to visitors, staff and garda&iacute;.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague in Government, Deputy Trevor Sargent will be very aware of the road system in that part of the world.  He would concede that an essential road system is needed before this prison opens, as is a bus service, which does not exist around Thornton Hall at the moment.  Deputy Sargent might cycle there but the majority of visitors will come by public transport or car, so we need to put these facilities in place before the prison opens.</P><Col N="1150"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked me to raise the issue of boundary treatment and landscaping.  We are proposing a 7 m high wall.  Given the space available, this could be moved back to create a larger boundary between the prison and the adjoining residential population.  These are detailed issues that I fully accept can be worked out.  We need to allocate the space on the site appropriately and it is to be hoped that if the Minister of State takes on board the points about the Central Mental Hospital and the women&rsquo;s prison, there will be more space available.  This space should be used for rehabilitative purposes.  I would like to see more sports grounds on the site, more study areas, classrooms and decent sized accommodation for inmates.  Those matters can be looked at and I hope the Minister of State can take them on board.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the proposal as it stands is the answer to the problems of the Irish Prisons Service.  I do not believe that locating the Central Mental Hospital or the women&rsquo;s prison there is a good idea.  The debate is over as to whether the Government was right to buy such a large amount of land there.  Let us use it for rehabilitative purposes to ensure prisoners have as much land as they need.</P>

	<P>I shall be sharing time with my colleague, Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, with the agreement of the House.  I want to deal with work, training and education within prison.  As the Government spokesman in the Seanad on the issue of drugs, I want to emphasise that it is important we have drug-free prisons.  Up to now there have been major problems in establishments such as Mountjoy, so there is now a great opportunity to install suitable screening arrangements.  This will ensure visitors are properly screened for drugs, mobile phones and all manner of material that can cause great problems and undermine the running of a prison.</P>
        <P>I am glad that the Minister has no plans to locate young offenders at Thornton Hall.  There is only a contingency plan in that regard and he assures me that in the event, there will be no mixing between older and younger inmates.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s D&aacute;il comments to the effect that he is closing St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and a new Lusk offenders&rsquo; facility will be completed before the Thornton Hall development.  That is a very welcome initiative.</P>
        <P>On drug rehabilitation, we have an opportunity to establish a model detoxification unit.  The treatment and education of prisoners are very important and if we do not get them right, we will not have a proper rehabilitation system.  It is vital that we include rehabilitation services associated with treatment, drug supply reduction, prevention, research and detoxification when designing the new prison.  This will pay dividends because when the prisoners are released on their having served their time, they should have an education and a trade.  This should be facilitated.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his very informative speech, in which he outlined what he is doing and how open he is to consultation with the residents living beside the site of the proposed prison.  We will require their good will.  The prison will result in financial gain for the area in question.   The prison in Roscommon is an example of where this occurred.  I visited it and noted it is a model of how we should treat and educate prisoners.  Such a system will work well.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minster of State for outlining the current position so lucidly.  I welcome in particular the flexibility he has indicated will apply.  It is very important.</P>
        <P>Kilsallaghan is one of the very few parts of the greater Dublin with which I am familiar.  It is in a most beautiful rural setting and is well known to those who follow the horse races, including the Cathaoirleach.  It was for many years the home of the great Arkle when he was in training.</P><Col N="1151"/>
        <P>Having been involved in planning for 25 years with Kerry County Council, I realise that if the proposed massive development were to be lobbed into any part of counties Kerry, Cork of Clare, the hullabaloo that would ensue would be out of this world.  The rigours of the planning process in the counties with which I am familiar are such that such a development would not be allowed to proceed.  However, it is proceeding at the proposed site and we welcome it because it is important.</P>
        <P>I know many of the residents in the area in question and they have legitimate concerns.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated there will be over 1,000 inmates and I suppose there will be as many staff.  In effect, the prison will be the size of a small provincial town, all to be located in a tranquil area.  There is a fear of the unknown in that the development will not be like a factory or housing development.  No-one knows what will happen and there are occasionally bad stories and experiences associated with prisons.</P>
        <P>Any reasonable request the residents are making should be met by way of negotiation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State agrees with this.  It is proposed to erect a perimeter wall 7 m in height, which is fairly forbidding.  Most of houses in the region have an average height of 3 m or 4 m.  It is proposed to push back the perimeter by 10 m but 50 m would be far more realistic.  There is sufficient space to allow for this and it can be done if there is sufficient will.</P>
        <P>If people, especially the elderly and long-term residents, feel unhappy and stressed over the prison, perhaps the Minister of State should enter buy-out negotiations with them, if they so desire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I have had a long-standing interest in prison reform and have long been a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  I am very familiar with the inside of many of the State&rsquo;s prisons, happily not as a prisoner but as a defence lawyer and criminologist.  I spent time touring the inside of Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and other prisons.  I have been in the cells in Mountjoy Prison and the room in the D&oacute;chas Centre.  I have some familiarity with the system as a consequence.</P>
        <P>We must all welcome that there will be a significant improvement in conditions for male prisoners when they move from Mountjoy Prison to the new prison.  Nobody can stand over the appalling conditions male prisoners are currently subjected to in Mountjoy Prison, where they are still, in 2008, slopping out.  This involves urinating and defecating into buckets.  Allowing this is an appalling practice.  The Government should be very ashamed that, after 11 years in power, there is still no in-cell sanitation for the majority of prisoners in Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>I hope there will be enhanced rehabilitation facilities in the new prison.  It is welcome to hear the Minister of State speak in favour of greater rehabilitation facilities, but this does not ring true when one considers the quiet winding down of the CONNECT project, an innovative rehabilitation programme to which money had been allocated.  However, it is apparent that it has not been spent and the project is no longer up and running.  What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal in regard to the project?</P>
        <P>While it is to be hoped that conditions will improve when the new prison is built, it is regrettable that there will be an increase in both the size and capacity of the prison by comparison with Mountjoy Prison.  It is to be regretted that what should be an urban or city-centre prison is moving to a greenfield site.  We have debated this but I must reiterate my concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am particularly concerned about the capacity of the prison.  The Minister of State said there will be a total of 1,400 prisoners on the site but the motion refers to 2,200.  We therefore require clarification.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1152"/>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can clarify that now.  There are to be 1,400 prisoners but we are providing for additional capacity to accommodate up to 2,200, which would be achieved by dividing rooms in half.  We have over-provided regarding the size of individual cells.  It is only for an unforecasted increase in prisoner numbers that the additional capacity would be utilised.  It is not axiomatic that there will be 2,200 on the site in year one, year four or year six.  The specifications are such that 1,400 can be accommodated comfortably, but the number can potentially be increased to 2,200.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very much obliged to the Minister of State for clarifying that.  I believed that might be the case.  I am particularly concerned, therefore, that we are allowing for a potentially enormous increase in prisoner numbers to 2,200.  The unfortunate truism is that if prison places are built, they will be filled.  We should all be concerned about the direction this would take our penal policy.  It would be a question of simply warehousing prisoners in large numbers, as other Senators have stated.</P>
        <P>The location of the prison could lead to stigmatisation, particularly of children of prisoners, who are to be taken to Thornton Hall on a special prison bus.  This is of real concern and we must consider other ways of ensuring access links for people travelling from the inner city.  The reality is that many visitors will be travelling from there.</P>
        <P>I was fortunate enough to see plans for the redevelopment of Mountjoy Prison, which were at a very advanced stage under Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  They were so advanced that there was even a scale model provided of what the redeveloped prison would look like.  It was along the lines of the D&oacute;chas Centre.  I understand these plans were abandoned and that a greenfield site was proposed.  What was the rationale behind the abandonment of those plans?</P>
        <P>That debate is over and it now appears that the prison at Thornton Hall is to be built, although some have raised concerns about whether the public private partnership will go ahead.  If it is to go ahead, I would like to see two aspects in particular changed.  The proposal that the Central Mental Hospital be located at the site should be abandoned.  It is not in the body of the motion before the House but the &ldquo;Patients not Prisoners&rdquo; report, launched earlier this week, raised very serious concerns over moving psychiatric patients to a penal site designed for a prison.  This is of real concern.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of my second concern, I have been working with a colleague from the other House who is not unknown to the Minister of State, namely, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  She and I hosted a meeting last week with Baroness Jean Corston from the House of Lords, who has produced a comprehensive and thought-provoking report, &ldquo;The Corston Report&rdquo;, on female prisoners in the United Kingdom, the recommendations of which have largely been taken up by the British Government.</P>
        <P>The Corston report recommends that prison is not appropriate for the majority of women offenders and I expect the report would have the same application in Ireland.  Research here has shown the majority of our female offenders are non-violent.  They are committed for minor offences and for short terms of imprisonment.  At present, approximately 100 women are in prison in Ireland on any given day.  The Thornton Hall development effectively proposes to double this with its provision of 170 places and apparently a further 40 places are to be provided in Cork Prison.  This is a most regressive step, which will ensure not the rehabilitation, but the warehousing of women.  Such women are among the most vulnerable of our prison population and include those who have severe mental health problems and many who have addiction problems.  I again stress the majority of them pose no risk to society because they are non-violent.</P><Col N="1153"/>
        <P>Research has shown that at present, women in our prisons have an average of two to three children each.  Although as I noted earlier, 100 are in prison on any given day, the numbers for committal in any year are striking.  A total of 960 women were committed to prison in 2006.  This represents 2,000 to 3,000 children who were left motherless in 2006.  Even if this was for a brief time, Baroness Corston has observed it can lead to the women losing their homes and the placing of their children into care.  There is an enormous cost to those children, their mothers and to society when one considers the cost of the alternative care, the emotional and social cost and so forth.</P>
        <P>As I noted, prison places that are built are filled.  If 170 places for women are built on this proposed site, they will be filled and increasing numbers of women will go to prison for minor offences that should require punishment in the community.  Instead, we should see a development of community service orders.  Ireland should go down the road British penal policy is taking on foot of the Corston report and should consider alternatives for this vulnerable group of offenders.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that although plans for Thornton Hall are advanced and the prison development is proceeding, there still is room for manoeuvre regarding the groups that are to be moved there, as well as the site&rsquo;s composition.  The Government should give serious consideration to not moving the D&oacute;chas centre there.  The D&oacute;chas centre is less than ten years old.  It was built on rehabilitative lines and provides all the prison places required.  These women are damaged and not damaging and do not deserve to be expanded in number.  I apologise to the Cathaoirleach for exceeding my allotted time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is possible for schools to register themselves as charities to benefit from tax concessions.  The Minister responsible should address two issues in this regard.  A two-year gap exists between registration as a charity and fully benefiting from the effects of the tax concessions pertaining to charitable status.  The Minister should consider shortening that period to three months in order that schools can benefit almost immediately from being a registered charity when funding activities within the school.</P>
        <P>The Minister also should outline in his reply how schools can apply for charitable status, as well as any reasons he may not wish to shorten the aforementioned period from two years to three months.  While this issue is completely separate to other forms of State funding of schools, concerns have been raised because summer works and devolved grants schemes, as well as other funding streams that were expected by a number of schools effectively have stopped.  At present, all schools are being asked to apply through the emergency building fund if they require funding for refurbishment.  However, the issue I raise simply pertains to schools registering themselves as charities in order that they can benefit from tax concessions.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister responsible to address this issue as a matter of urgency and to respond to me as soon as possible.  This issue may require consideration by both the Ministers for Education and Science and Finance, as the latter is responsible for such legislation.

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him, compliment him and wish him well in respect the new challenges he faces.  I am sure he will distinguish himself in the same fashion as when discharging his previous responsibilities.  I also welcome this motion.  During the debate on the Prisons Act 2007, Members on all sides of the House welcomed its provisions.  Before the passing of the Act, the Minister effectively was the deciding authority regarding the location of a prison.  New requirements arise from that Act whereby an environmental impact statement must be undertaken to EU standards and a rapporteur&rsquo;s report must be prepared in that regard following a consultation process.  Moreover, both must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and must be decided by way of draft resolution from the Minister.  This is an important development and constitutes significant progress in the manner in which such issues are dealt with.</P>
        <P>A prison is a major item of infrastructure that has an impact on society in general and on the neighbourhood in which it is located in particular.  It is right and appropriate to have safeguards, precautions and checks and balances within that system, which take all views and everyone&rsquo;s interests into consideration.  The Minister is obliged under that Act to have due regard to both the environmental impact assessment and the rapporteur&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting this development will lead to the closure of Mountjoy Prison.  As many Members have noted, in itself this is a development that is to be greatly welcomed.  Mountjoy Prison has a capacity for 934 prisoners in the male section in four different institutions.  It is interesting that earlier this month, 992 prisoners were held there as the prison often is stretched <Col N="1158"/>to its capacity and beyond.  Senator Bacik and others have alluded to the practice of slopping out that takes place there.  This is a throwback to Victorian times and prisons, and it should not be part of a custodial regime in the 21st century.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, I happened to visit the prison some years ago.  The experience of those who were on the deputation to the prison was one of being <i>ad idem</i> on the need for new facilities to be put in place and for a move away from the type of arrangements that were in place there.  Matters such as the number of prisoners to a cell were completely unacceptable.  There has been at least one, if not more, high profile case in which someone has been murdered in a cell with the involvement of a number of prisoners.  There have been instances of rape and assault, which possibly have been under-reported.  When the State takes people into custody, there is an onus on it to ensure their safety and to provide reasonable basic accommodation for them.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It also must be stated that the present regime and the building do not lend themselves to modern approaches to prisoner custodial arrangements.  The increase in capacity to 1,400 prisoners, with particular emphasis on single cell occupancy, is a desirable step forward.  Moreover, the provision of eight different blocks, ranging up to houses and apartments, is a development all Members should support.  There is a need within the prison system to categorise prisoners.  Some are highly dangerous serious gangsters and murderers.  A regime should be in place that is appropriate to the risks that such prisoners offer to other prisoners, staff and society at large.  Others however, probably are more amenable to a less harsh regime and the structure of a modern prison will allow such a regime to be invoked and put in place.  It also will allow for emphasis on work training in order that people will have the opportunity on leaving the prison system to get respectable employment.  This should be its objective.  It will enable them to move away from the life of crime on which they may have embarked.  It will also provide them with educational facilities and rehabilitative programmes.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The Minister of State, in answer to Senator Bacik, alluded to the fact that the environmental impact statement was constructed on the basis of a maximum possible prisoner population of 2,200.  We hope that this figure is not reached but if it is at least the facilities will be there to deal with it.</P>
        <P>I do not concur with those who argue that other aspects of the Prison Service, such as D&oacute;chas, should be left where they are.  This should be decided on the basis of economics, the use of facilities and the effective administration of the prison system, which should rank high in the criteria.  These elements should be combined in one location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution for young offenders will close as youths will be relocated to other prisons such as Wheatfield and one in Lusk.  This is a welcome development as I was concerned, as were others, that having young people in a complex with hardened prisoners could only lead to a situation in which they were more likely to embark on a more serious level of crime.  The segregation of hardened criminals from those involved in less serious crime is an important part of our approach to this issue.</P>
        <P>The environmental impact assessment deals with many issues and I concur with what has been said on tree-screening, walls, neighbourliness and ensuring the implementation of the mission statement and plan in ways that allow ongoing consultation with people in the area.  The report recognises that this matter does not have a great impact nationally or regionally but it is significant for people living adjacent to the complex.  We should work to mitigate adverse effects in this regard and all reasonable requests made by those living nearby should be complied with.  I would like to think we are doing this, particularly regarding changing roads, planting and so on.  This is a move in the right direction.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and, given my experience of him in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs where he showed himself to clear-sighted, forthright and open to argument, I am glad he is in charge of these proposals.  He is prepared to take risks from time to time.</P>
        <P>I endorse what has been said by my colleagues, particularly Senator Ivana Bacik, about the location and development of this site.  Of course one welcomes the end to slopping out, an appalling and barbarous procedure that was against the interests of inmates.  I agree with her that we must look carefully at the issue of women prisoners.</P>
        <P>I will put down an amendment to the Broadcasting Bill to ensure that people who fail to pay the television licence fee will not be subject to prison terms.  There was recently a case of a young single mother in Cork who was jailed for non-payment of the television licence fee and her son was traumatised as a result.  This is completely inappropriate.  The more prisons we build, the more likely we are to fill them.  Prison is an inappropriate treatment for many prisoners, not just women but men also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The topic I wish to raise, the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital to the Thornton Hall site, is related to this subject and I propose to deal with it because it is indicated that a site has been reserved on the map.  A very important report on the Central Mental Hospital round table meeting, Patients not Prisoners, was published on Tuesday this week.  The Central Mental Hospital&rsquo;s carers group, the Irish Mental Health Coalition, Schizophrenia Ireland and a number of other groups were involved.  It is important that we examine this aspect of the development of the Thornton Hall site because, at this stage, no clear decision that cannot be reversed has been taken.  The decision can be reversed and the Minister of State is the right person to<?oasys _jy ?>do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From a political point of view the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall conflicts with the Government&rsquo;s excellent statements in its policy document, A Vision for Change.  There it is stated that the Central Mental Hospital should be replaced or remodelled to allow the provision of care and treatment in a modern, up to date and humane setting.  This flows from inspections carried out by the Council of Europe committee for the prevention of cruel and inhuman treatment and torture.  The committee visited Dundrum in 1998, 2002 and 2006 and on foot of its report a decision was made that the facilities there were inadequate.</P>
        <P>It is many years since I visited a patient in Dundrum and on that occasion the conditions were appalling.  I am glad that they have altered and that there is now a full-fledged therapeutic environment, although nobody doubts that the facilities must be updated.  However, the relocation to Thornton Hall will be damaging because there is a possibility of contamination and stigmatisation by osmosis.  I do not wish to further stigmatise the prisoners but it is clear that patients in the Central Mental Hospital are not prisoners; they are patients and have been deemed as such.</P>
        <P>In the existing situation, while the buildings are inappropriate, the location is as good as one can get.  There is access on foot from the city centre and the surrounding suburbs and also by rail, bus, taxi and Luas.  The current location has the works in this regard.  In these circumstances we must consider not only patients but also families and visitors.  The Dundrum facility has existed for 150 years and the local community has absorbed it so there will be no great impact by retaining and redeveloping it.  However, there could be an impact resulting from the Thornton Hall location as one does not know what the attitude of the surrounding community might be.</P>
        <P>If the hospital is redeveloped on the Thornton Hall site the patients will face increased isolation.  Low security patients in Dundrum are already permitted to take part in various courses, including college and university courses, and they have access to rehabilitative facilities in the city.  This is important.  A distinguished Australian expert in this area concluded that <Col N="1160"/>the therapeutic culture enshrined in Dundrum could be seriously undermined by a move to Thornton Hall.</P>
        <P>There is a strong economic argument for opposing the move.  Mr. Jim Power, a significant economic commentator, indicated that the proposed relocation is a worst case scenario that looked as though it had been planned on the back of an envelope.  He said there is a better economic case for redeveloping the facility in Dundrum.  There is a 34 acre site there of which 14 acres could be sold to generate around &euro;140 million.  This would more than pay for the development of the hospital, leaving 20 acres for the hospital to be redeveloped; effectively a greenfield site.</P>
        <P>One of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues on the radio yesterday said we could not carry out both projects together.  Why not?  The Minister for Health and Children, who is not unknown to the Minister of State, is a passionate advocate of co-location.  It is not beyond the wit of man or woman to build while maintaining existing facilities &mdash; there would, after all, be a 20 acre site.  It would be possible to co-locate a building site and hospital and it would be positive.  Such a project would be revenue neutral and a small profit might even be made.  There would continue to be a land bank there.</P>
        <P>The Irish Human Rights Commission, which was appointed by the Government, said it is gravely concerned at what it calls a &ldquo;highly inappropriate proposal&rdquo;.  The Government must listen to organisations of this calibre that makes such statements.  There is nothing from the Government to support the case for the decision.  It has yet to produce a legally required cost-benefit analysis of the options.</P>
        <P>There is a series of reasons the hospital should not be moved.  It is against the Government&rsquo;s policy.  There has been no consultation whatever so far with the users and their families.  I met families of patients in Dundrum before Christmas, just last week and within recent days, and they are passionate about the issue.  I am using this opportunity to respectfully ask the Government to reconsider the decision in the light of its own policies and from the point of view of convenience for public transport, access to local facilities and the general location.  A community has been built up around the hospital.  Staff live locally and patients feel safe going to local shops.</P>
        <P>I will end by quoting one of the people who briefed me on this.  She asked her son what he thought of the Central Mental Hospital going to Thornton Hall and his reply was that people would think the patients were prisoners, not people with mental illness, and that he would be too afraid to go outside as the proposed site is in the middle of nowhere.  The Minister of State is the appropriate person to start the process of re-examining this question before facts emerge from the situation on the ground.</P>

	<P>It is clearly stated here that Senator Diarmuid Wilson is first, but if there is agreement we will take Senator Keaveney first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is obtaining some information on Senator Wilson&rsquo;s matter.  It would be helpful if we could take them in that order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing my topic for discussion on the Adjournment.  This is an ongoing issue.  There is a small school in Monreagh, Carrigans, County Donegal, which was one of our first integrated schools, although the predominant ethos is Church of Ireland.  The school was built in 1853 and there are 17 students, with 23 planned to enrol in September.  There has been quite a lot of development in the general locality of the school and we are trying to encourage the community of those who have moved from Derry to this lovely rural area of Donegal to take up the opportunity of using the school.</P>
        <P>It was decided in 2001 that a new school was needed.  It is difficult to encourage not only the existing population but also new arrivals to use a school that has structural and physical problems such as this school has.  The front of the school faces onto a very narrow road which is used by lorries carrying material from a quarry.  These lorries deposit large stones in the area, as we discovered on Monday night when we attended a meeting at the school and saw for ourselves the stones that are bouncing off the lorries.  The back of the school is shared with a working farmyard.  Due to natural run-off of fertiliser and other such issues, it is not a particularly healthy environment for the school.</P>
        <P>The biggest difficulty is that we are trying to sell the message that the school is to be relocated.  Three sites so far have failed for one reason or another to materialise.  There is a fourth site and the difficulty is not with the Department of Education and Science so much as with the Office of Public Works.  The specific question we need answered is why there seems to be a problem with the complete title on the land.  The owner bought the land 27 years ago and, he understands, has full title.  Despite this, when he tried selling it on to the OPW, it stated there was an issue with the title of which nobody else seemed to be aware.  At this time we are totally in the hands of anyone who can give us information on how we can make progress on this site.  As I said, this is the fourth site that has been suggested for the school.  It is now seven years since a new school was sanctioned.  The current site is unsuitable and dangerous with health and safety issues both outside and inside the school.  The school should be moving quickly through the system on the basis of the case presented in 2001 and also the very good presentation made by Angela McGee on Monday night, a copy of which I can give to anybody in the Department to prove the case.</P>
        <P>The fundamental point is that we cannot move on to questions of whether we should be in band 1 or band 2 or how quickly we should be moving through the system because we do not yet have a site.  I ask the Minister of State to elicit the information, if he has not already obtained it, on why there is a problem, whether it may be overcome and how we may do so.  If someone else buys the site and then sells it to the OPW, will it accept that title?  I know this is becoming personal because no matter how one deals with it, someone owns the site which the OPW is talking about buying, but I cannot overcome this issue.  It is the sticking point.</P>
        <P>We talk about maintaining communities in rural Ireland.  This is a very strong rural area.  The decision was taken in 1996 that the school would not be amalgamated with another school, but the Minister of State can understand the difficulty, as the years go by, of selling the message that a new school will be built.  There are many new houses in the area whose families will <Col N="1162"/>sustain the school.  Sustaining a school means sustaining a rural community.  The people in this area do not have a religious bias.  They are so close to the Border that in some places it would defy one to find the other side.</P>

	<P>We are desperate in our desire to find a solution to this issue.  I do not doubt that I will revert to the Minister of State directly with all of the evidence on how the process must be progressed quickly.  I hope he has an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators Keaveney and Wilson for their co-operation in the order of the Adjournment matters.  I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter, as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position in respect of the specific difficulties and solutions for acquiring a site for Monreagh national school, Carrigans, County Donegal.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our building stock as well as the necessity to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth comprise a significant challenge which the Minister for Education and Science intends to be one of his priorities.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost &euro;600 million this year.</P>
        <P>Almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools in the lifetime of the national development plan, an unprecedented level of capital investment that reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continuing its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works, OPW, which acts generally on behalf of my Department in the acquisition of sites for schools, was requested to source a suitable site in June 2001.  The OPW advised my Department that, on foot of advertising, it had identified a number of sites.  They were inspected by its regional architect and four were selected for further consideration.  One of them was identified as the preferred option and, in November 2004, my Department instructed the OPW to open negotiations.  The acquisition of this site was almost complete when, in September 2006, the OPW advised my Department that the vendor could not offer good marketable title to the property.  Consequently, my Department instructed the OPW to readvertise.  I do not have the exact details of why good marketable title was not on offer, but I can have more information provided to the Senator.  The OPW has recently advised that there is a potential alternative proposal, which is currently under consideration by my Department in the context of its multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project, which indicates the urgency, type and extent of work required at a school.  The band rating system involves all applications for capital funding being assessed in the planning and building unit of my Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, <Col N="1163"/>site capacity, etc., leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in respect of the specific difficulties and solutions for acquiring a site for Monreagh national school, Carrigans, County Donegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his report and offer him the safety report on Monreagh national school, which he might pass on to the relevant people.  The school cannot encourage people to attend it given its history of being unable to acquire a site.  Similarly, Ray national school had only nine students when it battled to get a new school.  It now has approximately 92 students.  Student numbers in Monreagh national school will reflect need, but the site difficulties have rocked people&rsquo;s confidence as to whether the project will go ahead.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, who wished to participate in this debate.  He must attend another appointment, but he wishes to be associated with this Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Laragh national school, Stradone, County Cavan was built in 1963.  Originally designed as a three-teacher school, it now has 130 pupils, five mainstream teachers, one part-time resource teacher, one learning support teacher, three special needs assistants and one school secretary, a total of 11 staff.  Three prefabricated buildings were added to the structure in 1972 when Caulfield national school and Carrickallen national school amalgamated with Laragh national school.  A further prefabricated building was provided in September 2001.  There are only two permanent classrooms, the rest of the accommodation being prefabricated.  The condition of the prefabricated accommodation is deplorable despite the best efforts of boards of management over the years.  Asbestos panels were removed from the prefabricated buildings approximately six years ago and replaced with plywood, which has since rotted.  There is no hot water in the school.  The electricity and sewerage systems are not up to safety standards and are in breach of the Health and Safety Act.  The Department has been advised of this situation by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith.</P>
        <P>The parish purchased a large field beside the school to provide options for the necessary development and to try to improve playground facilities, but it was unable to do any work without the Department of Education and Science being on board.  The school has an excellent teaching staff, but morale is low.  Councillors Michael McCarey and Gerry Murray and Mr. Pat Smith of the school&rsquo;s board of management have been lobbying the Minister and I continuously in respect of this worthy project.</P>
        <P>Two options are available to the Department, namely, a total refurbishment of the existing school plus the construction of a permanent extension or a new school on a greenfield site.  I urge the Minister of State to progress one of these options as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Wilson for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position regarding the provision of improved facilities for Laragh national school, Stradone, County Cavan. </P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, almost &euro;600 million in public funding is being provided for school buildings this year, enabling the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary school projects, which will deliver 7,000 additional permanent school places in new schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools, and construction work on 150 devolved projects under the permanent accommodation scheme, which will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools.  In the post-primary sector, construction work will be completed on 19 large-scale projects, which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in four new <Col N="1164"/>schools, and additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools, which will benefit more than 7,000 pupils.</P>
        <P>This funding will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, particularly in rapidly developing areas, and will facilitate the progression of new projects through architectural planning and design stages.  On 1 February last, the previous Minister announced the first tranche of projects that will proceed to construction this year.  Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of public private partnership schools, while further projects will be offered to the market next year with a view to building work commencing in later years.</P>
        <P>Laragh national school is a co-educational facility with a current enrolment of 127 pupils.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, four mainstream assistants and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.  The school authority submitted an application to my Department for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.  The long-term staffing figure, on which accommodation needs will be based, has been determined.  In this regard, it has been agreed that accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of a principal, five mainstream assistants and appropriate ancillary accommodation.  The proposed extension and refurbishment of Laragh national school has been assigned a band rating of 2.1.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under my Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to provide an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project.  However, I assure the Senator that the Minister is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Laragh national school at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, to exert maximum influence to ensure the final round of the Zimbabwean presidential elections is free and fair.  This is not the first time I have raised the situation in Zimbabwe in the House.  That country is at a critical juncture.  The unsatisfactory presidential and parliamentary elections which already took place have resulted in what will supposedly be a run-off between the current President, Mr. Robert Mugabe, and his main opponent, Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai, who has returned to Zimbabwe having fled it some time ago.</P>
        <P>Given our anti-imperialist past, our neutrality and the fact that we have some history in common with Zimbabwe, Ireland has a particularly strong and influential voice on such matters.  It would be extraordinarily helpful if the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as taking a stand along with other EU Ministers to ensure the upcoming elections are fair and free, were also to take unilateral action in this regard.  Ireland&rsquo;s voice on such issues is powerful and useful.</P>
        <P>As a first step, the international community should ensure, having seen what happened in the first round, that independent observers are sent to observe this fresh round of presidential elections.  One does not have to be a private investigator or a member of the special branch to recognise that the activities surrounding the first round of elections were unsatisfactory.  There was clearly mass intimidation and there may also have been fraud.  It took an extraordinary length of time for the election results to be released, which is completely unacceptable and unprecedented in any democratic country.  The suspicion cannot be dismissed that the figures that were finally released were not authentic, even though Mr. Mugabe was defeated by some 48% to 43%.  It seems this was simply a ploy to ensure Mr. Tsvangirai came in at below 50%, thus ensuring a run-off.</P><Col N="1165"/>
        <P>The concern is that, having ensured a run-off in this way, the current regime will engineer a victory for the incumbent by hook or by crook.  That may not necessarily happen but there is absolutely no ground for optimism that it will be otherwise.  We must consider whether the result of this election is inevitable, namely, that the President, Mr. Mugabe, will be re-elected one way or the other.  Serious violations of human rights are already taking place in Zimbabwe, with members of opposition political parties and opposition movements being murdered and starved.  All types of violations are being perpetrated in an effort, presumably, to ensure the opposition is intimidated and prevented from participating in the poll on 27 June.</P>
        <P>It may be somewhat unfair to say that Ireland is doing virtually nothing about this but our voice is certainly not a loud one in a situation where human rights are at stake.  I do not have time to spell out the situation in Zimbabwe.  To say that the rule of law has broken down is an understatement.  Health services are in an appalling state, AIDS is rampant and the life expectancy is a mere 44 years for men and 43 years for women.  The economy is disordered and disorganised and food riots have already taken place.  Inflation is running at an incredible 1,000,000% per annum.  Displacement of the population is ongoing, with many people leaving the country.  It is almost impossible to hold free and fair elections in the jurisdiction.  It is unlikely, for example, that the opposition has been able or will be able to hold any democratic rallies.  Mr. Tsvangirai was frightened to come back to the country but eventually did so at what may well be a high personal cost.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister either to take unilateral action to raise Ireland&rsquo;s voice in calling for elections that are as fair and free as possible or to ensure maximum pressure is applied to the one individual credited with having influence on this situation, the South African President, Mr. Thabo Mbeki.  The Government must take robust diplomatic action to convey our disappointment that Mr. Mbeki&rsquo;s protests against the activities of the regime in Zimbabwe, if any such protests have taken place, have been extraordinarily ineffective.  Mr. Mbeki has clout in Zimbabwe.  There is a good deal of trade between the two countries, they share a common border and Zimbabwe relies on South Africa for a significant portion of what is left of its economy.</P>
        <P>I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to give a response which will offer some comfort to the people of Zimbabwe that they have friends in Ireland, that we identify with them, that we deplore the fact that these elections seem unlikely to be conducted in a democratic fashion and that we will do everything we can to set that right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on this matter on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who cannot be present today.  The ongoing tragic situation in Zimbabwe has struck a chord here in Ireland, as was made clear in the all-party consensus on the issue in the D&aacute;il on 15 May.  Ireland and the EU continue to urge the Government of Zimbabwe to put in place the necessary conditions for free and fair elections before the run-off vote on 27 June.  A credible election process demands basic minimum standards, including an end to the current conditions of pervasive intimidation and violence by state authorities.  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Zimbabwe at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting in Brussels last Monday.  In that debate, Ireland urged that strong political pressure on the Mugabe regime be maintained until the crisis is resolved.  The EU has again publicly called on the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure a level playing field and a secure environment so that the results of the second round will reflect the free and democratic will of the Zimbabwean people.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to support Zimbabweans in a practical way at this time.  Total Irish Aid funding for the people of Zimbabwe, including humanitarian support and health care provision, came to more than &euro;17 million in the past two years.  The Government is planning to continue this support, through UN agencies and international and local non-governmental organisations, in 2008.  Ireland fully supports the existing EU measures targeted against those responsible for <Col N="1166"/>bringing Zimbabwe to its current sorry state, and would be open to considering any further measures which could be effective.  However, the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy and the indifference of the Mugabe regime to international condemnation have greatly reduced the effectiveness of international pressure on the Zimbabwean authorities.  In the circumstances, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours, who have the greatest influence, bear the greatest responsibility to act &mdash; perhaps South Africa most of all, as Senator Ross said.</P>
        <P>We believe that African countries can and should show leadership with regard to Zimbabwe.  I believe there is a strong sense of shock and outrage in southern Africa at what has happened in Zimbabwe in the past two months.  On Monday, EU foreign ministers called upon the Southern African Development Community, SADC, to continue to engage with strong determination with the Zimbabwean authorities.  Irish and EU ambassadors have been in contact with our partner countries in southern Africa to convey our concerns about Zimbabwe and our support for decisive action to resolve the crisis.  Ireland welcomed the emphasis put by the SADC leaders<b> </b>on strict compliance with the rule of law and the SADC&rsquo;s own principles for the conduct of democratic elections.  We recognise that the political culture of the region is such that much work is done behind closed doors.  Whatever methods are used, our focus must be on the results achieved on the ground.</P>
        <P>We support the work which the SADC and the African Union have done in monitoring the first round, and urge them to continue and increase their presence both on 27 June and in the weeks leading up to polling day.  Ireland would support additional credible international monitoring of the election process, if this is possible.  However, from a practical perspective, unless international monitors are granted visas and given access to polling stations and count centres, they simply will not be able to observe the process.  If it becomes possible to send an EU observation mission to Zimbabwe, Ireland would support that.</P>
        <P>The Irish ambassador to Zimbabwe was in Harare for the election period and will travel there again as necessary to continue to monitor the election process until it is finalised.  We applaud the courage the Zimbabwean people have shown in exercising their right to vote on 29 March, despite the conditions in which the election was held.  The Government strongly condemns the attempts which have been made to alter the election outcome by fraud, violence and intimidation.  The Government remains committed to doing all it can to support a peaceful and democratic outcome in Zimbabwe.  We stand ready to respond appropriately to any opportunity to work with a democratically elected government of Zimbabwe, a government which is committed to the type of reform that will secure the long-term well-being of its people.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State convey a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  I recognise that sometimes matters are dealt with behind closed doors, but if nothing of that nature has yet occurred, why does the Government not make direct approaches to President Mugabe rather than go through either the EU or President Mbeki?  Why does the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach not make a direct approach to President Mugabe to tell him, in unequivocal terms, that we do not approve of his activities or the circumstances in which he is holding elections?</P>
