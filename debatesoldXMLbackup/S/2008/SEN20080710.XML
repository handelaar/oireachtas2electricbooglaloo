	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to clarify the reason that Buncrana Harbour works have not commenced despite money being made available for this at least twice and given the serious safety issues involved for the RNLI.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the measures to be taken to ensure that teachers who were awarded a postgraduate diploma in learning support or special education needs prior to summer 2006 will henceforth receive the same allowance as that received by teachers who were awarded a postgraduate diploma in learning support or special education needs after summer 2006.</P>
        <P LI="1">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the situation in Letterkenny General Hospital, whereby due to budget constraints the hospital will be closing one of its 20 bed wards and to indicate if she believes that this will adversely affect patient care.</P>
        <P LI="1">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline her strategy to provide social worker cover in Cork city at weekend hours.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Keaveney, Mullen and Doherty and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senator Buttimer may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, Statements on the fishing industry, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, but not earlier <Col N="922"/>than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes.  Senators may share time.  The Minister shall be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for his concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael opposes the Order of Business on the grounds that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is being rushed through the Oireachtas, which does not make for good legislation.  I propose an amendment that Committee and Report Stages not be taken together today.  We should adhere to the principle of having time in between the different Stages of legislation to allow for adequate examination, consultation with interested parties and to ensure the best possible legislation is put through the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I object strongly to Committee and Report Stages being taken together today.  The programme for Government has a section on Oireachtas reform, but where is the reform if we take these Stages together today?  The Green Party said Oireachtas reform was a key principle for the party.  Where is the reform when we handle legislation the way we are handling this Bill?  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the situation at Dublin Airport today.  The travelling public must be kept informed as attempts to rectify the situation take place.  The big issue is the provision of information.  As much information as possible must be provided.  The inconveniences being suffered at Dublin Airport are unacceptable.  I hope the Minister will raise the issue with the Irish Aviation Authority.  It is not the first time this has happened.  Apparently, it has been happening for weeks.  My main concern is that information be made available to the public.  People entering or leaving the country are suffering appalling inconvenience.  I hope the Minister will take whatever action he can to ensure, at the least, that information is provided until the problem is resolved, which I hope will be as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I return to economic matters because I am still very concerned about the vagueness and lack of detail in the Government&rsquo;s economic policy.  I never saw a more unconvincing and lacklustre performance than yesterday&rsquo;s announcements of Ministers&rsquo; plans to address the current economic challenges.  They spoke about the possibility of amalgamating agencies.  What agencies will be amalgamated; when will it happen and where is the plan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the situation is out of control and the vagueness of their response was embarrassing to watch.  Reforms of spending and project evaluation should have been introduced in previous months and years.  The manner in which Ministers outlined their extraordinary list of cuts was unacceptable.  The implication given at the public press conference was that spending on education and health would not be reduced, yet now we find that one third of the cutbacks will come from health.  Some &euro;85 million will be cut from supports to elderly people trying to meet the cost of nursing home care, &euro;38 million will be saved through the slower roll-out of health projects and &euro;21 million will come from what is described as other savings.  Similar cuts will be imposed on education.  The worrying reality is that cutbacks will hit front line services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This morning&rsquo;s edition of<i> The Irish Times</i> carried an article titled &ldquo;Tanker-like ship of public finances heading for the rocks&rdquo;, which reports: &ldquo;This six percentage point deterioration amounts to the most rapid two-year decline of any euro area country at any time since the single currency was launched.&rdquo;  That is the reality of our public finances because of mismanagement by <Col N="923"/>the Taoiseach while he was Minister for Finance.  The article also stated: &ldquo;The surge in spending before the last election explains a large part of how an unusually big surplus in 2006 had all but evaporated in just 12 months.&rdquo;  I hope the public sees clearly the mismanagement that has been at the core of Government financial policy and public spending over the period of its term in office.  The fruits of the Celtic tiger should have been invested in health and education and the growth in the economy should have been managed so that we could have proper public services.  Instead, we are seeing cutbacks in vital front line services.  That is unacceptable and extremely disappointing for the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s objection to the Order of Business for the same reason that we gave yesterday, namely, it makes a mockery of this House.  The entire concept of legislating by means of Second Stage debate followed by Committee Stage and, after due reflection, Report Stage is being ignored.  If we speak about Seanad reform while ignoring the basic principles on which legislation has been developed over many years, we must object to the system proposed today.  If we make an amendment on Committee or Report Stage, it will not be heard by the other House.  We have to reconsider this.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the House to the in case of emergency, ICE, concept, of which I was made aware yesterday by the ambulance services.  The vast majority of people carry mobile telephones but, if someone has an accident, the responder often does not know which number to dial.  Everybody carrying a mobile telephone should have an ICE listing for the person who should be contacted in an emergency.  The thought behind the concept came from a paramedic who came across a person injured in an accident but did not know which number on the person&rsquo;s mobile telephone to dial.  There is no cost or business model behind the concept but I would love to think we could promote it.</P>
        <P>Given that we are approaching the end of term, I want to give Senators the homework of reading the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, which is fascinating.  It found that public servants lack knowledge of disability issues.  A number of cases arose where those who were disabled were not given public access or the attention they deserved.  Many State bodies have not realised the onus of responsibility that falls on them.  Individuals, and particularly those who are disabled, should not have to contact the Ombudsman to have their problems solved.</P>
        <P>Another report published recently is The Business of Ability, which recognises that people who are disabled also have abilities.  The organisation which recently changed its name from the Aisling Foundation to the Kanchi Foundation plans to encourage businesses and State bodies to recognise the talent and ability of people who might otherwise be regarded as disabled.  We, as a nation, should give more attention to that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senators Fitzgerald and Quinn on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and I will support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  Yesterday, I asked the Leader to stand up for the integrity of the House in respect of the manner in which this Bill is being forced through but he either decided not to defend us or he failed in his attempt.  I ask him not to respond by saying, as he did in the past, that we can sit late tonight, tomorrow or next week because that does not address the problem.  Senators need a judicious gap between different Stages of the Bill so that the issues can be carefully scrutinised and considered.  It would be somewhat disingenuous of the Leader to propose a late sitting tonight because that will not address the issue raised by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>I also concur with the Senator in regard to her remarks about the extraordinary spectacle of the Government&rsquo;s response to the current economic difficulties and its proposals for cuts in spending.  Quite simply, it was all over the shop.  We were told that the 3% cut on pay would not affect health and education but the Minister for Education and Science subsequently <Col N="924"/>appeared on television to say he would impose cuts in education.  Did he do that off his own bat?  We were told that health would not be affected but now we know it is the sector which will receive the biggest cuts.  It makes a mockery of the Houses and the wider community to say the polar opposite of what was said hours earlier.  The Government is clearly all over the shop and does not know what it is doing.  It would seem Ministers are waiting for hourly briefings by Department of Finance officials before informing the rest of us.  I would have thought they should be in the driving seat on these matters.</P>
        <P>In respect of tax, I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to yesterday&rsquo;s interesting and helpful submission by the ICTU on tax reform.  I am aware that a Commission on Taxation has been established, but can the Leader confirm whether it will be possible for this House to address the issue in the autumn?  We have heard the mantra of low taxation and that we have a low tax economy, even though only our income taxes are low.  We seem to debate a range of issues, such as health, education and child care, almost in the abstract and without considering whether our tax base is robust enough to fund the public services we need.</P>
        <P>We will adjourn for the summer today unless the Leader advises differently.  Throughout the year, he has informed, educated and, from time to time, entertained us.  I ask him to confirm that he will not take us down the road of our Romanian counterparts who recently passed a Bill, which thankfully has been shot down by the courts, requiring or instructing the radio and television stations to give equal air time to good and bad news stories.  Apparently, this was motivated by a desire to improve the mental and emotional condition of the nation.  I ask the Leader to confirm that he does not intend to bring forth such a proposal.  I do not believe he will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no good news articles at the moment anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is going to bring out a CD.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I believe the Leader will not do so is that the situation obtaining in Romania is completely different.  There is a suspicion there, unlike in this country, that the Bill was intended to reduce the number of unflattering stories about politicians who are notorious for corruption and incompetence and whose exploits often dominate national news broadcasts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Leader did not respond positively to the requests made during the past three days by Senator Fitzgerald and others in regard to the time allowed to debate the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  The position is that no extra time will be allowed for adequate discussion on amendments.  This is the situation with which we are faced in this House.  In commenting on the Bill, we will not obtain a positive response on any quarter or amendment no matter how meritorious, which is disappointing.  I believe the Leader is failing to stand up for this House and its procedures.</P>
        <P>Following on from Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s remarks on the economy, earlier in the week we received an indication of the Government&rsquo;s proposals and yesterday sought clarification in this regard.  Essentially, everything in the proposals is aspirational.  The proposals provide for efficiency reviews, projects to be examined and prioritised and joint public procurement operation targeted schemes to reduce surplus staff.  The only specific proposal which provides for a cutback is in respect of the &euro;45 million in overseas development aid.  We seem to be able to pick on the poorest abroad without a second thought.  The other proposals are all fudge, confusion and contradictions.</P><Col N="925"/>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to a report in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The article referred to is by Dan O&rsquo;Brien, economist of the Economist Intelligence Unit, presumably an independent source in regard to the economy.  A particular line in that article states, &ldquo;... it will be obvious that its cause was not global economic conditions or some other misfortune, but mismanagement of spending, revenues and the wider budgeting process&rdquo;, something we have been saying for some time.  This statement comes from an independent source.  It is important the truth of that statement is identified and accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to comment on that specific statement.  We have moved in the past year from discussions about corruption in politics to discussions on incompetence in politics.  There is a serious economic cost to incompetence in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that this be considered as we conclude our year of discussions in this House.  The proper subject matter of debate is competence in Government.  One Taoiseach has been already forced out of office because of corruption.  We have a situation now whereby another Taoiseach may be forced out of office because of incompetence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>That is totally out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The remark is totally out of place.  I ask Senator Regan to withdraw it.  In my humble opinion, no Taoiseach was forced out of office because of corruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I correct the record.  The discussions we had were on corruption.  The former Taoiseach was forced to resign from office.</P>

	<P>I am more than disappointed that anyone would draw the inference that the former Taoiseach was forced to resign over corruption.  In my opinion, the former Taoiseach&rsquo;s resignation did not relate to issues of corruption in politics.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>

	<P>Yesterday, I met, accidentally, Professor Drumm in the corridor of Leinster House and spoke to him about my document in regard to what we can do about suicide in the new Ireland.  I drew his attention, for the third time &mdash; I previously raised the matter in committee &mdash; to the fact that there are 11 suicide prevention officer positions in Ireland, three of which are vacant.  </P>
        <P>The role of the suicide prevention officers is to implement the national suicide strategy regionally and locally.  The Government declared in June 2007 its intention to reduce suicide rates by 20% by 2012.  How can it be expected to do so if the full complement of suicide prevention officers is not in position?  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children and her Ministers of State to ensure these positions are filled.  There are 113,000 <Col N="927"/>people working in the HSE at a cost of &euro;14.5 billion per annum.  Surely, the HSE can afford to fill these vacancies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the remarks made earlier by Senator Fitzgerald and others in regard to today&rsquo;s Order of Business, although I accept this is not entirely the Leader&rsquo;s fault.  However, it would be useful if he took a stronger position on this issue.  Today we are in the rather farcical situation of discussing amendments which we know have no earthly chance of being accepted by Government.  This seriously undermines our constitutional function as the second Chamber of the Oireachtas, which is lamentable.  Would it be possible to secure from Government a commitment that it will underwrite our constitutional position?  I have no doubt but that this is a breach of the Constitution.  We are required to scrutinise and amend legislation and are being prevented from doing so by the exigency of Government policies.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have just returned from the airport where I met quite a number of unhappy people, some of whom had spent the entire night there.  I do not often agree with Michael O&rsquo;Leary but am forced to do so on this occasion.  There is no backup system.  There is no fail-safe.  That is perfectly obvious.  The delays are unconscionable.  Questions must be asked about the fact that &euro;116 million was spent on acquiring this apparently sophisticated up-to-the-minute system for radar control from a French company.  The company has let us down badly.  There should be a fail-safe system but there is not.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary is probably right in saying there will be a further backup in flights later this morning, with people being delayed and flights being cancelled.  People have missed international connections and they will not be compensated.  This has happened to me.  The passenger, it seems, is almost always wrong.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader warmly for his support for the suggestion that the Abbey Theatre be relocated to O&rsquo;Connell Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and probably to the GPO, which is a historic and iconic building and one of the finest works of classical architecture from the early 19th century in the city.  I have received messages of support from some of the leading figures in the Irish theatre world and from some iconic names known from the events of 1916.  I have also received support from groups of architects and from people representing businesses in the city centre.  The matter is not closed.  I look forward to meeting with the Leader and with other representatives in this area.  It is important that instead of dismissing our national theatre out to some financial suburb down on the docks we should have it right in the centre of the city where it is accessible by metro, Luas, bus, bicycle and car and on foot.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We have received a letter from the Cathaoirleach regarding the deferment of this project.  I realise it is a health and safety issue but in view of the present circumstances, I wonder whether it is really vitally important.  This building was reconstructed some years ago and I cannot understand, irrespective of what the Clerk of the Seanad&rsquo;s view is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What about Roscommon County Hospital?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is built, but the way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is amazing how the Members opposite come in here and talk, despite how bad everything is in reality.</P>
        <P>We in the House have been misled by the Government.  I request that the Leader arrange a debate on this issue today.  The debate we have had thus far on the economy has been based on false premises.  Yesterday it emerged that the Minister for Health and Children will claw back vast sums of money from the nursing home funding scheme, A Fair Deal.  Fair deal, how are you?  What about a fair deal for the elderly who have been hurt by the Government?</P>
        <P>I also ask the Deputy Leader, who last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>To the Leader, not to the Deputy Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, before the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s party went into Government, its members lectured everybody about the economy.  Now, all Senator Boyle can do is to say he welcomes decentralisation.  I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the status of the decentralisation programme and the matter <Col N="929"/>of the e-voting machines which are now costing millions to store.  It is important that we have an honest debate on the economy because people are being affected.</P>
        <P>Finally, I join with Senator Norris&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s party never favoured decentralisation.  They scuttled it before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>He is good at it himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not make false promises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We over here are getting very tired of Senator Buttimer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to hear the matter on which Senator Buttimer is joining with me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden is being decentralised already.</P>
        <P>I join with Senator Norris in stating that what has been happening in Dublin Airport today and yesterday is atrocious.  It is incredible that we have no backup radar system.  Furthermore, the lack of assistance to the travelling public by the airlines is not good enough.  They have a responsibility to the travelling public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened with interest today to the comments to the Leader.  I have spoken to many people in my constituency in the past few days who have acknowledged that the country has experienced an economic transformation in the past few years, achieved through the hard work and enterprise of the citizens and led by the good, sound economic policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  Contrary to what is being said by the Opposition, it is the general view that our economy is strong and dynamic and is well placed to face the current international turbulence.  Much has been said about the economy and I want to balance it by saying this country has a low level of public debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a lot of personal debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a low burden of taxation and, most importantly, there are more than 2 million people at work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The ordinary people are exposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is rising unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>This has all arisen from the careful stewardship of the economy in the past decade&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is in denial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which has positioned it well to weather the current economic climate.  We should acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>Senators have been stating that there is a lack of information.  Anybody who looks at the Government&rsquo;s website will see that an announcement was placed by Government on 8 July regarding public spending measures.  A number of people asked about decentralisation.  I presume the Cathaoirleach will not allow me to read out this information on the Order of Business, <Col N="930"/>but I am simply making the point to the Opposition that if Members want to speak they should ensure the correct information is available to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have read it.  It is not detailed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of points in this which would be very helpful to people who wish to raise issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not need lectures.  We have read the information provided and there is no detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator speak on the debate yesterday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comment about storing a telephone number on one&rsquo;s mobile telephone in case of an emergency.  I am delighted to say I have an ICE number on my mobile phone.  I have been making the point for some time now, including in newsletters to my constituents, that it is important to have such a number.  Everybody has a mobile telephone now, including young children.  I make a special plea to people to put an ICE number in their telephones now if they have not already done so.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to reply to me on two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many Senators who wish to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>People have condemned the operational problems in Dublin Airport today.  I pay tribute to the IAA and to the many people who do tremendous work at the airports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should say that to the thousands who have been inconvenienced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrary to what we have heard from the Opposition, the radar system is working in Dublin Airport today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>People are sleeping on the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The IAA is putting passenger safety first, which is the most important thing.  However, it is equally important that the DAA inform passengers exactly what is happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>And the airlines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point we were making.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Strike notice has been given by staff of the Dublin Port tunnel.  It is my understanding that protocols and procedures were to be put in place and this now rests with the social partners.  Would it be possible for the Leader to obtain for me a briefing on that matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Only a year ago the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, was against incinerators but one is soon to start functioning in Duleek, County Meath, and one for up to 200,000 tonnes is planned for north Meath, in Nobber.  What are the views of the Minister and the Green Party on the number of incinerators needed by this country.  How many should be built in County Meath?  We need to <Col N="931"/>know because it is not clear that the Green Party has a policy anymore on this.  Does the party favour sandals or flip flops?</P>
        <P>I visited Dublin Airport this morning and saw banks of screens in the arrivals hall saying that flights will be delayed.  In the departures hall flights are delayed by up to two and a half hours.  This is the height of our tourism season and it is not clear that anything is being done about this issue.  The Minister may be able to take off and land at will at Baldonnel but the rest of us must queue in the departures hall.  This has been going on for five weeks and some action must be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The country is facing a huge financial loss that would make the Army deafness claims seem like a drop in the ocean.  ComReg, the communications regulator, has confirmed to me that there is no requirement on mobile phone companies to indemnify the Government against losses caused by the potential health effects of mobile phones and mobile phone masts.  This is particularly concerning because so many mobile phone masts are located on OPW land, Garda stations and hospitals.  Lloyd&rsquo;s of London, which can assess any possible risk, refused to insure mobile phone companies against the potentially damaging health effects of mobile phones and mobile phone masts.  If Lloyd&rsquo;s of London is not prepared to insure mobile phone companies the Government should require mobile phone companies to indemnify it against any potential class action suits.  Employers could find themselves in trouble if employees develop cancer and brain tumours due to the use of mobile phones; the Association of British Insurers said as much in a recent report.  I ask the Leader to ensure that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources implements the recommendations of the report and sees that the Government is not held liable for the actions of mobile phone companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add to the expressions of concern on the vagueness of the cutbacks that were announced in recent days.  I appeal to the Leader to clarify these issues for the House at the earliest possible date.  The suggestion that there should be cutbacks in expenditure on consultancy and public relations is so basic and obvious that it should have been implemented long ago.  </P>
        <P>We also need clarity on the situation regarding the fair deal for older people on subventions.  I understand from making representations that at present, the Health Service Executive cannot pay subventions at the 2008 rate.  Subventions are being paid at the 2007 rate pending the fair deal.  There is a gap in the interim and people are enduring shocking hardships due to the questions surrounding subventions.  This matter is arising at all of our advice centres so I ask the Leader to make a clear statement to the House in this regard and get clarification from the relevant Minister on when the fair deal will be put in place, what will happen to the money that was ring-fenced for it but has been lost through cutbacks and whether people can be paid 2008 subvention rates in the interim.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Leader for clarification on the position of the decentralisation programme, particularly regarding County Cavan.  The site there has been purchased but we were disappointed by Teradyne some years ago.  Can the Leader confirm that decentralisation to Cavan will go ahead, given the level of expenditure that has occurred there?  It should proceed given the commitment that has been made to it already.  It would be madness to reverse that kind of expenditure and I ask the Leader for clarification in this regard.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader clarify an issue I have been raising with him for some time that is of great concern to me and which is now very relevant given the current economic situation.  A battery of inspectors is travelling around the country making assessment of non-contributory old age pensioners.  This group of people, who do not make PRSI contributions, is very small and <Col N="932"/>consists mostly of married women who were debarred from working, small farmers and the long-term unemployed.  Will the practice of assessing these people be abandoned due to the wasteful expenditure involved?  I suspect that the cost of the administration of this process exceeds any savings it makes.  This is a tyranny facing old people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that in any court case the evidential burden will shift when one side has been heard and the other has not.  Unfortunately, an unethical procedure in this House saw Senator Regan passing on evidence from one side of a case as a fact.  As a senior counsel, this would be unethical behaviour in his own profession and it is unethical in this House.  Under no circumstances, when the evidential burden has not shifted and a person has not had the opportunity to answer charges, should a person take the initial charge as a fact of the court and present it in this House as a court decision.  This is unethical behaviour given Senator Regan&rsquo;s position as a barrister and Senator.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want no discussion on this.  Senator Regan should withdraw his remarks.  I understood what the Senator said and I asked him to withdraw his comments.  Whether the Senator withdraws his remarks is a matter for him to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to respond precisely to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s request for a withdrawal of my remarks.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Withdraw the remarks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is unreasonable.  I made a statement to emphasise the issue of competence in politics and I do not want to be distracted from that by this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want any distraction from it either.  The Senator said he would not withdraw his remarks relating to corruption but I believe he should.</P>

	<P>I will take the point of order in a moment when I have finished with Senator Regan.  As Cathaoirleach, all I want to know is whether Senator Regan is withdrawing his comments.  If he wishes to withdraw them he may do so, if not I want no further discussion on this matter.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to spoil the crankiness that has broken out this morning and which is uncharacteristic on the last day of the session.  I hope it is over and I congratulate Senator Regan for restoring peace to the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Leader for a debate on State agencies.  Senators Norris, Callely and others have touched on the issue of the Irish Aviation Authority.  A very important point must be considered in respect of yesterday&rsquo;s debate on cutbacks.  Senator Norris rightly stated &euro;116 million was spent on a radar system that does not work.  It is not that it did not work once but that it did not work several times.  This begs the question as to what on earth is going on in semi-State agencies.  It is not only a matter of the radar system not working but of there being no backup system.  I therefore suspect there is something wrong with the culture of agencies.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely touched on the Dublin Airport Authority.  It appears it is not providing the sort of information to which the public is entitled at this time.  Considerable money is spent on the Dublin Airport Authority, the Irish Aviation Authority and all such agencies, yet the issues that arise in respect thereof are, for some reason, political taboos in the House.  I have mentioned F&Aacute;S several times in the House but it is no coincidence that the matter has not been taken up by anybody.  Everybody in the House knows damn well that F&Aacute;S is wasting money hand over fist in various areas, but ignoring this problem is embedded in the political system such that politicians are frightened of taking it on.  One billion euro is being spent on F&Aacute;S every year, which represents a decrease by comparison with previous years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator requesting a debate of the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Although &euro;1 billion is being spent, nobody raises a hand.  They are frightened of the matter because it is embedded in the political system.  If we are talking about cutbacks, let us stop messing around in regard to bogus minor savings of sums that would not <Col N="934"/>be spent anyway, as Senator Fitzgerald and others suggested.  Let us tackle the taboos radically.  Let us tackle the State agencies and ask what they are doing.  Do we need to spend such sums on them?  My point on making minor savings in respect of moneys that would not have be spent in any case is borne out throughout the document issued yesterday.</P>
        <P>Yesterday this House was treated not with contempt but certainly with casualness.  The Minister entered the House and read a statement, the facts of which were all in the public arena already.  They were all in the newspapers yesterday.  Why does this happen?  There is another taboo at work, on which I request the Leader to have a debate in the autumn.  Nobody really cares about what we say about the economy.  Members of all parties have surrendered power to the social partners and have done so willingly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>We all pay lip service to the social partners and let them decide what happens.  What is said in the House falls on deaf ears.  I refer to the Minister and everybody else.  Unless we tackle the taboos in the political system &mdash; the semi-State agencies, the social partners and many others I could list &mdash; this House will become increasingly irrelevant and we will have more justifiable bellyaching.  It will be our own fault.  The untouchables, such as F&Aacute;S and the social partners, must be touched and tackled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for a debate on public private partnerships, PPPs, in the autumn in view of the recent problems at the Ringsend wastewater treatment unit and the amount of money that the relevant local authorities had to pay under the PPP, which amounted to &euro;35 million.  A number of PPPs are based on this model.  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated in the House that the Ringsend plant was based on best practice although there was no comparable PPP in the country.  Not only should the debate I request cover PPPs but also the funding of local authorities.  I am disappointed we have not had a debate to date on the Green Paper on local authorities.

	<P>The last contribution sounded like a request to the Leader for a debate on interruptions, which would perhaps be unusual.</P>
        <P>I echo the words of other Senators in calling for clarity on the cutbacks proposed by the Government.  It is adding insult to injury to suggest serious cutbacks will be made while the House will be in recess for the summer and not tell Members the exact nature of those cutbacks.</P>

	<P>In that context, will the Leader consider a debate on violence against women and children early in the next session.  One criminal justice case that received national attention in recent weeks, of which we are all very aware, concerned issues within family relationships.  The high profile of the case should not detract from the fact that the majority of cases of domestic violence or violence in intimate or personal relationships are committed against women and children.</P>
        <P>Some worthy progress has been made and the Government has established for the first time an agency, Cosc, whose function is to collect national data on domestic violence or violence in intimate relationships.  I fear that, in this climate of cutbacks, there will be cutbacks in funding of this agency.  Other Senators have referred to the review of agencies that is to be undertaken by the Government.  In this regard, I am very concerned that there will be no cutbacks in this area.  For far too long, groups such as Women&rsquo;s Aid and shelters for victims have been starved of resources.  Will the Leader consider a debate on violence against women and children, or violence in intimate relationships, early in the next term?  The main focus on the debate should be on what can be done about such violence and how we can best ensure resources are well directed in this area.  I hope Cosc will survive the cutbacks we expect over the summer.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Quinn, Alex White, Mary White, Regan, Norris, Buttimer, Callely, O&rsquo;Reilly, Ross and Bacik referred to matters that concern them greatly.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which was not initiated in this House and which was before the D&aacute;il for some considerable time, has been ordered for today.  It is a short Bill and the main Bill will be presented to Senators for their consideration in the autumn session.</P>
        <P>On the difficulties being experienced at Dublin Airport this morning, I cannot understand, regardless of the cost, why there is no stand-by radar signalling system to ensure passenger safety.  I hope the system will be repaired.  However, it goes to show that no matter how expensive a piece of technology is, a standby system also must be in place.  I wish everyone well, and it was alarming to hear radio reports this morning on the concerns of passengers who were missing flights to Australia and of a young couple with a three or four month old baby, who were obliged to spend the night at the airport.  One&rsquo;s heart went out to them.  Moreover, it is not easy for the staff of the airlines, who are doing their best and passing on the information as they receive it.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Mary White on a wonderful publication, namely, her report on suicide that she published this week.  She is a credit to the House and is to be complimented and commended highly on her efforts in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Senator Fitzgerald and other Members again expressed their serious concerns regarding the economy.  All Members are singing from the same hymn sheet in respect of doing whatever must be done regarding the challenges facing the Government.  Members are aware that on Tuesday, the Government stated it was determined to achieve the savings that now are required urgently.  To this end, each Minister will report to the Government regularly for the remainder of this year on the progress made in his or her area of responsibility towards achieving the specific savings required.  The measures agreed by the Government are focused on saving on administration costs, economising on the services it buys, driving efficiencies, reducing the proliferation of agencies and squeezing consultancy and public relations spending, which is required urgently.  All Members receive glossy publications that are not required because they all could be made available on a website.  The cost of such publications is enormous.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Other measures include streamlining service delivery and reprioritising certain capital expenditure in the future.  These measures seek to protect the vulnerable as far as is possible and all Members will agree with that sentiment.  They wish to see senior citizens, children and those on lower income levels protected as far as possible.  As for the low tax regime in place, one third of all who are in employment in Ireland at present do not pay tax, which is to the great credit of the Government and everyone concerned.</P>
        <P>On the Seanad&rsquo;s return in the autumn, I will have no difficulty in facilitating a lengthy debate on the economy, as well as an update at that time.  The time for the preparation of Estimates will be at hand and the formulation of the next budget will begin to take place.  It will be timely for the Seanad to express its opinion, as Senator Ross stated, and make it meaningful.  As for Senator Ross&rsquo;s specific request, I certainly intend to facilitate an all-afternoon debate on Government agencies and on the challenges facing F&Aacute;S, which is an agency that will be obliged to answer to the call in respect of retraining and reskilling.  As Members are aware, great resources have been allocated to it under the national development plan.  A total of 60% of those who are in employment at present will require upskilling or retraining.  Members want that to happen and will wish to examine the areas of expertise.</P>
        <P>Those Oireachtas joint committees that have an involvement in this field could be of assistance to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They could draw up proposals at their September sittings to bring before both Houses, where they can be discussed, deliberated on or enhanced.  As Senator Ross noted, while the social partners have a role to play, the Oireachtas joint committees also have a great role to play.  The expertise that is available to the joint committees from the membership of the Oireachtas can take centre stage in assisting the Government, in particular in those areas that have been outlined this morning.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn and Callely highlighted the importance of the in case of emergency, ICE, telephone number concept for the emergency services, which is a very good suggestion.  I will pass on Senator Quinn&rsquo;s suggestion to the Taoiseach after the Order of Business as it is something that everyone can easily do.  Senator Quinn also stated his strong views in respect of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on disability issues.  I agree with the Senator in this regard and will pass on his views to the Minister concerned.</P><Col N="938"/>
        <P>Senator Alex White called for a debate on taxation and the Irish position thereon.  I have no difficulty with such a debate taking place, possibly in tandem with the debate on the economy, on the return of the Seanad in the autumn.  I take Senator Alex White&rsquo;s point to the effect there should be a good news slot, perhaps for a half hour each day on radio and television, as well perhaps as a half page in the daily newspapers, to let the people of Ireland know the truth of the news and what really is happening.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris expressed his strong views, which I share, in favour of a review in order that the Abbey Theatre should be located on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  As massive savings are being sought at present, several million euro could be saved, were the suggestion to use the GPO to be furthered.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris has received great support for such a proposal from those who have been associated with theatre life for many years and have had great achievements in this regard.  I will assist the Senator and colleagues in the theatre world to achieve this in any way possible.  Ultimately, the main reason to so do is to satisfy the demand of the customer.  Everyone in Ireland knows the location of O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin.  However, in respect of many other locations in the capital city, while one&rsquo;s friends and relations might agree they sound great and should be visited sometime, they never do so.  Members want the theatre to be for everyone in Ireland.  It should be easily accessible at a location with which everyone is familiar.  Moreover, I refer to the various transport links that are available when an O&rsquo;Connell Street location is centre stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the redevelopment of Leinster House, where health and safety are extremely important issues.  I wish the Office of Public Works well in its undertaking.  Its performance and expertise have been exemplary through the years.  I look forward to working with the Cathaoirleach and other colleagues in the House to make this possible as soon as possible.  The health and safety of all, including Members and the working staff of the House, is included in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and O&rsquo;Reilly expressed their concerns regarding decentralisation.  The Cavan decentralisation project was mentioned, which Senator Wilson has assured me is already lined up and in place.</P>

        <P>Senator Callely raised the issue regarding Dublin Port tunnel and the difficulties that may be experienced there.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister to ascertain the position and will revert to the Senator.  Senator Hannigan expressed serious concerns regarding incineration and the challenges facing the people of his constituency.  I also can have inquiries made into this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly pointed out to the House the ComReg position in respect of health and mobile telephone masts, and referred to the ongoing debate on health and safety in respect of those who use this facility on a daily basis.  I have no difficulty in referring this matter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for its sittings during the remainder of July or in September.  It could respond with a short report to be discussed in the House in the early autumn.</P>
        <P>As I noted in respect of Senator Ross&rsquo;s request, I have made a commitment to hold an afternoon&rsquo;s debate on the State agencies, the social partners and the great responsibility in respect of the enormous sums of money, such as the &euro;1 billion allocated to F&Aacute;S, that are being spent annually.  This debate will take place in the early autumn.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke called for an update on the value of public private partnerships with particular reference to waste water treatment plants.  I have no difficulty in allowing time to facilitate such a discussion.</P>
        <P>Senator Larry Butler outlined to the House his difficulties in making his contribution here yesterday evening.  With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I will take the Senator&rsquo;s serious concerns to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see how we can improve and assist the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Cathaoirleach and those who face the challenge of this difficulty.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on violence.  I have no difficulty in providing time for this.</P>
        <P>As this is the final day before the summer recess, I thank the Cathaoirleach for his patience, courtesy and understanding of the difficulties we are experiencing.  I thank the Leas-Cathaoirleach.  I thank the Leaders of the various parties, the Whips in the House, and all colleagues and Senators.  I wish them all well for the summer.</P>
        <P>Senators should take a nice break in the month of August.  The committees are sitting right up to the end of July and at the start of September we will be back to work again.  They need to take a good hard look at our workload because it will be difficult.  With the economy being difficult, our constituents will need all the support they can get, and with our hard work and endeavour, and experience, when our batteries are recharged we will have no difficulty in facing them.</P>
        <P>I thank the Clerk of the House and the Clerk Assistant.  I thank the Captain of the Guard, John Flaherty, and the Superintendent, Paul Conway, and all the staff of the House for their kindness, help and courtesy.  I thank Mr. Jimmy Walsh, our correspondent from <i>The Irish Time</i>, and &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, for bringing to the people of Ireland the affairs of this House and letting them know the high level of debate that takes place here, and the hard endeavour and work, and the serious concerns, of us all.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, lines 18 to 21, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) The Courts of Justice Acts 1924 to 1961, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2007 and <i>section 7(a)</i>, to the extent that it amends the Courts of Justice Act 1924, may be cited together as the Courts Acts 1924 to 2008 and shall be construed together as one.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The reason for this proposed amendment is that there appears to be an inconsistency in the collective citations of the Courts of Justice Acts.  There is one citation for the Acts dating from 1924 to 1961 and a second citation for the Acts from 1961 onwards, even though the Courts of Justice Act 1961 extensively amended the Courts of Justice Act 1924.  The amendment proposes to bring some order to this chaos.  &ldquo;Chaos&rdquo; may be too strong a word to use in the circumstances, but there seems to be an inconsistency bordering on the chaotic.   The suggestion is to use a single composite citation, namely, &ldquo;Courts of Justice Acts 1924 to 2008&rdquo; from hereon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first amendment.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, agree this process is completely chaotic?  Will he state clearly, for the record of the House, whether the Government is in a position to accept any amendment whatever, due to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il?  We are engaged in a farce.  There is at least one amendment on the Government side in the name of a leading member of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party and the leader of the Green Party in the House &mdash; the man who negotiated the formation of the coalition Government.  Will the Minister of State candidly state if he is prepared to accept an amendment?  It seems clear to me that he cannot.  The degree of shambles in which we are involved is evident from the fact that we have just been issued with a list referring to amendments Nos. 2<i>a</i> and 12<i>a</i> which we do not yet have.  Does the Minister of State believe this is any way to conduct business?  We have been given groupings of amendments that we have not seen, which I find absurd.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the remarks of Senator Norris.  Regarding the amendment groupings just distributed, I have proposed amendment No. 9.  I have been told it is proposed to be grouped with amendment No. 8 and amendment No. 8<i>a</i>, which I have not yet received.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Along with several colleagues, I have previously raised the matter of the process by which this Bill is brought before the House, which is not only a matter for the Seanad but for the process as a whole.  The Government is seeking to rush the Bill through the House on the last sitting day before the recess.  The D&aacute;il will not be in a position to deal with the Bill if it is forwarded.  I question how we can deal with this and how the Minister of State can take or discuss amendments on the Bill in this chaotic environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous comments.  The Minister of State pretends to lend an ear to what is said in this House, but has no intention of accepting any amendments.  The organisation of business in the House has come as a diktat from Government and we know this from the Leader of the House.  He has no room to manoeuvre in terms of the timing.  With the dissolution of the D&aacute;il it is clear there is no intention on the part of the Minister of State or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to accept amendments.  This unwillingness to accept amendments is not because they may lack merit.  It is simply a blanket policy to reject all amendments and it ties in with the agenda of the Government to rush this legislation.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is exactly the same.  Is it the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention or is he willing to accept any amendment?  I assume that if the Minister of State accepts an amendment &mdash; I know him well enough to realise his intention is to write good legislation &mdash; it will not come into operation until it goes back to the D&aacute;il, which may be in September or October.  That is quite valid and I understand why that should happen.  Is the Minister of State willing to accept any amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>From the initial discussions on this debate, there have been a number of meetings.  I wish to bring some balance to the matter.  I understand the frustration from the opposite side and I proposed yesterday that I would have no problem in the House sitting next week.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="942"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for myself.  On the principle of amendments, we must deal with every one on merit and it will ultimately be a question for the Minister of State.  In the process over the past several weeks, the Minister has accepted several amendments, one example being the proposal that the 46 or 47 early opening houses throughout the country, which serve a purpose, were to be either closed down or brought back to regular hours.  This has been changed and there are a number of instances where the Minister has listened, not alone to lobby groups, but to different views put forward.</P>
        <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that a further Bill is being proposed for the autumn, which can deal with many other issues.  We voted on this already this morning.  Senator Alex White has moved the first amendment and it is not for me to second it.  We should debate each amendment on its merit rather than keep going around in circles on whether the issue as a whole will be sorted out today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should stand up for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and be persuaded that the amendments are meritorious.  If they are, I will accept those amendments.  There is a process to be observed called democracy.  We must go through these amendments <i>seriatim</i> and decide if they are appropriate.  I will give the replies as the amendments arise.</P>
        <P>Some of the amendments are extremely good and their substance will be incorporated in future legislation if not in this particular legislation.  Some of the items raised by way of amendment by particular Senators are of particular merit.  In substance, they have already been incorporated in the approach being taken by the Government.  I do not see us being at odds with each other to the extent being made out.</P>
        <P>I am happy to proceed in the normal way with business and ensure we go through this item by item, giving the level of scrutiny deserved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to hear the Minister of State say he is willing to accept amendments.  He went even further and I was delighted to hear him say that some of these are very worthy amendments and worth accepting.  The only trouble is if these are not accepted today, they do not become law.  Something else will become law until later in the year.  We will have six months of bad law.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State has indicated some of these amendments are very worthy of consideration and acceptance but does not accept them, he is introducing bad legislation which we must put up with for at least four or five months.  I am sure the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention is not to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Just because the Senator has a good idea from time to time does not mean I am enacting bad law.  The Government has not framed any particular amendments to this Bill and as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan stated earlier, some fairly significant concessions from the Government side have already been made with regard to two issues.  These are the matters of early houses and separation of alcohol products, which has by agreement been parked until we can derive a code of practice with the industry on the issue.</P>
        <P>The underlying thrust of this Bill is very significant.  I do not see how Senators can wish to delay legislation like this, which is specifically designed to curtail the availability of alcohol, <Col N="943"/>and by extension to control and limit the kind of public damage to individuals and property done because of late night and binge drinking, etc.  I cannot believe Senators would want to delay legislation which has at its spearpoint proposals to counter the hooliganism associated with late-night drinking.  It will make it easier to curtail this phenomenon, which is making a misery of the lives of a great many people.  I do not see the argument for delay.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I raised this matter it has been taken up.  All my colleagues, including those on the Government side, have acknowledged that there is a significant problem.  There is no intention to delay this matter and we concur on this side with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan if the Seanad must meet next week.  The D&aacute;il will still be in recess so it will not be of much use in solving the problem.</P>
        <P>I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the Minister of State on an admirable fudge.  He did not say he would accept any amendments and we all know bloody well that he will not.  The Minister of State spoke of what happened in the D&aacute;il but we know what happened there.  A guillotine was employed and two thirds of the amendments put down by the Opposition in the other House were not discussed at all.  That is what has happened with this Bill.</P>
        <P>We are not trying to delay the legislation at all.  We are absolutely at one with the Minister of State in that the public order problem must be addressed.  What the Minister of State has essentially indicated, if he reads the subtext, is that there may be some ideas in the amendments which will be incorporated in the main Bill in the autumn.  I would be very surprised if the Minister of State accepted any amendment today.</P>
        <P>I am prepared, as the poet Wordsworth wrote, to be surprised by joy.  I do not anticipate it but I will not hold up the House any longer.  We should get down to the substance of the amendment because we have established where we are.  It is a poor day for the respect for the constitutional position of the Seanad in that this should happen.  I do not personally blame the Minister of State but I attach blame to the Government in the way it has treated this legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the point that to suggest many amendments have been accepted in the D&aacute;il has no relevance to the debate in this House.  Senators are putting down <Col N="944"/>amendments on the substance and merits of the Bill and that is what is at issue, not any amendments which have been accepted in the Lower House.  As Senator Norris has stated, we know only a couple of the amendments were even debated before the guillotine was put down.  The Minister of State does not intend to move on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot take the matter much further than my colleagues.  I do not intend to rise to debate or over-react to some statements in the same way as some colleagues, usually from the opposite side.  I take exception to any suggestion on the part of the Minister of State or anybody on his behalf, when he gave the long list of problems and social ills attempted to be addressed in this Bill, that people on this side of the House are in some way less concerned or interested in addressing those issues.  He rather rhetorically threw into his defence of the position a few minutes ago that people would surely want to deal with issues such as binge drinking and fall-out from the abuse of alcohol, as if there was some suggestion that people over here were less interested in doing so.</P>
        <P>I take considerable exception to that suggestion.  Anything said by Senators Quinn, Norris, Bacik, Regan or myself has been precisely directed in that cause &mdash; an attempt to ensure this legislation is the best possible.  We are not attempting to delay it for the sake of it.</P>
        <P>Despite Senator Quinn&rsquo;s benign interpretation of what the Minister of State said in respect of listening to amendments, it is perfectly clear the Government has not the slightest intention of accepting any amendments before the House.  It is a sad state of affairs that Members of an important constitutional body such as this House know that irrespective of what they say or do before this debate concludes, either today or, at Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s suggestion, next week, it will not make a difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Alex White, I will respond to the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that Senators on this side are seeking to delay the Bill and do not have concerns about the problems associated with alcohol abuse.  As many of us stated during the Second Stage debate yesterday, while we are very concerned about these problems, we do not believe the Bill is an effective means of tackling them.  On the contrary, it is counter-productive legislation and restricting the hours in which people are entitled to drink in pubs and clubs will not address the problem of binge drinking or the harm associated with alcohol abuse.  Such restrictions will affect where and how alcohol is consumed, rather than how much of it is consumed or what damage it causes.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Opposition Senators do not wish to under estimate or trivialise the problems associated with alcohol abuse.  The amendments I and other Senators have tabled propose alternative means of tackling the problem and more time is needed to debate them.  It is unfortunate, as other speakers have noted, that Senators have been left in the farcical position of proposing good, worthwhile alternatives which the Minister of State appears to be unable to accept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was rather upset by the Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion that our proposals to improve the Bill would not achieve the objectives set out in the Bill.  I and my colleagues want to have good legislation and we seek to improve the Bill.  The Minister of State suggested the purpose of our amendments is to delay or stop the Bill.  That is not our intention and I ask him to rephrase his remarks insinuating that those of us who are trying to improve the Bill are seeking to prevent its objective being achieved. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will first address Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment No. 1.  I understand the purpose of the amendment is to create a new collective citation for the Courts Acts, which would incorporate the Courts of Justice Acts and the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) <Col N="945"/>Acts.  Irrespective of the merits of having a new collective citation for all courts legislation on the lines proposed in the amendment, the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that this is not the legislation in which to make such a change.  However, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has undertaken a joint project with the Law Reform Commission to codify the Courts Acts and I am sure this is one of the issues that will be addressed in that project.</P>
        <P>While the amendments, including amendment No. 1, contain meritorious ideas, the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that it would not be appropriate to take a collective citation approach to the alcohol Acts in this legislation.  However, the Department is engaged with the Law Reform Commission to do precisely what the Senator proposes by way of amendment.  The Parliamentary Counsel differs with the Senator in taking the position that the Bill is not the appropriate place to make such an amendment.</P>
        <P>While the spirit with which Senator Alex White has applied himself to the detail of the law in this area and the thrust of the amendment are absolutely correct, this is not the appropriate legislation for such an amendment.  This is what I meant when I indicated that some of the amendments are fine and have a noble purpose.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment is a clever approach to addressing a legal matter, albeit not in the right place.  This does not diminish his motivation or the purpose of the amendment.</P>
        <P>On the broader issues raised by other Senators, one must distinguish between fine amendments such as that under discussion and other amendments that are clearly motivated by an industry that operates late at night and seeks to have the legislation changed.  This industry has lobbied around the House in the past week or so and some Members may have been persuaded to table amendments in this House or the other House.  The Government will legislate for the industry in the autumn in a comprehensive Bill.</P>
        <P>The Government is not in agreement with the industry or specific amendments to be discussed later.  While I do not wish to pre-empt those discussions, the Government does not wish to have later opening hours.  I am rather surprised by Senator Bacik&rsquo;s assertion that restricting the hours of availability of alcohol has no effect on consumption given that definitive international evidence is available which shows consumption is affected by restrictions on the sale, supply, advertising and sponsorship of alcohol.</P>
        <P>We have a unique opportunity to address this issue.  It has been my experience over the years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State to confine his remarks to the amendment before us as he is pre-empting the debate on other amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so.  Every time a Government has tried to address this issue and challenge vested interests in the alcohol industry, efforts have been made to thwart it.  We have reached a key juncture and if we do not introduce legislation, we will not get to grips with our national alcohol problem.  Speedy legislation is required to put down a definite marker.  A range of vested interests, including groceries, supermarkets, retail outlets, convenience stores and alcohol producers, would prefer a liberal approach to alcohol consumption.  Unfortunately, Ireland has a serious problem with alcohol and legislation is required to restrict opening hours.  The bottom line is that we have tried everything else, including having a persuasive conversation with members of the public on the matter, but it has not worked.  It is, therefore, time to legislate quickly.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>At this early stage, the Minister of State has extended the debate into other issues, despite being urged by the Leas-Chathaoirleach not to do so.  In respect of amendment No. 1, I anticipate that the Minister of State will inform the House that while many of <Col N="946"/>the amendments are good, the legislation is not the appropriate place in which to deal with them.  I will have some difficulty with that response as business proceeds.  </P>
        <P>In respect of the proposal in amendment No. 1, the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that the legislation may not be the appropriate place to deal with the issue in question has some merit and I am prepared to accept it.  While I am not in a position to set conditions for the Minister of State, I ask him to indicate that the issue will be, as opposed to may be, addressed in the codification exercise to which he referred.  If he gives such an undertaking, I will be satisfied that subsequent legislation is the appropriate place in which to address the issue and will not pursue the matter on the basis that progress will be made.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should not take a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; position on lobby groups or vested interests as he is a prominent member of a party which is familiar and comfortable with dealing with such groups and interests in all types of areas.  He should not tell Opposition Senators that we should not talk to or listen to lobby groups.  They are as entitled as everyone else to raise issues with us.  It is a little rich to hear a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude from the Government side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not wish to prolong the debate on the amendment, in the interests of fairness I must respond to the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments which misinterpreted what I said.  I did not say regulations on the advertising, sale and supply of alcohol do not have an impact on consumption.  Clearly, such regulations have an impact and I have argued in the House that the Government should restrict the sale of premiership football jerseys in children&rsquo;s sizes which prominently bear logos of alcohol companies.  I hope to raise this issue again with the Department.</P>
        <P>My specific point was that restricting opening hours, for example, abolishing holy hour, does not of itself lead to the problems we associate with binge drinking and alcohol consumption.  There is no evidence that the abolition of holy hour has led to people drinking more during that period.  I do not believe that allowing clubs and bars to extend their opening hours beyond 2.30 a.m., or 1 a.m. on Sunday nights, would lead to people drinking greater quantities of alcohol.  The evidence from countries where opening hours are more liberalised is not that people drink more or binge drink.  Our culture is specifically binge drinking in nature, largely because we are used to having severe controls imposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is straying from the content of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to comments made by the Minister of State, who suggested that people who tabled amendments seeking longer opening times had somehow done so at the behest of lobbyists or vested interests.  I take exception to that assertion.  The one vested interest group to which the Minister of State did not refer is that which comprises consumers.  I have attended nightclubs and bars &mdash; and I hope to continue to do so &mdash; and, like most Members, I was lobbied by the nightclub industry.  We were also lobbied by those who attend nightclubs and late bars, which is fair enough.</P>
        <P>I would have tabled my amendments regardless of whether I had been lobbied.  I have a long record of seeking action in respect of this matter.  I wrote in <i>Gay Community News</i> on the need to liberalise opening hours.  In the past I made a submission, in a personal capacity, to the Commission on Alcohol requesting that opening hours be liberalised.  I also supported a proposal put forward by a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the effect that caf&eacute; bar licences should be introduced in this country.</P><Col N="947"/>
        <P>It is unfair to state that people are suggesting that opening hours be extended just because the Irish Nightclub Industry Association or some other lobby group made a recommendation in this regard.  There is an important principle at stake &mdash; namely, that the laws should not be as restrictive as they are at present &mdash; in which many of us believe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current licensing system came into place on foot of legislation introduced by the Government.  The Opposition cannot be blamed for the current position.  To introduce crude and rushed legislation in an attempt to deal with some perceived ill such as, for example, public order offences is not the way to proceed.  I strongly object to the Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion that all the Opposition amendments were tabled at the behest of a specific lobby group.  Members have tabled a range of different amendments which relate to the concerns of the people who will be affected by the legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the remark he made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will adhere to the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s instruction to comment only on the amendment tabled by Senator Alex White.  I assure the Senator that the matter to which he refers is being dealt with under the joint codification project in which the Department is engaged with the Law Reform Commission.  When that project is complete, there will be a unified corpus of law relating to this area.  I welcome the Senator&rsquo;s indication that he would withdraw the amendment if I provided an assurance in respect of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, subsection (5), line 29, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;but should not commence until a Regulatory Impact Analysis has been completed and published&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This simple amendment is worthy of consideration.  A provision such as that contained in the amendment should be included in practically every item of legislation and it was agreed in the past that this would be done.  We should not introduce new laws without having some idea as to the costs to which they will give rise.  Unless there is an extremely urgent need to pass legislation, I am of the view that each Bill should be the subject of a regulatory impact analysis before it is commenced.</P>
        <P>In this instance, it is clear there is a need to carry out such an analysis.  The Bill is short but it contains a number of extremely pertinent provisions.  For example, under section 9 a new subsection (1A) is to be inserted into section 3, as amended by section 4 of the Act of 2000, of the 1927 Act.  This new subsection states:</P>
        <P LI="1">[W]here non-licensed business is carried on in a premises to which an off-licence is attached, the holder of the licence shall ensure that ... the exposure for sale and the sale of intoxicating liquor is exclusively confined to a part of the licensed premises ... which is structurally separate from the remainder of the premises by means of a wall or similar barrier ...</P>
        <P FLI="0">A number of retailers are extremely concerned regarding the costs to which this provision may give rise.  They approached the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who agreed with the points they raised and indicated that it is not his intention to commence this part of the Bill if those making the case to him behaved and did what they were promising to do, namely, put in place not a wall but some form of separation arrangement. <Col N="948"/> The Minister is to be congratulated on listening to their concerns and deciding not to commence this provision.</P>
        <P>The amendment is worded in a particular way.  That is because, in the future, if a Minister decides to commence this provision, the cost to the supermarkets, stores, etc., that will be affected will be something of the order of &euro;200 million.  That is a major sum of money and responsibility for this matter should not be placed in the hands of a Minister who might, at the stroke of a pen, commence the provision.  If the provision is not commenced, there will be no need for the &euro;200 million to which I refer to be spent.  In general terms, the spending of this money would not have a positive impact on Irish industry because that which would be required would have to be imported from elsewhere.</P>
        <P>There may be other provisions in the Bill which may give rise to costs of this nature and that is why a regulatory impact analysis should be carried out.  Regardless of this, however, such an analysis is necessary in respect of the provision to which I refer.  While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that he will not commence this provision if the legislation is passed, he would still have the right to commence it.  The amendment in my name suggests that it &ldquo;should not commence until a Regulatory Impact Analysis has been completed and published&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is a worthy amendment and it is one which the Minister of State could accept because it would be easy to carry out a regulatory impact analysis.  The latter would not delay the implementation of the Bill, it would only delay the commencement of the provision in question.  I urge the Minister of State to consider accepting the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, the proposition relating to which is self-evident.  A regulatory impact analysis should have been carried out before the Bill was initiated.  As Senator Quinn stated, this matter can be dealt with because the Minister will be in a position, under section 1(5), to decide when particular provisions of the Bill should come into force.  I received representations from many supermarkets, discount stores and retail outlets in respect of the cost to which the measures contained in the Bill could give rise.  The Minister of State should respond positively to the proposal put forward in this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge Senator Quinn&rsquo;s renowned expertise in the area of retailing.  It is important to understand what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in respect of this section.  He clearly stated that he will not be commencing this aspect of the separation in respect of mixed trading environments where alcohol, food items and other products are sold together if the vested interests involved adopt a code of practice in respect of the sale of alcohol within their stores.  Those involved have been charged with developing a code of practice that would have the same effect as the provision contained in the Bill.  The Minister clearly indicated he is linking the two.</P>
        <P>The Minister must retain the sanction outlined in the Bill.  I do not anticipate it will be used.  The vested interests &mdash; in this instance, small retailers &mdash; most at risk from the commencement of this provision are attempting, willingly and in good faith, to see if the import of the section can be reflected in the code of practice they have been charged with drawing up.  Clearly, the Minister must have the reserved power to commence this provision should the sector show bad faith or seek to string out the discussion about a code of practice but I do not see that as a possibility.  The Minister and the vested interests have shown good faith.  I agree with the Senator, to the extent that an imposition of a cost of &euro;200 million on small retailers whose profit margins are narrowing by the day would be unfair without seeking to proceed by way of a code.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment but the Government is fully committed to implementation of the regulation principles set out in the White Paper, Regulating Better, which makes it clear that regulatory impact assessment is an aid to decision-making, not a substitute for it.  Neither should it become an obstacle to reform, especially where implementation of reforms is considered urgent by an advisory group responding to the terms of reference given to it by the Government.  The report of the advisory group was generally concerned with the increased availability and visibility of alcohol in retail outlets.  The advisory group indicated that it was guided by better regulation principles in addressing its terms of reference and called for submissions from interested bodies.  Almost 200 were received.  It consulted widely with trade and other relevant interests.  In the interests of transparency, chapter 2 of the report sets out the data for alcohol consumption, public health and public order issues which guided the advisory group in formulating its recommendations for reform.</P>
        <P>I have concerns about the constitutionality of the amendment which Senator Quinn tabled in good faith.  I see his purpose but there are issues around its constitutionality.  To make entry into force of legislation duly enacted by the Oireachtas subject to a subsequent economic analysis of its impact would undoubtedly raise constitutional issues about the separation of powers under the Constitution.  To a certain extent, it would diminish the powers of the House because it would pass a Bill but leave it to another body, economic or otherwise, to analyse and make recommendations for change.</P>
        <P>I reassure Senator Quinn, given his expertise in retailing and his contribution to the country during the years, that the intention is to ensure the section will not be commenced because we expect the sector, through the retail organisations which represent it, to come up with the answer by way of a voluntary code of practice which will apply across stores without imposing an extra cost on retailers who are struggling with issues of profitability and physical space.  Most reasonable people would accept that it would be very hard to impose a commencement order on small retailers who may have distinct issues or problems with the square footage available in-store.</P>

	<P>I accept what the Minister of State said but it is bad law.  It is bad to pass legislation without assessing the impact it will have, including its economic impact.  A regulatory impact analysis should be undertaken in respect of everything we do.  It would not take much time and would be very simple.  No law should be passed with knowing what its effect will be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation has been rushed.  The alcohol advisory group set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes has, as the Minister of State said, done a lot of work.  It was established in January and told to report by March.  Many representations were made to it but the process was rushed.  The Government looked at the report sometime in March and then introduced the Bill in May without attention being given to it.  The reason we have had so many calls from various vested interests is they did not have a chance to express their points of view beforehand and it is now far too late for them to do so.  We should consider this matter much more seriously.  Legislation should not be passed without having some idea of what its impact will be.  In this case, the Minister has not analysed the cost, including the economic cost.  The Minister of State should accept the amendment.  I hope that between now and Report Stage he will give it serious consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a clear logic to what Senator Quinn said and the basis of his proposal.  He is left in a position where the only way he can introduce it and have it included in the Bill is to make commencement of the legislation contingent on the making of a regulatory analysis about which he spoke.  I take what the Minister of State said in querying the constitutionality of such a proposal, that the passing into law of a measure would be made contingent <Col N="950"/>on something else happening.  There is probably some merit to that argument but the issue of substance Senator Quinn raised is that all such legislation should be made subject to a regulatory analysis to ensure best practice.  He is absolutely right to look for this.  However, as he said, he is placed in a position where the only way he can introduce this meritorious proposal, given that the legislation has been so rushed, is to look at the commencement provisions and link his proposal to that mechanism.  It would have been preferable if it could have been done in another way but there was no time to do so.  I fall back on the logic of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s proposal which is unanswerable.</P>
        <P>There is another side to the argument in section 8 or section 9 related to structural separation.  There is a clear commercial interest and problem which has been discussed with me and must be addressed.  There is also the wider public issue at which we need to look.  Many of us have made the point in the House that when one goes into a shop to buy a newspaper, one trips over alcohol.  That issue needs to be addressed.  However, sticking to this proposal, in the explanatory memoranda to all legislation we are told a scan has been done to assess the cost, if any, to the Exchequer.  That is a standard statement in all explanatory memoranda.  In this instance it is stated there will be no significant financial implications for the Exchequer.  It is right we are told this but, similarly, it should be possible for legislators to know, or to have the means to assess, the cost to interested parties resulting from its implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a technical point before I leave.  The monitors show we are on section 1, amendment No. 1, and have done so throughout the discussion of amendment No. 2.  I intend to follow the debate on the monitor in the hope I will be able to return when my amendment arises for discussion.  It will not be helpful if the monitors continue to show the incorrect amendments.  They have now changed.  I did not intend to interrupt Senator Regan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment relates to the retail sector, or mixed trading houses, in particular.  In that context, I do not believe the Minister intends to introduce some of the provisions in the Bill relating to that sector.  There is scope to carry out a regulatory impact analysis.  The Minister of State has made the case for me that that is the type of analysis which should be undertaken before the Act is commenced.</P>
        <P>On the constitutional point, one would not be giving the authority to implement legislation to an outside body.  We are delegating authority to the Minister to implement legislation and adopt regulations under it.  All that is proposed in the amendment by Senator Quinn is that an impact analysis be completed.  Therefore, I am not sure the constitutional point being raised by the Minister of State is so devastating for it.  I urge him to at least consider the amendment as it relates to the sector Senator Quinn has in mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to get into a lengthy reply on the matter.  I accept the principle behind Senator Quinn&rsquo;s suggestion.  However, impact assessments of the kind he suggests should be done before legislation is introduced rather than, as he proposes, afterwards.</P>
        <P>I put my hands in the air to a certain extent with regard to the rushed nature of the legislation.  As a Minister of State in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I and the previous Minister, had discussions with the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, as part of our outstanding bilateral discussions between Ministers in particular Departments.  The overwhelming view resulting from that meeting was that matters of this kind need to be fast-<Col N="951"/>forwarded for various reasons, such as public order, the long gestation of discussion on alcohol related issues and the difficulties associated with situations where vested interests throw up the spectre of an alleged nanny state placing restrictions on citizens.  It was, therefore, thought best to move this through speedily.  That was the motivation.</P>
        <P>In that respect, the current Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is not responsible for the rushed character of this legislation.  The urgency had its origins in the meeting I attended with the former Taoiseach and the previous Minister.  There was an overwhelming view at official and political level at that meeting that this should be pushed through quickly because of issues relating to public order and alcohol consumption.  I say all this by way of explanation.</P>
        <P>Impact assessment is important.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has engaged honestly with the industry and we can achieve the desired result without imposing the significant cost of &euro;200 million on a small and fragile sector such as small retailers.</P>
        <P>Another issue the State will have to consider, but which has not been addressed in the Bill, is the pricing of alcohol.  From conversations with retailers in my constituency I am aware they are worried about vexatious regulation by way of separation of products, etc., within a store.  The issue we must get to grips with, however, is pricing.  I hope, now that the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is Minister for Finance, that he will give serious consideration to the issue of the pricing of alcohol products, beers or otherwise, on a discount basis.  In many cases the cost is cheaper than a cup of coffee, which creates a problem.  It is an issue that people can go into a store and buy a can of beer for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.  This is the elephant in the room and the issue must be addressed by the Government.  It is not covered in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On a point of information, I agree with the Minister of State that is an important issue, but it is addressed in section 16, which permits the Minister to make regulations prohibiting or restricting licensees from selling intoxicating liquor at a reduced price.  I support that and believe it is a sensible and moderate approach.  It does not ban below cost selling, but it imposes restrictions and permits the Minister to make regulations that will provide for the detail.  That is a moderate and balanced approach.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION  2.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2<i>a</i> and 12<i>a</i> are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="2">In page 4, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo; &ldquo;Court&rdquo; means the District Court and in relation to any application to the Court means the District Court for the court area in which the premises to which the application relates is situated;&rdquo;.</P><Col N="952"/>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment makes a technical definition of the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo;.  The amendment is designed to introduce and deal with night club permits.  It is designed to deal with a situation which has arisen through the provisions of the Bill which seek to harmonise or provide a common closing time for premises with special exemptions, including theatres and night clubs.  As a result we have non-sequential exiting from late night drinking premises.  This, essentially, tells mature adults that they should not be out late after 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m. and tells them when it is time to drink up and go home.</P>
        <P>This amendment is designed to introduce a provision to regularise this situation.  On the question of theatres and night clubs, the measure proposed in the Bill is crude in the extreme.  It affects the entire industry, has social implications and was adopted in a manner that will not achieve the primary objective of the legislation, namely, to address the public order issue.  We know and the Garda has confirmed that where there is common exiting from late night drinking premises, public order issues arise.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12<i>a</i> provides for a specific licence for night clubs.  The conditions of the licence allow the business to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., provide that an admission price would be charged at a designated cash desk, subsequent to passing a security desk and prior to entering into the premises and that there would be a specific percentage of floor area, 20%, for dancing.  The dancing space provision is designed to ensure that it is a genuine night club establishment and place of entertainment.  Public liability insurance is also required and there must be two security persons on the front door.</P>
        <P>Another provision is that no clients are admitted to the premises after 2.30 a.m.  This provision is designed to prevent those exiting pubs from then streaming into night clubs and would contribute to sequential exiting of people from late night drinking establishments.  The conditions under which a court may grant a licence, the conditions attaching to the licence and the offences giving rise to a breach of a night club permit are set out in the amendment.</P>
        <P>This is a reasonable and correct approach to take with regard to regulating the sector.  The primary purpose of the legislation is to avoid public order issues that cause huge difficulties arising late at night and early in the morning.  We all concur with the basic objective of the Bill, which is to deal with the public order situation and underage drinking, etc.  However, with regard to late night drinking and clubs, we have arrived at the nanny state and at telling mature adults when they should drink up and go home.  This is not appropriate in the 21st century and does not address the social issues the Bill attempts to address.  I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the amendment put forward by Senator Regan, as well as the argument behind it.  An element of straight thinking is required on this issue but, while I know the Minister of State to be both thoughtful and discerning, I was concerned to hear some of his earlier remarks.  If we are serious about addressing the social problems that arise from alcohol abuse and binge drinking, it is a pity to argue for restricted opening hours in all circumstances for nightclubs and other licensed premises.  It is dangerous and unrealistic to believe that the first issue is directly linked to the second.  The logical conclusion would be to advocate greatly reduced opening hours for public houses, which is not being provided for in this Bill.  There is, therefore, no causal link between opening hours and abuse, despite what the Minister of State suggested in his opening remarks.</P>
        <P>Nightclubs are a feature of urban life throughout the world.  There is nothing inherently wrong with them provided they are properly regulated, managed and secured.  They are part of the social and entertainment fabric of every modern city.  We should be honest about this <Col N="953"/>notion of bashing nightclubs.  I visit nightclubs on occasion and I do not think there is anything wrong with doing so.  Nightclubs in Barcelona and in cities in Italy and Germany open later than 4 a.m. with few repercussions in terms of policing or security.  They also play an important role for the music and entertainment industry.  The suggestion that people go to them because they crave more drink after falling out of pubs is not true.  People abuse alcohol in various surroundings but nightclubs appear to have become fair game in the Government&rsquo;s approach to this problem.  There is nothing wrong with a responsible and controlled environment in which people can have a late night drink and enjoy themselves by dancing the night away.  There is in this approach a touch of the nanny state which the Minister of State decried five minutes ago.</P>
        <P>I am not making these points because my arm has been twisted by some society of nightclub operators.  I do not care much about any particularly lobby group.  Are we prepared to honestly say, as I am, that nightclubs are part of what we are?  We should by all means regulate them in the manner proposed by Senator Regan&rsquo;s careful and detailed amendment and that is the direction in which the Minister of State should proceed.</P>
        <P>Some of my colleagues on the Government side are of the view that the provisions in the Bill will deal solely with theatre licences.  We are aware of the fiction whereby nightclubs operate with theatre licences.  That is crazy because they are nightclubs rather than theatres but it is the only means by which they can open late into the night.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment takes away the reliance on theatre licences and introduces a proper nightclub licensing system.  It will have the effect of addressing the issue of sequential closing in Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where public order issues arise because all the pubs and clubs disgorge their clientele at the same time.  That is a completely crazy practice which I thought we had all agreed to end.  It does not make sense that the streets of Dublin are crowded between 2.30 a.m. and 3 a.m. and there is nothing wrong with a relatively small number of well managed nightclubs.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s proposal has considerable merit, therefore, and I am happy to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  The present system of nightclubs operating under the guise of theatre licences is inappropriate and it is time that we clarified the law by regulating them properly.  Some of us frequent nightclubs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>From time to time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not do so every night of the week.  It is reasonable that people should be able to frequent nightclubs which stay open later than pubs.  A system of sequential closing should be introduced because public safety is a real concern when large numbers of people spill out on to the streets at any one time.  Difficulties arise in terms of public transport and safety for young people who walk home alone because they cannot find taxis.  Anybody who has been on Dame Street or any other main street in Ireland at 3 a.m. will be aware of these problems.</P>
        <P>It would be eminently sensible to operate a sequential closing system so that some venues can stay open later than others.  Proper nightclub licences which permit people not only to drink but to dance and socialise late into the night would also be sensible.  Such systems can be seen in many other countries in Europe and around the world.  It would allow for the creation of a more cosmopolitan culture around drinking and tourists would feel more welcome.  Dublin in particular has been marketed as a place where people can enjoy a cosmopolitan drinking culture.</P>
        <P>On a slightly more whimsical note, it is nice to be able to dance until dawn.  Nightclubs are not important only for drinking; they also offer opportunities for dancing and socialising.  Unless dawn comes very early, however, we will not see it with the Bill as it stands.  U-turns have <Col N="954"/>already been taken in regard to early houses and off-licence partitions, so I would like the Minister of State to accept that nightclub licences are a sensible way to proceed, if not in the context of this Bill, then in the comprehensive legislation promised for autumn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will not speak about nightclubs because it is some time since I have visited one.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address the definition of &ldquo;court&rdquo; in amendment 2<i>a</i>.  It seems logical in that a court other than the District Court might otherwise be involved and, if that is Senator Regan&rsquo;s intention, I ask for clarification on why it is not acceptable.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have mixed views on the issue of closing times.  Senator Bacik spoke about dancing until dawn but I visited a night club only once in the past ten years, on the occasion of a birthday, and I felt somewhat out of place.  Most of the people there appeared young enough to be my children or grandchildren.  </P>
        <P>There is a problem in terms of the misuse and abuse of alcohol and we should not forget that.  I am not sure that stipulating the time at which nightclubs must close will help to resolve this.  I have witnessed what happens when people spill out of nightclubs.  Most of them are, unfortunately, well-loaded.  I do not buy into the argument that there is a short supply of taxis.  Dublin is flooded with taxis.  At around 1 a.m. travelling down Dawson Street one Thursday night recently I noted there were taxis parked from one end of the street to the other.</P>
        <P>There is another notion I would also like to put to bed.  In my constituency, as in most rural towns, there is only one nightclub and as such no issue arises in regard to people spilling out on to the street at the same time.  The Minister of State might correct me or clarify for me the following point.  When this issue was being debated by the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party I recall the current Minister stating that he had been informed in discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Commissioner level, that this issue was not a matter of concern for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Apparently, in areas where there are three or four nightclubs people are staggering from one to the other.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I may be wrong on this and the Minister of State can correct me if I am.  While I believed this issue was of concern to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister stated that in discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Commissioner level he was informed that the staggering of closing times in the context of crowd control was not an issue of concern for the Garda.  I would have thought that where there are five or six nightclubs in one area it would be helpful if they closed at different times, say, from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. as this would make it easier for people to get taxis home and would assist the Garda from a public order perspective.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister but I was taken aback that his advice from top ranking Garda is that this is not the case.  I would like if this matter could be put to bed once and for all.  If that is the advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then the Minister should heed it.  However, I accept I may have misunderstood the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Regan for tabling this amendment.  I reiterate the point that the Minister has indicated his intention to provide in the autumn a licensing permit system for nightclubs.  The detail of the proposal, which contains some good ideas, could be incorporated into that legislation.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that the Government cannot accept amendments that would have the effect of permitting nightclubs to remain open until 4 a.m.  This deals by extension with Senator Bacik&rsquo;s desire to dance all night.  The Senator will have to dance at home or some other place as she will not be permitted to do so in a nightclub.</P><Col N="955"/>
        <P>It is important people understand that the Government intends to continue with the existing regime which provides for a closing time of 2.30 a.m. followed by a half hour drinking up period.  I cannot accept the amendment tabled by Senator Alex White which proposes longer opening hours for nightclubs as provided for in Germany or on the continent.  There is no strong evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current situation in England and Wales provides a salutary lesson to those who would liberalise the licensing laws in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour and public disorder on the streets.  In late 2005, when longer opening hours were introduced in the UK, British Ministers argued that the aim of this was to reduce the disorder caused when everyone emerged from licensed premises at the same time.  </P>
        <P>A research report issued by the Home Office earlier this year reported that there was no clear evidence to date that positive benefit had accrued from staggered or better managed closing times.  There were no clear signs that the abolition of a standard closing time had significantly reduced problems of crime and disorder.  While there were some signs that crimes involving serious violence may have fallen, the overall volume or incidence of crime and disorder remained unchanged and there was evidence of what can be described as temporary displacement in that the number of violent crimes that occurred in the small hours of the morning had grown.</P>
        <P>Bearing this in mind and, following advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government believes the effect of postponed or delayed closure in terms of nightclubs and drinking generally is only in public order and policing terms to postpone the phenomenon to a later time.  There is no defined or clear benefit in having staggered or prolonged closing times.  For this reason and others, the Government has chosen to stick with the existing regime and to not provide for a 4 a.m. closing time.  I believe this is sensible.</P>
        <P>There is no point extending opening hours unless behaviour changes, as is clear from the experience in the UK generally and in particular from the local authority associations there who have undertaken surveys in this regard.  A point of difference between ourselves and people on continental Europe, which is of regret, is our binge drinking habits which we share with our nearest neighbours in the UK.  I lived on the continent and I never witnessed there the Irish and British phenomenon of drinking at speed in concentrated periods and resultant public disorder.  I have not witnessed there such behaviour to any great extent.</P>
        <P>I lived in eastern Europe and was quite amazed to see large numbers of young people going in and out of nightclubs late at night and very little public order or anti-social behaviour occurring.  There is definitely a phenomenon in this regard in Britain and Ireland.  There is no point pretending otherwise.  We all aspire to experiencing here that which we experience while on holiday on the continent and so on in terms of public order on the streets.  I was amazed at the behaviour of young people on the continent either on the streets late at night or during the day time.</P>
        <P>I was lucky enough to be in the Slovak capital during its accession to the EU.  There were thousands of people packed into the main town square, many of whom were drinking, yet there was not even a hint of anti-social behaviour or disorder.  Also, there was not a huge police presence.  The phenomenon of binge drinking in Britain and Ireland needs to be addressed be it by way of curtailed opening hours or a change in behaviour.  There is no clear answer to this problem.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="956"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s selective quote in regard to sequential closing times and its impact on public order.  It is a self-evident proposition which cuts across any of the statements we have heard from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on this issue.  It is in contradiction to the practice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in co-operation with the nightclub in respect of sequential closing times.  I do not know from where the Minister of State got his information.</P>
        <P>The objective of the Bill is to ensure public order.  I am making the case that to have all late night premises closing at the same time is detrimental to policing and controlled situations late at night in our cities.  This will impact on tourism, the entertainment industry, music industry and, social life in urban areas and in Dublin in particular.</P>
        <P>The issue of people spilling out on to the streets at the same time and the availability of taxis and late night buses and so on has been raised.  If we are going to control the supply of alcohol in this crude fashion to adults who are simply enjoying a social occasion, we might as well revert to closing pubs on St. Stephen&rsquo;s day and other days.  This is crude legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment and I hold to it.  The terms of the amendment provide for a controlled and supervised situation for social drinking and entertainment.  It is a reasonable proposition and one which properly regulates the licensing system for nightclubs, which is one of the objectives set out by the Minister when introducing the Bill in the Lower House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response was unconvincing.  The premise on which it was based was that those who advocated lengthier opening hours for nightclubs in England and Wales had done so on the basis that it would reduce social disorder arising from drinking but when social disorder was found not to have been reduced, the plan had failed.  Sequential opening is only one aspect of this, although an important one.  It is amusing to some extent and we can talk about dancing till dawn and so on, but as legislators we have a serious responsibility.  If adults wish to go out and have a good time in our cities and towns, it is not any part of our job to stop them doing so unless a compelling case is put forward that it causes harm to others.  To me that is a basic premise.  The proposal that opening hours for nightclubs should be more liberal is not being introduced as a public order measure but as a sensible suggestion in the interest of citizens of the State who wish to go out and have a good time, whether it is dancing until dawn or otherwise, having a late drink or meeting friends.</P>
        <P>If there is a compelling argument that later opening hours are a risk to public order, of course we must consider it very carefully.  The wish of people to stay out late drinking in nightclubs could be overridden by an argument that it would undermine public order.  I accept that premise.  However, no argument made by the Minister convinces me that it has that effect.  In fact, the outcome of the analysis in England and Wales was that whatever level of disorder that had existed prior to the extension of opening hours remained.  It appears it had a neutral, not a detrimental effect on public order.  A good legislator would say that if the measure does not have a detrimental effect and if there are other positive reasons to support it, it should be implemented.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk about what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wants.  Of course the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will listen carefully to its advice.  However, the Garda does not run the country.  It is there to perform a service for citizens of the State.  One of the things I have heard over the last few days is that some members of the Garda are saying they want closing time to be at 2.30 a.m. for everybody because it is consistent with their shift pattern.  They want to get everything wrapped up and sorted out by 3 a.m. so they can clear off out of town.  It would be unacceptable if this decision were to be made based on the shift pattern of the Garda.  If there is a compelling public order argument against later hours, we must all listen <Col N="957"/>to it.  However, if, as in the case of England and Wales, the measure has a neutral effect, then it is not detrimental.</P>

	<P>As Senator White has said, this amendment is not just about public order but about public policy, and not just public policy as it relates to the consumption of intoxicating liquor but as it relates to socialising and social culture generally.  Thus, it has a considerable impact.  I may have sounded frivolous earlier when I mentioned dancing and so on, but it is a serious matter.  In order to be serious, we must take into account that it is about more than just alcohol consumption.  It is about the culture we wish to see prevail in our urban centres.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made some points about public order.  The concern in England and Wales, as I understood it, was that the trouble was simply being deferred and that similar public order issues were occurring at a later hour.  That is targeted in my own amendment, No. 9, which is similar to this one.  The amendment allows some flexibility in that a court may specify that particular places close at different times, including earlier than 4 a.m.  Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that all venues would be closing at the same time, which would lead to the problems identified earlier.  We are all suggesting that there be some system allowing sequential or differential opening hours for different venues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not spoken on this aspect of the discussion before, but I believe there is a real effort in Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment, No. 12<i>a</i>, to face up to a problem which the Minister believes is creating public disorder.  The Minister, when introducing the Bill, mentioned that one of its objectives was to reduce public disorder.  There is a real danger that this legislation, without Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment, will impinge on citizen&rsquo;s rights.  In addition, it will certainly affect tourism.  If we make Ireland an unattractive country to visit &mdash; the accusation of nanny state may well apply &mdash; fewer people will come here.  It is difficult to defend.</P>
        <P>A couple of years ago my wife and I were in Salt Lake City, Utah.  We were invited out to dinner in a restaurant and when asked what we would like to drink, I said I would have a glass of white wine while my wife said she would have red wine.  However, our host said that would present a problem as there was a law in the city that two bottles of wine could not be on the table at the same time.  I had to give way and have red wine instead of white wine.  This is an instance of legislation that intruded on citizens&rsquo; rights.  The words &ldquo;nanny state&rdquo; may apply.  It may well have been that when the legislation was introduced there was an objective behind it.  The Minister&rsquo;s objective here is to avoid public disorder and I believe Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment is an effort to achieve that.  I do not think the Minister of State has made the case that the amendment should not be accepted.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also important to remember that many people in Ireland go out drinking not just to have a good time but to get drunk.  This is the difference between the continental environment for alcohol and the environment in Britain and Ireland.  Senator White tried to suggest that the example I cited from Britain is neutral but it is anything but.  The view of the British Home Office on this is definitive as it refers to already unacceptable levels of anti-social behaviour and irresponsible use of alcohol that have not been changed by later drinking times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

	<P>He does not accept the good faith of people on this side of the House.  When people on this side of the House make an argument on the legislation that he does not like he puts it down to not being serious about controlling alcohol abuse.  This is not acceptable from a Minister of State.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to the survey by the British Home Office because it is interesting.  It notes evidence from countries that have moved from strict opening hours to a more relaxed regime, such as Australia, New Zealand, Scotland and Iceland, and the experience has been that liberalised regimes tend to result in higher levels of alcohol consumption and more alcohol related problems of crime and disorder.  A more recent survey carried out in England and Wales for the Local Government Association reported increases in alcohol related incidents.  For example, half of all police authorities said that longer opening hours simply resulted in incidents occurring later at night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government introduced longer opening hours.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="959"/>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The survey of police forces indicated that crimes committed between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. were up by 22%.  Meanwhile, three quarters of health authorities surveyed reported increases in spending as a result of a rise in accident and emergency department admissions between those times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government introduced longer opening hours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is why I cannot accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s suggestion that we should keep these nightclubs open until 4 a.m.  The Government has decided that they should close at 3 a.m. and, unfortunately, this means Senator Bacik cannot dance all night in a nightclub.</P>
        <P>There is a serious issue in the relationship we have with alcohol.  I would love if our relationship with it were similar to that on the continent, where people can dance all night, do not bump into one another, cause fights and have problems with the law.  Unfortunately, in Britain and Ireland the experience has been the opposite to that on the continent.  In Britain and Ireland, the longer the opening hours and the greater the availability of alcohol the more it is likely there will be public order problems of a serious nature.  This is the problem we are trying to address here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Government allow pubs to stay open until 2.30 a.m.?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is the first instalment of serious new legislative measures to curtail the public disorder associated with alcohol.  All governments, including this one, will have to address this issue.  </P>
        <P>I do not see how tourists can find it attractive to come to Ireland and see people falling out of pubs drunk, getting into fights and having problems with the police.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is pathetic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know of any evidence to suggest tourists come to Ireland to drink at 4 a.m.  Figures show that most tourists who come to Ireland are low imbibers of alcohol who tend to be rather more sedentary than the locals regarding drinking practices and nightclub attendance.  The surveys from tourist authorities show little demand from tourists for the all-night dancing and drinking experiences that are being urged here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s logic is that closing all late-night drinking establishments will curtail excessive drinking, anti-social behaviour and curb demand for alcohol.  We have found in the past that this does not work.  This is a killjoy Bill and I am disappointed the Minister of State continues to talk about the general problem without addressing the specific proposal being made here.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Section 12 of the Act of 2003;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to a section providing that there should be no entertainment during drinking-up time.  The proposal is to include it as one of the sections to be deleted.  It is a somewhat outdated provision and perhaps, as a tidying-up exercise, this can be accommodated by the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not outdated in the literal sense, in that it was introduced in 2003.  I do not wish to pun, but this is not to be and I cannot accept the amendment.  It seeks to repeal section 12 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which prohibits entertainment during the 30-minute period of drinking-up time following normal closing time and special exemption orders.  Section 12 of the 2003 Act was enacted to give effect to a specific recommendation of the Commission on Liquor Licensing&rsquo;s final report, namely, that entertainment be expressly prohibited during drinking-up time.  The commission pointed out that the purpose of drinking-up time, which originally was ten minutes under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 but which was increased to 30 minutes in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1998, was to facilitate a gradual and orderly departure of customers from a premises during that period.  However, the continuation of entertainment during this period had the opposite effect as customers were reluctant to leave while the entertainment continued.  This resulted in customers leaving together on expiry of the 30-minute period, thereby increasing the risk of disturbance and disorder on the streets outside.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;5.&mdash;Where the District Court for a particular district is exercising a discretion concerning the grant of a licence permitting the consumption of intoxicating liquor on particular premises, the Court shall exercise its discretion in such a way as to avoid the closing of a significant number of premises in a particular locality at the same time on the same day or days.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that all nightclubs do not disgorge their customers onto the streets at the same time.  Many Members have received e-mails from the industry pointing out the worrying consequences of such an action.  People will be queuing for taxis and possibly arguing over them.  I am unsure whether the Minister of State has ever been at the top of a taxi queue when people, who perhaps have consumed too much alcohol, come along and claim to need to get home quicker.  It is a recipe for disaster.  The potential for trouble as a result of putting everyone out onto the streets cannot be ignored.  As Members have received warnings from the industry on the consequences of this clause, I have tabled this amendment to allow the District Court some flexibility on the issue in order that licences may be obtained whereby people can leave at different stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s amendment as this appears to be an eminently reasonable proposal that is in the interests of the public.  It now is at least six or seven years since I raised this subject in the aftermath of disturbances on O&rsquo;Connell Street arising from the practice of a now-defunct nightclub to shovel people out at the same time as pubs.  This frequently led to antagonism between the different groups and was a serious problem.  As for the point made by Senator Hannigan on the question of transport availability, particularly in respect of taxis and so on, it does not seem logical to push everyone out at exactly the same time because they will compete in a limited market for the aforementioned resources and tempers may become frayed.  This appears to be an eminently sensible suggestion that I am content to support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While this issue already has been debated at some length during the discussion on amendment No. 12<i>a</i>, I also support this amendment because it is important to have a system of sequential closing.  Clearly, this would address the problems associated with the current system in which large numbers of people are disgorged onto the streets at the same time.  However, a more comprehensive reform is required and it is unfortunate that the Minister of State has indicated his opposition to amendment No. 12<i>a</i>, which would introduce nightclub licences and would amount to a more comprehensive reform.  Nevertheless, this is an important measure because it would allow flexibility in the times at which different venues close.  While I am attempting to do something similar with amendment No. 9, this amendment deserves support for the reasons already described.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment for the same reasons.  The problem lies with the rigid rule of closure at 2.30 a.m. or 1.30 a.m. on Sundays and this amendment seeks <Col N="962"/>to address it.  While the parameter of discretion ideally should be laid down in the Bill, the rigid rule creates a problem in this regard.  I support the amendment, which pertains to the issue that Members have sought to impress on the Minister of State, namely, the importance of sequential closing.  The Minister of State does not accept the logic of this argument for some curious reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek clarification from the Minister of State on a point I raised earlier regarding sequential closing times.  Whatever the case may be in Wales, England or Scotland, has the Garda made a submission, either orally or in writing, that there is a problem from the perspective of policing or monitoring people coming onto the streets at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.?  I understand, from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that senior garda&iacute; have stated it is not an issue.</P>
        <P>I also find it hard to believe another point.  If a nightclub closes at 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m., I fail to discern the reason there also would be a problem with people spilling onto the streets from pubs, which I understand close much earlier.  Although I do not have a problem with nightclubs, I have heard its lobby expressing its concern in this regard.  Most nightclub owners, when their premises&rsquo; doors are closed, are not one bit concerned about where people go or what happens out on the street.  Let us be real.  That is my strongly held view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We are concerned.  We are not speaking for the nightclub industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There seems to be a textual confusion in this amendment.  It is difficult to make sense of.  It refers to the District Court exercising discretion in granting licences and the need to avoid closing a significant number of premises in a particular locality at the same time on the same day or days.  In fact, the District Court does not grant licences.  The key point here is that the timing issue is dealt with by legislation and the law, and the court then issues the licence.  I will not accept this amendment because of its confusion.  I suspect whoever drafted this had some confusion in his or her mind.  He or she seems to have mixed the concepts of the District Court as a licensor and special exemption orders, which are a different phenomenon.  I suspect this amendment seeks to look at the issue of special exemption orders but, unfortunately, the drafting of it refers to the District Court, implying the District Court has a discretion or power in this area which it does not.  That is the only reason I do not accept it.  Obviously, there is the broader philosophical issue we dealt with earlier.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">As was mentioned by one of the speakers, we are not in favour of the staggered regime.  To answer Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s point, we are not convinced from the available international evidence from Scotland, New Zealand, Northern Ireland and elsewhere, that there is a material difference.  There is no reduction in crime or anti-social behaviour.  All that happens with staggered closing hours in the countries which most relate to our own experience of binge drinking and such phenomena is that the problem is just pushed on later into the night or early morning.  There is no indication from the most approximate jurisdictions to our own that the existence of staggered hours solves the problem.</P>
        <P>In philosophic terms I cannot accept the amendment, but I only reject it on the basis that it is textually confused on the operation of the District Court as a licence giver, but not an institution that sets the times of openings.  There seems to be confusion between the special exemption orders issue and the competence of the District Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry if the Minister of State is confused by the issue.  The spirit of the amendment is clear.  I could not accept what was said by one of the Senators on the Government side on what happens at the closing of pubs.  When people leave pubs they <Col N="963"/>have a choice &mdash; to go home or to go to a nightclub &mdash; and there is not this funnelling of people into one area.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has seen studies done elsewhere.  We are shutting off the availability of somewhere to go and suddenly all those people who are out on the town come together to find transport home.  There is no facility for that demand to be spread out over several hours, which there would be with staggered opening hours.  I accept that people will consume too much alcohol in some instances and it is difficult to legislate for that.  What we can do with staggered opening hours is at least ensure that we reduce the number of flash points on the streets.

	<P>I move amendment No. 4<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;6.&mdash;Section 4 (as amended by section 10 of the Act of 1960) of the Act of 1927 is amended:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) in subsection (3), by the insertion of the words &ldquo;Subject to subsection (11)&rdquo; at the beginning of that subsection;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) by the insertion of a new subsection (10A) as follows: &ldquo;(10A) It shall not be lawful for the holder of a general exemption order to sell intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises during the period of exemption.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an amendment concerning early houses.  It is in the context of the debate on not discontinuing the licences for early house pubs.  It is appropriate, in view of the concern for public order, that there would be no off-licence sales from early houses.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  It is in the spirit of addressing the issue of public order and drinking that can give rise to public disorder.  It deals specifically with the off-licence sales from early houses.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Regan for this amendment, but it is not necessary since the content is already covered in section 4(1)(<i>d</i>), which prohibits off-sales during any period covered by a general exemption order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the amendment was adopted in the context of the review in the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;6.&mdash;At the Court hearing in respect of any licensing application under the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2008, any Garda Officer, not below the rank of Sergeant, may appear and shall be heard in court in relation to such application, whether or not such application relates to premises within that Officer&rsquo;s district.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This concerns the arrangement of licensing in the District Court.  We have moved responsibility for certain licences from the Revenue Commissioners to the District Courts.  There are references in the licensing Acts to the Garda superintendents being in a position to object to an application for a licence.</P><Col N="964"/>
        <P>At times there is an extraordinary level of Garda resources taken up in courts with licence applications, even because the Garda must be from the district in which the premises, in respect of which a licence is being sought, is situated.  In one case in the District Court one morning there were five inspectors, 15 sergeants and other garda&iacute; in the licensing court.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that there can be a Garda officer who is designated to deal with all licence applications.  In many cases there are Garda inspectors and sergeants present who simply must state that they do not object to a licence applications.  It seems an extraordinary waste of Garda resources.</P>
        <P>No doubt the Garda assign these officers to the courts to deal with licence applications in compliance with the requirements of the legislation and the regulations.  In ease of their responsibilities and duties, it behoves us to provide a legislative framework that makes their job easier.  I commend the amendment to the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the general thrust of Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  If situations arise in the District Court where there may be a number of, or a couple of dozen, garda&iacute; hanging around waiting to give evidence, that is not a proper management and use of manpower.  It seems wasteful.</P>
        <P>However, I would put in a caveat, that those persons present in court to present such evidence should be properly briefed.  Sometimes it astonishes me, in looking at the way in which the District Court operates, that often there is no objection, not because there is nothing objectionable about the premises but because they have not bothered to find out.  Where the garda might be asked is there an objection, he or she answers &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but actually does not know whether there is.  That situation might be made worse if the garda is from a completely different district, unless he or she is properly briefed and in possession of the correct information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Probably the next amendment, which is in my name, addresses this situation.  However, I have that worry.  I accept that it is wasteful to have large numbers of garda&iacute; hanging around just to make a formal acknowledgement, but it is not appropriate that they should be there in the absence of being able to contribute something substantial to the understanding of the matter before the court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Regan for coming up with this amendment.  While I appreciate the reasons behind this amendment, the Department would need some time to discuss its implications with the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Garda has already moved towards this idea in operational terms.  Recommendation 31 of the advisory group on alcohol suggests that there should be a garda assigned to licensing matters in each Garda area.  This is being discussed with the Garda Commissioner.  I suggest that we return to this issue in the context of the sale of alcohol Bill later in the year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I reassure Senator Norris on the issue of garda&iacute; being properly briefed.  The purpose of the recommendation of the advisory board is to ensure a knowledgeable officer of the Garda deals with licensing matters as routine.  It also ensures there is no duplication or officers &mdash; as Senator Regan stated &mdash; marching in and out of the courts sometimes not fully briefed on the case or not fully on top of matters.  This is why we must move to a position where someone is assigned responsibility to collate the information and deal with these matters.  I agree with Senator Norris that it is important that whoever is in court knows the background, history, feelings of people in the area, troubles and the difficulties generated when it comes to licensing issues.  I do not know if this will allow Senator Regan to withdraw his amendment, but the matter is being dealt with in the context of the sale of alcohol Bill. <Col N="965"/> Our preference is that it be dealt with as an operational matter for the Garda, rather than through legislation although both could be recommended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that it should be dealt with in this Bill.  The fact is we are transferring further responsibilities to the District Court.  I will press the amendment.</P>

I compliment the Minister of State on the ingenuity and variety of his methods of evading or avoiding accepting amendments.  It is a remarkable intellectual exercise and I regret that I will not be here for the entire afternoon to appreciate the full repertoire of the Minister of State's manoeuvres.  However, I am an admirer and I wish to put this on the record of the House.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, subsection (3), line 17, after &ldquo;evidence.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;The Superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must present to the Court a document certifying whether the premises has been appropriately and properly managed and supervised during the preceding year.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="966"/>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to address the position I referred to just a few minutes ago, where the court has inadequate or no information at all about the behaviour of the people running these premises in the preceding year.  To a certain extent I am inspired to table this amendment from reading what Professor Keane stated about the responsibilities of senior consultants within the health service.  He pointed out that in Canada, it is a requirement of a senior consultant in hospitals to issue a certificate every year of competence to all those medical personnel underneath the consultant.  This avoids, as much as possible, botched operations and diagnoses.</P>
        <P>I have attended court on a number of occasions where applications for licences have simply been rubber-stamped.  There is no other possible description of it.  When I mentioned this before, a large number of people, including solicitors, came to me and told me I was perfectly right.  They had attended court on such occasions.  This is not appropriate.</P>
        <P>If we are to grant licences on the basis of the good character and responsible behaviour of the proprietors, we must have some evidence.  It is not sufficient for a judge to rubber-stamp a string of these applications without the slightest inquiry.  I have seen cases where there were serious questions about the way in which licensed premises, in particular, were being run and yet the applications went through on the nod.</P>
        <P>A requirement to produce a certificate is not very onerous but would assist in the proper running of premises.  It should be a minimal requirement as otherwise judges will simply issue licences without any knowledge of the behaviour of the people behind the applications.  This will happen unless the application becomes so scandalous that it appears in the newspapers or other media and the judge becomes aware of it through these channels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment, which is in keeping with the spirit of the legislation in its positive sense.  It seeks to achieve a proper regulation of premises selling alcohol, which is what we are all seeking to do.  We may disagree on how best that regulation would be achieved and the particular issues around restrictions, opening times and so on.  We are all in favour of proper regulation to avoid the problems associated with alcohol abuse and public disorder.  The amendment is in keeping with that spirit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the intention of Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment.  Section 7 deals with applications for new off-licences and subsection (3) gives the Garda and local residents the opportunity to object on any ground set out in subsection (1) to the granting of the required District Court certificate.  These grounds include that an off-licence would be unsuitable for the area or that there are already sufficient off-licences in the area.</P>
        <P>Since these are applications for new licences and not renewals of existing licences, the Garda superintendent is not in a position to present a document certifying that the premises have been properly managed and supervised during the preceding year.  The matter raised in this amendment could be considered in the context of licence renewal, which will be dealt with the forthcoming sale of alcohol Bill.  I agree with Senator Norris in this respect as there is a distinct problem of judges not having the requisite knowledge or information about the character of the individual behind a particular licence application and what has been the previous experience of management of a particular premises.  However, this applies to renewals rather than <i>de novo</i> applications for off-licences.  I remind the Senator that this measure operates in two ways in so far as courts are sometimes influenced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, even though the company and directors of premises may have changed.  I have dealt directly with a case in my constituency in which new directors who were reforming the operation of the premises were stuck with the reputation of the previous company directors who had misrun the premises.  I agree with the <Col N="967"/>spirit of the amendment, which could be incorporated in some fashion in the sale of alcohol Bill in the autumn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State who is correct on this matter.  However, part of the reason is that the legislation has been rushed into the House.  I am pleased he has accepted the idea behind the amendment and look forward to its inclusion in the sale of alcohol Bill later in the year. </P>
        <P>I will amplify a point made by the Minister of State.  Sometimes, even in a new premises, the person making the application is, to use an unfortunate phrase, known to the Garda and others as a person who is completely unsuitable.  In such circumstances, it would be particularly appropriate to hear evidence from the police.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said various sections of the Bill provide an opportunity to the public or authorities to object on various grounds.  We must go further and make this a requirement because these grounds are sometimes not as clear as they should be or are ideologically driven.  I volunteered to join the north inner city policing committee.  There is no advantage to doing this but I believe in taking a responsibility for my area.  One of the matters that arose at a meeting of the committee, at which the assistant city manager and various officials were present, was the question of the licensing of new off-licences and the proliferation of licences for corner shops, supermarkets and so forth.  The committee requested a report on this issue.  When we received it we found it was ideologically driven and the only principle it respected was that of competition.  The welfare of the citizens of the surrounding area was of no consequence.  I forced the withdrawal of the report because the people within our city authorities were observing what they considered to be an ideological requirement.  As the Government is in favour of competition, when considering granting licences and planning issues they focus exclusively on competition rather than the well-being of the surrounding area.  This was a dreadful approach.  Some tests of character are important and should be taken into account.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and I will await the publication of the sale of alcohol Bill in the autumn.  I hope he or his colleagues will ensure the proposal in my amendment is included in the legislation.  I thank him for his interesting statement in this matter.</P>
        <P>Owing to other commitments, I regret I will not be present for discussion of a later amendment.  However, I understand Senator Bacik has agreed to move an amendment on the labelling of containers.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach will permit that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete lines 17 to 49 and in page 8, to delete lines 1 to 4 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<i>(a)</i> not later than 6 months after section 8 of this Act is commenced, the Minister shall lay before each House appropriate regulations for the structural separation for the sale of intoxicating liquor,</P><Col N="968"/>
        <P LI="2"><i>(b)</i> such regulations shall be approved by each House and shall come into force not later than the first anniversary of such approval,</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(c)</i> the Minister shall, prior to laying of the above regulations before each House of the Oireachtas, consult with representatives of the industry to facilitate the practical implementation of the above regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the structural separation for the sale of intoxicating liquor in mixed trading establishments or premises.  It proposes that rather than make provision in the Bill for specific measures to be put in place without adequate consultation with the industry, the relevant regulations would be adopted by the Minister, following consultations, six months after the adoption of the Act.  This is an alternative to rushing through a measure which could have unintended consequences and impose a burden on the retail sector that is disproportionate to the objective sought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume this amendment was intended to propose that structural separation would be implemented by means of regulations tabled by the Minister following consultation with relevant interests and that any such regulations would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before entering into force.  This is not what the amendment proposes.  By not proposing the repeal of lines 14 to 16, inclusive, on page 7, the proposed new text of sub-paragraphs <i>(a), (b) </i>and <i>(c)</i> remain subject to the introductory text.  In short, the amendment does not make sense.  The Minister has commented on the possibility of implementing a code of practice as an alternative to the structural separation.  That remains his intention. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment in the knowledge that if more time had been available for consideration of the Bill, it would have been preferable to have included Senator Regan&rsquo;s proposal in the legislation.  However, following a meeting with retailers who are concerned about the provisions on structural separation, the Minister agreed not to commence the section pending the introduction of a code of practice by retailers.  Senator Regan is correct that it would be preferable to have included his proposal.  Nevertheless, the Minister has paid attention to the concerns of the trade.  The cost of imposing the provisions would have been prohibitive.  I am not sure if the figure of &euro;200 million is correct but it is outrageous that we would consider imposing such costs.  The Minister has listened and his proposal appears to be acceptable.  I remain concerned, however, and would prefer if Senator Regan&rsquo;s proposal was accepted. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment and concur with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments.  In essence, Senator Regan seeks to do what the Minister has promised to do in any case.  It is another unfortunate consequence of the decision to rush through the legislation that the Government&rsquo;s amendment does not reflect the reality of what the Minister has agreed, whereas Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment, which I presume will not be accepted, is more reflective of that reality. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot express the matter better than Senator Bacik has done.  The amendment makes perfect sense and it is evident what it intends to do.  It is reasonable to address technical matters of this nature in the form of delegated legislation whereby the Minister would adopt regulations.  That is the intention behind my amendment, which I do not propose to press. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<i>(a)</i> any premises the subject of an exemption granted under section 3A (as inserted by <i>section 10 </i>of the <i>Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008</i>).&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I move the amendment on behalf of my colleague, Senator Alex White.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 7 suggests an exemption from the structural separation provisions in the case of premises at which specialist tobacco and alcohol products are sold.  It is almost farcical that the structural separation provisions should apply to establishments of this nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I cannot accept these amendments, which seek an exemption from structural separation requirements for special tobacconists.  The only special tobacconist with which I am familiar is J. J. Fox Limited, opposite Trinity College.  The first difficulty is that the proposed new section, despite its length, does not contain a definition as to what constitutes a specialist tobacconist.  Although it states that such an individual is a person who sells specialist tobacco and alcohol products, questions still arise as to what are such products and how they differ from products on the shelves of ordinary off-licences or up-market supermarkets.  I cannot see the difference.</P>
        <P>The extent to which a provision along the lines of the proposed new section is required is not clear.  The Department received one submission in respect of a possible future development.  Wine is already exempted from the structural separation provisions.  It would only be necessary, therefore, to display spirits behind the counter in such specialist outlets and sell them from there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know whether alcohol is sold at J. J. Fox Limited, opposite Trinity College.  Regardless of whether it sells expensive Cuban cigars or cognac I also do not know whether setting establishments of this nature apart would set a good precedent, particularly in the context of what we are trying to achieve, namely, to control the display of alcohol products.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is clear and suggests that the structural separation provisions should not apply to premises that sell specialist tobacco and alcohol products.  The introduction of a code of conduct is being examined.  If the Minister of State will indicate that this matter could be considered in that context, I will not be inclined to press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from the absence of any criteria to distinguish specialist outlets from non-specialist ones, another problem arises.  While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has general responsibility for the licensing laws, he or she has no direct involvement in granting of licences or the application of those laws.  These are matters for the courts and the Garda.  It would not be appropriate to give the Minister a direct role in such matters.</P>
        <P>This is another of those issues that can be teased out when, and if, the industry draws up a code of practice.  One would not like a situation to arise where the specific requirements of one of the retailers in question might be upset due to the uniqueness of the products he or she sells.  However, we cannot differentiate between the treatment of ordinary off-licences and specialist establishments.  That would not be fair.  I do not wish to be trite but if we made <Col N="970"/>exceptions for people who purchase expensive Cuban cigars or wonderful cognacs of one kind or another, we would probably be accused of being somewhat elitist.  We will consider the matter in the broader context of the Bill.</P>

	<P>It is unfortunate that the legislation is being rushed in this way.  The confusion surrounding the grouping of amendments and the way in which the procedure relating to them has been operated is most unfortunate.  We would have liked more time in which to deal with these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the arrangements for discussing the amendments agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, lines 4 and 5, to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) by substituting the following subsection for subsection (5):</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;A special exemption order shall expire not earlier than 2.30 a.m. on any day of the week unless the Court, for stated reasons including reasons related to maintaining public order, considers it expedient to grant the order for a shorter period.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an amendment to section 10.  The latter amends section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which inserted a new section 5 into the Act of 1927.  There is already, therefore, a compendium of different provisions in place.  The effect of existing legislation is that those who hold theatre licences are exempted from the closing times other licensed premises may apply for by way of special exemption orders.</P>
        <P>The entire premise of this system is flawed.  The fact that late bars must apply for special exemption orders in order to open is problematic.  I hope that matter will be addressed in the autumn.  I also hope that a specific nightclub licence will be introduced.  The latter would <Col N="971"/>remove the need to employ archaic measures such as theatre licences or provisions which do not suit the reality of the situation.</P>
        <P>Everyone wants comprehensive reform.  The Minister of State has repeated a mantra in respect of various matters to the effect that he will &ldquo;be looking at this in the autumn&rdquo;.  He also stated that changes will be introduced by means of the sale of alcohol Bill.  That is really a way of rejecting many of the amendments tabled.  Unfortunately, this means that an interim system will be in place during the summer months whereby different closing hours will obtain.  It appears that some of the restrictions that will be in place during the summer will, perhaps, be removed in the autumn.</P>
        <P>Due to the fact that this is an interim Bill, I seek to make an interim amendment that will resolve the situation whereby there will be an unnecessary restriction in place during the summer to the effect that all those establishments, be they bars or clubs, with special exemption orders will be obliged to close at 1 a.m. on Mondays.  The impact of the provisions in section 10, particularly those in paragraph (<i>c</i>), will be that all licensed premises with special exemption orders, be they bars or clubs, will be obliged to close at 2.30 a.m. every day other than on Mondays, when they must close at 1 a.m.</P>
        <P>I take exception to the idea that Sunday nights are different for everybody.  They are certainly different for those of us who work nine to five, Monday to Friday.  Obviously, Members do not work nine to five and they often work very different hours.  However, there are those who work shifts and people in the services sector and the entertainment industry for whom Sunday night is their night off because it is a quiet time for everyone else.  If people wish to remain out beyond 1 a.m., I do not see where the problem arises.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, I have been lobbied by nightclub industry representatives.  However, I do not hold a brief for them.  This issue does not merely relate to the industry, it is much broader than that.  We have all been lobbied and contacted by ordinary punters who, as consumers, wish to be able to go out at night.  I do not understand why people feel there is a need to curtail their enjoyment at 1 a.m. each Monday.</P>
        <P>The term &ldquo;nanny state&rdquo; is overused.  However, this is an overly paternalistic measure.  It is like the measures we had in the past, such as the holy hour.  It will not do any good in terms of preventing alcohol abuse or public disorder.  It is an unnecessary measure to make this distinction between Sunday night and other nights.  Will the Minister of State consider accepting either my amendment or Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment No. 8<i>a</i> which would have the same effect in terms of restoring 2.30 a.m. as the potential closing time for special exemption orders on a Sunday night?</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 9 has a different effect.  Essentially, I seek to build on the special exemption orders by permitting the District Court where a application is made to it by a licensed premises to permit it, having considered all the reasons offered, including reasons relating to maintaining public order, to grant a special extension of time within which alcohol may be served beyond the time for which the special exemption order applies.</P>
        <P>It is very similar to the amendment Senator Hannigan tabled, amendment No. 4, in which he sought to ensure that the court could exercise discretion to avoid all premises in an area closing at a particular time.  What I hope to do here, in somewhat more elegant drafting, is to achieve the same objective, that is, to achieve a sequential closing time and to allow flexibility for the court but within the parameters of the existing special exemption orders.</P>
        <P>I seek to amend section 10 to insert a new subsection (<i>e</i>) which would allow a court to grant a special extension of time up to two hours beyond the expiry of a special exemption order.  This would permit places to close up to 4.30 a.m.  However, it gives flexibility to the court to make the time shorter and it builds in, as I have done with amendment No. 8, a provision that <Col N="972"/>the court may look at reasons relating to maintaining public order.  It is a reasonable approach and I ask the Minister of State to take it on board if not now, then in the autumn.  However, I would very much like him to take it on board now because I do not see why we should have an interim arrangement over the summer which will restrict closing hours, particularly on a Sunday night, with the promise of something else in the autumn.</P>
        <P>I will press these important amendments.  I do not see any rationale not to accept them even in terms of the Minister&rsquo;s stated intentions in regard to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s views, particularly in regard to amendment No. 9.  The objective is to give the power to the court to extend a licence on occasion.  We already had the discussion about premises closing at the same time.  What will happen if the amendment is not accepted appears heavy-handed.  The amendment is worthy of support because of the case Senator Bacik made and I urge the Minister of State to accept it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment.  Amendment No. 8<i>a</i> has exactly the same effect and relates to early closing on Sunday night.  That is another killjoy provision which is inappropriate.  The point about sequential closing has been made before and the amendment is a very eloquent way to deal with the issue.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>Before the general election, Senator Regan&rsquo;s party leader was very keen to invoke the Judeo-Christian tradition as one of the bases for the development of Irish life and society in the future.

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on extending the period within which opening can occur to 2.30 a.m.  We cannot accede to that amendment.</P>
        <P>We also have a problem with Senator Bacik&rsquo;s suggestion that we give a two-hour supplement to special exemption orders.  Again, it goes back to the philosophical standpoint of this Bill.  We are not in favour of extending hours generally.</P>
        <P>When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights submitted the report on which much of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2000 was based, it noted that Sunday was a day which, unlike the other weekend nights, precedes a day of work for most people.  In the circumstances, the committee was inclined to recommend that no special exemption order be granted for Sunday night-Monday morning.  The Government subsequently decided to permit such orders on Sunday nights but not beyond 1 a.m. on Monday morning.  While I admit much has changed since 2000, I am not convinced the time has come to extend that deadline to 2.30 a.m.  We know absenteeism from work is already a problem and my fear is that longer opening hours on Sunday night could add further to the problem.</P>
        <P>Consultation with the social partners would be necessary before any such change could be contemplated.  I am not referring here to employers&rsquo; organisations only.  The organisations <Col N="973"/>representing those who already work long hours in the bar trade and wider entertainment sector would also need to be consulted.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik&rsquo;s other amendment is for an additional two-hour exemption to be added on to certain special exemption orders.  In short, special exemption orders could be sought until 4.30 a.m. on weekdays and 3 a.m. on Sunday night-Monday morning.  According to the amendment the court would grant this supplementary exemption on being satisfied the applicant had made a particular case.  No detail or guidance is given on what might constitute a particular case.  What factors would the court take into account?  Would it apply to all the special occasions defined in subsection (1)?  I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
        <P>One of the problems with the theatre licence is that a coach and four has been driven through the whole concept of a theatre licence and because of the loophole accepted by the High Court, it ends up as an opportunity for everybody to open up later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That was as a result of rushed legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This would create another unmanageable loophole and another series of unmanageable later openings which we do not need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see the problem with opening later.  I do not believe the Minister of State has made the case that the restriction of opening hours is a causal factor in alcohol abuse or in public disorder.  Responding to his point about consulting the social partners in respect of any change, the provision unamended would change the current situation.  The current situation is that persons who hold a theatre licence can open until 2.30 a.m. on a Monday morning and that the provision in the Bill, as I understand it because it is complex and I hope I have not gotten it wrong, unamended would result in a change to restrict opening hours on a Sunday night-Monday morning to 1 a.m.  It would bring theatre licence holders back to the position of pubs in the possession of special exemption orders.  I hope somebody will correct me if I am wrong on that.  If that is the case, then a change is proposed in the Bill.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s points about the need to consult social partners, etc., are unmerited.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are operating under a flawed system, that is, the special exemption order system.  I would much prefer to see a more honest approach to licensing which allowed pubs to apply for late opening without the need to go through the motions of special exemptions and which allowed clubs to operate under a different nightclub licence, as Senator Regan has proposed.  The current system smacks of paternalism.  It would be open to the Minister of State to accept the amendments on nightclub licences which would resolve the problems he has expressed about the driving of a coach and four through the theatre licence.  The theatre licence is fictional, as we have all said.  All of us would be in favour of seeing something more honest and realistic in place to replace the current theatre licence.</P>
        <P>I propose a stopgap to try to address the issue while we have a system of special exemptions in place and to allow the extension of special exemption orders at the discretion of the court, as proposed by amendment No. 9, or at the very least the more restrictive measure in amendment No. 8 to allow opening until 2.30 a.m. for any licensed premises with a special exemption order over seven nights per week and not only Monday to Saturday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To suggest Sunday night is different discriminates against those who do not work Monday to Friday.  I did not think there was a religious rationale.  I had completely neglected that because, given that the current situation allows theatre licenceholders open later on Sunday nights, I do not believe there is a ground to suddenly raise a religious objection.  The objection was raised because of Monday absenteeism but that can be addressed in other ways.  The people who go out on Sunday night tend not to be those who work on Monday morning.</P>

	<P>With regard to the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment, I do not presume, as he suggests, that it is inconsistent to go to church on Sunday and go for a drink late on Sunday night.  I support the amendments.  The Minister of State has given different reasons for rejection of amendments.  Earlier, on Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment, he said it could not be adopted because it gives authority to another body.  Now he says he cannot accept this amendment because it would need to be decided by the social partners.  There is inconsistency in his approach to different provisions of the Bill, in particular this amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, line 29, to delete &ldquo;container;&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;container.  All such containers must carry a clearly identifiable mark indicating the specific address and location of the point of purchase;&rdquo;.</P><Col N="976"/>
        <P FLI="0">Senator Norris in proposing this amendment is seeking to ensure that containers or bottles of alcohol carry an identifiable mark which would indicate the off-licence from which they were bought, the purpose of which is self-evident.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The making of regulations to require labelling of alcohol containers is already provided for in section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  This legislation permits the making of a statutory instrument specifying particulars to be affixed to containers at off-licence premises in which alcohol is sold for consumption thus enabling the premises concerned to be identified.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the labelling of containers might on first sight appear to be an attractive solution, significant challenges need to be overcome to render it effective in practice.  There are practical difficulties at retail level where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, namely, an enclosed six-pack of bottles, a plastic wrapped tray of cans or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of vintage wine.  This inevitably raises the question of whether the label should be attached at an earlier stage in the supply chain rather than at the point of retail sale.  Attaching such labels at an earlier stage could create logistical difficulties for distributors and, in the case of imports from European Union countries, any additional labelling requirements might be regarded as infringing the European Community&rsquo;s Internal Market rules which are intended to guarantee the free movement of goods and services.</P>
        <P>Even if such logistical difficulties could be overcome, an equally important concern is whether or not any such additional labelling requirements would improve enforcement of the law.  It is clear that possession by an under-age person of a labelled container could not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol contained therein had been illegally supplied to him or her by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container.  The alcohol in question might have been taken from a family home or could have been sold to a person over the age of 18 years before being passed to the under-aged person.  Indeed, a labelled container might have changed hands several times before finding its way into the hands of the under-age person in whose possession it was found.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container and doubt is therefore cast on the benefits of any regulations made under the 2003 Act.  For these reasons, I have taken the view that regulations under section 22 would not be worthwhile.  However, I would be prepared to give serious consideration to any reasonable and workable alternative.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The basis for this amendment is that the High Court has already upheld the validity of investigations of the type referred to in this section.  In those circumstances, confusion might be caused by the introduction of a statutory power that might cast doubt on the validity of investigations not carried out under this particular section.  We are proposing the insertion of this clause in order to avoid any lack of clarity on the matter.  We wish to make it clear that the previous power is not being interfered with and that no issue arises in that regard.</P>

The Minister and I have been informed by the Attorney General that an amendment on these lines is not required.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendment.  I am guided by the legal expertise made available to the Minister in this regard.  I am not in a position to duel with the Senators on the legal niceties of these issue.</P>

The Government is relying on the professional advice offered by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office through the Parliamentary Counsel at its disposal that such a clause is not required.  Unlike Senators Alex White and Regan, I am not a genius in many different disciplines.  I do not believe I am in a position to ignore the legal advice offered to me by the Attorney General.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sometimes gratifying to have one&rsquo;s professional background acknowledged by a Minister.  However, I am not here in that capacity but as a Member of the Seanad, as is Senator Regan.  The fact that we are lawyers has nothing to do with it.  This matter is before the Seanad and all the Minister of State can say is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He says he has advice which tells him not to proceed with it.  He is saying, essentially, that either he does not have the detail of that advice or he does not understand it, and in those circumstances, he is not accepting the amendment.  Senator Regan is right.  There is a clear intention on the part of the Minister of State not to accept any amendments.  This points to the bad faith of the Government in its approach to the House with regard to this Bill.  I do not want to direct this personally at the Minister of State but I must use those words.</P>

They have withdrawn their own amendments and utterly abused the procedures of this House in respect of this legislation.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach made a ruling on foot of what Senator Ross proposed.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach is the only person in the Chair.  No one else is in the Chair.  He has made a ruling, just as he made a ruling that went against us a minute or two before, which we had to accept.  It cannot be reversed on the basis of advice tendered a few minutes later.</P>

Does that mean the Bill as a whole is no longer valid, as we are already in breach of Standing Orders?  Either the Leas-Chathaoirleach is right or he is wrong.  If he is correct in stating that an amendment cannot be moved without the permission of the proposer, I remind him that I did so earlier on, which suggests that the whole Bill is no longer valid.</P>

    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
      
        <P>Sections 17 and 18 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not tabled an amendment to section 19.  My issue is with the thrust of the section as it stands.  It is the section that aims to insert two new sections, sections 8A and 8B, into the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  I am concerned about inserting <Col N="986"/>new offences and new powers for the Garda into an Act that is already quite draconian in its content.</P>
        <P>While I have a concern about that, I am particularly concerned about what would be the new section 8A of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act which would create essentially a new offence of failure to give an explanation to a garda where requested to do so.  It provides that where a garda finds somebody with alcohol in a situation where he or she believes the person is causing trouble, annoyance or nuisance to another person, the garda may seek an explanation as to any of the matters to which his or her belief relates and if the person refuses to comply with the request for information, he or she may be guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>My concern is that Ireland has already been found in breach of the Convention on Human Rights by the Court of Human Rights, in the cases of Heaney and McGuinness <i>v</i>. Ireland and Quinn <i>v</i>. Ireland, in the provision of the Offences Against the State Act that makes it an offence to fail to answer questions where being questioned by a garda in the course of detention.  The Court of Human Rights stated that was in breach of due process rights, and so on.</P>
        <P>There are other provisions where it is an offence to fail to give name and address to a garda, but this purported section 8A goes beyond that in making it an offence to fail to give an explanation.  I am concerned that this would be in breach of the Convention on Human Rights.  Has the Attorney General advised on this and in the light of the concern I raised, is the Minister willing to review the operation of the section until the issue of compliance with the convention is reconsidered?</P>
        <P>This is part of an unfortunate trend where we are seeing an ever increasing number of offences being created.  There is already a section 8 offence in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 of failure to comply with the direction of a garda.  That is quite a broad offence.  What we are seeing with this provision, section 8A, is an even wider cover-all offence, which gives greater power to the Garda.  This gives rise to fear of abuse and with this problem, on my reading of it, it makes it an offence to fail to give an explanation to a garda.  I ask the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General put a great deal of thought into this section at the drafting phase, for the good legal and civil liberties reasons Senator Bacik outlined.  He found it appropriate to use in section 48A &mdash; the additional power about which Senator Bacik spoke &mdash; the phrase &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;.  The garda involved can only act on this new power where he or she has a reasonable cause to believe that there are people who are under age drinking alcohol in a situation that is clearly illegal.  That has been carefully drafted and on the advice of the Attorney General it is fit for purpose and in compliance with the Convention on Human Rights.  The Attorney General sees this new power as fit for purpose but trammelled by particular requirements on reasonable cause.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A garda must have reasonable grounds for believing that section 37A or 8A applies before exercising the entry powers under section 37B or 8B, as the case may be.  It may not become clear until after entry has been completed whether it is section 37A, that is, a person is under 18, or section 8A which applies.  The entry provisions are framed to deal with that by requiring that the garda be satisfied before entry that one or other, or both sections, are applicable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I am looking at section 19 which creates new sections 8A and 8B, and I do not see the text to which the Minister of State refers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to section 48A.  Senator Bacik spoke about an additional power being conferred on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Senator is correct.  An additional power is <Col N="987"/>now being given to an individual member of the force to enter into a family home, in effect, or a domestic dwelling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to a different provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik did not specify the extra power that the Garda received.  As I understand it, I am responding to a concern Senator Bacik has on civil liberties grounds in connection with this additional power being given to the Garda under section 48A to enter a home in limited circumstances where reasonable cause is the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not speaking of the Garda&rsquo;s power to enter homes.  I did express a broad concern about civil liberties, but my more specific issue relates to a provision, which would be a new section 8A of the 1994 Act but which is in section 19 of the Bill, under Part 3, Amendment of Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which is, the power to direct persons who are in possession of intoxicating substances, and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the power to take away the cans or bottles of alcohol in a situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik is seeking an explanation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the other power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That is one of the new powers but there is also&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Bacik think that is draconian or somehow in breach of civil liberties?  That is why I am rather puzzled.  I would have thought, coming from Senator Bacik&rsquo;s strong perspective of civil liberties, the issue of entering a house would be more important than a garda, anticipating an element of urban menace, deciding that he or she wishes to remove the can of alcohol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order,  in order that we can all sing from the same hymn sheet, to what provision in the Bill does the Minister of State refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is not, is there to be any order in this debate?  I am on my feet.  The Senator raised an issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik raised the issue with the Minister of State and it is up to him to answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Minister of State answered a different one and he does not even know which question he is answering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any control over what the Minister of State says.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is rubbishing the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised a valid point of concern in a constructive way, I hope, on a section of the Bill which the Leas-Chathaoirleach called, namely, section 19.  This purports to insert a new section 8A into the Amendment of Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  This section would create an offence of failing to give an explanation to a garda.  Will the Minister of State specifically address the concern I have raised?  Section 8A(5) states: &ldquo;It shall be an <Col N="988"/>offence for any person, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, to fail to comply with a direction given by the member under subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of paragraph (b) of subsection (2).&rdquo;.  This is a direction requiring explanation.  This raises a concern as there have been cases successfully taken against Ireland on a similar provision.  I am sorry we do not have more time to review this and to establish whether I am correct.  There is a concern this provision might fall in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights on the same grounds as those in the Heaney and McGuinness judgment and the Quinn judgment.  These cases found it was in breach of the convention to make it an offence to fail to answer questions in a broad sense.  I may be wrong but I am simply raising a concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may be right, but I am reliant on the advice of the Attorney General, who deemed this part to be constitutional.  I apologise if there was confusion between section 48A and section 19 8A.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no section 48A, we are discussing Section 19 8A.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We believe this part is in conformity with the Constitution.  That is the best advice we have received from the Attorney General.  I emphasise, in order for Members and others outside the House to be clear about the discussion, that rather than consider the theoretical legal implications of a measure, we are discussing the powers conferred on the Garda to make assumptions about why a person would refuse to be identified when asked simple questions about whether he or she is of age to be allowed to drink intoxicating liquor.  This is a fair assumption and a fair power to pass on to the Garda.  If someone is drinking in a public place and carrying cans, and such a person appears to the officer to be under-age, then the officer has a reasonable right to inquire of the age of such a person.  The provision allows for this and does not represent a complicated change to life as we know it.  However, I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s concern on the human rights issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State has misinterpreted my remarks.  Section 8A does not relate to underage persons.  Section 19 8A(1)(a) states, &ldquo;...a person is in a relevant place alone or accompanied by other persons...&rdquo; which appears to apply to any person about whom a garda has a concern because such a person holds alcohol in a bottle or container and is causing annoyance or a nuisance to other persons.  Senator Alex White made the point already that we need to ensure the Minister of State addresses the questions raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is not even listening to the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure the Minster of State is addressing the specific question I raised regarding section 19.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has a tendency to dumb down every discussion and rubbish every question.  We wish to ensure that the legislation we adopt is constitutional and in accordance with the general principles enshrined therein.  To simply brush aside a valid question is not appropriate.  The question raised should be answered rather than discussing the general policy objectives with which we all concur.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can answer only as best I can, short of allowing Senators to write my replies and utter them.  This section applies to under-age and over-age people.  It allows the Garda to anticipate the possibility of a public order offence.  The purpose of this section is precisely so that the garda&iacute; can anticipate such offences using their eyes, invaluable experience and judgment to form a clear view that a person will behave in a manner contrary to public <Col N="989"/>order or create a breach of the peace.  This is a positive measure from a law and order point of view because while the Garda has existing powers in this area, the measure allows it to anticipate the possible perpetration of an offence and act accordingly.  I have no problem with this measure, nor does the Attorney General.  However, I take on board the remarks of Senator Bacik regarding the civil liberties implications.  I can only rely on the advice of the Attorney General on this matter which indicates that the measure is constitutional.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We are passing into law a novel offence with very little debate.  I am concerned by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, as he stated this measure will allow the Garda to anticipate the commission of public order offences.  We have a presumption of innocence under the Constitution, on which the criminal justice system is premised.  It would be a matter of some concern if the Garda could arrest people in anticipation of such people committing an offence.  We have given powers to the Garda to prevent crime, which serves everybody&rsquo;s interests.  However, this measure goes beyond what is normally permitted in the interests of the prevention of crime.</P>

	<P>I have provided as complete an answer as I can offer at this stage.  I am not refusing to answer questions, but I have offered as comprehensive a reply as I can in the circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of the term &ldquo;to anticipate&rdquo; is interesting.  Does this allow for the provision to be used on the grounds of the manner in which a person looks at a garda?  Is such an action grounds for a garda anticipating an offence?  This matter should be clarified.</P>

	<P>Yesterday on Second Stage I remarked on the concept of pre-emption.  I know the Senator is aware of such concepts as they apply both legally and otherwise.  It does not require further explanation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that amendments must be seconded and only the Senator moving the amendment has a right to reply to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  Amendments No. 1 to 3, inclusive, may be taken together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete lines 17 to 49 and in page 8, to delete lines 1 to 4 and substitute the following:</P><Col N="990"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) not later than 6 months after section 8 of this Act is commenced, the Minister shall lay before each House appropriate regulations for the structural separation for the sale of intoxicating liquor,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) such regulations shall be approved by each House and shall come into force not later than the first anniversary of such approval,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the Minister shall, prior to laying of the above regulations before each House of the Oireachtas, consult with representatives of the industry to facilitate the practical implementation of the above regulations.&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a list of Report Stage amendments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are outside the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.  I did not realise the list was issued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an amendment on the structural separation of alcohol in mixed house premises.  I do not propose to delay the House on this but I put the matter to the Minister of State.  I put this amendment on Committee Stage to the Minister of State but as the amendments will be automatically rejected, I do not propose to say too much on them.  The same logic applies to amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  Although I do not propose to press the amendments, I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If there had been time for proper consideration and scope for the Minister of State to make a decision, some amendments could possibly have been accepted and there would be some logic in putting down amendments.  The placing of these amendments is almost a futile process given the blanket policy of rejection of any amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will reiterate what I stated on Committee Stage.  I hope the code of practice will generate the result which is presumably intended by way of this amendment.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has indicated his flexibility and pragmatism, as always.  My experience of working with the Minister for the best part of four years is that he is flexible and pragmatic with regard to not commencing this section of the Bill in preference to having a code of practice that will act as the guideline for small individual retailers.  It is hoped it will, in effect, bring about the position where there is separation without it involving structural building work, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 4 in the name of Senators Ross and Quinn is out of order as it does not arise from committee proceedings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose that the amendment be recommitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I put down an identical amendment No. 4 in the names of Senator Cummins and myself.  It dealt with this issue of the upgrading of restricted licences.  It is identical and is included in the list of amendments.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>It is the same amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan submitted an identical amendment, which is being allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment was submitted to the Bills Office and acknowledged as having been received.  That is the reason it is on the Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I kept quiet because I understood we would be able to discuss Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment, which is identical and on the Order Paper as allowed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the event of an amendment having been submitted to the Bills Office and not been returned, of if there is an error, I will suspend the sitting in order to allow Senators check it out and give them an opportunity to speak on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for that.  Either the amendment is in order or it is not.  I did not press my amendment because I understood Senator Regan has an amendment which is obviously allowed.  It is printed and on the Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to clarify this.</P>

	<P>It was submitted and acknowledged by the Bills Office.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Perhaps we need time to clarify the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We can just add two names to the amendment.  We do not need to delay further because of that procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I will move the amendment on behalf of Senator Regan, with his permission, if it makes life easier.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>Amendment No. 4 is in the names of Senators Regan, Cummins, Ross and Quinn.  Senators Ross and Quinn were first to commit it.  It was discussed on Committee Stage by Senator Regan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of the amendment was discussed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment was not printed in Senator Regan&rsquo;s name.  We received a letter stating it was out of order but Senator Regan did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that but it arose from confusion about the list.  There were two names which should have been on the list but are not.  Only two names were attached to the amendment on the list that came to me, which is why it was ruled out at that stage.  There are four names attached to it now.</P>

	<P>Senator Boyle appears to be chomping at the bit to speak to the substance of the amendment, although he failed to speak on Committee Stage.  He has shown contempt for the House by submitting an amendment and allowing it not to be moved, thus preventing Senators from speaking on it.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for spending so much time in the House.  He gave detailed explanations as to why certain amendments could not be accepted.  In a sense, the whole process has been undemocratic, an abuse of the procedure of the House and very cynical.  We knew no amendments would be accepted which is unfair to Members.  The ultimate proof of that cynicism was the fact the Government side voted against its own amendment.  I thank the Minister of State for his time, even though there was no scope for refinement of this legislation.  </P>

I apologise and regret that they did not get an opportunity to get anything to eat since they came into the Seanad today.  However, I must repeat what was said by others.  It was unfortunate that such an important issue as public disorder resulting from alcohol did not manage to get the attention it deserved.   The House has been demeaned by the way the debate was handled.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of State that on the last sitting day of the Seanad some seven years ago, when the D&aacute;il had already risen for the summer, Senator Ross discovered there was a flaw in a Bill that had passed through the D&aacute;il, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  The Leader of the House verified it was a flaw and the Bill failed.  It was worth having debate at that stage, although we entered debate believing it was highly unlikely our amendments would be accepted.</P>
        <P>Those of us who spoke and gave much time to this Bill today, believe it is not the best legislation that could be achieved.  That is not the fault of the Minister of State or officials, but the fault of the arrangements made to deal with it.  I express my disappointment with the manner in which the Bill has been passed.

Also, the Minister of State said today that some of the issues raised by the Opposition will be definitively addressed in the autumn in the other Bill that deals with alcohol related issues, and that is a ray of hope. </P>
        <P>It is important to discuss alcohol abuse in the House.  This is the third time I have been involved with legislation on the issue.  We discussed the issue in the late 1980s.  Today&rsquo;s legislation is being introduced to close off a loophole and to strengthen the law and powers of the Garda against social unrest as a result of alcohol abuse.  This is good for the House.  I welcome what has been achieved and thank officials, staff and the Cathaoirleach.

I accept what has been said about the sequencing of the event, but as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said, we will return to legislation on other aspects of the issue in a short period.  I am confident that many of the issues that have been raised on Committee and Report Stages on this legislation will be taken into account when that Bill comes before us.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House.  It is good that <Col N="997"/>the Minister of State with responsibility for the issue is here to respond and I hope he has good news for me tonight.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of Buncrana breakwater not only because it is long-standing but because it is an issue of health and safety.  I have raised this issue many times, as I will demonstrate before I finish.  Ned&rsquo;s Point, Buncrana has been the location for the RNLI, an organisation that has been working well and which has continued to acknowledge the terrific work being done by the volunteers in the Buncrana area through providing bigger and better boats for the RNLI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The RNLI, however, should be based out of Buncrana Harbour.  There have been significant attempts within the council area to ensure that dredging takes place to enable boats of all sorts to get in and out of the harbour, but primarily the RNLI boat.  Unfortunately, dredging has not worked and the harbour seems to silt up as fast as it is dredged.  Therefore, the solution deemed necessary is a breakwater, estimated to cost approximately &euro;1 million when the need was identified.</P>
        <P>We have had announcements on funding for the breakwater at least twice, if not more.  We have also had matching funds in place at least twice, yet there seems to be ongoing difficulty with regard to a lease.  Now, so many years after we first raised the issue it has gone beyond a joke.  On previous occasions when I raised the issue in the Seanad, I asked who will be responsible when and if the boat cannot get out.  There have been instances already when the RNLI has not been able to respond as speedily as it needed and there have been times when it was unable to get back into the harbour.  Fortunately, up to now no fatalities arose on those occasions, but in the nature of the job it is only a matter of time before they do.</P>
        <P>All of us in the area are anxious to acknowledge the tremendous work of the volunteers in the area.  We need the breakwater and this has been accepted by the Government and the Department but I wonder why, despite raising the issue with every Minister that has been in charge of this area, there is a delay or what is causing the problem.  Can we get to a point where the problem is resolved?</P>
        <P>Over a year and a half ago, at Christmas 2006, the county manager came to Dublin and sat with the Minister at the time, Deputy Noel Dempsey and me and we went through the issues.  The Minister agreed what needed to be done and I was told in January 2007 that everything was in place and everything that needed to be done was being done.</P>
        <P>I wish to give the Minister of State an idea of the written record of contact I have had with Ministers or officials on the issue.  I wrote to then Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, in April 2006.  In April 2007 a sum of &euro;562,500 was granted for the construction of the breakwater.  A sum of &euro;900,000 was granted in 2007 and it was agreed to keep that in the 2008 budget.  I asked parliamentary questions on the issue on 27 September 2006, 15 February 2007, 24 April 2007, 19 February 2008.  I raised the issue in the Seanad in November 2007.  I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in November 2006, the foreshore section in November 2006, John Quinlan in December 2006, the Taoiseach in January 2007 and the Minister of State here present, Deputy Killeen, on 26 June 2008.  I also wrote to Deputy John Browne, former Minister of State, again on 31 October 2007 and in January, February, April and June of 2008.</P>
        <P>If this is not evidence of the urgency of the situation, I do not know what more I can say to stress that this breakwater is vital.  I do not know how much I can stress the need for a breakwater to protect RNLI workers.  I hope the Minister of State has good news for me.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht an &aacute;bhar th&aacute;bhachtach <Col N="998"/>seo a hard&uacute;.  There are two aspects to this issue.  The first concerns silting of the harbour and in this regard successive dumping at sea permits have been issued to the council to facilitate maintenance dredging which would allow the RNLI to launch its boat on a 24-hour basis.  The primary responsibility for this aspect rests with the local authority, which has been given assurances by the Department on several occasions that further requests for permits for ongoing maintenance would be given the highest priority in the interest of public safety.</P>
        <P>The second aspect relates to the drafting and acceptance by the relevant parties of a lease in respect of the proposed breakwater at Buncrana.  The council requested a reduction or total waiver of foreshore charges on the basis that the facility was to be used by the RNLI.  Following extensive discussions and as an exceptional matter, the Department, with the agreement of the Department of Finance, informed the council that it would consider waiving the rental charges if the council could confirm that the proposed facility would be for the exclusive use of the RNLI.  The council was also informed that if it was unable to confirm that the facility would be used exclusively by the RNLI, the Department was prepared to apply a reduced rental charge based on the ratio of usage of the facility by the RNLI.</P>
        <P>The council subsequently confirmed that the works proposed at Buncrana Harbour are being constructed solely for the use of the RNLI and are not being constructed for the benefit of any other party.  On foot of this confirmation the Department entered into detailed discussions with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office with a view to preparing an appropriate draft lease to best facilitate the council&rsquo;s proposal and safeguard the State&rsquo;s ongoing interest in the management and protection of the foreshore in the public interest.  The draft lease will involve the insertion of specific conditions that will reflect the fact that the arrangements involved are unusual and based on the need to provide a permanent location for the RNLI which will enable the launch of its boat on a 24-hour basis.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s discussions with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office have focused on the public interest provisions of the Foreshore Acts, the proposed arrangements which the council will need to make with the RNLI and other legal issues designed to protect the interests of all parties.  When drafted, the lease will require the agreement of all relevant parties.  In the course of drafting the lease conditions the council was asked to supply plans for the structure which, when received, required subsequent clarification on a number of occasions.  These clarifications concerned the type of structure and the scale of its footprint.  These issues have now been substantially resolved from a technical perspective and the Department is in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office on finalising the draft lease.</P>
        <P>The issues associated with this application are relatively complex but every effort is being made to expedite completion of the draft lease.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Minister of State is new to his job but does he accept that the answer from the Department on this issue has not changed in 18 months?  Is there possibility of a notional time frame for resolution of this issue?  This funding has been allocated on several occasions and, if it is not drawn down now, we fear that it will not be given again.  Can the Minister of State confirm that funding will be available when the lease is sorted and tell us whether the issue will be resolved within weeks or months?  I have indicated the frequency with which I raised this matter but the answer unfortunately has not changed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot confirm a date at this stage because it is not possible to predict the time frame within which the information will be provided by the council.  Many of <Col N="999"/>the delays on the project arose because of the inadequate nature of the information supplied to the Department.  Due to the involvement of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office and the complexity of the lease, issues arose which involved several parties.  I can only speak for one of these parties but I will ensure that the Department deals with its responsibilities as quickly as possible once the other parties provide the information needed from them.</P>

    <Title>Teaching Qualifications. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I draw the House&rsquo;s attention to an anomaly and inequity that currently exists with regard to an allowance payable, or not payable as the case may be, to holders of postgraduate diplomas in learning support and special educational needs.  Teachers who were awarded the postgraduate diploma in learning support prior to summer 2006 do not receive an allowance, whereas an allowance is paid to teachers who did broadly similar postgraduate diploma courses from 2006 onwards.  This is a double whammy in that applications are accepted in spring for enrolment on the following year&rsquo;s postgraduate diploma in special educational needs courses.</P>
        <P>The criteria for selection include the following: only one application per school is considered; and priority is given to teachers who have not already attended a similar postgraduate programme for learning support or special education teachers approved by the Department of Education and Science.  Teachers who did the course up to 2006 are being denied the allowance, as well as being uniquely disadvantaged as a group in being denied access to a programme of professional development which would allow them to increase their salaries.  Effectively, the Department recognises that they are suitably qualified but believes they do not merit further training while refusing them the allowance which is paid to their peers.  This needs to be addressed on the grounds of natural justice, equality and promoting and valuing professional development.</P>
        <P>The relevant circular from the Department, which is accessible from its website, includes the current year&rsquo;s application form for the course and useful background information on the colleges involved, the selection criteria and various learning difficulties.  Demand for places on courses leading to a postgraduate diploma typically exceeds the number available.  In this regard, the circular states: &ldquo;Priority will be given to teachers who meet the criteria below and who have not already attended a similar post-graduate programme for Learning Support teachers or teachers of pupils with Special Educational Needs approved by the Department of Education and Science.&rdquo;  Accordingly, teachers who currently hold a postgraduate diploma for which an allowance is not payable are effectively ineligible for acceptance on the current course.</P>
        <P>With the rapid growth in the number of teachers working in learning support, a considerable number of teachers apply for the course each year.  These will get priority selection over teachers who already have a qualification in this area already.  If a school is aware that only one application per school will be considered, it is unlikely that it will jeopardise its chances of getting a place on the course by submitting an application for a teacher who already possesses a qualification.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to the summer of 2006, the course was effectively repackaged but the bulk of the material remained the same.  The assignments which participants must complete in their personal time are strikingly similar.  The course is carried out on a block release basis whereby the participants attend college for several weeks each term.  The number of weeks of block release has increased since 2006 and some topics are treated in greater depth.  However, the extension of the block release sessions has arguably reduced the intensity of the course for participants.  In addition, substitute cover has been provided since 2006 for course participants <Col N="1000"/>during block release sessions.  Prior to this, no cover was provided, which meant that on return to school, course participants were under significant pressure to address their teaching tasks.  They are in effect being penalised while holding substantially the same qualifications even though in some cases greater efforts were required.</P>
        <P>Part of the current course requires course participants to spend a week in a learning support department or special education section of a school other than their base schools during the year.  For two years running, one teacher has hosted postgraduate students on a college&rsquo;s recommendation.  This teacher, therefore, continues to be a net giver.  This issue affects both primary and post-primary teachers.  The allowance has an impact on earning power over a teacher&rsquo;s career, as well as on pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>Successful completion of the postgraduate diploma course in learning support or special educational needs entitles one to pursue a masters degree.  I am aware of one person who completed a masters course yet receives a smaller allowance on grounds of already holding an honours primary degree.  This person would have received more by completing the postgraduate diploma in special education needs, which is a prerequisite for the masters degree.  In the case of which I am aware the person invested personal resources of in excess of &euro;5,000, leaving aside the indirect costs.  I wonder what kind of value is being placed on people&rsquo;s diligence and commitment that they are now being penalised in this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This situation would be unacceptable in any field.  It is all the more unpalatable in a field that is centred on education in the first instance.  I know the Minister of State is aware of the relevant facts and figures in this regard.  I am hoping to hear from him today an honourable promise of a solution to ensure this unnecessary anomaly and inequity is rendered something of the past and that those who obtained the qualification prior to 2006 will be treated on an equal basis to those who obtained it post-summer 2006.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; m&eacute; ag freagairt thar ceann an Aire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta, an Teachta Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht an &aacute;bhair t&aacute;bhachtach seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an tSeanaid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the payment of an allowance to teachers of students with special educational needs.  As the Senator may be aware, in addition to holding a relevant qualification in the area of special educational needs, there are other criteria that a teacher must satisfy to qualify for payment of an additional allowance.  A primary teacher must also hold a permanent position in a sanctioned post in an area of special education.  A post-primary teacher must spend a minimum of 12 hours per week working with pupils who have special educational needs.  There are also other conditions attached to the retention of this allowance, namely, primary and post-primary teachers who voluntarily leave their posts in the area of special educational needs within the school will not be entitled to retain the allowance.  The current rate of this allowance is &euro;2,502 per annum.</P>
        <P>Prior to 2006 the Department of Education and Science funded access to a number of post-graduate programmes of continuing professional development, two of which were a programme of training in special educational needs for teachers working with students with special educational needs in primary and post-primary schools, which satisfied one of the criteria in order to qualify for payment of the allowance, and a programme of training for teachers working with students in primary and post-primary schools requiring learning support and which did not warrant payment of an additional allowance as it did not provide them with the necessary skills to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs.</P><Col N="1001"/>
        <P>In 2005, the Department introduced the general allocation model of provision which immediately provided an additional 660 special needs teachers to enable schools to cater for the needs of pupils with high incidence special education needs.  Outlining the provisions of the scheme, the Department issued a circular to all primary schools providing advice in regard to the re-organisation of teaching resources for students requiring learning support and resource teaching support in primary schools.</P>
        <P>The model provides for a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to enable schools to cater for the needs of pupils with higher incidence special education needs, those with learning support needs, borderline mild and mild general learning disability and dyslexia without the need for individual applications and psychological assessments.  It also allows for individual allocations in respect of pupils with more acute needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new system put in place resources on a more systematic basis thereby giving schools more certainty over their resource levels.  This allows for better planning in schools, greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils&rsquo; special educational needs as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.  In this regard, the circular also advised that schools should allocate teachers in line with pupils&rsquo; needs in order to ensure that those with the greatest need received the highest level of support.  A concern was articulated in the circular that pupils should be supported by the teacher with the most appropriate training, experience and expertise.  It was envisaged that teaching resources would be deployed in a flexible manner which would lead to the most effective and efficient delivery of services.  To ensure that this model of provision operates effectively and efficiently, a new combined postgraduate diploma programme of continuing professional development was offered to teachers from September 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 300 places on this combined postgraduate diploma programme of continuing professional development are offered in the following centres: St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra; Church of Ireland College of Education; St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo; Mary Immaculate College, Limerick; UCD, University College Dublin; Department of Education, University College Cork and, the Department of Education, National University of Ireland, Galway.  The budget to cater for the provision of these programmes of professional development in the current year is more than &euro;1.3 million.  Those teachers who successfully complete this programme of professional development and who satisfy the other conditions are eligible for payment of an additional allowance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am happy to advise the House that officials in the Department are currently engaged in discussions with the seven institutions involved in the delivery of this combined postgraduate programme with a view to developing a further comprehensive programme of continuing professional development.  The aim of this new programme of continuing professional development will be to enable those teachers referred to by the Senator to effectively upgrade their current qualifications to meet the learning and teaching needs of all students with special educational needs in our schools.  Department officials have been in close contact with these institutions for some time and the Minister is confident that significant progress will be made in the new academic year with a view to having such a programme of continuing professional development in place for the Autumn of 2009.  Successful completion of this programme will enable these teachers satisfy the condition for payment of the allowance relating to the holding of a relevant qualification in the area of special educational needs.</P>

However, in light of the many similarities between the qualifications achieved by people prior to summer 2006 and the qualifications for which people now receive an allowance, will the Minister of State seek from the Minister an assurance that the cost to be borne by teachers taking this course will be sufficiently low as to reflect the fact that the skills and expertise acquired will be relatively small in comparison with the significant expertise they gained in the first instance?</P>

	<P>I have sought a number of times to have this matter discussed on the Adjournment.  I am glad I will today, the last sitting day of the Seanad this session, receive a response from the Department and the Minister&rsquo;s office on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, the people of Donegal heard on a local radio station that Letterkenny General Hospital, owing to budgetary constraints, is to close a 20-bed ward, and its day services unit for most or all of the month of August.  Just over a year ago, at the end of March last year, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, visited Letterkenny General Hospital amidst much glitter and fanfare to announce the opening of a new 30-bed short-stay ward at the hospital.  The former Taoiseach stated at that time that this was a major step forward for the hospital, which it was.  Prior to the putting in place of those additional beds, Letterkenny General Hospital had more patients on trolleys than any other hospital outside Dublin.  It was a major step forward but the decision by the manager of the hospital, taken on foot of budgetary constraints imposed by the Departments of Health and Children and Finance, will return the hospital to a situation whereby it will once again have an increased number of patients on trolleys.  Also, patients will have to wait longer for treatment owing to the closure of the day services unit.</P>

Letterkenny General Hospital has shown efficiency in terms of what it has being done during the past number of years, including a 25% increase in the number of day cases treated and an 11% increase in the number of outpatients treated.  The result of management and staff treating patients quickly and more effectively, in a hospital with the longest waiting list in the country, is a decision by the Department to close 20 beds and the day services unit at the hospital because it treated too many people and ran over budget.  This does not make sense.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There are sick people in Donegal who need beds and treatment.  Letterkenny General Hospital will, as a result of this action, revert to the situation it was in prior to March of last year.  Another issue of concern is that of infection control within the hospital.  The Minister of State is well aware that additional capacity within a hospital will allow hospital management and staff to deal adequately with infection control.  However, taking away these beds will put serious pressure on management and staff to prevent and control infection when it arises.  The Minister for Health and Children is well aware of the concerns of people in Donegal on a wide variety of health issues, including the failure to roll out BreastCheck, the fact that there is no centre of excellence in the north west, and the downgrading of Sligo General Hospital.  Today we hear from IMPACT that there are to be 250 job losses in hospitals in the west and north west as a result of the Government&rsquo;s penny-pinching and cutbacks.</P><Col N="1003"/>
      
         <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">The Taoiseach and the Minister stated this week that there would not be any cuts in the areas of health and education.  This is a joke.  The reality in Donegal shows that cutbacks are not planned for the future but are happening now.  I ask the Minister of State to take this issue very seriously.  This hospital has shown that it works effectively.  It treats more patients and, as a result, decreases the number on the waiting list.  It suffers as a result of that.  The necessary funding should be made available to the hospital to ensure that the 20 beds are not lost in the month of August and that the day service unit can remain open so that those who have eventually been able to see a consultant and who require treatment can avail of it during that period.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir freisin.  I propose to take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is obliged to provide services in line with available funding.  The service levels for 2008 are set out in the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan.  These include national service level targets for acute hospitals of almost 600,000 inpatient discharges, more 580,000 day cases, and more than 2.7 million outpatient attendances.  Similarly, each acute hospital has annual service targets that include numbers of inpatients, day cases and outpatients.  Letterkenny General Hospital has seen major increases in funding and activity in recent years, with many new services being developed.  This year there has been a substantial reduction in waiting lists for surgery, due in particular to the increase in day cases.  Activity at the hospital has increased significantly in the past year as new developments have come on stream.  Already this year the hospital is ahead of its 2008 service plan targets.  The Minister for Health and Children understands from the HSE that there has been a 25% increase in day cases and that the number of outpatients treated has increased by 11%.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that the approved expenditure for Letterkenny General Hospital is approximately &euro;112 million for 2008.  The executive has advised that it is taking steps to ensure that the overall level of activity at the hospital in the current year can be funded from within this sum.  The Minister understands that the HSE is currently discussing a number of measures with staff in the hospital, including a proposal to attempt to renegotiate contracts with certain suppliers to obtain better value, as well as other measures with regard to activity that it not patient-related.  It is also proposed that services in the day service unit be scaled back for several weeks in August.  This will not affect oncology and haematology day services and will allow services to be managed more efficiently at a time of reduced activity and at peak holiday time.  It may involve closing the day service unit for a week or two in August.  The temporary closure of one of the smaller 20-bed wards in the hospital is also proposed, and the staff concerned will be transferred to cover vacancies, maternity leave and sick leave elsewhere in the hospital.</P>
        <P>The HSE remains committed to minimising the impact of these measures on patients.  It has also given an assurance that emergency and urgent services will not be affected.  Accident and emergency, maternity, outpatients, renal dialysis and chemotherapy services will operate as normal.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his response, which contained nothing new to us.  The Minister of State outlined the areas that would not be affected, but the reality is that 20 beds are to be lost from Letterkenny General Hospital and patients who want to avail of treatment as day cases will not be able to do so.  The Minister for Health and Children always said that these cutbacks would not affect patient care.  The general manager of Letterkenny hospital stated on Highland Radio that one would have to be naive to think <Col N="1004"/>these cuts would not affect patient care.  Does the Minister of State stand over the fact that patients in Donegal will receive a reduced service?  The beds will not be there, which will result in more patients on trolleys, and those who are waiting to be treated as day cases during August will not have that service.  It is appalling that the hospital is being punished for being effective and being ahead of its own targets this year.</P>

	<P>I understand that the number of cases being dealt with in the hospital will show an increase of 25% and the number of outpatients will increase by 11%.  However, I will raise the Senator&rsquo;s concern with the Minister.</P>
