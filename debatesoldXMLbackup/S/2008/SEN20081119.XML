	<P Just="Left">I have notice from Senator Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to confirm that due to the imminent retirement of the consultant surgeon at Bantry General Hospital, the surgery unit and the medical unit at the hospital will not be adversely affected and that the retiring consultant will be replaced as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the measures that have taken place to implement recommendation 1283 on history and the learning of history in Europe.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to recognise the necessity of core funding for the continuance of deaf studies in Trinity College Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to address the backlog in applications from people who have recently lost their jobs, for social welfare supports in County Donegal, leaving many of them without social welfare supports for periods up to and over two months.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Keaveney and Ross, and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Doherty may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made the point before that I do not believe the Government protects the vulnerable as it should do.  I raised this point in regard to the way the budget cuts especially affected the young and the elderly.  I am disturbed that the risk of female genital mutilation is not considered an adequate reason by Irish courts for a family to be allowed to remain in this country.  The barbaric idea that two young girls could be subjected to this awful practice and that Ireland would not intervene is not reflecting the will of the vast majority of people in this country, who would want to see Pamela Izevbekhai being allowed to stay in this country with her two children, particularly in view of the fact her eldest daughter has already died as a result of this practice.  One can understand her huge anxiety about returning to the country where this happened.  Were it not for the intervention of the European Court of Human Rights, she would have been deported yesterday.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform our concern about this case.  I hope, irrespective of what the European Court of Human Rights decides, that the Government will take a humanitarian approach to this case given the amount of distress the family have been through already.</P>
        <P>In terms of protecting the vulnerable, I want to raise an issue in regard to an art collection in the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the &ldquo;Outsider Art&rdquo; collection, which has been on loan to this country for ten years.  It was put together by people who have had mental health difficulties and is a particular form of art.  While the country has had the collection for ten years, arbitrarily the owners have now been asked to remove it from IMMA.  I ask the Leader to follow this up and find why it is happening.  Again, it involves a vulnerable group but it also involves a particular, well recognised form of art.  We are lucky to have the collection in this country but a decision has been made arbitrarily to remove it from IMMA.</P>
        <P>The key concern on our minds this morning is the situation regarding the banks.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i>, for example, David McWilliams, among many others, states: &ldquo;Act now, minister, or we will all live to regret it.&rdquo;  Deputy Richard Bruton writes an article today stating we should be clear that at this point the banks are a tool, no more, no less.  In the long term, the banking sector needs to be radically reformed, as does the public sector.</P>
        <P>Senators on this side of the House as well as on the Government side asked yesterday where is the plan from Government.  We hear about late night meetings but we desperately need to hear from the Minister for Finance in this House about his plans.  Equally, we need answers to questions regarding what measures he proposes to safeguard the public interest if and when such recapitalisation takes place.  I am especially concerned at the reliance being placed on putting directors into the banks because they will be in a position where there is a clear conflict of interest.</P>
        <P>Everybody would want to be reassured that if there is to be recapitalisation, the money will be used for the right reasons and that small businesses, which are the lifeblood of this economy, will get the income and support they need.  They are the businesses that will give us hope in a year or two when, we hope, the economy recovers.  However, if they do not get the right support now, they will not recover or be able to give the kind of hope that is needed in the country.  When will we have a debate on the current economic situation, the banks and the Government&rsquo;s approach to them at this critical time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We asked the Leader yesterday, last week and the previous week to deliver on his promise to have regular discussions on the economy which were to take place <Col N="233"/>not less often than once a month.  We are still waiting for that debate.  This should not be taking up time on the Order of Business but issues arise.  The Government is addressing a matter that is all over the newspapers and is of concern to everybody in the country but we are not talking about it.  This cannot be right.  If the Leader cannot get the proper Minister in, he should get some Minister.</P>
        <P>I do not understand what is going on, nor does anybody else.  Specifically, I do not understand why we are recapitalising at this time.  I know what we are trying to achieve but nobody has explained to me how recapitalising the banks will send out the right message and prove things will return to operating properly.  As we are all aware, the American banks and the UK banks were recapitalised but it does not seem to have made a great difference.  If we are simply recapitalising so the banks carry on doing what they did before, I do not see it is an advantage to the Irish taxpayer.  However, I am not saying I am right about this question because I do not know the answer.</P>
        <P>I have been trying to check with small businesses as to how badly they are being treated by the banks.  I am coming across situations where people are getting loans and mortgages and where businesses are being allowed to continue.  I just do not know the facts in all of this.  I know other people are in serious trouble but this is because of bad risks that were taken earlier.  What exactly is the clear picture?  What are the demands?  We know what small businesses need and we know the support to which they are entitled and which they should get.  How much are they getting or not getting?  Are the banks telling us what is going on at that level?  If they will not tell us, let us carry out a survey of people in business to find out what is happening.</P>
        <P>On another issue, I raise for the nth time a request that the Leader would deliver on the promise for a debate on education.  We have a situation where issues of special education are being completely ignored.  Newcomer children with language difficulties are not getting the support they need.</P>
        <P>I want to make one simple fact available to the House.  Members on the Government side are being told by their Minister about reducing class sizes by one.  That does not happen.  Members should take this image away with them.  A school with 60 pupils and three teachers has a class ratio of 20:1 per class.  If one teacher and one pupil are taken away, there are 59 pupils for two teachers.  The ratio moves from 20:1 to 30:1, which is why people are upset.  It is unfair that Members on the Government side are told at their parliamentary party meetings that there is simply a change of one because it never happens that way.  There is always a significant impact, particularly on small schools.  This will be the death of schools in rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators referred to the difficulties faced by small businesses at present.  In this climate it is vital we ensure our small businesses are not being ripped off.  I want to give two examples where I believe excessive profiteering is taking place by suppliers to small business.  The first is in regard to company travel.  Businesses must use airlines to go abroad to do business.  We know the additional surcharge will not help but I want to draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to the Visa charges applied by airlines.  Three of the airlines based in Ireland charge a fee of &euro;10 per user for every time the person uses a Visa card.  However, British Midland only charges &euro;6 per person so it is clear the others do not have to charge &euro;10.  It is excessive profiteering by some airlines and we need action.</P>
        <P>The second example is in regard to mobile phone charges.  We have spoken before in the House in regard to small businesses paying 66% higher mobile phone charges than the average for the rest of Europe.  We will remember that a few months ago there was a storm about the fees being charged for the Apple iPod.  Members may be aware the new BlackBerry is about to come out.  In Newry and the Netherlands it will be free, but in Navan it will be &euro;110 and the <Col N="234"/>contract prices will be higher again.  It is clearly another example where action is needed.  I ask the Leader to try to get the communications regulator and the aviation regulator to come to the House to explain exactly what they will do about this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to draw attention to the latest annual report of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As a result of the downturn in the economy, there are now 15% fewer cases going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but staff numbers have increased by 26% and the number of external consultants used has risen by 20.  It is clear the board needs to look again at its resource requirements.  I am not suggesting that redundancies are needed but I do suggest we consider putting placements or secondments from An Bord Plean&aacute;la into county halls nationwide.  Many county councils are reviewing their town plans and county development plans at present, and they could benefit from the expertise of members of the board.  There is now clearly an excess number of staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and we should consider placing some of them in county halls nationwide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The points on the need for a debate on the banking system have been well and regularly made in this House.  I am sure the Leader will afford us an opportunity with regard to the Finance Bill but there is a need for a particular debate in addition to that, as many Members have stated.  A number of factors have delayed this.  One is the production of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report for the Government as to the state of the loan books in many of the financial institutions.  Part of the problem with the banks is that the collateral they are claiming on many of their outstanding loans is probably falsified based on wildly exaggerated property values.  The Government, and the wider body politic, must have such information before we have a proper debate.  It is worth putting on record before we have such a debate that the United States has twice changed its policy on banking.  The United Kingdom has capitalised several of its banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland to the value of Stg&pound;21 billion, but it has not achieved the desired effect of additional lending within the system.  Regardless of when and how recapitalisation happens in our banking system, it must be properly directed in that there is additional lending and the reserves of the financial institutions are not held on to.</P>
        <P>The additional factors must be brought about, including better governance in the financial institutions and the people responsible for bringing about the financial crisis being held to account and questioned.  Major questions arise about whether they are the people who should help the financial sector get out of this situation.  The wider debate must include all those components.</P>
        <P>The Government was right in delaying making this decision until the last possible moment because these decisions have been made in other jurisdictions and they have not worked to date.  There is no panacea or magic wand.  If we are to get out of this situation the debate we have in the wider body politic must ensure that at least there is an indication that the response we take is the right approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>These late night crisis meetings regarding the banking situation are not doing us any good and I suggest there has been too much delay.  Everybody has made the case for a banking debate and a debate on the wider economy.  We are all concerned about the economy and the future of business within our economy.  We need to know whether the Government has in mind a State rescue plan or is it seeking a foreign cash injection.  If it is a State rescue plan, how does the Minister intend to proceed regarding the issue referred to by our leader on this side of the House?  If people are to be nominated to act in the public interest, <Col N="235"/>how will they get over the conflict of interest regarding company law?  Does the Minister have in mind &mdash; the sooner we know this the better &mdash; amending legislation to get over the difficulties in that regard?</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, a recapitalisation may not necessarily help our ailing economy, which is suffering so much, because it may not remove restrictive lending policies.  It may simply be used to add to the cash reserves to balance the ratios, but in any event we need to hear from the Leader in response to all the requests we are making on a daily basis.  When can we have the debate and, if the Minister for Finance cannot come to the House, we should not have to wait for the Finance Bill.  We should be able to have our own debate on these issues forthwith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I hope tomorrow we will see significant political developments in the North.  I seek a debate on Irish unity and welcome the new publication by Dr. Richard Humphreys, <i>Countdown to Unity: Debating Irish Reunification</i>, which was launched by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, yesterday.  It sets out practical steps, a road map and a programme on how reunification can be achieved in a peaceful manner.  Articles 2 and 3 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann refer to the fact that the State&rsquo;s objective is a peaceful reunification of the country, and Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s principle has always been a united Ireland.  To achieve unity it is incumbent upon us to explain to the Unionist community how a united island would be beneficial to us all.  We must be aware that any changes necessary to create this one nation would require sacrifices, but the sacrifices would be insignificant compared to the sacrifices of previous generations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am, but I am also seeking a debate on the fact that at the same time we seek to unite we also divide.  The electoral commission has again proposed that Leitrim should remain divided, despite the fact that 14,000 people signed a petition against it.  The constituency commission got 327 submissions, of which 241 related to Leitrim alone.  Senator John Ellis spoke many times in this House and throughout the country about the difficulties of being the sole Oireachtas Member from Leitrim, while the Oireachtas Members representing the Sligo, north Leitrim and Roscommon-South-Leitrim do an excellent job.  As the Cathaoirleach is well aware, we all prefer to be represented by our own county men and at this 11th hour I ask the Leader to seek fair representation for County Leitrim and intervene on behalf of the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to note the very good news today about an article in <i>The Lancet</i> outlining how a woman in Spain has become the first person in the world to be given a laboratory engineered organ.  This transplant operation was based on her own stem cells and did not require any immuno-suppressant drugs.  The good news, contrary to what some speakers said in this House last week, is that so much progress is being made in the area of adult stem cell research and related therapies that we have every reason to hope that the cures we seek can be achieved through ethical means and not through embryo destructive research.</P>
        <P>It is in that context that I hope to introduce a Bill in the House tomorrow, the Stem Cell Research (Protection of Human Embryos) Bill, which I hope will be taken during Private Members&rsquo; time next week.  I ask for the support of all sides of the House on that.  I note what Senator Daly has just said about a united Ireland.  Uniting a people is about more than eliminating the borders, it is about having policies that can unite people and that, in the area of research and medicine, can help us find cures with which we can all live.  That is important.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>I draw the attention of the Leader and the House to the excellent advertisement being run, thanks to Ruhama, on human trafficking which points out to people that to use a trafficked <Col N="236"/>person in prostitution is a criminal offence.  We had a debate on that at the time of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill.  It is incumbent on us to have another debate now in light of the fact that it appears Norway will follow the Swedish example in criminalising the use of a person in prostitution.  It is time we had another debate about how we protect people from exploitation in the sex industry.  I ask the Leader to make time available for that because the way we treat the most vulnerable people in our society at any stage of life is the true test of our civilisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the views in support of ethical research.  It does us no harm to remind ourselves frequently that there have been no successes with embryonic stem cell research.  All the research to date has indicated that the adult stem cells are the ones that are producing successful results.  We hear of the new alchemists spending millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money throughout the world trying to find some cure using embryonic cells, yet after decades there has been no positive result.</P>
        <P>I support those Senators who spoke about liquidity problems.  We have a capacity to help Irish jobs, and it is vital that we do so, that is, to buy Irish.  For the first time in a long time buying Irish has become directly associated with saving jobs in this country.  There is a campaign to encourage us to buy local.  Both of those campaigns are laudable and should be supported.  We should have a debate in the House at the earliest opportunity to encourage people to buy Irish to save Irish jobs this Christmas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the statements by Declan Ganley, the chairman of Libertas, to the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, which are reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today where he calls for an EU constitution of no more than 25 pages, presumably like the US constitution.  I do not know if this man is for real.  God bless America and the American constitution, but Europe is not America and it is not a federation as is established in the US constitution.  The history and political philosophy on which the European treaties are based and the evolution of the EU in the past 50 years is so distinct from America that there are no lessons on the form of treaty or constitution on which a Europe of 27 member states operates.  The European constitution and treaties accommodate 27 member states and 21 official languages, not to mention minority languages.  The accommodation of this diversity requires the type of treaties we have, including the treaty of Lisbon.  To tear up, as he suggests, 50 years of work on treaty building in Europe is off the wall.  I do not know if this man is for real.  The political structure in Europe is unique and is a model for the rest of the world.  When Mr. Ganley, also at the committee, talked about the political elite, he referred to the Heads of Government of 27 member states, all of whom who were democratically elected, unlike Mr. Ganley&rsquo;s elite of right-wing eurosceptics.  This House should bear this in mind.  I ask the Leader if he would like to comment on what Mr. Ganley said about the Lisbon treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator Hanafin, on the issues he raised, along with other speakers, about stem cell research and finance.  While there has been a great impetus over the past 24 to 48 hours to try to resolve the capital market situation and falling share prices, especially of the financial institutions, I am not sure what any injection of capital from Government will do about the extraordinary times in which we live and the recession.  Despite any cash injection, in whatever format or mechanism, we will still be in a very dark situation as we approach 2009 and throughout 2009.  I am deeply concerned about the impact the lack of finance available to business and households will have and what is likely to happen over the next few months.</P><Col N="237"/>
        <P>If there is a cash injection by Government over the next short period, the Leader must ensure he is informed and works with the Minister and others in the Department of Finance who speak to the banking institutions or the Financial Regulator.  This is very sensitive.  There must be some associated mechanism to ensure cash is made available to those who require it to prevent foreclosures on homes and businesses closing with a loss of employment.  Whatever we do to address the capital market difficulties, there must be some leverage to ensure we get the maximum benefit required as we approach the very difficult months ahead.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Leader will pursue my suggestion of a number of weeks ago about the importance of what Senator Hanafin said about buying Irish products and services.  I ask the Leader to enter discussions with other leaders in this House to see how we can do it individually, collectively and in our political groupings.  I will not ask the Leader to respond to that part of my question today but I ask him some day next week to brief me on the progress he has made with the other political groupings in this House on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on the case of Ms Pamela Izevbekhai.  Ireland has received a well-deserved slap in the face from the European Court of Human Rights on this matter.  I have been a Member of this House as we have discussed immigration legislation over a long number of years.  I do not believe this kind of circumstance was envisaged by any Member of the House.  I see the Leader nodding.  Decent people on the Government side tabled amendments to try to ensure this kind of thing would not happen.  It is not the intention of the Oireachtas that this woman be placed in such a circumstance.  One of her daughters has already died through a massive haemorrhage as a result of this barbarous procedure.  We intended that people in those circumstances should be protected.</P>
        <P>I do not intend, and would not be allowed, to criticise the judge.  He was well within his remit.  It was a timid judgement and perhaps the judges are telling us something &mdash; that they have rebuked us so often in the past for not securing people&rsquo;s human rights, they have given up.  The judge said the balance of convenience favoured enforcement.  That is an astonishing statement.  The &ldquo;balance of convenience&rdquo; against the life of a child.  I am sure he is right that the legal points can be discussed in the absence of the mother.  He said that only &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; would justify his intervening and these had not been provided.  He said to do otherwise would &ldquo;usurp&rdquo; the function assigned to the asylum system.  That is a valid and important point.  Those entrusted with the asylum system have proved themselves unfit.  When will the Immigration and Residence Bill come to the House?  That is a very dangerous, bad and defectively drafted Bill that will copper-fasten exactly this kind of thing and it must be amended in this House.</P>
        <P>I submitted an Adjournment debate matter which was not in time for today but which I hope will be for tomorrow.  It will concern Senator Callely, who very ably chaired a meeting of the Sub-committee on Human Rights of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  All the Members present were from Seanad &Eacute;ireann and this shows how actively we participate.  Senator Daly was there, and spoke very movingly.  This concerns the case of Roma gypsies in Kosovo, whom the United Nations has placed on a site seriously contaminated with lead.  Every child born there has degrees of lead poisoning that are off the medical scale.  Every one of them is born, and will be born, with irreversible brain damage.  This is nothing other than a death camp.  Will the Leader draw this to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and ask him to contact the UN?  Appallingly, this is done by the UN and a group of Christian churches which acted in good will but in ignorance of the situation.  It simply must be stopped.</P>

	<P>I compliment Senator Mullen on his intention to bring forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on stem cell research.  It is timely because there is a vacuum in the debate.  It is not enough to have sound bites on the Order of Business week in, week out.  The debate has become very disjointed and I look forward to hearing what Senator Mullen has to say and participating in the discussion.  There was radical, revolutionary news on the radio this morning about stem cell research and its results in Spain.  This seems to have been forgotten.  This was adult stem cell research and the recipient received a new windpipe.   Within ten days of that, the recipient was out at a dance in a nightclub and rang the surgeon to say everything was going well.  This is an amazing breakthrough.  In fairness to RTE, it presented it in that manner as well.  There is a possibility that the limited debate on embryonic stem cell research is distracting from the opportunities that exist for adult stem cell research.  If Senator Mullen&rsquo;s Bill gives us an opportunity to make a more detailed contribution to the debate, it will have served its purpose.  I compliment him on taking that initiative.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to debate the dreadful gangland murders in Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere.  It was indicated yesterday that surveillance legislation may be introduced before the summer of next year.  Why has it taken so long for the Minister to take action in respect of thugs and gangland murderers?  Why are sentences so short?  Why does the maximum sentence not last for more than ten or 12 years?  Why is the relevant sentence not 20 years?  Why is the Special Criminal Court not being used?  Why are these guys allowed to drive around in bulletproof BMWs?  Why are they allowed to live in local authority houses?  Why are their assets not seized?  Why have they been allowed to fly in the face of the law?  It seems to me that the Minister has been asleep.  Resources have not been provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It beggars belief that it has taken so long for the Minister to put in place the necessary legislation.  I welcome the decision to put in place more checkpoints, to arrest these guys and to seize their assets.</P>
        <P>I applaud the people of Limerick and the Munster rugby team for providing such a wonderful spectacle last night.  It was a complete contrast to what has been going on in some of the local authority housing estates in that city.  It was a demonstration of the wonderful spirit that exists in Limerick.  I applaud everyone concerned.</P>

	<P>I have visited a couple of secondary schools in the past few days.  I was disturbed to note that morale among the teaching profession is quite low.  Teachers are concerned about the implications of the cuts which will affect secondary schools.  I am aware of a number of schools that have sent notices to parents indicating they intend to withdraw extra-curricular activities like football, debating and games.  It is a matter of extraordinary seriousness.  It is well accepted that such activities are as essential, if not more so, to the education of young people as anything they may do academically.  I was interested to discover that teachers are worried about missing out on extra-curricular interaction with youngsters.  I ask the Leader to convey that to the Minister for Education and Science.  If teachers get out of the habit of being involved in extra-curricular activity, they may not readily return to such activity.  They may develop alternative lifestyles in future times.</P>
        <P>This is a matter of extraordinary seriousness because the activities to which I refer can act as a bridge between teachers and students.  They allow young students to escape their tension and stress.  They give young people an opportunity to develop in a different way.  People who do not perform academically often thrive outside the classroom.  Many people who excel academically also show excellence in sport.  It is a shame that such opportunities may be lost.  It is <Col N="239"/>wrong.  I appeal to the Leader to contact the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, about this minor issue.  He should make the point that the removal of extra-curricular activities such as football and other games would, in effect, undo years of progress in secondary education.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposal that we should have a general debate on education, with a particular focus on this issue.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Callely&rsquo;s comments on the banks.  I agree with him that the yardstick by which any arrangements with the banks should be measured should be the extent to which we extract a <i>quid pro quo</i> whereby interest rates are immediately passed on to ordinary consumers, small businesses are supported and a proactive lending policy is put in place throughout the country.  The needs of shareholders should not take pre-eminence again.</P>

	<P>As a teacher, I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly that teachers are very concerned.  Having said that, I would like to think sacrifices can be made.  I suggest that parents and teachers should work together in the short term until we come out of this downturn.  That is what I would say to teachers.  As a teacher, I have encouraged many of my former colleagues to try to work out some arrangement.  We do not want children to be deprived of extra-curricular activity.  As politicians, we should take the lead by pointing out to our teacher colleagues the road they should be going down in the short term.  I know it is not ideal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to think we could take such an approach.  All I am saying is that some sacrifices are needed in the short term.  Many teachers agree with me in that regard.</P>
        <P>I agree with the many Senators who have spoken about the problems in the banking sector.  I know the Leader is conscious that a full discussion is needed in the House if Members are to thrash out all the points that have been raised in the past couple of weeks.  The banks deserve the bad press they are getting at the moment.  It would be great to have a full debate in the Seanad, so that all the points can be aired once again.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a debate on adult stem cell research.  I am glad that we will get an opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with some of my colleagues who have expressed delight at the successful outcome of certain research, as reported today in <i>The Lancet</i>.  I welcome the news that a woman in Spain is making a good recovery following the procedure that was carried out.  I disagree with those who have suggested that this development should preclude or prevent the development of other sorts of research into the potential of stem cells to offer treatment or cures to people with chronic illnesses and conditions like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  I do not see how that follows.  As a woman, I am concerned about the strange fetishisation of the human embryo.</P>

	<P>I am rather uncomfortable about the apparent obsession with women&rsquo;s reproductive capacity that is displayed by some Members of this House.  I note that Senators on the other side have expressed their support for Senator Mullen&rsquo;s legislation.  While I do not imagine I will support it, I look forward to seeing Members on the Government side crossing the floor &mdash; one needs to put one&rsquo;s money where one&rsquo;s mouth is &mdash; to support the Bill when Senator Mullen introduces it.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>I would like to ask the Leader for a debate on a far more pressing matter, which has been mentioned by Senators Fitzgerald and Norris today and which I raised yesterday.  I refer to the need to allow female genital mutilation to be used as a ground when people from other countries are applying to be granted leave to remain here, which has arisen in the context of the case of Ms Pamela Izevbekhai.  All of us should be concerned that her deportation would have been allowed under Irish law, as interpreted by the High Court, if it had not been for the welcome intervention of the European Court of Human Rights.  I wrote to the Minister yesterday to ask him to give Ms Izevbekhai and her daughters leave to remain here on humanitarian grounds.  I hope other colleagues on both sides of the House will put similar pressure on the Minister.  That is very important.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the implications of the budget cuts on people with disabilities.  I note that Senator Ross has tabled an Adjournment debate matter concerning the Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College.  I share his concern about the apparent ending of the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s core funding for the centre.  Having worked with the centre, I am familiar with the important work it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be discussed on the Adjournment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support all my colleagues who rightly condemned the banks for what they are not doing.  I would like to raise a similar issue.  I am a customer, as are many people in the midlands, of a television service company and if one does not use a direct debit to pay the subscription, one is charged an additional &euro;3 per month.  If the service is not provided, customers must do without it but, meanwhile, the company has their money.  This is very high-handed and I contend it is illegal.  I would like something done about it.  Will the appropriate Minister come to the House to debate this and related issues?</P>
        <P>I recently spoke to an individual in the garage business.  People can say what they like about that business but it makes a contribution to the economy.  I asked the individual how his business was doing and he replied that it was great.  He said he can sell a multitude of second-hand cars but cannot secure a cent in finance for them.  This issue must be addressed.  Every Members of both Houses stood behind the banks when we thought it was the right thing to do.  I could have done with being in bed at the time because I was dying with the flu, but I stayed the course with other colleagues.  We did what we had to do, but we are not getting the appropriate response from the financial institutions.  They are not doing what they are supposed to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, for a debate on the education cuts and the impact the recent budget will have on education.  While I have the greatest of respect for Senator Ormonde and I appreciate she was a teacher, these cuts are about the children and the impact they will have on their education, extracurricular activities <Col N="241"/>and their educational development, not about their parents and teachers.  The Senator referred to sacrifice.  The sacrifice is not about parents or teachers but about the children and how they will be educated.  We should not sacrifice children and their future education in any budget.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s comments about criminal gangs and the devastation they have caused in Limerick and many other cities.  It is time for a debate on the criminal justice system so that criminals realise the law of the land will not allow this sub-culture to continue because it is causing devastation in our communities.  The only business that is thriving in this country is the drug trade and that is a sad indictment of our society in these modern times.  As a society, we must take responsibility because we are creating demand.  However, it is the responsibility of the Government and the authorities to ensure these criminals and crime lords do not get away with this dangerous business.</P>
        <P>Recently two deadly cargos were landed off the south-west coast.  Ireland is an island nation and where next on our coastline will be targeted by drug barons to land their deadly cargos?  This problem will not disappear and I seek a debate on the resources of the Naval Service, the Customs and Excise service and the Garda to ensure our coastline is well protected and that similar cargos to those landed in Cork in the past few months will not get through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I supported the call for recapitalisation of the banks but that must only happen if it will lead to additional lending to provide the necessary cashflow for all the businesses in serious trouble.  I referred yesterday to business owners in Galway who are wondering whether they will make it to Christmas.  Strict terms and conditions must be laid down for recapitalisation, otherwise it will not address the purpose for which it is needed.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the call for a debate on female genital mutilation.  I was appalled by the decision of the High Court yesterday but I was delighted by the intervention of the European Court of Human Rights.  This woman lost a daughter in 1994 to this awful practice.  Many of us have young daughters.  Can we imagine that we would in any way condone or support this practice, which is absolutely outrageous?</P>
        <P>Today I will publish the results of a survey of 115 public representatives on education.  I conducted the survey prior to the budget and the main concerns of public representatives, as pointed out to them by parents and teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not here to promote anyone&rsquo;s survey.  The Senator must ask a question on the Order of Business.  Time is up and I would appreciate a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Pupil-teacher ratios and overcrowded classrooms are the main concerns.  The main change that is sought is broader curriculum choice, which means more teachers.  Ironically, these issues were affected by the cuts the Government introduced in the budget.  As Senator Coffey said, this issue is not about the teachers, it is about the effect on children.  When will we have the debate I have called for repeatedly for almost five weeks?  The Leader promised the debate but we still do not know the date.  I look forward to his reply.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Boyle, Coghlan, Ormonde, Glynn and Healy Eames called for various matters to be discussed and given importance.  Matters pertaining to the budget can be discussed in the House during the debate on the Finance Bill.  However, I am endeavouring to have a major debate where Senators can express their views to the Minister for Finance, early next week if at all possible, because we are awaiting the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which is with the Government, and other events that will happen this week.</P>

	<P>We will have the benefit of those, hopefully, to express our views and assist in any way we can.</P>
        <P>Calls were made for a debate on banking issues, which the Deputy Leader correctly outlined in his contribution.  The lifeblood of business is the availability of credit, particularly at Christmas time.  Every business in the retail sector needs increased stock and, therefore, additional overdraft facilities.  This has been the case for many years.  In the main, retailers are being assisted but I understand from my inquiries that smaller retailers are not being facilitated.  I read the article about the lady who had a &euro;5,000 overdraft and who highlighted at the weekend that she needed a &euro;10,000 facility.  That is not the spirit of banking we have all come to know.  Everyone in business in Ireland has done well in the past ten or 12 years.  As I often said, we were the envy of the world.  What was gained should not be lost but should be appreciated.</P>
        <P>Hopefully, the events of the next 48 hours will put confidence back into the retail sector because the word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; does not exist in that sector at present.  I know this from experience and from meeting so many people.  Senator McFadden will be aware of this in our area.  The lack of confidence is widespread in the midlands.  We all have confidence in the Taoiseach.  We all are honoured the Taoiseach has come from the midlands and we are looking forward to getting our fair share, to say the least of it, in the coming years.  However, we must put confidence back into the marketplace and I hope the events of the next few days will help in no small way in that regard.  I would not like to say any more about that at present.</P>
        <P>I agree with colleagues on female genital mutilation and the plight of Pamela and her family.  I am pleased the Government has confirmed it will hold this decision until after 10 December and the European courts consider this urgent matter.  It would take a tear from a stone watching television last night to see the human hurt and the appalling circumstances in which this woman finds herself.  As has been said, having lost a daughter already and with two other beautiful young girls in her family, she is experiencing a terribly distressful time.  We in Ireland have been always proud of our stance on humanitarian issues.  Please God, maybe this will come through at the 11th hour for this poor unfortunate lady who is experiencing this difficulty.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, O&rsquo;Reilly, Ormonde, Coffey and Healy-Eames called for a debate on education.  I am endeavouring to have this take place.  Hopefully, by tomorrow morning I might be able to let the House know when this will take place.  Senator Ormonde gave us the benefit of her views this morning, as of course did the representative of the teachers here, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who has excelled in his career in what he has done for the teaching profession and his membership of this House.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has been always to the fore in giving the House, the country and the Government the benefit of his experience.</P>

        <P>For example, teachers have made an immense contribution to the Gaelic Athletic Association over the years and, in my view, have given us the best amateur organisation in the world.

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that this is the definition section, it is a missed opportunity not to include within it a new statutory definition of homelessness.  I made this point on Second Stage. The definition of homelessness currently does not include those who are in short-term rental accommodation.  A broader definition modelled on the European-wide definition to include persons who experience inadequate or insecure accommodation, such as victims or survivors of sexual violence or so-called &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; violence should be included in the Bill.  No formal amendments have been tabled on the definition section but it is important that the Government consider on Report Stage inserting a definition of homelessness in this section of the Bill.  I hope to table amendments in this regard on Report Stage and I will also seek the inclusion in the definition section of an amendment on homeless action plans.  It is important that we have a provision relating to this in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="245"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik raised precisely the point I wish to raise.  I find it astonishing there is no definition of homelessness in this section.  We are relying on previous and clearly inadequate definitions.  I am glad this matter has been raised and I strongly support what Senator Bacik stated.  I will table amendments and I will be happy to support amendments tabled by Senator Bacik.  It is important that this matter is cleared up and that the matter of homelessness is made central in the Bill.  Homeless action plans are inadequately dealt with in the legislation as framed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, as a former colleague in this House and as a good Minister of State, will be receptive to these matters and I am sure he will take on board that the principle function of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is to amend legislation.  If he is agreeable to amendments, it is in this House they should be taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues in their call for a definition of homelessness to be inserted in the Bill.  I also wish to give notice that I intend to table amendments on Report Stage on obliging housing authorities to prepare housing action plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael also would like to see included a definition of homelessness.  A housing Bill is passing through the Oireachtas without a clear definition of homelessness which is one of the most significant challenges facing us with regard to housing.  Will the Minister of State take on board the views of the House?  It is clear that strong views are held on a clear definition of homelessness.  Unless we know what we are talking about we cannot put in place the measures to address this challenge.</P>

	<P>The House will have an opportunity to debate this matter when we discuss section 10.  I commented on this matter on Second Stage and I stated that I am satisfied that the current statutory definition of homelessness which is contained in the 1988 Act is sufficient.  We will carry out a review of the definition for operational purposes.  Furthermore in the context of developing a new assessment for the need for social housing support we will provide for a nationwide consistent standard and an objective suite of criteria.  The details of such criteria are best suited to secondary legislation and this is what the Bill proposes.  We will have further opportunity to deal with this matter as we progress through the Bill today.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment is intended to replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the section with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  This would place a legal obligation on housing authorities to provide housing services which would significantly strengthen the legal obligations provided for in section 20, on which I have tabled amendments.  Section 20 provides for the range of services which housing authorities will provide.  Some of us argued for a constitutional right to housing which would be elevated above legislation.  While it would not go so far, it is important to place, within this legislation, a more onerous requirement on housing authorities to provide this type of service.  Will the Minister consider accepting this amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of section 10 is to provide a summary of the main functions of the housing authorities and to act as a lead-in provision to the requirement to make housing service plans as provided for in sections 14 to 18.  While I appreciate the objective of the proposed amendment, it would not have the impact envisaged by the Senator.  It could oblige an authority to put in train arrangements to deliver support which is not required.  I <Col N="247"/>consider the most appropriate way to proceed in this area is to develop procedures whereby an individual or household can apply for social housing support, have their eligibility and need for support assessed and determined in a consistent and fair manner and be allocated to dwellings appropriate to their needs in good time.  The provisions of the Bill, including section 10, provide for a coherent set of arrangements for achieving this and I cannot accept the proposed amendment which, if made, would not add to this process.  I call on the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>Section 10(<i>a</i>)(iv) lists sales or consents to sales under Part 3 of the Bill, that is, the incremental purchase scheme as a housing support forming one of three specific elements of the housing services provided by the housing authority under the housing Acts.  However, the social housing support is also listed in section 10(<i>a</i>)(i) as a form of housing support and elements of the social housing support are listed separately in section 19(2).  As sales or consents to sales under an incremental purchase are listed as social housing support in section 19(2)(c), they should not be listed as a stand alone housing support in section 10(<i>a</i>).  Hence the proposed deletion of section 10(<i>a</i>)(iv).</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom a l&eacute;iri&uacute; nach bhfuil m&eacute; s&aacute;sta n&aacute;r ghlac an tAire St&aacute;it agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; ar thaobh an Rialtais le leas&uacute; Uimh. 3, a chuir m&eacute; si&oacute;s chun br&uacute; a chur ar na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go gcuirfidh siad seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il &oacute; thaobh tith&iacute;ocht sa St&aacute;it seo.</P>
        <P>I wish to register my disappointment that amendment No. 3 was not accepted by the Minister and his Government colleagues.  It was an important amendment that would provide for a rights-based approach in accessing housing services.  It is clear from international best practice that where a rights-based approach is taken to public service provision, including housing, the service provision is more effective and unequal access to services is greatly reduced, resulting in a fairer and more equitable society.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment which replaces a section of the Bill with a different section on the basis that amendment No. 30 would be accepted.  Amendment No. 30 is the substantive amendment and applies to section 20, page 16, lines 42 and 43.  It seeks to provide a new definition of homelessness.  At present, homelessness is defined under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  The definition has merit but it is far too restrictive and fails to capture the reality of homelessness.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The premise of the amendment is very simple.  The first step in solving a problem lies in its definition.  This applies to social policy and legislation as much as anything else in life.  If we are serious about reducing and eventually ending homelessness, we must work from an agreed and comprehensive legal definition.  Across the European Union, NGOs and academics use what is known as the European typology on homelessness and housing exclusion or ETHOS definition of homelessness.  This includes people defined as &ldquo;roofless&rdquo;, such as rough sleepers, people who are homeless, such as those living in emergency accommodation, and those living at risk of homelessness, whether in unsuitable or overcrowded accommodation or experiencing domestic violence.</P>
        <P>The amendment seeks to incorporate the ETHOS definition of homelessness into law by retaining the valuable language in the existing definition while adding the broader ETHOS typology.  This is the definition used by voluntary service providers across the country and by the Homeless Agency in Dublin.  Interestingly, even the Government&rsquo;s new homelessness strategy includes a commitment to review the operational application of the existing definition in line with ETHOS, and includes a detailed explanation of the typology in the appendices of the strategy.  Unfortunately, the Government has decided against the new legal definition.  That makes no sense.  I urge the Minister and the Members of the House to support the amendment.</P>
        <P>Finally, with regard to the new homelessness strategy, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008 &mdash; 2013, I am deeply disappointed that the Government has not brought forward any amendments to incorporate the legislative commitments in that strategy into this Bill.  In particular, I wish to highlight the need to place both the homeless fora and homeless action plans on a statutory footing as a matter of urgency.  The homelessness strategy seeks to end long-term homelessness by 2010.  However, time is passing <Col N="249"/>quickly and if it is to be successful, it must be based on a firm and clear legal footing.  I intend to bring forward an amendment on this issue on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>I wish to stress Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for this Bill.  My amendments are proposed in a positive and constructive manner.  My intention is to strengthen this Bill and its intent, which is to ensure better provision of housing services to those in need in order to build safe and sustainable homes and communities.  The problems of homelessness can be turned around.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s partner in Government, the Green Party, has been shamefully quiet on this issue and has a heavy responsibility to end the wrong of homelessness.  Every night that one of our people must sleep rough is the fault of every Government Minister and backbencher.  They have the power to end homelessness but they choose not to.  There is no excuse.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party must remember their political mandates and who gave them that mandate.  A substantial, prosperous economy can be built only on foundations that are just and equal.  The Government parties might not recognise this, but the people do.  It is time the Government listened to the people.  I urge the Minister to listen to my contribution and support amendments Nos. 5 and 30, which would provide for a new definition of homelessness in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Doherty.  He has done us a service by providing a definition of homelessness for the Bill.  I am sure Members on this side of the House will put forward amendments and if I do not put them forward, I will certainly support those who do.</P>
        <P>It is essential to have this definition of homelessness.  I wish to comment on the wording of the amendment.  The first thing one notices is that there is a sliding scale; it is gradated.  Subsection (<i>a</i>) states, &ldquo;(<i>a</i>) a person who has no accommodation available to them other than a night shelter, a public place or external space&rdquo;.   That is the extreme, but regrettably we know these people exist.  There are people within 100 yards of this building who are homeless and who have no place to go.  One such person is known to me and he has chosen to remain homeless.  It is very difficult to know what to do in those circumstances.  There are others, and with the increasingly hostile economic climate there will be many more.  For this reason it is very important we address the situation of homelessness very clearly, directly and specifically.</P>
        <P>I agree with the definition of homelessness provided by Senator Doherty with one reservation.  I suggest when he tables the amendment on Report Stage, as I imagine he will if the Minister does not accept it, Senator Doherty might reconsider the question of people residing in mobile homes because there are people who live in perfectly good, adequate and decent mobile homes.  There is something unexpectedly snobbish about this coming from Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is almost as if we were dealing with trailer trash.  Such people are not all Sarah Palins; there are some very decent people.  I suggest Senator Doherty might re-examine the business of mobile homes.  There are very good quality, well-maintained and comfortable mobile homes in which people live a quite adequate life.  I do not believe they would be flattered by being described as homeless.  With that reservation I support the amendment.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to consider a definition of homelessness.  I believe we are only taking Committee Stage of the Bill today and that we will not consider Report Stage.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will have time to consider the question of a definition of homelessness.  He would do us a service if he provided a definition and he should not allow it to go to the Lower House.  The Minister of State was a Member of this House and <Col N="250"/>we have been treated with scant respect by it in recent days.  I believe he would be doing the political system a favour if he either provided a definition of homelessness himself or accepted the one proposed by Senator Doherty, by Senator Bacik, who has indicated she will provide one, by me or a combination of all three with, I am sure, the support of Labour and Fine Gael and the moral support of the soldiers of destiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Doherty&rsquo;s amendment and I echo the words of Senator Norris on this matter.  It is crucial a more comprehensive definition of homelessness is provided.  I said this on Second Stage and I repeated it earlier.  I am grateful to the make room campaign led by the four national voluntary organisations working in the area of homelessness and housing, namely, Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Simon Community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been very helpful to several of us in working on the Bill.  It is important there is a more comprehensive definition of homelessness.  I say this, as did Senator Doherty, in the spirit of supporting and broadly welcoming the Bill, as I have previously said.  A Bill dealing with housing in such a comprehensive manner is welcome.  However, there is an omission and it would be a missed opportunity if we did not provide a better definition of homelessness.</P>
        <P>In July of this year during a debate on housing, the Minister of State discussed the Government&rsquo;s new homeless strategy and its key objectives which are the elimination of long-term occupation of emergency homeless facilities, the elimination of the need to sleep rough by 2010 and to prevent the occurrence of homelessness as far as possible.  These are very important aspirations, the attainment of which could be assisted by a proper definition of homelessness.</P>
        <P>I note the assessment of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2005 of slightly more than 3,000 people experiencing homelessness.  This is regarded by those in the voluntary sector who provide homeless services as an underestimate of the number of people who should be termed homeless.  These organisations are of the view that the 2002 figures, which are in excess of 5,000 persons, may be a more accurate representation of homelessness.</P>
        <P>To conduct the necessary assessments, to further the homeless strategy and to provide a statutory basis for homeless action plans, it is important to have a statutory definition of homelessness that is comprehensive and on which everyone agrees.  I urge the Minister of State to consider these comments and adopt such a definition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party supports this Bill.  Our amendments are tabled with the intention of improving the thrust of the legislation.  I compliment Senator Doherty on providing a definition of homelessness and the Labour Party will support its inclusion.  Clarity is required and we have seen from the exchange between Senators Doherty and Norris that there are issues relating to mobile homes and overcrowded dwellings.  Regarding mobile homes, I understand Senator Doherty refers to the type of mobile homes found in people&rsquo;s back gardens which are without access to sanitation or water supplies.  These are in place because the eldest son or daughter of the family cannot avail of housing elsewhere.  As Senator Norris noted, there are examples of very good mobile homes, linked to sanitation supply, near shops and which are in effect reasonable dwellings.  However, the definition should have greater clarity.  The mobile homes referred to in the amendment are more likely to be unserviced and in place because of a real need on the part of the occupants.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>Regarding the definition of overcrowding, there are many cases of which Senators are aware whereby young families must share rooms in their parents&rsquo; houses.  In such cases the young people concerned may start a family and may be unable to find accommodation.  In some cases they end up sharing a bed with their young children because of the lack of social and affordable houses in certain areas.  This issue must be addressed.  At present overcrowding is usually just taken as one criterion in the assessment for whether a person should be housed from the social housing list.  We need to strengthen the definition and I welcome the inclusion of this amendment, which I support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is generally agreed that this is a positive and progressive Bill dealing with housing.  It would be a shame for it to progress beyond the House without a clear definition of homelessness.  It is a significant challenge which we face and this is an ideal opportunity to address that challenge.  This amendment serves to define and clearly enshrine or acknowledge in legislation what it means to be homeless.  If we are to seek resources for housing plans or local authorities, we must acknowledge in legislation at the outset that homelessness is a problem and it must be clearly defined and understood.  We also support this amendment.</P>
        <P>Many Senators outlined their concerns on homelessness on Second Stage.  One need only look around the streets near Leinster House at night to find clear evidence of what some people live through in this day and age, which is a very sad indictment of the system.</P>
        <P>I refer to the voluntary and community agencies working at the coalface to deal with homelessness.  Senator Bacik already mentioned Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community and Threshold.  These organisations work daily with various housing authorities and agencies and they see at first hand the shortfalls in the system.  These organisations make recommendations for the good of those who are homeless and they are the voice of such people.  I compliment the manner in which they have engaged with the parliamentary system and the Oireachtas on this Bill, as they speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.  They raise the awareness among Senators, Deputies, civil servants and the Department of those in need and they do a very good job.</P>
        <P>We support the amendment for this very reason.  It clearly defines homelessness and I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendment as it can only strengthen what is already a very positive Bill.  It is possible to build a consensus in the House and in the D&aacute;il when the Bill goes there.  This amendment can only strengthen the legislation and provide a stronger document.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the comments of my colleagues.  This is a very good Bill, but there should be a statutory definition of homelessness and it is a pity there is no mention of homelessness in it, given there are so many homeless people.  I understand more than 5,000 people are in this position.  People are moving from the house of one relative to another, carrying their belongings in a refuse bag and sleeping on couches.  The Minister of State opened a very good refuge in Mullingar last week.  The people in that refuge are homeless and they have nowhere to go.  These people need to have their rights defined clearly by this Bill so I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary that a Bill on housing does not contain a definition of homelessness and has little or no mention of homelessness.  The Minister of State should take on board the amendments that we have put forward.  People are putting forward amendments to improve the Bill.  We would welcome the acceptance of such amendments or an assurance from the Minister of State that he will put down an amendment on Report Stage <Col N="252"/>to deal with homelessness.  We certainly cannot let the Bill go through the House without a proper definition of homelessness.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that 3,000 people are on the streets, but the agencies claim the figure is much higher than that.  I would be inclined to believe the agencies that are working with homeless people across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Doherty go bhfuil an leas&uacute; i mB&eacute;arla agus mar sin beidh an freagra i mB&eacute;arla.</P>
        <P>In its new homeless strategy, the Government has decided that the statutory definition of homelessness will not be changed.  However, we will review how the definition is applied operationally, for example, to ensure consistency in its application across local authorities.  This has been made clear in the homeless strategy and in the course of engagement with representatives of service providers in the make room alliance.</P>
        <P>Work is being undertaken by the Homeless Agency, in partnership with the Centre for Housing Research, to develop a position paper on a common operational definition for the Dublin area.  This paper will form part of a review to be undertaken through the cross-departmental team on homelessness, in consultation with the national housing consultative committee.  FEANTSA has devised a typology, entitled ETHOS, to assist in the understanding of housing exclusion and the risk of homelessness.  To ensure awareness of groups that may be at serious risk of homelessness, reference is made to the wider ETHOS typology by the Homeless Agency and by non-governmental bodies.  This is relevant to the planning and implementation of effective responses to homelessness, particularly in the context of prevention.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to amend the definition of homelessness and I ask the Senator to withdraw amendment No. 30 and the consequential amendments Nos. 5 and 52.  There are other elements of amendment No. 52 which are the same as amendment No. 53 and these can be dealt with later.</P>
        <P>The statutory definition of homelessness is set out in the Housing Act 1988.  It defines a person as homeless if:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) there is no accommodation available which, in the opinion of the authority, he, together with any other person who resides normally with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him, can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of;</P>
        <P LI="1">or</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) he is living in a hospital, county home, night shelter or other such institution, and is so living because he has no accommodation of the kind referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>), and he is, in the opinion of the authority, unable to provide accommodation from his own resources.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This definition is generally interpreted as including people living in temporary or insecure accommodation, people living in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and hostels, people in HSE accommodation because there is no other accommodation available, rough sleepers and victims of domestic violence.</P>
        <P>The suggested definition by the Senator in certain cases seems to deal with categories of persons who are possibly at risk of homelessness, but who are not actually homeless.  For instance, a person whose house is repossessed might be able to source private rented accommodation with the assistance of rent supplement in certain cases.  This may also be true for some of the other categories mentioned.  Some of the other categories in paragraph (<i>c</i>) would be included anyway in a general assessment of housing need, such as for persons in unfit <Col N="253"/>housing.  There could also be difficulties with statutorily categorising all persons in mobile homes as homeless as this would not be acceptable to Traveller groups.</P>
        <P>I launched the homeless strategy in August and this is the first serious attempt by the Government to address the issue of homelessness.  The strategy has very clear aims, but it will not be implemented unless we have an implementation plan.  That plan will be made available before the end of the year.  It is very important that we have the implementation plan and the consultation process is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I indicated that I hope to bring forward amendments on the homeless action plan during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the House.  I will deal with that on a statutory basis.  I ask people to see things from my position.  People are often in emergency accommodation for up to eight years so I have brought forward the homeless strategy with that in mind.  One of the main aims of the strategy is that nobody will remain in emergency accommodation for more than six months and that we will deal with homelessness and sleeping rough by the end of 2010.  That involves many stakeholders and I am involved in a series of meetings with them all.  I have met some of them many times.  We have a half-day meeting coming up soon with many of the stakeholders, where we hope to finalise our discussions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very committed to this.  In those Estimates for which I have responsibility, it is one of the areas where I have increased the allocation, by 5%, for next year.  Almost &euro;100 million will be available to deal with homelessness in 2009, made up of &euro;62 million from my Department, over &euro;30 million from the HSE and the remainder from local authorities.  I am very committed to the issue of homelessness.  The organisations involved have given public recognition of that.  The homelessness issue will be dealt with in the implementation plan, which will be put on a statutory footing.  I await our final discussions on that plan.</P>

While I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, I do not agree that a definition of homelessness as outlined in amendment No. 30 should not be included in the Bill.  The original definition of homelessness is too narrow.  It does not address the reality on the ground.  Given that the Minister of State has clearly said that the Government has no intention of altering the statutory definition of homelessness, I have no option but to press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am heartened by some of what the Minister of State says, but I am disappointed with his response to the definition.  I would like some information on that.  I know there is a definition in the 1998 Act, but that dates from 20 years ago.  We now have a more sophisticated and targeted approach in these matters.  I would not like to think that we have not learned anything over the past 20 years that would be helpful in providing a definition of homelessness.  I assume it is automatically carried over from that Bill.  Perhaps the Minister of State will advise me how that is done technically because I do not see any definition here.  It may be that it is included technically, but I would like to know how and where that definition is carried over from the 1998 Act.  I am sure the Minister of State is correct in saying that it is, but I am not sure how.  It would be helpful therefore if he would explain that.  We will continue with this because we are disappointed.</P>
        <P>I completely concur with my colleagues who have referred to the work of the make room group, as well as the four principal organisations: Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community and Threshold.  The Minister of State said he has been in discussions with what he calls stakeholders, but that word can mean various things.  I assume that among the stakeholders would be this coalition of particular people who do remarkable work <Col N="254"/>on our behalf, including the menial but essential job of providing soup and blankets.  Is the Minister of State saying that the principal groups delivering services to the homeless are satisfied with the definition?  I would be very interested to know that.  It will weaken our case if he tells me that these people are satisfied because they are the stakeholders, apart from homeless people themselves.  If the Minister of State tells me that they are happy with the absence of an updated definition of homelessness, I will take the opportunity to consult them this evening.  If the Minister of State is correct and they say &ldquo;Fine&rdquo;, so be it.  I will have to withdraw my point.</P>
        <P>I was pleased that the Minister of State spotted the argument about mobile homes.  There are people who are happy enough in mobile homes and that issue can be met.  I am sure the combined intelligence of my friends, Senators Doherty and Bacik, and even my own wit, might come up with something to cope with that while still covering vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by the clear way in which the Minister of State dealt with the situation.  It is obvious that he is on top of the job regarding his portfolio.  I am 64 years old, however, and have difficulty in hearing.  Therefore when he is making an important point, will he emphasise it a bit more for the elderly among us who may be hard of hearing, although not homeless or inadequate in other ways?</P>
        <P>I will end on a positive note.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on emergency accommodation.  Although some people have been in such accommodation for years, he has given the House a commitment that no Irish citizen shall be in emergency accommodation for more than six months.  That is the ambition the Minister of State proposes to realise and I welcome it.  I will be most interested to hear if his discussions with the people who deliver these services have entitled him to say that they are happy with this definition of homelessness.</P>

	<P>As regards mobile homes, I suggest that it is an opt-in.  It is not a compulsory definition, which may annoy or upset people if they take it as a slur.  If an individual or group thinks that because they are living in a mobile home they are homeless, let them opt in to the clause.  It is not beyond the wit of the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers to come up with a wording that would achieve the obvious aims of what we are trying to do.  </P>
        <P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and I serve notice that we will be tabling amendments on Report Stage specifically on the obligations of local authorities to produce service plans for the homeless.  If Senator Doherty wishes to push this amendment, he will have our support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to venture a suggestion on mobile homes, although not necessarily an intellectual one.  Some qualifying word could be countenanced so that &ldquo;mobile home&rdquo; would not be included as an absolute term.  One could refer instead to &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo;, &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo;  or &ldquo;insecure&rdquo; mobile homes, to provide for the scenario whereby people want to be in mobile homes.  They might otherwise feel it is in some way judgmental to suggest that mobile homes are automatically unsatisfactory, insecure or unsuitable accommodation.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s full answer but I am disappointed that he will not take on board our comments about the definition of homelessness.  While he does not feel the statutory definition requires updating or changing, I understood him to say that he will review its application in an operational sense.  I would like some clarification from the Minister because I am not quite sure what that may mean in practice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the last question first.  Senators are aware of the strategy on homelessness, but it is not worth the paper it is written on unless there is an implementation plan with a statutory back-up.  That is the process I am involved in at the moment with all the stakeholders and it is our definite intention to publish the plan before the end of the year.  We want to implement it, which means working to get people out of emergency accommodation and into either independent or assisted living under the rental accommodation scheme or other schemes.  It is important to work on a co-operative basis, which is why I mentioned the stakeholders who have dealt with homelessness over the years on a voluntary basis.  I am now attempting to assist them not alone with a strategy but also with a planned legislative framework so that people will not be in emergency accommodation for more than six months.  I have good reason for saying that because I worked in the health services and the local authority system and it is not good for anyone&rsquo;s self-esteem to remain in emergency accommodation for a long period.  It gives them no opportunity to re-establish their independent identities, which many of them have lost, nor to enter relationships.  I am keen therefore that emergency accommodation should be just that, for emergencies only, and that we will move on from there.</P>
        <P>Stakeholders have been informed of the Government&rsquo;s decision regarding the 1998 Act, which is mentioned in section 10 of this Bill.  However, the 1998 Act and all other housing legislation work in conjunction with one another.  That definition of homelessness therefore forms part of the law of the land.  All the Acts from 1996 to 2008 will remain in force.  The statutory definition of homelessness is a very good one that has withstood the test of time.  The difficulty is not about the definition, but that we have not dealt with homelessness in a broad way.  We have allowed that situation to develop over a long number of years, although I am not blaming anybody.  I thank the voluntary organisations that have held the line in providing such services.  We have not done it in a way that has allowed people to get into independent living or assisted living.</P>
        <P>According to the April night count, 104 people were living rough in this city.  While I do not want anybody living rough, we will have a small cohort of people who will not take a bed &mdash; we know this from the organisations on the ground.  That said, we want to make sure they are offered a bed and that they are looked after if they do not want to take it.  When we remove people from emergency accommodation, this frees up such accommodation.  This will give us an opportunity to have a better range and suite of emergency accommodations than is perhaps available at this time.</P>
        <P>As I said, we informed the organisations.  I do not want to speak for them as they can speak for themselves and I will not talk on anyone else&rsquo;s behalf.  They are aware of my position and they continue to work with me.  If I were to interpret it, I believe the implementation plan is the important part for them.  We have arranged for a half-day meeting with all the stakeholders in the Custom House some time in the coming weeks, and they have agreed to that.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, having considered this in its entirety, I am happy the existing suite of housing legislation puts us on a new path.  There is much in this Bill, for example, with regard to the <Col N="256"/>incremental loans scheme.  There is a broad range, although we are focusing on homes.  The suite of supports available will be adequate and it provides the framework for assessing housing needs, which includes homelessness, as far as I am concerned.  The final response before its implementation will be the plan, which I am sure will be debated in this House when it is available.  As I said, I hope to have it before the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In my discussions with the four principal elements of the Make Room grouping, they were extremely positive about the Bill and about the Minister of State&rsquo;s attitude.  There is no question of a dispute or anything like that.  However, I could not help noticing that the Minister did not actually say they are happy with the definition of homelessness.  In fact, he scrupulously avoided it.  Perhaps he is correct &mdash; he has just said he cannot speak for them &mdash; but the rest of his language is also instructive.  He said they have been informed of the decision of the Government and that they continue to work with us.  That does not reassure me 100%.</P>
        <P>I am not suggesting there is any tension between the Minister of State and these groups because they are all moving very much in the same direction.  One of the most heartening things is the Minister of State&rsquo;s very clear commitment to an implementation plan.  I would support him in what I understand him to say, namely, that any amount of definitions are no use unless one has an implementation plan.  This House on all sides will support the Minister of State in the most rapid development and action on the implementation plan.</P>
        <P>If I might presume to one slight correction, when the Minister of State directed my attention to section 10 he referred to 1998.  The Act in which I am most interested is that of 1988, not 1998.  It is an understandable confusion as there are so many.  However, it is reasonable to let the record show it is the definition contained in the Act of 1988.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 1988.  I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me, Senator.  I asked Members coming to the Chamber not to have phones with them.  A phone is switched on and it is not fair to those trying to record the proceedings.  Senator Doherty should proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a missed opportunity.  The existing definition of homelessness in the 1988 Act is too narrow.  The Minister of State talked about the ETHOS definition but this does not incorporate that broader definition.  He used phrases regarding the definition such as &ldquo;can be interpreted to mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;in my view&rdquo;.  This amendment seeks to make clear it is no longer a matter of the Minister&rsquo;s view or interpretation but that the definition of homelessness would be clear.</P>
        <P>With regard to the mobile home issue, a suitable formula of words can be found to deal with any concerns Members have.  I want to state clearly that it is nothing to do with Sinn F&eacute;in snobbery or thinking that people who are at risk of homelessness or who are homeless are trailer trash or anything like that.  I bring these amendments in a constructive manner and with a clear agenda, namely, to strengthen the Bill and to deal with the issue of homelessness.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State talked of &ldquo;The Way Home&rdquo; strategy and the ending of homelessness by 2010, which is just 13 months away.  There is a need for legislation to be brought forward.  He referred to the implementation plan.  Of course, everybody is concerned about the implementation plan because they want to see action but they want to see action on some basis or <Col N="257"/>according to some definition.  Will it be the narrow definition of homelessness or the broader one that has been accepted and implemented by agencies working in this city and other areas?  I have no doubt the groups at the coalface would like to have the broader definition of homelessness.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this matter and to accept the amendment or indicate he will come back with his own amendment that would be in keeping with the spirt of my amendment.  If not, I will press the amendment.  I am glad of the support indicated from other Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not accept that the definition of homelessness in the 1988 Act is inadequate.  It is very clear and deals with people who live in temporary or insecure accommodation.  Much is covered.  There is always a danger in tying down definitions that it may not work the way one wants it to.  The implementation of the homeless strategy is what is important.  We have a statutory framework in the 1998 Act, it is mentioned again in this Bill and we will have the implementation plan for that strategy by the end of the year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  This will not be done alone by the Department responsible for housing or by local authorities, or even by the organisations.  It must be a co-operative approach.  While in many cases my Department and the local authorities may provide the funds, we are not in a position to provide the care.  Many of these people have social and addiction problems and need the provision of care.  This must involve the Departments, the local authorities, the voluntary organisations and the HSE and the health side.  This homelessness strategy will be successful if there is a co-operative approach.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I intend to drive the strategy and the implementation plan when it is available.  The implementation plan will get legislative back-up when it is agreed.  I do not want to pre-empt the final terms of the implementation plan.  I have my own ideas, as has the Department, but it is a co-operative approach and that is the reason the consultation process has been ongoing for some time.  While other people were on their summer holidays I was working on the homelessness strategy, and many other people on the voluntary side were available also.  We have a short time in which to get it up and running.  There are less than two months remaining but we have two years in which to get the results.  No one person, be it the Minister or anybody else, can do that unless he or she has the co-operation.  It appears from the comments made in this House that there is great support for tackling the problem and as politicians we have a responsibility in that regard.  I have a responsibility, as Minister with responsibility for housing, to remove the sore of long-term emergency accommodation and to give some self-esteem to those who have been in such accommodation for up to eight years.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the points made by the Senators but I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I ask the Senators to understand my position on it and accept that the final piece of the jigsaw, namely, the implementation plan, is not in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 12 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, subsection (1), line 7, to delete &ldquo;works or services&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;works, services and tenancy services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I refer to section 11 and we are talking about housing services, which are an important function of local authorities across social and affordable housing, grants, loans, etc.  Section 11 refers to ancillary services.  If we examine where local authorities have historically delivered housing projects there has been a gaping deficit in the level of support services provided to support the people who live in those estates.  We have had tenements in our history and sprawling estates, mainly in our cities, where houses were built and large multitudes of people housed without any support.</P>
        <P>I am glad section 11 refers to ancillary services which include roads, shops, playgrounds, places of recreation, parks, allotments, open space, sites for places of worship, factories, schools, offices and other buildings or lands and other such works or services.  It is good that the Bill acknowledges that where people live there is a need for supports such as education and recreation.</P>
        <P>We are tabling this amendment because we need to acknowledge that tenants live in these housing estates.  For a long time Irish property habits has focused on the rights and needs of home owners.  The needs and considerations of tenants has been mostly an afterthought.  New regulations for the standards of rented accommodation will be introduced only this year, after decades of ignoring horrifically low standards in tenants&rsquo; conditions.  The Bill should expand <Col N="259"/>the definition of ancillary services to include services intended to support tenancies.  Even with property prices falling, a significant sector of Irish society cannot afford new dwellings and will remain tenants.  When drafting legislation, these people could be considered as much as home owners.  For that reason the amendment specifies &ldquo;works, services and tenancy services&rdquo; to give a real acknowledgement and definition of tenancy services in legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to speak on amendment No. 12 in section 15, which deals with the content of housing services plans.  The amendment proposes that in page 13, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(<i>i</i>), line 23, after &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;including but not limited to, tenancy services, supported housing, tenancy sustainment, tenancy support and settlement, advice, advocacy and mediation services.&rdquo;  The rationale is that this amendment would provide a more detailed explanation of what housing support could mean.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the thrust of both these amendments but prefer Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s on behalf of the Labour Party because it includes Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment through its reference to &ldquo;tenancy services&rdquo;.  Senator Coffey made a very good case for this and this may be the way of the future, that more people will live in rented accommodation, as they do on the Continent.  People will find it very difficult to afford houses, even with the collapse in house prices.  It is important we move to a situation whereby tenants in rented accommodation should be also protected and live in decent conditions.  The Minister has this in mind and the Government is moving on it, which I very much welcome.  Substandard accommodation is not tolerable.  I know of some appalling cases of people living in these dreadful, ghastly bed-sitters.  The Government is taking action.  I rent out an apartment in my house.  I have just spent &euro;50,000 on it and it is a hell of a good apartment.  I am not milking money out of it and I have declared every penny, partly out of morality and partly because I am too stupid to fiddle tax.  I find it a much better policy to be completely open and above board about it.</P>
        <P>The other reason I support Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s amendment, which he advocated very well, is that he anticipated a ministerial response.  I am in this House long enough to know that sometimes when one puts down such definitions the response is that the Minister agrees with it all but that the amendment is unnecessarily limiting and the recital incomplete.   Senator Hannigan and his advisers cleverly anticipated and met this point by including the phrase &ldquo;including but not limited to&rdquo; as a pre-emptive strike in amendment No. 12.  That is an important element of the amendment.  I hope it will help to persuade the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 11 of the Bill replaces and updates section 56(2) of the Housing Act 1966 which, as Senator Coffey has said, empowers local authorities to provide services which are ancillary to the provision of dwellings, such as roads, shops and playgrounds.  The services in question are capital in nature.  This section of the Bill envisages the provision of supporting infrastructure and amenities rather than services of the type proposed in amendment No. 6.  The same issues apply in section 12 of the Bill which empowers the Minster to pay grants or subsidies to housing authorities in respect of specified services, including the provision of ancillary services.  Section 10(<i>b</i>) of the Bill sets out the general functions of the housing authority in the provision of housing support and the management and maintenance of dwellings and estates.  This would comprehend tenancy services.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 also attempts to tackle the issue of the provision of services to tenants.  The effect of this amendment may be to confuse the understanding of &ldquo;housing support&rdquo;, and place some limitations on such support, rather than to bring greater clarity to the matter.  The tenancy issues mentioned in the amendment are covered in the definition of &ldquo;housing support&rdquo; in section 10 to the extent that they are within the remit of the housing authorities.</P><Col N="260"/>
        <P>I accept what Senator Coffey and others have said about services.  Senator Norris made a valid point about bedsits.  It was important for us to take action in that regard.  While I appreciate that many of the new properties that have come on stream in recent times have better facilities, we continue to have a hangover from other times.  Bedsits like those developed in the 1960s, which do not have separate sanitary and kitchen facilities, will no longer be acceptable from 1 February next.  The Bill also deals with the appearance of properties.  In many streets, it is easy to identify the houses that are rented out as opposed to those occupied by private owners.  We are giving responsibility to landlords in that regard.  The local authorities are to be given funds to conduct inspections.  I hope that will improve conditions.  Bedsits will be gone.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that a number of Senators have considered it appropriate to suggest amendments to clarify this point.  I am prepared to ask the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to examine this matter and ascertain whether a more explicit reference can be included in this legislation.  In that light, I ask Senators Coffey and Hannigan to withdraw the amendments before the House.  I will come back to the matter if I can get the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to agree to include a more explicit reference.</P>

I hope an inspectorate will be established.  Legislation to deal with substandard accommodation is of no use unless properties can be inspected.  It should be possible to put out of business those who provide such accommodation.  I suggest that the Minister of State might use his good offices to get the inspectorate to look at Nos. 5 and 6 North Great George&rsquo;s Street.  It would be very welcome if he could do that.  It would be no harm if the houses could be investigated or inspected to see the conditions inside them.

        <P FLI="0">This relates to the preparation and making of draft plans.  Currently section 16 (1) states, &ldquo;A housing authority shall prepare a draft of the housing services plan and shall send a copy of the draft housing services plan to [a list of bodies].&rdquo;  We are seeking to amend the subsection in order that a copy of the draft plan will be sent and responses sought.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It strengthens the notion of consultation, which is often an empty term where it involves simply providing information.  The amendment strengthens the provision by ensuring housing authorities also seek responses from the listed bodies.  This does not impose an onerous obligation on them but it requires that responses would be sought, which is an important improvement to this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the amendment because without it, the plan may remain inert in certain aspects and we should seek active engagement with the plan.  This Part is important because it deals with the assessment of needs and the provision of a plan by the appropriate authorities in response to that.  It is a desirable objective to make the entire process active.  Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s amendment goes a good distance to ensuring this will be done.  All of us are showered with documents, surveys, plans, questionnaires and briefs.  It is endless and an encouragement to respond would be no harm at all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the general thrust of the amendment.  Consultation should be a two-way street.  Where housing authorities have gone to the trouble of preparing a housing services plan for their administrative area, it should be forwarded to the Minister, every local authority adjoining them and the Health Service Executive.  I have not tabled an amendment but it should probably be forwarded to Oireachtas Members as well.  I am not sure whether we are listed but we would have an interest.  Perhaps we could have an input during the drafting stage of the plan.  Consultation is a two-way street and it would be positive to have the views of the bodies listed included the plan.  A track record of responses could be built up, which would also be positive.</P>

	<P>Section 16(1) requires the circulation by the housing authority of a draft housing service plan to the Minister.  With regard to specified bodies and persons, amendment No. 21, which concerns section 16(3), clarifies consultation under section 16(1) is confined to the persons listed and it is clear from the amended subsection that written submissions or observations are anticipated from them.  The proposed amendment does not add to the provision and I therefore ask the Senator to withdraw it.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 14, subsection (1)(<i>d</i>), line 1, after &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;or other bodies including community based organisations, networks, fora or other representative bodies; voluntary service providers, housing and/or homeless networks and fora; or any other body&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment seeks to strengthen the consultation aspect of the service plan.  Amendment No. 16 seeks to insert &ldquo;or the provision of housing or homeless services&rdquo; after &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; in the same subsection.  This also seeks to strengthen the consultation process by naming these organisations.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18 proposes to insert a new subsection, which states &ldquo;any recognised association under section 128 of the Local Government Act 2001, and&rdquo;.  This would ensure local residents associations are included in the consultation phase of the plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In general I support the thrust of the amendments because the development of community organisations and residents associations is valuable.  This has been recognised in Dublin.  For example, I am on the policing committee for the north inner city and I find that very valuable.  The city manager has Oireachtas representatives for the local area in for lunch regularly with all the assistant city managers and that is extremely valuable.  I strongly support the sense of the amendments.  It is very much part of democracy to bring in community organisations, residents and so on because they are the people on the ground.  I am slightly entertained by all the networks, fora, doo-dahs and what nots and, therefore, I am not quite sure about that as it is a little woolly but, on the other hand, I strongly support the intention behind the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the thrust of the amendment which does not place unduly onerous obligations on housing authorities, which would be a concern given amendment No. 15 refers to &ldquo;or any other bodies&rdquo;.  The amendment does not require them to provide this information to a range of bodies, which would be too onerous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments generally seek to expand the list of bodies and persons with whom the housing authority formally consults on the draft development plan. I do not consider that the combination of amendments will add to the provision.  I am satisfied that the list under section 16(1)(<i>f</i>) is sufficiently broad to cover the groups referred to in the proposed amendments.  However, when work is completed on the homeless action plans, I envisage that the homeless fora may need to be included in that listing.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 16, which seeks to expand paragraph (<i>d</i>) of subsection (1) which provides that approved bodies must be consulted, it is important to state that such bodies must have, as primary objects, the relief of housing needs, poverty and hardship.  It is also relevant in the context of the proposed amendment to state that they receive their approved status for the purpose of, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of housing accommodation for homeless persons.  The use of the phrase &ldquo;approved bodies engaged in the provision of accommodation or shelter&rdquo; in subsection (1)(<i>d</i>) is, I believe, sufficient to cover the work engaged in by approved bodies and the additional phraseology, as proposed, is not necessary in this instance.  I have concerns that in trying to draw out the provision there is a danger of excluding a group that would have been covered by the more general term.</P>
        <P>Specifically, on amendment No. 18, which proposes to include recognised associations under section 128 of the Local Government Act 2001, I am satisfied that subsection (1)(f) of section 16, which specifies that the draft plan may be made available to local community bodies or any <Col N="265"/>other persons as the housing authority considers appropriate, is sufficient to cover any<?oasys _jy ?>groups which are active locally that are relevant.  I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendments.</P>
        <P>The housing services plan, which will be made within six months of the development plan, will have to have regard to that plan.  The development plan, and the housing strategy therein, is subject to full public consultation.  Consequently, a broad constituency of groups will have had an opportunity to make submission on overall goals, including the quantum of housing demand and need at that stage, and it would be inappropriate to repeat this process within a short time.  The groups listed, and the local groups the manager might also include, will be those with particular interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The purpose of this provision is not to relieve local authorities of their statutory responsibilities nor does it imply any substitution of private effort for State and local government funded works.  Its purpose is to provide a response to a genuine local demand to promote participation in and ownership of projects at local level, to harness the goodwill of recognised associations and to give purpose and meaning to the partnership model at practical level or to deal with particular local circumstances, such as works on an island, which may be more appropriately carried out directly by a local community.</P>

Importantly, the Minister may, for stated reasons, require the housing authority to amend the draft plan in order that the adopted plan takes full account of the matters specified in section 15(1).

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment Nos. 21 and 22 are related and alternatives and can be discussed together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 21:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, lines 12 to 14, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&rdquo;(3) Written submissions or observations with respect to the draft housing services plan may be made by the persons specified in <i>subsection (1) </i>to the housing authority within 6 weeks from the date on which the draft plan is sent under <i>subsection (1).&rdquo;.</i></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government amendment substitutes the existing subsection (3) with a new subsection (3) and makes two changes to the text.  It clarifies that consultation is confined to the persons listed in Section 16 (<i>1</i>).  It also provides that the period of submission for draft housing service plans begins from the date of issue of the draft plan rather than the date of its preparation.  Under the provision as it stands delay in issuing the draft plan reduces the time available to the persons listed in section 16 (<i>1</i>) to comment on it.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>Regarding the first change, while the former consultation process under section 16 is confined to persons listed in Section 16 (<i>1</i>), other interested parties are not excluded from the process.  There is extensive public consultation in the preparation of a development plan which incorporates the housing strategy on which the housing services plan is based.  In addition, as proposals for a draft housing services plan will be tabled before Members, the consultation process is very open and anyone can make known his or her views to elected representatives for input to the deliberative process.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Opposition amendment No. 22.  I am keen to ensure the creation and adoption of a housing services plan is carried out in a timely and efficient manner.  No matter what timeframes are chosen, there always will be demands for extensions to those limits.  However, I believe the limits in the Bill are reasonable and will help to concentrate minds to have a plan adopted.  In those circumstances, I ask that the Senators withdraw their amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 22 asks for an additional two weeks.  This gives more time to respond to the proposed services plan, further strengthening the process.  That is worth taking on board and I would ask the Minister of State to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support both amendments.  It is important to allow for a more concrete method of consultation to take place whereby written submissions or observations can be made.  I think six weeks may not provide enough time, however, and eight weeks would allow the bodies concerned a little more time to consider the information they have received from the housing authority and to make more comprehensive and more thoughtful submissions and observations.  It is not about challenging the Minister of State on his amendment, but about extending the time to eight weeks rather than six weeks.  I do not see a reason for keeping within the six-week limit.  A further two weeks will not impose any undue burden on the housing authority.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s indication that he might support this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The housing services plan must be made within six weeks of the adoption of the development plan.  I consider this to be an appropriate timeframe to ensure compatibility within the two documents.  Within this period, the timeframe for preparation and consultation is properly apportioned.  While there is a formal statutory requirement to consult, I would expect ongoing inter-agency group work during preparation of the housing strategy, so that the housing authority will be aware of the priorities mentioned by the groups when preparing a draft plan for consultation through formal engagements.</P>
        <P>Considering what the Senators have said, I will have a look at this with the Parliamentary Counsel and I will get back to them.  I am not giving any definite promise but we will see if we can accommodate the views of the Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful to the Minister of State for indicating that.  It is very helpful that he is willing to look at the provision.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It adds an important extra dimension to the background to which the housing authority must have regard when performing its functions.  Social background is a relatively broad provision, but to include &ldquo;economic or cultural&rdquo; extends it to encompass different groups that are already represented in our communities.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate that he might perhaps consider amending the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the same phraseology that is used in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and is similar to the term &ldquo;social inclusion&rdquo; reflected in local government legislation.  I am satisfied that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in its normal use, that is, pertaining to society, is sufficiently broad to encompass economic, cultural, ethnic and other issues.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am slightly disappointed with that.  When something is referred to in previous legislation in a particular way, that should not be a reason for not doing something which is beneficial and will enhance the Bill.  Adding &ldquo;economic or cultural&rdquo; would extend the <Col N="271"/>meaning, and we would not have to rely on what is customarily understood in the use of the word &ldquo;social&rdquo;.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response but I do not intend to push it to a vote.  I ask that he reconsider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The word &ldquo;social&rdquo;, in its normal usage, embraces economic, cultural, social, ethnic and other issues.  It is in existing legislation, so I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not been enacted previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State said that the phrase included cultural and economic aspects.  I am not sure if it does that.  Margaret Thatcher drew a very clear distinction between society and the economy when she said that we had an economy and that society was a very detached object.  To prevent that Thatcherite confusion, it might be worth looking at the Senator&rsquo;s amendment again.  It is not automatic that &ldquo;social&rdquo; includes all these areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Social inclusion is in existing legislation.  The interpretation has been that it encompasses economic, cultural, ethnic and other issues.  By adding one or two pieces to it, we may be excluding something else.  If we leave it as it is, it will be interpreted as including all those areas.  I do not want to exclude any group or person.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 26:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, subsection 4, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&rdquo;(<i>c</i>) ensure adequate provision of housing to prevent and reduce homelessness.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Chapter 3 relates to the question of social housing support.  The Bill should place homelessness as a top priority.  This amendment is intended to advance that idea.  The amendment aims to ensure that housing authorities have due regard to provide housing for homeless people in their housing service plans.  The amendment would strengthen the Bill in the area of homelessness.  The Minister of State spoke at length about &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo; strategy and about his proposals on the implementation plan.  If this is set in legislation, it will give homelessness a high priority.  Any housing authority member who reads this Bill will see that the Oireachtas has placed homelessness at the very top of its list of priorities.  We propose this amendment in the hope that the Minister of State takes it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It is important to specify in this Part of the Bill that housing authorities must work to prevent and reduce homelessness.  As was said in the context of earlier sections, it is important to see some reference to homelessness included in the Bill.  I know the 1998 Act provides the definition and we have heard the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on that.  We had a vote on the issue of that definition, but some specific reference is required to the need for housing authorities to provide this sort of service.  A specific aim should be built into the legislation for such authorities to prevent and reduce homelessness.  We should support that important principle in this legislation.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment.  It is a deficiency in the Bill that there is insufficient recognition of the significant problem of homelessness.  I know it is the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention to deal with this, as he has clearly indicated.  He has ambitious plans and we believe him, but in this section we have the matter of segregation between persons of different social backgrounds, as well as mixed dwelling types.  Other categories are clearly specified, yet <Col N="272"/>there is no mention of the homeless who are glaringly absent.  Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment is very reasonable and I hope the Minister of State will be able to take it on board.  Even if the Minister of State regards it as redundant to a certain degree, it does not conflict with the intention of the Bill or with his stated views in the House, as far as I understand them.  If the Minister of State accepted the amendment, it would be an indication that it is worth our while arguing here because to date not one Opposition amendment has been accepted.  I am watching with great interest to see if any Opposition amendments will be accepted whose constitutional remit is to amend and revise legislation in the best interests of the people.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support this amendment which speaks for itself.  The prevention and reduction of homelessness should be a part of any local authority&rsquo;s strategy.  Any housing strategy that does not include such a measured objective would certainly be deficient.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is not appropriate for inclusion in section 19.  The section provides the general power for housing authorities to provide or manage the provision of social housing support and is essentially a restatement of section 56 of the Housing Act 1966.  However, section 19 is more comprehensive with an updated power for housing authorities to provide what is now a broader range of social housing supports.  It should also be read with section 10 which lists the broader range of housing supports, including specifically the provision of services for homeless people.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment seeks to include in subsection (4) a specific reference to the prevention and reduction of homelessness, but such an insertion is not appropriate to this subsection.  Section 19 deals with how the housing authority delivers support, not the objectives of that support in terms of targeted households.  While earlier sections deal with powers &mdash; for example, to acquire or build dwellings &mdash; subsection (4) provides that, in carrying out its social housing support functions, a housing authority must have regard to its housing services plan, as set out in chapter 2, but in particular the need to counteract segregation between persons of different social backgrounds and to ensure that housing authorities provide an appropriate mix of dwelling types and sizes and tenure types.  This is an important provision in ensuring, in particular, that estates built by housing authorities have a good mix of house types for different sizes of household and are not mono-tenure.  We are moving away from large-scale, mono-tenure social housing estates and, therefore, this provision is an important component of the drive to build sustainable communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The housing services plan referred to provides the platform for the ultimate delivery of housing supports and the new assessment and allocation provisions in sections 20, 21 and 22 give practical effect to this planning.  It is in this area that the priorities are set for tackling the needs of different groups, including the homeless.</P>
        <P>Section 20 is the basis for the new assessment of need and provides regulatory powers to set eligibility criteria and to describe and classify need, which will include homelessness.  Section 22 provides housing authorities with a new system to ensure a better fit between needs and resources and to respond, as far as possible, to the expressed preferences of individual households.  Allocations can be made to particular classes of household.  In certain circumstances, a housing authority can allocate a dwelling outside the scheme of letting priorities &mdash; for example, where a household is displaced due to a fire or flood, both relevant in the case of homelessness, or some other emergency.</P>
        <P>Under the new approach, each authority will adopt a new allocation scheme, which will allow for local discretion within the national framework.  In this way, it is hoped to strengthen the <Col N="273"/>link between local needs and the subsequent provision of resources, as well as ensuring consistency in the way in which applicants for social housing are prioritised.</P>
        <P>As the Bill deals more generally with the issue raised by the Senator, I ask him to withdraw this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Together with a number of other Senators, I acknowledged the progressive nature and general thrust of the Bill, which will certainly improve housing services.  We are adamant that homelessness should be given a higher priority in this Bill.  The amendment merely seeks to insert an additional subsection (<i>c</i>) to section 19(4) to &ldquo;ensure adequate provision of housing to prevent and reduce homelessness&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As various Senators outlined, in the context of housing legislation, homelessness is an important and significant issue, which we wish to put to a vote.  I propose that the amendment stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, in line with the homelessness strategy, I intend to put on a statutory basis the homelessness action plan by bringing forward amendments during the passage of the Bill.  I spoke about that plan before lunch today.  Such plans will deal with the implementation issue as well as addressing the concerns that have been expressed.  I know that they are two different sections, but I have put that on the record of the House.  I reiterate that there will be an opportunity for the implementation plan to be placed on a statutory basis.  I am not accepting the amendment on account of that, as I explained earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State clarify once more where he proposes to allow for the implementation of the homelessness strategy in this legislation?  While I am sorry to ask him to reiterate this, I would appreciate it if he would do so because this is a very important matter.  I do not doubt the Minister of State&rsquo;s genuine concerns in this area and I acknowledge the work he has done on the homelessness strategy, including The Way Home document he produced in August.  As he said, however, a plan is not worth the paper it is written on without an implementation plan, resources and an acknowledgement by all sectors of society, from top to bottom.  We are trying to frame legislation so that homelessness will be clearly identified and acknowledged.  If the Minister of State can clarify that point we may consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Coffey again on this matter.  The movement from this side of the House is in support of the Minister of State&rsquo;s stated objectives.  Should it come to pass, however, that Senator Coffey feels compelled to call a vote, I suggest that we should go through the division lobbies in light of the earlier debacle.  In addition to a physical vote, we might also secure the services of a town crier, dressed in 18th century costume, to go through the corridors ensuring that everybody hears the division bells.</P>

	<P>Yes, that is an additional flourish to the amendment.  I passed a number of people in the corridors and while I had the bells ringing in my ears, they were unable to hear them.

In the strategy I announced in August, I referred to this.  The Way Home strategy outlines the approach to local homeless action plans and indicates they will be put on a statutory basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State clarify this point further?  What he says is interesting in that he suggests it is within the passage of the Bill that these regulations are spelled out.  However, I do not see them in the text of the Bill so how will that be done within the passage of the Bill?  The Minister of State has unintentionally muddied the water because I am sure it must be after the passage of the Bill that he proposes to spell them out.  The regulations may exist on paper somewhere in the Department but, as far as I know, they have not been laid before the House, although I could be wrong on this.  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s illumination on this point.</P>

	<P>We are only on Committee Stage.  The implementation plan will be in place before the end of the year but it is not in place as we stand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not before the passage of the Bill.  I think the Minister of State intends that the Bill should pass in anticipation of these matters, but those will not form part of the Bill.  That is the point I am trying to clarify.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is we are working on the Committee Stage amendment and that work is continuing as we speak.  It is a work in progress and it will be part of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that happen in the Seanad?  Will this come as an amendment from the Minister of State on Report Stage, given it is not in the Bill at present, or does the Minister of State anticipate that the Bill will take longer than just this afternoon and he will have an amendment for us the next time the House sits to discuss this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect it will be in place during Committee Stage in the Seanad.  However, as the Senator knows, the legislation will finally come back to the House in which it was initiated.  For explanation purposes, there are a number of other provisions that are also being worked on by the Attorney General, such as the sale of flats in Dublin, which we may deal with later, and that type of issue.  We are awaiting final clearance from the Attorney General on certain matters but not on this one.  This concerns the implementation plan and I expect it will be included on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is unsatisfactory.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department to present a complete Bill to the Seanad.  While I am sorry to have to say this because I know he is working hard on this, as are his staff, the Minister of State has produced an incomplete Bill, which is not appropriate.  I repeat that the Minister of State is attributing to the D&aacute;il functions that properly accrue to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This Bill should be presented in this Chamber in full with all its working parts and not left as a kind of half moth-eaten document to be completed by the D&aacute;il.  It is not painting by numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not for one minute doubt the genuine attempts of the Minister of State who, while he has been in office for a relatively short time, has done enormous work in the whole area of housing and homelessness, which I publicly acknowledge.  However, I concur with Senator Norris.  I am a relatively new Senator, having only been here since July last year, but I have a lot of respect for this House and the work it does.  I am disappointed we more or less have a half-baked Bill, if I understand this correctly.  There are implementation <Col N="275"/>plans, housing strategies and regulations over which this legislation will form an umbrella.  As Senators, we would like at an early stage to have the same opportunity to debate the full context of housing, homelessness and all that goes with it as has any Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Every Senator present has taken a genuine interest in the Bill and we have put down amendments for genuine reasons, to try to enhance what we acknowledge is a progressive Bill.  For those reasons, I propose the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>To echo what other Senators said, I would welcome clarification from the Minister of State as to what precisely he plans to do with regard to the homeless implementation plan.  While this may be my misunderstanding, I understood him earlier to say he would put the implementation plan for the homelessness strategy on a statutory footing at a later stage this year.  I understood that as meaning separate legislation would be brought before this House either later this year or early next calendar year to implement the homelessness plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I now understand it may be put as an amendment to this Bill, perhaps on Report Stage in the Seanad or at a later date in the D&aacute;il, or even when the Bill returns to the Seanad.  We would like clarification from the Minister of State as to exactly at which stage he intends to bring forward this provision to place the homelessness implementation plan on a statutory footing.</P>
        <P>I do not believe any of us would hold him to it, but it is simply so we have some sense of when this is coming.  It would short-circuit matters because we could stop putting amendments which the Minister of State then indicates he will accept or, in any event, do something about at a later date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject totally that there is any question of this being a half-baked Bill.  There is a simple explanation.  The Bill was published in advance of the strategy, which came afterwards.  I am sure the House would want me to put the implementation plan on a statutory basis as soon as possible.  I am being as helpful as I can to the House and to the people in having it included in this legislation and in getting the matter of the homelessness implementation plan on a statutory basis and up and running as soon as possible so we can implement it, as I said, in 2009 and 2010.  The simple explanation is that the homelessness strategy was announced by me in August of this year, which was after the Bill was published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Norris.  We have given this a fairly good airing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude because Senator Bacik and I have teased out the issue.  Our difficulty is that while we welcome the implementation plan, this is all theory unless we put something into action.  However, the Minister of State appeared to suggest that when it went to the D&aacute;il, there would be a further legislative development which had not been considered at that point by this House.  That is inappropriate and nothing the Minister of State has said so far has convinced me otherwise.</P>
        <P>When will the Bill go to the D&aacute;il?  I presume it is not a matter that can be left forever because once this Bill passes in the Seanad in the next week or so, it will then go to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State is anticipating it being law by Christmas so it might very well go to the Lower House very rapidly.  I want to know why we are not given the opportunity to scrutinise something that will apparently be scrutinised as part of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been, as Senator Coffey very kindly pointed out, long enough in this House to know the way legislation works.  If it was just a question of a completely separate set of regulations, it would not be an issue because provisions are frequently made for regulations to be determined <Col N="276"/>afterwards by the Minister.  This seems to be something more than that because the D&aacute;il is being given the opportunity to consider it but we are being deprived of that opportunity.  Perhaps as a sop, we may get an opportunity to put the Bill through on the nod, as amended by the D&aacute;il, but that is not what this House was intended to do.  I regret to have to say this to the Minister of State because I know he intends the best.  We want to support him in this, particularly in dealing with the situation of homelessness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>While I can understand the concerns, to be fair to the Minister of State, these issues were raised on Second Stage by both sides of the House &mdash; I raised them too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree, we want to offer support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State gave undertakings in responding on Second Stage, and he has repeated them here, that there will be an amendment in this area and in other areas such as the sale of apartments to tenants, not only in Dublin but in other parts of the country.  That could happen on Report Stage here or it could be on Committee Stage or Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In any case, because this House is instigating this Bill, it must come back here for final scrutiny.  There will still be plenty of opportunity to consider this amendment as and when it comes, and to comment appropriately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The House is being treated with contempt, given the way this has been introduced.  The Minister of State gave undertakings on Second Stage but when amendments such as these are tabled on Committee Stage, Committee Stage should be postponed until proper amendments to deal with this specific matter are put before us.  It is not acceptable to be told an amendment may be tabled on Report Stage or it may be amended in the D&aacute;il.  That is treating this House with contempt.  The entire Bill should be postponed on Committee Stage if amendments such as these are being put before the House rather than dealing with the issue in a haphazard way such as we are doing now.  We do not know what will come to us next week, before Christmas or after Christmas.  We are being treated with contempt, and we will press this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention was not for this to reflect badly on the House in any way.  If anything, the intention was to reflect favourably on the House by initiating the legislation here, as somebody who spent 14 years in this House.  Senators will have an opportunity to debate every part of the Bill because as they are aware, a Bill must come back to the House in which it is initiated.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that Government amendments, or any other amendments, can be brought forward at any time.  It is important to remember that this Bill was published in advance of the homeless strategy but one other piece of the jigsaw, namely, the implementation plan for the homeless strategy, has yet to be finally agreed.  As I put it to the House earlier, we will have a half-day gathering with the stakeholders to finalise our discussions in advance of the implementation plan which I expect to have published before the end of the year and then put on a statutory basis.  Members of this House will have an opportunity to deal with it on that basis.  The Lower House will deal with this matter after this House has dealt with it but as Members are aware, it can come back to this House if amendments arise at a later stage.</P><Col N="277"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>To hold back the Bill would not be in the best interests of the implementation of the homeless strategy or of the many provisions in this legislation, including the incremental loans scheme and other ones.  This is a broad-ranging Bill and there is a great opportunity for both Houses to debate it.  Following clearance from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office more amendments will be tabled.  We are responding to a public need.  I refer in particular to the strategy.  We do not need the Attorney General&rsquo;s clearance on that but we need it on the area dealing with the sale of flats.  I cannot bring legislation into this House that has not been cleared by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  That would be foolhardy as it would be thrown out in some other forum.  This House is being given priority in having the legislation initiated here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Doherty.  We are beginning to rehash the debate on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was about to welcome the fact that the homeless strategy implementation plan would be put on a statutory footing as part of this Bill but having heard the Minister of State&rsquo;s latest comments, I am not sure if that is his intention.  He said he hopes to publish it by the end of the year and that it will then be put on a statutory footing.  We need some clarity on this issue.  Will the implementation plan be part of this Bill regardless of whether it is amended in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il?  All of the parties broadly support the Bill and all we want to do is strengthen it.  We focused on the homelessness issue as part of the Bill.  It is not something that should arise as an additional amendment at a later stage.  We should have the amendment at this stage but that is beside the point.  Can the Minister of State give some clarification?  Will the implementation plan be part of the final Bill and when does he expect the final Bill to pass all Stages in both Houses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Doherty has very succinctly expressed what I would like to find out.  With regard to the Minister of State&rsquo;s wonderful jigsaw analogy, he will not win any prizes for a jigsaw that, as he admits, has a significant piece missing.  I have done jigsaws in my misspent youth.  The whole point was to get them finished.  The Minister of State will not get a prize for an incomplete jigsaw, either in the real world or in this Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only the corner piece.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>How green does Senator Boyle think this eye is?  I will make one constructive suggestion and not continue with this matter.  We must get ahead and have our vote.  When the Minister of State has answered Senator Doherty&rsquo;s very reasonable questions and if it turns out that this material part of the Bill will not be given primary consideration in this House but left to the other House, I suggest the appropriate approach would be to go through the Bill to its conclusion of Committee Stage today, the next day or whenever but delay Report Stage, which will be gone through fairly rapidly, until this amendment is produced, at which point it can be discussed, as it should be, in this House.  That is a compromise that allows the Minister of State to complete Committee Stage today and then introduce Report Stage.  I imagine the period between when it is completed in this House and then goes to the D&aacute;il will only be a matter or days.  For the sake of a few days can we not have a complete Bill in this House if, as Senator Doherty has asked, this plan is to be an integral part of the Bill as passed by the Oireachtas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The local action plans are part of the implementation plan.  This issue will be put on a statutory footing but some of the implementation issues do not need to be put on a statutory footing.  I want to make that distinction.  Some of the implementation <Col N="278"/>plan will need a legislative framework and some of it will not.  I repeat that the statutory part of the implementation plan will be part of this Bill.  That must be the fourth time I have said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister of State a specific and clear question and I would like an answer to it.  Is he prepared to postpone Report Stage?  It cannot affect the timetable for the passage of the Bill in any significant sense if he delays Report Stage until this House gets an opportunity to discuss it.  Otherwise, I will begin to suspect the Minister of State&rsquo;s good faith in this respect.  What is the point of sacrificing Seanad &Eacute;ireann to which I know the Minister of State has some vestigial loyalty.  He spent 14 years in this House and he was a good and valued colleague.  Why are we not being given sight of an integral, significant part of the Bill until it goes to the D&aacute;il?  Why are we being requested merely to rubber-stamp it?  That is not the function of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the position because I and other Members were not clear as to his intentions in terms of the homeless strategy implementation plan.  The second part of that question, and it arises out of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that he intends to publish the plan by the end of the year, is when he expects the Bill to be in effect.  If he is only publishing the plan at the end of the year, we are talking about February.  I presume the Houses will not convene until the end of January and therefore it will be February or March.  Will the Minister of State outline to the House when he intends that this Bill will conclude all Stages?</P>

	<P>It is a matter for the Houses to organise their business through the Whips.  We cannot delay the progress on the legislation and I will not delay it.  We have indicated here in respect of a number of amendments that we must go back to the Parliamentary Counsel.  The same must apply to those that must be dealt with in the future.  It is a work in progress and parliamentarians understand that.  No piece of legislation walks through both Houses without amendments and Ministers going back, listening to Members and saying they will get the Parliamentary Counsel to examine them, as I have done on three or four occasions today.  However I stated the sequence of events very clearly in my Second Stage speech and I outlined that we were still at a stage where some parts of it had to be dealt with by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  Earlier today I said the implementation plan is to be in place by the end of the year.  Then we can move whatever provisions need legislation into the legislative framework.  It is a practical way of getting this major piece of legislation into place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are related, and are alternatives to amendment No. 27, amendments Nos. 27 to 29, inclusive, may be discussed together.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 27:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, lines 40 to 42, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(1) A reference in this section to a household shall be read as including a reference to 2 or more persons who, in the opinion of the housing authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention of section 20(1) is to qualify the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; in section 2 as &ldquo;a person who lives alone or 2 or more persons who live together&rdquo;.  Section 20(1) provides that for the purposes of section 20 as a whole, &ldquo;a household includes 2 or more persons who, in the opinion of the housing authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together&rdquo;.  This extension of the definition is needed to ensure that two individuals in a relationship who are living separately because they are unable to provide accommodation for themselves &mdash; they may be living with parents or other relatives &mdash; can be considered as a single household for the purposes of evaluating their eligibility for housing support.  As I am concerned to ensure there is no confusion in this regard, I am proposing amendment No. 27, which provides for a new section 20(1) of the Bill.  The new section 20(1) clarifies that, for the purposes of section 20 as a whole, the term &ldquo;household&rdquo; as set out in section 2 shall be read as including a reference to two or more people who are currently living apart but have a reasonable expectation to live together.  This meaning is in addition to the meaning of &ldquo;household&rdquo; for the purposes of this legislation as a whole, which is set out in the basic definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; in section 2 of the Bill.  According to that section, a &ldquo;household&rdquo; is &ldquo;subject to section 20, a person who lives alone or 2 or more persons who live together&rdquo;.  The proposed Opposition amendments seek to clarify the existing provision in a similar way, but they do not fully cover all possible household formations.  I thank Senators for their pro<Col N="280"/>posals.  I ask them to withdraw their amendments, Nos. 28 and 29, in favour of the Government amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 27 does not specifically state that a &ldquo;household&rdquo; can constitute an individual.  It merely contains a reference to &ldquo;2 or more persons&rdquo;.  We need to push on with things.  Amendment No. 28 is really just a drafting amendment to make it clear that, in certain circumstances, a &ldquo;household&rdquo; can consist of one person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State suggested that the spirit of my amendment No. 29, which seeks to specify that a &ldquo;household&rdquo; can consist of &ldquo;a person who lives alone&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;2 or more persons&rdquo;, is catered for in his amendment No. 27.  Amendment No. 27 does nothing of the sort.  Will the Minister of State outline how the definition of a &ldquo;household&rdquo; covers what the Labour Party and I are trying to achieve in our amendments?  We are trying to ensure a person living alone will be classed as a household under this section.  This is more than a drafting issue as it will have implications for the services that can be provided.  Will the Minister of State explain the difference the inclusion of a person living alone in the definition would mean to the section and why he will not include that formula of words?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what the Minister of State is doing but my reading of section 20(1) is that the Minister is seeking to expand the meaning of &ldquo;household&rdquo; for the purpose of the section beyond the meaning contained in section 2, the interpretation section.  A household is defined under section 2 as &ldquo;A person who lives alone or 2 or more persons who live together&rdquo;.  Section 20(1) extends the definition to include two or more persons who are not currently living together but have a reasonable requirement to live together.  If I am correct &mdash; the Minister of State is nodding &mdash; that is a progressive provision and I fully support it.</P>
        <P>However, I am sorry I did not table an amendment and in the interest of greater clarity it might be preferable to provide in section 20(1) that a household shall include not only a household as defined under section 2 but also a reference to two or more persons who in the opinion of the housing authority have a reasonable requirement to live together.  That would clarify that the extension of the definition in the subsection does not override the definition under section 2, which clearly includes a single person household but it also expands it to include two persons who have a reasonable requirement to live together.  If the Minister of State indicates he will clarify his amendment to ensure it will always contain the additional inclusive element, I will fully support it.  The problem is the subsection reads as if it supersedes the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; in section 2.  I read it not to exclude single person households but to include households of two persons who wish to live together.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik&rsquo;s explanation was lucid and engaging.  I am quite sure she is right and I hope the Minister of State will confirm that.  It is important, however, that, as was intended by the amendments tabled by my colleagues, we continue to take into account <Col N="281"/>the plight of single people and I understand the Minister of State has this very much in mind because we have been dealing with the question of the homeless for some time.  Homeless people are not usually part of a couple.  However, I would very much welcome a very clear statement by the Minister of State outlining what &ldquo;a reasonable requirement to live together&rdquo; means so that there can be no <i>post facto</i> revision of this.  Will two or more persons having a reasonable requirement to live together include a committed couple of the same sex?  The reason I ask for this to be spelled out is the Government&rsquo;s history regarding the Equality Authority and the mean-minded way it acted to deprive same sex couples of rights to which they were found to be entitled by the authority.  I want to make sure &ldquo;reasonable requirement&rdquo; covers people who have a commitment and relationship and that they will not be deprived of it because their need to live together is not seen to be a reasonable requirement.  In other words, I ask the Minister of State to spell this out and state that such couples shall be interpreted as being covered by this provision.  If not, I shall table an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik&rsquo;s interpretation of the subsection is correct.  The Parliamentary Counsel has agreed this text to cover this issue.  It should be read, however, in conjunction with the definition of a &ldquo;household&rdquo; in section 2, which states: &ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&lsquo;household&rsquo; means, subject to <i>section 20</i>, a person who lives alone or 2 or more persons who live together&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Norris, people in their application cannot be discriminated against on the basis of sex.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Or sexual orientation.  Let the record show the Minister of State nodded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for confirming my interpretation is correct and the subsection includes single person households, households defined under section 2 and this additional dimension.  I accept the Parliamentary Counsel approved the new wording but it still lacks clarity, as confirmed by the comments of colleagues.  The definition under section 2 is subject to this section and that means there is a lack of clarity.  A reader of this section at a later date might well assume subsection (1) contains a new definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; that excludes single person households.  Until this is teased out more carefully, it will be quite easy to interpret it as having that meaning.   Will the Minister of State countenance an amendment on Report Stage that would specify this subsection includes the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; under section 2?  I anticipate tabling an amendment to that effect.  It is a straightforward drafting matter to remove confusion for housing authorities in the future and ensure single person households and households defined in section 2 are included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik and the Minister of State for their clarifications.  However, like the Senator, I am still concerned about the amendment, which states &ldquo;subject to <i>section 20</i>&rdquo;.  This means section 20 will have precedence and it clearly refers to two or more people.  I do not doubt the Minister of State&rsquo;s good intentions but, for the sake of clarity, the section needs to spell out that a household can mean an individual or more than two people.</P>
        <P>I was interested in Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments and I thank the Minister of State for his clarification.  It is clear one person&rsquo;s definition of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; can be different from another&rsquo;s.  The definition of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; must be spelled out so that we can come back later to discuss this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government amendment seeks to achieve the same outcome as my amendment, which is to ensure single persons living alone are included in the definition of &ldquo;household&ldquo; in section 20.  It is not clear currently and the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo;, which <Col N="282"/>contains a reference to section 20, can be interpreted differently.  If the words &ldquo;subject to<i> section 20</i>&rdquo; were deleted, it would be clearer.  The amendment is a move in the right direction and gives greater clarity to the original text but there should be no opposition to clarifying this issue because this is the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention.  I am willing to withdraw my amendment No. 29 if wording is inserted in section 20(1) to clarify the intention to include single persons living alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a little more concerned now and I shall certainly table an amendment.  I am grateful to Senator Hannigan for drawing our attention again to section 20(1), which states: &ldquo;For the purposes of this section a reference to a household includes 2 or more persons who, in the opinion of the housing authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together.&rdquo;  That envisages differing opinions by different housing authorities and, therefore, no absolute or objective criteria are in place.</P>
        <P>In certain parts of the country there might well be a housing authority which had on it persons of strong views &mdash; views of this nature have been expressed not far from where I stand in this House &mdash; to the effect that one would need to be careful about encouraging persons of the same sex to enter into relationships and live together.  We really need a clear guarantee, first, that there will be a uniform standard and, second, that this legislation clearly encompasses same sex relationships.  It is not just a question of sex; it is a question of sexual orientation as well.</P>
        <P>I would say to the Minister of State that since our battles in the 1980s when we got sexual orientation included as a matter of course in legislation, this applies automatically.  It will not conflict with Government policy over the past 20 years but it should be clearly spelled out.  There should be no wriggle room for homophobes in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with the intent of the amendment, as outlined by the Minister of State here and as he gave us his definition, but it is not clear as defined in the Bill.  There is a need to define it in order to clarify the matter.  There is a need for a clearer amendment than has been put before us here today.</P>
        <P>I take on board the points enunciated by Senators Hannigan and Norris on uniformity.  There is a need for uniformity where different local authorities are concerned and that also needs to be spelled out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There is work to be done.  I certainly could not accept the Government amendment, even though I agree with what the Minister of State stated here and his intent.  As the matter is outlined in the Bill itself, I could not accept the amendment as it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Following on from what Senator Norris stated, I ask the Minister of State for clarification.  Obviously, the definition, as he stated, which is in section 2, stands for section 20, namely, that household will also include two or more persons who live together.  The amendment the Minister proposes is that it would also include not only two or more persons who live together, but two or more persons who, in the opinion of the housing authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together.  The intention of what the Minister of State proposes is that three definitions of household will apply to section 20, namely, a person living alone, two or more persons living together, or persons, in the eyes of the housing authority, who would have a reasonable requirement to live together.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators should refer in the first instance to the definition of household in section 2, which clearly refers to a person living alone.  We should get that on the <Col N="283"/>record here.  That is clearly stated in section 2.  Section 21 includes this definition but it qualifies it for the purposes of section 20 only.  The interpretation put by Senator Doherty is correct.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important to state that the Parliamentary Counsel has agreed this text as the format to cover precisely that issue.  That is what the Parliamentary Counsel has proposed, and that is what is in the amendment.  I have no difficulty going back to the Parliamentary Counsel to ask if there is a gap in that.</P>
        <P>In answer to Senator Norris&rsquo;s point, the Minister will issue guidelines on assessment to housing authorities.  The other aspect, of course, is that housing authorities must abide by equality legislation, and therein lies the guarantee that Senator Norris may be seeking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than the Minister of State going back to the Parliamentary Counsel asking if there is a gap in this, would it be possible for him to go back with a recommendation, as per Senator Bacik&rsquo;s proposal, to improve it?  Rather than asking is there a problem with this, would he offer a recommendation which this House believes would improve it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan as I was going to make the same point.  On a careful reading, it is inclusive of the definition in section 2.  However, as I stated, for greater clarity I would ask that the Minister of State &mdash; to whom I am grateful for indicating he might go back to the Parliamentary Counsel &mdash; take back to the Parliamentary Counsel the wording I suggested, namely, that the reference to household shall be read as including not only a household as defined in section 2 but also a reference to two or more persons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That would establish with much fuller clarity what exactly is included in this important provision.  This is the basis then from which the housing authorities will determine eligibility, etc., which we will debate.</P>
        <P>I was also pleased to hear the Minister of State say the Minister will make regulations providing for eligibility, which we will debate shortly.  It is important that they be objective and that the criteria used for determining eligibility is consistent.  The criteria for determining &ldquo;household&rdquo; must also be consistent and we need clarity in the primary legislation just as we will need clarity in the regulations which will stipulate, for example, how a housing authority will form the opinion that two or more persons have a reasonable requirement to live together.  The devil will be in the detail, but I am hopeful that we will see consistent and objective criteria used to answer the concerns expressed by Senator Norris about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be willing to withdraw my party&rsquo;s amendment if the Minister of State can give a guarantee that he will go back and proactively recommend a rewording of this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I am satisfied &mdash; the Parliamentary Counsel having agreed this wording &mdash; that it is the best form of words, but I am responding to the House here.  I will ask the Parliamentary Counsel to examine it but I will not recommend that it change it.  It will be a matter for the Parliamentary Counsel to examine it on the basis of the discussion here.</P>
        <P>It will not be regulations that will go to the housing authorities, as Senator Bacik stated.  It will be guidelines.  That is an important distinction.  I already covered Senator Norris&rsquo;s point.</P>
        <P>Considering the debate that has taken place here, I will have the Parliamentary Counsel examine the matter.  This is an agreed text from the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Parliamentary <Col N="284"/>Counsel officials feel they have covered what I have in mind, namely, that two persons who are not living together at present and who wish to live together will be in a position to apply for accommodation and that the application is to be processed, and that is the text they have put forward.  However, I will ask them to have examine it on the basis of the discussion here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to withdraw my party&rsquo;s amendment at this stage because of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, but I will reserve the right to table an amendment at Report Stage if we are still dissatisfied on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>As outlined, the Minister of State is still pressing ahead with the Government amendment.  My understanding is he is not withdrawing that amendment and introducing another on Report Stage.  In that case, despite what the Minister of State stated about assurances, etc., my party cannot support the amendment outlined here without any recommendation from the Minister of State.  He stated he would not recommend that it should be changed.  From that point of view, we cannot support the Government amendment.</P>

      </Vote>
        <P el="5">Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 17, subsection (3), line 5, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P><Col N="285"/>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment would make an important change to section 20(3) by providing that a housing authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; carry out a social housing assessment.  This changes the provision from facilitative to prescriptive.  Clarity is of great importance in this or any other Bill and it is particularly important given the debate we have had on the need for consistent and objective assessments of individual housing needs.  In his Second Stage speech, the Minister of State said that an objective and consistent assessment of individual needs is &ldquo;key to providing social housing supports&rdquo;.  We are all in agreement on that.  The Minister of State went on to say that such assessments are essential in determining a household&rsquo;s priority relative to the needs of other households and identifying the appropriate supports.  He remarked that section 20 is &ldquo;the basis for the new assessment of need&rdquo; and provides regulatory powers to set eligibility criteria, classify need and determine the form of this assessment.  That is absolutely correct.</P>
        <P>However, in the interests of making the section clearer and ensuring there is a set of objective and consistent criteria for allocating social housing supports, the wording of this provision should be somewhat stronger.  That is the objective of this amendment and amendment No. 32, each of which provides that a housing authority and the Minister, respectively, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; carry out certain functions.  Rather than simply enabling them to do so, we should make it a requirement.  This will strengthen the provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Although I voted against the Government&rsquo;s amendment No. 27, I am fully in agreement with the spirit of that amendment, namely, that housing authorities should be able to allocate social housing supports to households, including persons who do not currently live together but have a reasonable requirement to do so.  That is eminently sensible and progressive.  However, the wording could have been improved.  Likewise, I support entirely the important provisions in subsections (3) and (4).  All I seek in tabling these amendments is to strengthen those provisions to impose requirements rather than simply enabling.  That will ensure greater consistency across different housing authorities.</P>
        <P>There is much that is significant and progressive in the Bill.  Section 19 provides for important new powers for housing authorities to provide housing supports, including the power to purchase or convert buildings and to refurbish dwellings.  Given the high number of vacant dwellings in Dublin and throughout the State, it is important that housing authorities have this power.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is appropriate in some sections where we seek to empower and enable housing authorities, as it is in section 19(3).  In other areas, however, we should place a requirement, as is the case in section 20(3) in regard to housing authorities and in section 20(4) in regard to the Minister.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment and thus require housing authorities to carry out assessments where households have been in receipt of supplement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It should be a necessity that housing authorities carry out these assessments.  Subsection (3) is disastrously unclear. The Minister of State should bear in mind what has been said on this side of the House about Government amendment No. 27.  Some of us voted against that amendment not because we considered it a bad amendment but because we felt it could be better.  Although the legal position could, after considerable thought, be teased out and was made clear by a combination of the contributions of the Minister of State and Senator Bacik, who has significant qualifications in the legal profession, the average lay person would find great difficulty in doing so.  There must be an attempt by the Government to make legislation clear and accessible to citizens, where possible.  In the case of this provision, seasoned legislators who are not lawyers did not find it easy to understand.</P>
        <P>Subsection (3) states: &ldquo;A housing authority may carry out a social housing assessment where a household has been in receipt of a supplement under section 198(3) of the Social Welfare <Col N="286"/>Consolidation Act 2005 towards the amount of rent payable by the household in respect of the household&rsquo;s residence for such period as may be prescribed.&rdquo;  There are at least half a dozen ideas in this one sentence.  Why is this subsection not split into shorter, simpler sentences?  There is a grammatical conflict in terms of which verb governs which noun.  As somebody who taught English, it reads to me that a housing authority may do this, that and the other for such period as may be prescribed.  I assume this is not what is meant and that the phrase &ldquo;for such period as may be prescribed&rdquo; refers to the rent payable.  However, the meaning of the sentence is that the assessment shall be for the period prescribed.  It would be far clearer if the ideas, instead of being rammed together, were put into a series of short, simple and clear sentences.</P>
        <P>I realise we cannot go through the entire Bill to tease it out and put it into plain, understandable English.  However, I put down a marker in this regard.  We should attempt to make legislation as accessible as possible instead of being larded with this type of gobbledegook.  It is like Handel&rsquo;s Messiah.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is not necessary.  The subsection is intended to allow housing authorities, where they consider it necessary, to assess households that have been receiving rent supplement for a specific period and have not applied for local authority housing.  These would generally be households which become known to the housing authority by virtue of them being potential clients of the rental accommodation scheme.  It is not necessary to compel housing authorities to assess these households as they have not applied to the housing authority for social housing support and might not wish to do so in the future.  However, the authority has the power, if necessary, to assess such a household for social housing support at any time.  If a household falling under this subsection requested a social housing assessment to be carried out, the housing authority is obliged to do so under subsection (2).</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, subsection (4), line 10, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment again seeks to change a word in the Bill, but it is an important word.  This would provide that the Minister &ldquo;shall make regulations providing for the means by which the eligibility of households for social housing support shall be determined...&rdquo;.  The amendment seeks to create an obligation on the Minister to make regulations.</P>
        <P>I also seek clarification from the Minister of State.  I understood him to say that guidelines rather than regulations would be made providing for how local authorities would determine eligibility for social housing support.  It is clear in subsection (4) that the Minister has the power to make regulations providing for the means of assessment of eligibility.  It is important that this would be done through regulations.  There is great difficulty with this issue, as anybody who has knocked on doors during election campaigns will know.  There is a lack of clarity in <Col N="287"/>the criteria that are used by different local authorities, voluntary groups and the different entities that are providing housing supports to determine eligibility or housing need.  This difficulty leads to much unnecessary distress and upset among individuals who are looking for housing support and the provision of services by housing authorities.  They simply cannot find out what the criteria are.</P>
        <P>I recently advised people living in my area about this.  It is difficult for them to discover from their local authority where they are on the housing list, what points have been allocated to them, why certain points have been allocated to them but not to other households and so forth.  It is hugely important to provide for a change in this Bill to ensure a more objective and consistent set of criteria is adopted by local authorities.  It is not enough to empower the Minister to make regulations to do so.  It is far more important to provide that the Minister must or shall make regulations to provide for the means by which eligibility shall be determined.</P>
        <P>Those means are not exclusively set out in subsection (4).  There is a discretion there for the Minister.  There is a list of criteria by which eligibility should be determined but, clearly, he or she could add to that.  Some other provisions might be included, for example, the method by which two or more persons would be determined to have a reasonable requirement to live together, as mentioned in subsection (1), to ensure that objective criteria were used in assessing persons who have sought to live together but are not currently doing so.  It is important to change subsection (4) in the interest of strengthening rather than undermining the provision.</P>
        <P>The strengthening of the provision would lie in the fact that the Minister would have to make regulations providing for the means by which housing authorities would determine eligibility for social housing support, in view of the difficulties there have been with inconsistency and the opacity or lack of clarity in the current criteria operated by different local authorities.  As I said on Second Stage, the procedure for allocating housing in Northern Ireland was changed as a result of concerns in respect of different and overly selective criteria being used.</P>
        <P>This issue will arise again in section 22, which applies to the allocation of dwellings.  I will make the same points on that section.  Again, subsection (4) of that section provides for an enabling power whereby the Minister may make regulations.  I will ask that the Minister consider changing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, to prescribe that the Minister must make regulations to ensure local authorities provide more consistent criteria for determining eligibility.</P>

	<P>These amendments generally seek to require a Minister to regulate, whereas the Bill uses the normal drafting convention that the Minister may make regulations.  The amendments are unnecessary.  It is the intention of the provisions that the Minister will make the necessary regulations.  Drafting convention is that the power to make regulations is an enabling power, in the sense that it permits the Minister to do so, rather than compels him or her to do so.  The language adopted here has been cleared by the Parliamentary Counsel and I do not propose to change it.  I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
        <P>For clarification purposes, when I spoke earlier I meant regulations backed up with guidelines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that there will be regulations backed up by guidelines.  I am not sure why he cannot accept that regulations should be made by the Minister.  Can he give a guarantee that the Minister will make regulations, and guidelines following from the regulations?  I am not sure where the breakdown between regulations and guidelines will occur.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>

	<P>It is an enabling power that permits the Minister to do so rather than compelling him or her to do so.  This provision of an enabling power is in most legislation.  The guidelines are a back-up to regulations.</P>

	<P>I accept it is an enabling power.  I am asking that it be made a compelling power.  I note that section 20(2) provides an example of the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It states, &ldquo;Where a household applies for social housing support, the housing authority concerned shall ..... carry out an assessment...&rdquo;.  My amendments relate to the Minister&rsquo;s power to make regulations.  As this is such an important issue it would be important to prescribe that the Minister should make regulations.  I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann&mdash;</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />commends the Government, the tourism agencies and the wider tourism sector for the exceptional performance of Irish tourism in recent years, which has consistently outperformed competitor destinations in western Europe, including the number of overseas visitors exceeding 8 million for the first time ever in 2007, an increase of over 33% in the period since 2001, as well as record numbers of domestic visits;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />recognises the continuing commitment of the Government to the progressive delivery of its key tourism investment priorities in tourism marketing, staff training and business development and product development, within a framework of sound public finances and value for money, noting that the total allocation of the tourism services budget has increased by 50% since 2003 to &euro;161 million in 2009;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />acknowledges the exceptionally challenging conditions now facing tourism worldwide in the context of global economic conditions, as well as the particular challenges facing Irish tourism in the context of the current cyclical downturn in the domestic economy and notes that the Government is conscious of these challenges;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />notes that, notwithstanding these exceptionally difficult conditions, overseas visitor numbers reported to date in 2008 are broadly in line with 2007;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to build on the success of its policies and programmes to date by renewing the policy framework for tourism, as set out in New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action 2003-2012, with a view to ensuring that the sector returns to sustainable growth in the medium term;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />acknowledges the contribution of North-South co-operation in the tourism sector, in particular through the work of Tourism Ireland in marketing the island of Ireland overseas, with the support of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in the Northern Ireland Executive;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />and notes that the Government and in particular the Department for Arts, Sport and Tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are continuing to develop and implement actions and initiatives to support the sector in responding to the current short-term challenges it faces.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and express my thanks to him for giving up his time to be in the House.  We have to accept that we have done exceptionally well in tourism over recent years.  We must also acknowledge the challenging circumstances we will face in the tourism industry.  The Government&rsquo;s ambition and support for tourism is something for which we should express our thanks.</P>
        <P>There are different types of tourism, and Ireland is unique in the types it can provide.  Be it leisure tourism, golf, hiking, cycling or whatever, we are involved in everything except sun tourism.  That is important.  Tourism revenue has changed in some ways over the years, but in 2007 we brought in almost &euro;4 billion in tourism income.  That is an enormous sum of money.  With that income, we have shown that we are still able to compete, in spite of a number of changes that have taken place in the tourism industry and to tourist destinations.  Some of this is due to the fact that we have competitively priced flights into Ireland.  Our hotels and guest houses have also become very competitive in the past two years when compared with accommodation in other destinations.  This was forced on them owing to the amount of development that had taken place in the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>The figures show that we took in &euro;823 million from North America, &euro;1.3 billion from the UK and &euro;729 million from other European countries.  That is a phenomenal amount of tourism <Col N="290"/>revenue coming into Ireland.  The economic climate is more difficult now, but I know that the Minister is doing his utmost to promote Ireland as a tourism destination.</P>
        <P>There have been some tremendous successes at an international level, such as the Irish stage of the World Rally Championship, which will return in 2009.  The amount of revenue created in the north west by that event was enormous in such a short period.  The number of bed nights filled within a 60-mile radius of Sligo was phenomenal.  It was so difficult to get beds that some people hired cruisers on the waterways and stayed in them while they commuted to and from Sligo.  It shows that if we produce a high quality niche product, people will follow it and spend money.</P>
        <P>Success in this area also comes from the type of facilities provided and the type of back-up we supply.  Back-up means everything from hotels, restaurants and pubs.  Anyone who comes to Ireland does so partially for its rugged beauty and its friendliness, and we all accept that the Irish tourism industry has an orientation towards friendly service.  Golf has also become a major player in attracting people into this country.  Many have come to play three or four of the famous courses.  We may have spent a lot of money on the K Club a few years ago, but the knock-on effect in promoting Ireland has been enormous.  Certain golf courses, especially those in the south west, are very popular with overseas visitors, especially those from the US.  We are facing tougher times and the currency situation has caused problems with the American market.  However, we have still managed to maintain our tourism levels and our income from tourism.</P>
        <P>Other events are very important to tourism here.  Racing fixtures attract many people from the UK and from other parts, and these people spend a lot of money.  There are major festivals in Galway, Punchestown and elsewhere, but these attractions need major sponsorship.  I fear that the level of sponsorship available from the private sector for racing could have an effect on how it is developed.  Many overseas visitors are attracted here because there is much more prize money in racing than is available in the UK.  The racing industry has always made an historic contribution to society as well as a contribution to tourism.</P>
        <P>We must look also at the hotel industry.  Certain hoteliers and hotel groups make a great contribution to attracting tourists into Ireland.  Some hotel groups promote coach tours here, especially during the low season.  They manage to have an occupancy rate of between 70% and 80% at off-peak periods.  That is very important, because one hotelier once said to me that he is better off having a head in the bed for a &euro;5 profit than having nobody in the bed.  That is a progressive approach to the problem because once he had somebody in his hotel, he could make extra money in the bar or the restaurant.  The area in which the hotel was located would also benefit.  Such hoteliers often do not get the recognition they deserve, but so called &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; or senior citizen tourism is a major player.</P>
        <P>If we are to have a progressive tourism industry we must consider two issues, namely, our competitiveness compared to other destinations and what we deliver for that money.  From now on, tourism will be much tighter and people will be more cautious in how they spend their money.  We should start to focus on the senior citizens&rsquo; market as well as getting people to spend holidays in this country.  Every euro that goes to Spain, Portugal or elsewhere is a euro lost to our economy.  We must target the domestic holiday market, even though it is not the easiest thing to do, especially after the summer we had this year.  People will become more conscious of value for money, however, so we will make progress if we can maintain the high quality tourism product we currently have.  I thank the Minister for attending the House for this debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="291"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I second this motion on tourism.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  Over many years, tourism has played an important role in the economy, bringing much needed finance not just to Dublin and Killarney, but to less developed areas also.  The spin-off from tourism did much to improve the livelihoods of those along the west and north-west coasts where the bed and breakfast sector, together with activities, such as walking, hill-climbing and cycling, brought large sums of money to local economies.</P>
        <P>Despite the global economic downturn, visitor numbers continued to grow this year and last year.  As Senator Ellis rightly said, we place great emphasis on people coming here from abroad but we should not forget domestic tourists either.  Irish residents took 890,000 holiday trips in the first quarter of this year, which is a 16% increase on the same period in 2007.  The related expenditure totalled &euro;181 million.  This means that our hotels and guesthouses are offering a good deal because there is nobody more discerning than Irish people when it comes to seeking value for money.  They can see they are getting value here so there is an increased interest in short holidays, which include gym facilities such as swimming pools, spas and other treatments.  In other words, we like to pamper ourselves.  If the Minister could get the sun to shine for the three summer months he certainly would be the most popular person.</P>
        <P>While it may seem parochial, religious holidays form an important segment of the tourism market.  In England there are large ethnic groupings that are interested in pilgrimages.  In my parish, Knock shrine attracts large numbers of people, including those of Asian origin.  More could be done to welcome such people, however, and to make trips available for them.  A meeting has been scheduled for the coming weeks to investigate this matter which concerns many people of Asian origin in England.  This market should be pursued and facilitated.</P>
        <P>This is the first time I have had an opportunity to thank the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who as Minister for Transport provided a grant of &euro;27.1 million to Knock airport.  That is having a major impact on tourism in my county, which is welcome.  I pay tribute to the Minister for making that grant available when he held the transport portfolio.</P>
        <P>A recent survey of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive edge examined four areas: Britain, North America, Germany and France.  The two top points identified in that survey were the Irish people and the scenery.  Other points included the fact that the country is English-speaking, its cultural history and ancestral family ties.  The people constitute the most important element, however.  In recent years, our hotels had to employ large numbers of foreigners, which gave them a good living.  There was a downside to it, however, because one might not meet an English-speaking person in some hotels.  That was not good for us, so from now on the Irish people will have to take time out to talk to tourists and tell them what they can see in a local region.  That would be better than following some guide-book made up by somebody from another country who flies through Ireland and writes a book just to sell it.</P>
        <P>Scenery plays an important role in tourism and it is unspoiled here so we should make more of it.  From the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway to County Wicklow and from the west coast to the south, we have some of the finest scenery in the world.  We should promote it to ensure that people visit and, in addition, local people have a role to play in telling tourists about scenic areas.</P>
        <P>The downside includes the weather, to which I have alluded, and the high cost of living.  We hear about price levels but we supply a good product and our hotels were never as cheap as at present.  They offer a great service to foreign tourists, together with good prices.  Their food is of high quality and the rooms are of a high standard.  I have visited England and continental Europe where hotels do not compare to Irish ones.  We should promote domestic tourism and give full credit to our hotel industry in this respect.</P>
        <P>Tourism has brought money to remote regions, which has been important for the economy generally.  It is also important for our people, as well as providing a good supplement to the <Col N="292"/>local economy.  In recent years, the bed and breakfast sector, and especially farmhouse holidays, seem to have died away or declined.  Something should be done to promote such holidays, as was done over the years by the Irish Farmhouse Holidays Organisation and the Town and Country Homes Association.  They did a lot of promotion for that type of holiday where people could come and enjoy a stay with families for three or four days at a time, moving from one county to another and seeing all the local sights.  They got a high standard of service and the farmhouses built up such a reputation that they had repeat business over many years.  However, with reduced hotel prices and, dare I say it, with driving two or three miles to the pub a thing of the past, people prefer to stay in a hotel, where they have all the services under one roof.</P>
        <P>Regardless of what anybody thinks, the motion shows we have a very good product and that our Government is promoting that product.  The Minister is doing a good job in ensuring it is promoted around the world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">noting:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the disappointing downward trend in visitor figures, with a decrease of 3% in the number of trips to Ireland in June 2008 and a 2% drop in August 2008 at the height of the tourist season;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the underlying trend of a fall-off in visitors from traditional dependable markets such as North America and Europe with a 10% reduction in figures for August 2008;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the serious challenges posed to the aviation industry and the resulting impact this threat will have on tourism access to Ireland and, in particular, regional destinations;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the pressure that the current rate of inflation of 4% is exerting on the tourism industry, coupled with unwise increases in transport costs such as the recent 8% increase in taxi charges;</P>
        <P LI="1">considering:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the Government&rsquo;s failure to introduce initiatives and supports aimed at properly harnessing the potential of open skies;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the negative impact the Government&rsquo;s introduction of a departure tax on flights will have on tourism figures;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the pressure the &euro;200 annual levy on holiday homes introduced in the budget will place on the industry;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the significant cuts in current spending for the arts in the budget which will have a significant impact on the availability and quality of cultural tourism products across the country;</P>
        <P LI="1">calls on the Government to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />reconsider immediately the short-term revenue generating measures taken in the recent budget which will not deliver long-term gain for the industry;</P><Col N="293"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />take steps immediately to ensure tourism products and marketing spend in regional areas are enhanced to take advantage of open skies;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />introduce concrete steps aimed at restoring competitiveness and reducing cost pressures on the tourism industry; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />revise the action plan for the industry, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action 2003-2012, to take into account the new pressures facing the industry in the context of the current economic climate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming to listen to the debate.  I look forward to hearing his contribution, when he will be able to outline what aids and incentives he believes are appropriate at this difficult time for tourism and any other worthwhile ideas he might have.</P>
        <P>When I listened to Senator Ellis reeling off figures, I thought of the old saying about lies, damned lies and statistics.  In my area and in many others, unfortunately, many people are calling this the worst tourist season in living memory.  Of course, there are more tourism products than ever before and we had some good years.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister refer to Killarney House.  There is a proposal with his Department with regard to cultural tourism and the major funds available for worthwhile projects in this regard.  I know his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is interested in this issue, as is the chamber of commerce and all Killarney tourism interests.  Something very worthwhile could happen.  Not alone could it be a visitor centre for the national park, it could have a room dedicated to the memory of the Earls of Kenmare, who lived there for so long, and to McShane, the man who built Washington, who lived there with his wife for 40 years before he left the house to the nation.  In fact, he had sold most of it cheaply to the nation before his death.  I look forward to hearing the Minister deal with this issue.  If he cannot deal with it today, perhaps he might be able to brief me separately.</P>
        <P>Tourism accounts for more than 250,000 jobs across a variety of sectors.  With the recent downturn in tourism numbers, this obviously spells danger for employment in these sectors.  Tourism has contributed nearly &euro;3 billion per annum to the Exchequer in tax revenue through expenditure on tourism related goods and services.  This is vitally important to the Exchequer and, as such, needs to be protected to ensure it will continue, in so far as we can ensure this.  The indicators at present are not good.</P>
        <P>Last year, there were almost 8 million visitors to the State and, while this is an admirable figure, it has sadly not been sustained this year.  The Minister admitted in the D&aacute;il during a parliamentary question session that the figures for the first seven months of 2008 were only just ahead of last year&rsquo;s figures and that the figures for July were less positive.  The figures for August look likely to continue this downward trend, which the Minister might be able to confirm.  Overall visitor numbers for July were down by 8% to 835,000 but even this fall was cushioned by a relatively good performance from continental Europe, which managed to maintain last year&rsquo;s level of visitors.  North America was down by 6% but the most disappointing performance was from Great Britain, which showed a drop of 17% on July of last year.  In my area, I hardly met an American visitor this year.</P>
        <P>Mention was made of our great golf courses, of which the south-west has its share, but unfortunately, as the Minister is aware, income from green fees has decreased greatly.  This may have resulted from the shocking weather in July and August, which, while it is outside our control, meant that many clubs had to make big refunds to visitors who came but could not play.  Sadly, the visiting American golfer did not seem to come this year.</P><Col N="294"/>
        <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation has predicted that this year will see the first drop in overseas visitor numbers since 2002, with a consequent drop in tourism revenue.  Revenue is also likely to suffer given the weakened condition of sterling and the dollar, allied to the trend toward shorter stays.  Possible reasons for this drop in overseas visitors include the following.  The reality in respect of the visitor figures from Europe, which the Minister said are holding up, is that these represent low spend figures and they will probably disappear because all the indications are they relate to family members of migrant workers coming to Ireland.  Those visitors will disappear if the reports we hear about high unemployment among migrant workers are true, which we know they are.</P>
        <P>The climate is another factor.  While this is not something which can be attributed to the Government, it nevertheless has an impact on the suitability of Ireland as a tourist destination.  For the second successive summer, rainfall totals were above normal everywhere and were more than twice the average in the east and south east of the country.  Dublin Airport had its wettest summer since 1958, while it was the wettest at Cork Airport since records began there in 1962.  Except for a few parts of the west and north west, each of the summer months was wetter than normal.  A total of between 42 and 48 wet days was recorded at most stations for the three-month period compared with the normal range for summer of between 32 and 38 wet days.</P>
        <P>There has been a downturn in the world economy and there also has been a common trend towards an increase in travel by visiting friends and relatives.  Such tourists tend to spend less than holidaymakers or other promotional visitors and this trend adds a further negative impact on yield per visitor.  The drop in tourism has a number of knock-on effects for the Irish economy, including redundancies as there is no longer a need for the provision of certain services to the same extent.</P>
        <P>The Government has not helped tourism with regard to areas such as the increase in taxi fares and the &euro;10 levy in respect of flights leaving the country.  The response by Ryanair to this tax has been to heavily reduce its presence in Shannon and British Airways has cancelled its Dublin-Gatwick service.  The Government abandoned the decision to separate Cork and Knock airports from the DAA, which means these regional airports are simply unable to take decisions for themselves, they experience a lack of autonomy and they are being laden with debt from the DAA.  There is also lack of public transport at night to and from Dublin Airport, which does not accommodate late night flights.</P>
        <P>There is also the failure to take advantage of open skies.  The Government failed to harness the potential afforded to Ireland in the context of open skies because the opportunities included more passenger flights, lower prices and more choices of carrier from Irish airports to the EU and the US.  There is massive potential for Irish airports to establish themselves as hubs for the US and Europe and new trading and tourism opportunities with existing and emerging markets.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed &euro;10 tax from 30 March on outgoing flights of more than 300 km and &euro;2 on shorter journeys, while this will not apply to children under two years, disabled passengers and their helpers, it is estimated it will raise &euro;95 million in 2009 and &euro;150 million in a full year.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response on this issue.  Surely some alleviation can be provided in this regard.  The Minister might spell out how he can solve this problem.  We on the western seaboard are very disadvantaged.  As I have said on previous occasions, the only flight from Kerry not taxed would be to Dublin.</P>

	<P>I thank colleagues for welcoming me to the House and for the opportunity to speak to this motion, which highlights the success of Irish tourism to date as well as noting current trends in the sector.  The motion is timely given the changes in global conditions, even in the relatively short time since the House considered the position of Irish tourism last April.</P>
        <P>While the international tourism market is becoming increasingly competitive, Ireland has consistently outperformed its competitors in terms of growing the number of overseas visitors to our shores.  Taking the long view, in 1990 overseas visitor numbers to Ireland were just over 3 million.  That has more than doubled to an all-time high of 8 million visitors in 2007.  Revenue earnings from these visitors have also grown steadily.  In 1990, foreign visitors spent just over &euro;1 billion in Ireland.  That figure grew to almost &euro;5 billion in 2007.</P>
        <P>Tourism also generates an estimated &euro;2.3 billion in tax receipts to the Irish State.  The latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland data estimate the number of people in jobs in tourism and hospitality as at least 320,000.</P>
        <P>The Government is supporting and has supported the development of Irish tourism directly in three key areas, funding for overseas and domestic marketing and promotion, developing the capacity of businesses and managers as well as the skills of those working in Irish tourism and supporting tourism infrastructure and product development.</P>
        <P>The total allocation for tourism in 2009 is over &euro;160 million.  The corresponding allocation in 2003 was &euro;107 million.  Thus, even in the context of the current economic and budgetary stringency, the allocation to the tourism sector has increased by 53% over the allocation made in the Department&rsquo;s first full year in 2003.  There will be marginal reductions in the budgets of the principal tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in 2009 but these will be largely absorbed by savings in pay, overheads, consultancy and non-programme advertising.</P>
        <P>Our investment in front-line international tourism marketing is being maintained.  The tourism marketing fund for 2009 is &euro;48.5 million, which will enable Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to maintain the scale of their investment in marketing.  Given the overall economic situation, the tourism agencies should also be in a position to negotiate better value in terms of advertising and marketing space.</P>
        <P>In 2009, capital funding of &euro;11 million is being provided to support investment in key tourism infrastructure, attractions and visitor facilities which are in need of upgrading and development and to bring on stream some new products and experiences to meet the sophisticated needs of increasingly demanding tourists.</P>
        <P>The sustained Government and private investment of recent years in people, product and marketing within the overarching framework provided by <i>New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action</i> has given Irish tourism a new strength in depth.  This strength in depth, together with the partnership between Government and its agencies, the industry and key players, which has worked so well in recent years, will be fundamental to our capacity to deal with challenges that now face us as global tourism slows down in the face of a deteriorating economic situation worldwide and at home.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the current domestic and international environment is very challenging for tourism worldwide and in Ireland.  Sharp changes in fuel costs and a global economic downturn, coupled with falling consumer confidence and adverse trends in exchange rates, are affecting business.  The latest international projections are that growth in tourism arrivals worldwide, including the rapidly growing long-haul destinations, will be down to approximately 2% for 2008 and less in 2009.  Indications are that tourism growth across Europe stagnated over <Col N="296"/>the summer months &mdash; international arrivals in our region of Europe were up just 0.3% for the year to August.  In the same period, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas visitor numbers were down just 0.1%.  Indications are that we are continuing to hold our own, while many of our competitors are faring less well.  Meanwhile, growth is continuing in the long-haul markets reflecting the broader economic trends.  There was a 1.3% increase in revenue from overseas visitors in the first half of this year.  In actual terms, expenditure from overseas visitors for the first six months was &euro;2,137 million.  The fall-off in monthly numbers over the summer reflects trends across Europe, where the year started positively but saw a downturn in monthly figures from May onward.</P>
        <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation has stated that the fundamentals of the industry remain strong and Irish tourism is better positioned to withstand any downturn than in the past.  In particular, as our overseas tourism business has diversified across a wider range of markets in recent years, this has given it the capacity to better withstand pressures on particular markets.  I am heartened that the sector generally remains positive and confident for the medium term, building on its growing professionalism and resilience of recent years.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that our businesses are responding positively to current challenges, it is important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  I have therefore decided to take steps to renew our strategic framework for tourism development as set out in <i>New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action</i>.  I am currently finalising arrangements to put in place a renewal group.  This group will examine the current tourism policy and programme priorities, with a particular focus on the challenges which lie ahead, and will develop a road map to assist us in ensuring that tourism continues to be a major industry for Ireland.  I will seek for the group to complete its work in the first half of next year.</P>
        <P>In that context, various colleagues raised particular aspects of tourism in their areas, which could feed into that process in terms of the priorities and the emphasis that must be made on some of the products available, whether it is in Mayo, Sligo, Kerry, Killarney or wherever.  That may be added value in terms of this review.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland will shortly launch its 2009 overseas marketing strategy and plans.  At the heart of the visitor experience in Ireland are our people.  I was particularly pleased that in 2007, Ireland topped the Lonely Planet blue list survey as the world&rsquo;s friendliest destination.  Recent detailed consumer research undertaken by Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland endorses the findings of this survey.</P>
        <P>Getting to know the people of Ireland is a multi-dimensional experience and in particular can be enriched by engaging with our culture and heritage.  As part of the Department&rsquo;s 2009 planning process, I propose to take an initiative to develop the potential of cultural tourism, building in the first instance on co-operation and synergy between the bodies and institutions under my remit.  This initiative will build on some planning work already undertaken.  I intend to bring together the heads of the key arts, sport and tourism sectoral development bodies and the national cultural institutions to draw up a cultural tourism action programme to be initiated as soon as possible.  That will strengthen the arts and culture family and help the Irish tourism industry to address the current challenges and boost business in future years.</P>
        <P>Both the tourism agencies have demonstrated their worth over the past few years.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed the quality of our product, not only by supporting capital investment in product but also through developing the skills and capacities of those working in and managing our tourism businesses, and ensuring that our standards compare with anywhere in the world.  They have also been central in the strong growth of domestic tourism.</P><Col N="297"/>
        <P>Tourism Ireland has been driving the international marketing of the island of Ireland in Great Britain, Europe, North America and, increasingly, new and developing markets such as China, India and South Africa.  It is fair to say that Tourism Ireland is widely respected by its counterparts and competitors and is also acknowledged as being an exemplar of what can be done through North-South co-operation.</P>
        <P>I would like to give a special acknowledgement in this context to the work not only of Tourism Ireland but also of my counterparts in Northern Ireland, where the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and her Department have worked closely with us to ensure that Tourism Ireland maximises the tourism benefits for both parts of the island.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am pleased that the House is taking an active interest in tourism, perhaps our longest-standing internationally-traded service industry.  We all recognise that these are extraordinarily challenging and difficult times for every economic sector, and tourism is not immune, but with a robust strategic and policy framework, strong partnership between the public and private sectors, effective State agencies, appropriate investment in marketing and product, and tourism enterprises which are now on a par with those anywhere in the world in terms of management capacity and quality, I am confident that Ireland can face the challenges and position ourselves to come out of this downturn stronger.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  The motion before us is timely and opportune given the figures published today but I wonder if we can continue to blame the weather, the euro, sterling, the dollar, the price of oil and the international climate for everything that goes wrong in this country.  An honest appraisal of the prices we charge, the cost of doing business in this country, the need for a cohesive plan, the changes in our welcome and in employment in our tourism sector and the lack of infrastructure, from our regional and major airports in Cork and Dublin to the city centres, make us look to the future.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, the tourism figures for the last quarter of this year undoubtedly show that we face a challenging period.  There has been a 17% decline in UK visitor numbers, which are down by 65,800.  The figure for the rest of Europe is down by 8,800.  The figure for the United States and Canada is down by 10,200 and the figure for visitors from elsewhere in the world is down 1,200.  That is a 10.8% decrease, with the biggest decrease being in visitors from our neighbour, the UK.  That is an indication that our largest indigenous industry is facing a major challenge, and we should not overlook the fact that tourism is this country&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry.  It contributes more than 7% to service exports and accounts for &euro;1 in every &euro;20 spent on goods and services here.  It would be wrong if we dismissed the 250,000 jobs in the tourism industry.  Tourism contributes &euro;3 billion per annum in tax revenue.  We should not just abandon that and the Minister probably will not.  We must examine where we are going.  In the presentation the ITIC made to the Oireachtas joint committee its representative said, &ldquo;Ireland is not in a good place in terms of growth prospects for the next couple of year.&rdquo;  I am happy that the Minister said we need a plan and he spoke about the renewal of the plan.  We need a vision and a strategic plan for Irish tourism.  That will begin with the domestic market and go outwards.  We need a major emphasis on value for money.  We must be about value for money.  I hope the Minister will go back to his Cabinet colleagues and talk to the banks which need to pass on the interest rate cut to businesses.  I hope the Minister will also pass on the need for liquidity for banks to be able to do business.</P>
        <P>We need major renewal in our cultural area.  I speak in the context of our music.  I pay tribute to the work of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  Music brings people into the country.  Our playwrights, our language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We need a few in here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a few very good actors on the far side.  Senator Norris uses Bloomsday as a means of getting people into Ireland.  We should encourage more of this kind of activity.  Ireland is an island of festivals; we have a festival for nearly everything.  In my city, Cork, we have festivals for jazz, film, folk music and I could keep going.  Let us promote our culture more and have Ireland&rsquo;s distinctive culture embedded and imbued across the world.</P>
        <P>I hope we can examine the issue of short breaks and I will return to that later.  The Minister did not refer to the travel tax in his speech.  That is the daftest tax we have introduced in a long time.  It is anti-consumer, anti-tourism and anti-business.  The imposition of this tax when the aviation and travel industries are in trouble defies logic.  I have met no one in Government who has told me of the benefit of it.  I am sorry that Senator Carty has left the Chamber because last week the chief executive officer of Ireland West Airport Knock said the travel tax will have a devastating effect on his airport and will reduce tourism revenue by approximately &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million next year.  Imagine the impact in Cork, where the tax will be imposed, unlike Dublin.  It makes no sense.  Rather than tying the hands of our airlines and airports, we should encourage people to come and visit.</P>
        <P>I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has left the Chamber.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, a sportsman himself, might tell the Cabinet that under no circumstances should Ireland be without an Irish Open golf tournament next year.  We used the Ryder Cup to promote Ireland and it worked to a point.  The Irish Open is a major vehicle, through Sky television and the golfing fraternity, for attracting more people to the country.  Senator Coghlan referred to golf in his remarks.  I ask the Minister of State not to allow this to be lost.  If we are not negotiating with the European Tour, we should be.</P>
        <P>May I refer to my own city and county of Cork?  We have no permanent ferry link with the UK and we need one.  We face another summer with no ferry service to the UK.  It closes off an avenue of promotion.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We need a permanent ferry link with the UK.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, use his good offices to talk to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey?  I do not know if he is aware of the seriousness and severity of this for tourism in the south-west region.  We spoke about the hotels, and the regional distribution of visitors requires urgent attention.  We cannot have regional distribution only in Dublin and around the Pale.  Cork city is the capital of the south.  County Cork is the largest country in Ireland.  We must encourage people to go beyond the M50 and visit places such as Cork where one can have a great urban break with shopping, restaurants and sport.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the ITIC has 41 websites in 19 languages, but business tourism in places such as Cork must be advocated.  It is daft that a city and county such as Cork has no major conference centre.  I referred to that in the previous debate in the House on tourism.  Cork requires a conference centre.  We are planning a national conference centre but I speak on behalf of the people of Cork.  Our cultural heritage is of paramount importance to the development and evolution of tourism and attracting visitors.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been involved in the budget talks through his Department.  The travel tax must be repealed.  We are talking about attracting people.  The cost of doing business in Ireland has increased exponentially and this has not been addressed, so perhaps the Irish Hotels Federation could examine the cost factor in what hotels charge people for eating out, etc.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  Not everything is rosy in the garden.  It is not just the weather.  The tourism industry needs a major revamp.  I am not sure the Government has the vehicle or wheels to propel it forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I am glad this discussion is taking place.  We have had much discussion in recent weeks on the downturn in the economy and much of this has been of a very general nature.  We must examine the individual elements of the economy, especially our strengths and how we might sustain and build on them.  In recent weeks in the Oireachtas committee we have had most of the main agencies before us to discuss tourism.  We have had F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Rural Tourism Federation and various groups that provide a service to the tourism industry.  While they all say these are challenging times, each one adopted an upbeat attitude to the challenges facing us.  That is the starting point if we are to get the maximum benefit from the tourism potential.</P>
        <P>Over the years of the Troubles one can understand the difficulties the tourism industry must have had trying to market the island of Ireland &mdash; at that stage we marketed only the Republic &mdash; against some recent atrocity that would have been highlighted throughout the world.  It could have come right in the middle of a specific marketing campaign.  Despite this, the tourism board, then Bord F&aacute;ilte, would respond on each occasion.  It must have been exceptionally difficult, even more difficult than the challenges that face us now.  One of the best developments that has taken place under the Good Friday Agreement has been the establishment of Tourism Ireland to market the whole island of Ireland.  When one was trying to promote Ireland abroad, it was quite an irony to have to draw a line across this island, in some cases separating tourist attractions which are quite close to each other.  I am pleased to note the new arrangement is working exceptionally well.  It has helped the industry in this jurisdiction.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has replaced Bord F&aacute;ilte in looking after the home base.  Bord F&aacute;ilte had an exceptional record, by any measure, in building up the tourism industry.  I am sure F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue that good work.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am glad that a sense of getting back to basics has been evident in recent announcements made by the tourism industry.  The basics to which I refer are the strong and exclusive things that make Ireland different as a tourist destination.  Discerning tourists will not leave their own countries to come here if they think they will get a copy of what they have at home.  I am reminded of a major tourism survey that was conducted 15 or 16 years ago.  It highlighted the six main features of this island that attract people here.  The first item on the list was this country&rsquo;s collection of national monuments.  That should encourage us because our base of national monuments is so strong.  It is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s monuments are not confined to large urban centres of population.  If tourists are prepared to travel to see a built heritage attraction, tourism business can be attracted to the most isolated parts of the country.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>Traditional music and genealogy were also among the six features of this country highlighted in the survey to which I referred.  While the first generation of the Irish diaspora has been replaced by the second and third generations, the willingness of tourists to come here to trace their roots has not changed.  The interest of people of Irish extraction in coming here has been refreshed by the status of this country in fields like economics, sport, literature and cinema.  The people in question are proud of Ireland and are keen to visit the source of that pride.  The existence of the Irish diaspora, as a committed and captive audience, is one of the strongest tools we have at our disposal when it comes to tourism.  As we try to sell Ireland in a competitive market, it is important that we have almost 40 million people of Irish extraction at our disposal in north America.</P>
        <P>I have already mentioned the need to get back to basics.  Ireland&rsquo;s confidence has been enhanced in many ways in the past ten or 15 years, which has given us a newfound willingness to emphasise those attractions that are exclusive to this island.  That exclusivity is the biggest thing we can offer discerning visitors from other countries.  When we are discussing value for money, which is an important issue, we must compare like with like.  I am afraid that if one lowers the quality of the product one is offering, simply to be able to say one is providing better value for money, one will find it more difficult to attract the type of tourist that has been the mainstay of our success &mdash; the discerning tourist who comes to Ireland on a regular basis.  I have seen that happening to some extent in the airline industry.  I accept we are getting a good spin-off from that.</P>
        <P>In these challenging times, we are lucky that huge sums of money have been already invested in our tourism infrastructure.  We can build for the future from the infrastructural base that exists in urban and rural areas.  We should feel more capable than many other countries of overcoming the difficulties that currently exist.  Other countries do not have the same tourism base as Ireland because they did not make the same level of investment over the years.  Above all else, they did not cultivate their heritage and culture as we have done.  Everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet in that regard.  Ireland&rsquo;s culture, heritage and literature strike a chord with people from other countries.  I refer not only to the Irish diaspora, which is huge in itself, but also to many other people.  Ireland is seen as an attractive specialised tourist destination.  We can attract high spenders, who have a certain amount of finance at their disposal, as well as low spenders.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that the character of the Irish tourism business has changed because many of the immigrant visitors to this island are working in the hospitality and catering sectors.  I believe we can turn that to our advantage.  In years gone by, the very thing that made us attractive, apart from the matters I have mentioned such as our scenery, was our people.  Tourists often regarded their encounters with people who had the time to talk to them as one of the highlights of their visits to Ireland.  I am confident, on the basis of our track record, the investment that has been made, our history and the potential we may have, that our tourism industry can overcome the difficulties it may encounter.  We are well poised to cope with any competition that may come our way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to the House.  He comes from the same part of the world &mdash; the midlands &mdash; as my mother&rsquo;s people.  I think he is a good Laois man.  He does not have responsibility for this issue, given that he is a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, but I am sure he will winnow out the more sensible and trenchant remarks that are made and bring them to the attention of the relevant Minister.  He is ably assisted by two officials.  I know they will examine what we have to say.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>I do not want to get involved in the dispute between the motion and the amendment.  It is a classic example of the Wednesday night ping-pong that goes on in this House.  Members on one side think the Government is wrong and Members on the other side think it is right.  It is terribly boring.  Good points have been made by Senators on both sides of the argument.  It stands to reason that our tourism industry has been affected by the economic downturn and the fluctuations in currency, etc.  We have held our heads surprisingly well in the circumstances.  I will speak briefly about some of the things that have happened at the James Joyce Centre, with which I am involved, over recent years, including this year.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who is now in the Chair, that cultural tourism is at the heart of our tourism industry.  He has played a significant role, through Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, in the development of traditional music, which now has a wide audience throughout the world.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about some of the elements our tourism agencies promote.  There is a role for stuff like key rings, mugs and tea towels, but it is all so blaringly obvious.  We need to focus on what is distinctive about Ireland.  I have often said that, in addition to traditional music, books and bricks are the two most distinctive things we have.  People do not come here for the weather because they appreciate they will not get a suntan here.  Nowadays, some people come here in their wetsuits to avail of our remarkably good surfing locations.  Ireland&rsquo;s weather does not necessarily deter tourists.  Many people live in very warm parts of the world, where there is sunlight all the time.  They are sick of being scorched.  Such people find the rain reasonably refreshing, which is curious.  They are not as put off by it as we are.  Our weather will not attract many tourists, however.  It is our culture &mdash; by which I do not mean tea towels, key rings and drink &mdash; that will attract them.  Please spare us from the drink culture.  I am bored by it and tired of it.  Its promotion does no good for our country.  I refer to phenomena like the area of Dublin that was recently described as &ldquo;Temple Barf&rdquo;.  We have had enough of that.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>Joyce is an international brand name which could not be bought, and we are lucky.  We are different from the rest because we are the emerald isle, 40 shades of green were given to us and we have James Joyce, who is known all over the world.  If one mentions Joyce, people think Ireland.  If one mentions Ireland, people think Joyce.  The name brings huge numbers of tourists to Dublin.</P>
        <P>We established the James Joyce Centre approximately 20 years ago and we managed to repair the entire building, which was about to be pulled down by philistine authorities and the wonderful series of ceilings used as in-fill for the Poolbeg generating station.  We rescued it.  Our footfall has been consistent over the past four or five years at 17,000, which compares very favourably with the fully supported anchors such as the James Joyce Tower in Sandycove and the Dublin Writers Museum.  The former is the setting for the opening section of <i>Ulysses</i>, yet the centre still attracts more visitors.</P>
        <P>Until recently I was on the board of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, which has experienced a downturn.  It could not survive without tourists and it generates enormous revenue from them.  We should re-examine support for historical ecclesiastical buildings.  I understand absolutely the sensitivities associated with the separation of church and state, which I completely approve of, but buildings of international significance should be looked after.</P>
        <P>It is terribly important that the James Joyce Centre stays where it is.  We have a good plan and the Department has been extraordinarily helpful in this matter.  However, the centre cannot be looked at exclusively in commercial terms.  If it was commercial, it would close tomorrow.  We have kept our side of the bargain and we have met all the required financial targets but unless we are supported regarding the building and Bloomsday is hived off, which would also be good for the city, with the building treated separately, the centre will be in difficulty.  I recall talking to Bord F&aacute;ilte when Bloomsday was nothing.  I told the officials that if they played this <Col N="302"/>right, they would have an event similar to Mardi Gras.  Bloomsday has evolved over 40 years and it is celebrated all over the world.  I am invited to every city and I could go anywhere I want.  I always stay in Dublin out of loyalty to the James Joyce Centre.  The unique aspect of the day in Ireland is it has expanded to Blooms week.  We shifted the readings from the centre to Temple Bar, which brings everything alive.  Let us recognise it.</P>
        <P>Genealogy is great fun.  I love it but it is all hokum.  I was involved in the Fitzpatrick clan society and it was immense fun.  A number of enormously wealthy Yanks came over.  They had a parchment scroll from here to Adam showing they were the kings of Ossory.  One woman said, &ldquo;Well in the midst of all this royalty, I guess I am one of the ordinary Fitzpatricks.  I am Colleen Fitzpatrick.  My folks left this here Queen&rsquo;s County, as they called it then, to go to New Orleans in 1847.&rdquo;  She was like hell ordinary, given she was a senior NASA scientist involved in DNA testing.  I rushed to the front of the room and said, &ldquo;Open my veins.  Take my blood.  I sacrifice myself in the name of clan.&rdquo;  I was despised, spurned and rejected because they wanted mitochondrial DNA.  I volunteered my cousin who sent them a lump of spit in an envelope.  It was returned and the letter was all X, Y, Z, as it were.  He asked whether I understood it and I replied that I did.  He said he was a doctor and he did not.  I understood the only paragraph that mattered, which stated he was undoubtedly the last remnants of the ancient royal and noble family.  This was rubbish.  We are all descended from frogspawn but what a card to play at these gatherings.  The following year I attended a gathering and the Yanks were not present.  I asked what happened them and I was told it was a bit embarrassing.  I said, &ldquo;I like embarrassment.  Do tell&rdquo;, and I was told they may have been from somewhere in near Asia.  They were not even European.  Genealogy is a wonderful card to play.</P>
        <P>With regard to transport, the metro must proceed.  I am glad taxis were deregulated because we now have taxis all over the place.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Abbey Theatre.  My first choice for this wonderful institution was for it to remain on its current site but apparently that was impossible.  My next choice was the Carlton site but that has been loused up by property interests.  It must not be allowed, therefore, to become a token in a commercial development on the Dublin docks.  It should be in the GPO.  I was told by officials that the theatre would not fit there.  I am not an engineer but I visited DIT Bolton Street which has a school of architecture.  The design of the theatre in the GPO is the final year project for engineering students.  They have completed three dimensional modelling and have compared it with all the national theatres throughout the world.  As Barack Obama said, &ldquo;Yes we can.&rdquo;  It would fit perfectly.  They have arrangements for scene docks and so on.  Imagine the connection with the cultural revolution and the relationship between Yeats, the theatre, Pearse and &ldquo;A terrible beauty is born&rdquo;.  Imagine as a project for 2016 to commemorate 1916 the opening of the Irish national theatre, the Abbey, on every television set throughout the globe, bang in the middle of O&rsquo;Connell Street with the Luas, the metro, taxis, bicycles cars and every damn thing delivering people there.  What a fantastic space.  Watch this space; the people will prevail.  The naysayers will be put back in their box and I hope, with the assistance of open-minded officials and the Minister, the Abbey Theatre will be located where it should be, on our prime street, O&rsquo;Connell Street, for 2016.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator touched on nothing being done about other tourist attractions.  In 1965 my mother opened a little farm guest house on Sheep&rsquo;s Head, 13 miles west of Bantry, at a time when there was little hope in the country.  We had no electricity but we survived without it until 1977 and she reared 11 children.  She did not have a telephone until 1967.  She educated many of us through a simple tourism project in the middle of nowhere.  Recently I came across an <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal </i>article about what she was doing at the time for tourism in which she was photographed.  We have moved on light years from that and we are making major strides and doing very well.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the airport charges but they were mentioned earlier and I do not want to into the issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State will deal with it when he responds.  The airport in Cork is wonderful, despite the shenanigans over its debt and so on.  In the current climate the new terminal building would not have been built.  I use the airport regularly and I would like it to cater for transatlantic flights from Cork to the east and mid-west of America.  That should be achieved as it would be wonderful for tourism in the south west.</P>
        <P>I refer to health and fitness tourism.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; highlighted heritage tourism, which is wonderful, but the market is expanding for people who enjoy simple pursuits such as walking.  I was involved in the establishment of the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way.  Last Sunday, I walked five miles through the mountains during a soft day in west Cork but it was pleasant.  For every tourist who plays golf, three prefer to walk.  We have the most wonderful, exceptional and safe walks throughout the country, which should be highlighted and promoted.  This is the way forward.  I am amazed by the number of young people who avail of these walks.  The weather is not a factor because one can survive on a reasonably wet day wearing the appropriate gear.  It is a healthy pastime.  Walking provides a wonderful opportunity to promote remote parts of Ireland.  I thank the Minister, the Department and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the wonderful initiative they have adopted.  In many remote disadvantaged areas, such as Beara, parts of Kerry, west Cork and Mayo where they have waymarked ways, farmers are getting a top-up in their REPS payment for maintaining the walks.  That is co-operation and it is a positive way forward.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, will not have heard of this but he might address it in his response.  There is a wonderful feature coming to Bantry Bay in 2012 called the Atlantic Challenge.  It was held in Finland this year.  It is an international event covering a number of disciplines involving youth from the ages of 16 to 28.  It is a mixture of rowing, sailing, safety at sea, navigation skills, etc.  That should be highlighted and promoted as a wonderful attraction.  Bantry has now been designated as a tourist hub and already we are seeing the benefits.</P>
        <P>Being somewhat parochial again, I cannot forget the issue of the Cork-Swansea ferry.  Technically, this comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, but no doubt the loss of this link for the past two seasons has been critical to the south west, to Cork and Kerry, given the amount of people who used it.  In many instances the people who used it were from Wales and the British midlands.  It is a terrible loss to the region from the point of view of tourism and commerce, and to the fishing ports and the container lorries that used it to travel to England and further afield.  I ask the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to take a hands-on approach to this matter.  I am aware that there are certain difficulties in trying to locate a ship.  However, when I was elected chairman of Cork County Council in 1989-90 this ferry service was one of my commitments.  I was fortunate enough to also become a Senator in 1990, and the ferry service was restored when this country was recovering from a sustained economic <Col N="304"/>depression.  We can still achieve such an outcome.  It would be most regrettable if the ferry facility were not available for next year.</P>
        <P>Marine tourism is another area which may have been mentioned already.  For every yacht in Ireland &mdash; I do not refer to the yuppies &mdash; there are 500 in Australia, although perhaps that statistic has changed slightly.  When one considers the position in France and elsewhere, the manner in which we in Ireland have neglected the area of marine tourism is regrettable.  Thankfully, in the past four or five years Cork County Council recognised that.  We in west Cork are in a wonderful position in that there is a little of it in Kinsale.  From Baltimore, Schull, Crookhaven, Bantry and along the coast down to Dingle, there is not a decent marina, and yachting is becoming a popular event.  My point is that marinas can be self-sufficient and can be built because those who can afford a &pound;500,000 yacht can afford to buy a suitable berth.  Marine tourism has potential where we have beautiful bays and inlets.  In Schull harbour this summer there were approximately 160 yachts scattered over various moorings.  We must develop this tourism potential. While we may be a bit late in the day, if we grasp the nettle in terms of marine tourism the benefits to the economy will be far-reaching.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to say a brief few words on tourism which is one of the success stories of the past decade that we cannot deny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to the House.  I will begin with my usual spiel when it comes to tourism.  I also welcome the officials whom I know well.  </P>
        <P>For the Minister of State&rsquo;s information, I am an insider trader when it comes to this topic because I worked in the sector for nine years.  I will gauge my comments as party spokesperson on tourism but I hope he will bear in mind that they will be based on what I think is in the best interests of the future development of tourism.  I will use this opportunity to pick out certain areas that need to be promoted because I believe we are at a crossroads, and this is not just because of the international situation or the funding issue at home.  We have had incredible success in tourism and it needs to be acknowledged.  However, we all acknowledge there are some areas where we probably could have achieved more, there is an issue regarding products and there is an issue regarding regional spread.</P>
        <P>The first issue to which I will refer is that of the markets.  There has been a significant turnaround in the past year and the figures speak for themselves.  The UK market is particularly worrying, and it needs to be addressed quickly.  There is a related issue of competitiveness and how we market our product.  From a competitive point of view, we need to change our stance.</P>
        <P>Paul O&rsquo;Toole, chief executive of Tourism Ireland has told me about the significant encouragement he is getting from eastern Europe.  That is a welcome development which needs to be progressed further.  Short breaks are the way of the future for us when it comes to the European markets and we need more investment in this area.  Fundamentally, how we promote the short breaks is important.  It needs to be localised.  Much work has gone into this but it is worth expending greater effort in this area.</P>
        <P>The United States will pose a problem, given the turnaround in that market and the currency issue.  While Mr. Joe Byrne and his team over there are doing a good job, we must remember that the yield there is quite large. The creation of an area of advocacy was brought up during the Irish tourism review.  I do not know where the proposal ended up but, when it comes to the United States market, that role needs to be encouraged more.  I am not sure the proposal ended up anywhere.</P><Col N="305"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The most important aspect of Irish tourism is maintaining the Irish experience.  Despite some research, there is an issue here.  Visitor surveys show that we need to ensure our way of life has not been detrimental to the Irish experience.  While statistics say one thing, there is anecdotal evidence to show there is a particular concern in this area.</P>
        <P>In terms of tourism, competitiveness is key in terms of value for money.  Some 34% of people surveyed were not happy with our services, an increase of 10% in the past couple of years.  We all know we have a problem in this regard, the issue is how to address it.  Three areas that need to be addressed are food, hotels and green fees.  We should not encourage and promote to the same degree those who charge golf green fees of &euro;400 and &euro;500 during the summer.  Such fees are simply outrageous and do not contribute to the promotion of Irish tourism, and we need to acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>I welcome F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s review of the costs incurred in serving food.  However, we need a breakdown not just of labour and raw materials, but of all ancillary costs, to determine how one can justify, certainly in large urban areas, passing on such charges to visitors.  They see it as a rip-off.</P>
        <P>On hotels, we must get real.  I have said this a number of times to members of the Irish Hotels Federation.  Bedrooms are a perishable product.  One cannot use a bed-night a second time.  The airline industry learned this lesson.  There is a proliferation of hotels in this country.  Se&aacute;n Quinn, the chief executive of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has admitted we have enough, if not too many, hotels.  Many of them have been in trouble recently, and some have closed down.  If they do not engage, like the airline industry, in selling those rooms to cover their overheads, they all will be in trouble.  The idea that prices need to be maintained to keep a certain plateau needs to be thrown out.  In modern times, it simply does not wash.</P>
        <P>A number of areas in product development and marketing need to be addressed .  I have heard all the stories about rural tourism, which in theory is close to my heart given that I am a Tipperary man.  There is, however, no such product.  What we really need is development of more products in rural areas.  While some work has been done, we need to concentrate on developing tourism clusters, particularly around lake lands and areas where we can create activity-based destinations.</P>
        <P>Regionalisation is important.  From a tourism perspective we have been successful but from a regionalisation perspective we have failed.  This will be important to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who comes from a location near me.  When I worked in the tourism industry, a comment that was made about tourism promotion was that we had a hole in the doughnut, namely, the middle of Ireland.  Unless the role of Dublin Tourism is addressed we will always have this hole in the doughnut.  Dublin Tourism is a fine organisation which does a fantastic job for Dublin but because access is through Dublin, it does not encourage people to go down the centre spine of Ireland.  This needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Domestic tourism is under-rated.  It contributes a huge volume of visitors, particularly to the middle of Ireland.  Approximately 70% of visitors to Offaly and Tipperary are domestically based.  We need to encourage this and Government incentives could be provided with regard to marketing and product development.  One of my bugbears is that we have a proliferation of tourism agencies.  For a long time, I have suggested that the roles of Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland overlap.  I have personal experience of this and I know they overlap in areas such as golf.  This needs to be addressed and I encourage the Government to do so.</P>
        <P>We also need to examine funding from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which overlaps in tourism, and the roles of Shannon Development, the Western Development Commission and various other agencies.  I do not state we should get rid of them but an issue is raised with regard to overlap in what they do.  Until this is dealt with we will never get the bang for buck for the amount of money we spend on tourism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak about the importance of the tourism industry to Ireland as we have known it and grown it and how we will progress it.  The contributions made by colleagues are to be commended and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to the House.  Earlier, I spoke with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State knows where is the hidden Ireland with regard to the beautiful midlands with its lake district, bogs, golf, music and the various attractions from the Rock of Cashel to the Shannon and the Seven Wonders of Fore &mdash; where I live &mdash; to Dun na R&iacute; in Cavan.</P>
        <P>As was stated, the figures are encouraging.  During the first three months of this year 890,000 holiday trips in Ireland came from the domestic market.  This is extremely encouraging particularly as we must look toward the domestic market in the coming years for tourists to come and enjoy what we have to offer in places such as Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Cavan, Tipperary and Roscommon and the entire midlands area.</P>
        <P>We are fortunate because worldwide, our music is a brand name.  For how many countries is music a brand name?  In his lifetime, the Acting Chairman, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, has done a great deal for Irish traditional music.  He has been a shining example to motivate us to show our appreciation for the tradition handed down to us through the establishment of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann which occurred in my native town of Mullingar.  Senator Camillus Glynn and the Acting Chairman are doing a great deal for Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The Acting Chairman has been also involved in all-Ireland fleadhanna which took place in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s home town for the past two years and which were shining examples.  I attended a fleadh in Mullingar in 1963 and had the great pleasure of playing in the Clones fleadh in 1964 which almost marked the birth of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Consider the worldwide success of Irish artists.  Consider the great ambassadors they have been for our country in letting everyone know about this young, vibrant well-educated country where 50% of the population is under 35 years of age.  Never more was this excelled than the night Celine Dion won the Eurovision Song Contest and Riverdance was born.  What wonderful achievements the two great musicals, namely, Riverdance and Lord of the Dance, are.  Michael Flatley and all associated with John McColgan and Moya Doherty, are the great creators and innovators and the ones who have done so much for our tourism throughout the world through the music of our country.</P>
        <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, and the officials that the world of dancing has become a phenomenon in Ireland.  Approximately 2,000 go to Killarney for a Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  They will go to Tralee in a month&rsquo;s time and to Bundoran or Castlebar to see Irish artists performing.  They can enjoy themselves with dancing and they will fill hotels, have meals and entertain themselves with genuine popular Irish artists.  This area is not given too much support at present but I want it considered for future funding.</P>
        <P>As was stated, hotels have been transformed in Ireland.  I have been in the hotel industry for a long time, since 1983, and most members of my family are heavily involved.  I handed it over because I wanted to become a full-time politician in 2003.  The Government transformed the industry by providing capital allowances to allow people to build hotels and provide the best standards to the tourists.  We know that one does well to have a profit margin of 5% or 6% and then one must pay taxes.  It is an extremely long-term investment for high services.  It creates jobs, with perhaps 50 or 60 people employed.  The Greville Arms in Mullingar employs 100 people.  They are all little factories in themselves which keep communities together and money is spent in the community area.</P>
        <P>We have excelled in this and I congratulate successive Ministers with responsibility for tourism and Governments which have provided us with this opportunity.  Hand in hand with this we have grown the concept of golf.  We have 440 golf courses in Ireland, with some of the best, <Col N="307"/>if not the best, in the world with regard to links courses such as Ballybunion, Portmarnock, Royal County Down, Enniscrone and we also have Esker Hills, Glasson and Slieve Russell.  We have beautiful, magnificent world-class golf courses and &mdash; a dream come true &mdash; one of our own has won back to back opens in the same year.  This was never before achieved by a European and Padraig Harrington deserves our congratulations.  He is the best ambassador we could possibly have to show a shining example that not alone are we building courses but we have one of the best golfers in the world.  We look forward to many more of his achievements.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Dublin Tourism and F&aacute;ilte Ireland for all they have done but my hero is Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  I remember when Castlepollard was in a county hurling final and if the game was a draw my friends could not afford the return flight home from England for the replay of the match.  Now, people can go anywhere in England, western Europe and eastern Europe and Michael O&rsquo;Leary has made it possible for them to come home.  Fair comment for a local man down the road and our congratulations must go to him for making air travel competitive. Maintaining competitiveness is the greatest challenge.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary has opened up Europe and I look forward to the further opening up of eastern Europe.  The latter represents a substantial market in which we can excel.</P>
        <P>I am proud to come from a county that has produced, in Athlone, John McCormack, and, in Mullingar, Joe Dolan.  As Senator Norris observed, the geniality factor is enormous, particularly for our friends in the United States.  We have a claim to John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton &mdash; whose mother was a Cassidy &mdash; and now Barack Obama, who we hope will visit the Taoiseach in his native county of Offaly.  Including the Cathaoirleach, three Offaly men occupy the highest positions in their respective spheres both in Ireland and in the United States.  We look forward to the inauguration of another of our ancestral sons in the White House in January.</P>
        <P>As I said on the Order of Business, I support the proposal to relocate the Abbey Theatre, if it is to be moved from its current location, to O&rsquo;Connell Street.  My friends in Castlepollard do not have to be told why O&rsquo;Connell Street is the ideal location.  It has all the necessary services, including tram services and proximity to train services.  I support the proposal to locate the theatre in the GPO.  However, there is no necessity for it to be based in the front of the building; instead, it could be located on one of the side streets.  We should remember that RTE commenced operation from the GPO.  Our forefathers gave their lives so that we could have the opportunity of free speech, and their struggle reached its climax in that building.  There is no better place.</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly welcome everything that has been done in the area of tourism.  However, much remains to be done and it is up to us to be the leaders, as we have been for the past 15 years in terms of our economy, in promoting our country as a tourist destination into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, to the House.  I support the Fine Gael amendment, which seeks to curb the exuberance of the Fianna F&aacute;il motion and to commend courses of action that will enhance our tourism product in the future.  To say all is well with our tourism industry is not accurate.  The statistics are stark.  In the month of August, for example, there was a 17% drop in visitors from Britain and a 10% drop in those from the United States.  These are alarming figures.  There was an overall reduction of 8% in the number of visitors in the month of July.  The tourism industry is faced with significant threats and challenges.  All I can say to my good friend, the Leader, and my colleagues on the other side of the House is to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, &ldquo;It has happened on your watch.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The reduction in the numbers of tourists from Britain and the United States raises the question of what we can do to alter this decline.  The Acting Chairman, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, made reference earlier to the importance of the 47 million people who constitute the Irish diaspora in the United States and the millions of others of Irish extraction throughout the world.  We <Col N="308"/>must come up with more imaginative and consistent ways to market Ireland among the diaspora.  We must look more closely at targeted marketing via direct mailshots, e-mails and every other form of direct communication in establishing links with these populations.  We should use our sports and music stars, as well as political figures, in these initiatives.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a great opportunity for such activities, but we must seek out similar opportunities on every occasion.  We should think outside the box to find ways of reaching out to people of Irish ancestry.</P>
        <P>I attended a meeting of the Cavan Association in London some days ago.  Several county associations were involved and it represented an obvious marketing opportunity.  While some Irish people living in Britain come home regularly, there is potential to delve further into that market.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to examine what further steps can be taken to develop links with the Irish abroad.  Not enough is being done in this regard.</P>
        <P>Given that the Government was so eloquent in its claims of responsibility for the Celtic tiger, it must equally accept responsibility for the inflation figure of 4%.  This presents a difficulty for tourism, with visitors often citing costs as an issue.  A cost benefit analysis of the proposed &euro;10 air travel tax should be undertaken.  It may well present a difficulty, particularly for those on return trips, given the popularity of cheap flights.  We must consider whether moneys accrued from this charge may be cancelled out by the potential loss of tourism revenue.  It is an ill conceived initiative in that it impacts on a multitude of low-income visitors.  I am not convinced it is the right approach to take.</P>
        <P>Many speakers referred to the great potential that exists in cultural tourism.  I acknowledge the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s significant contribution in this area.  I am proud to say I initiated a Percy French society in Cavan, making the link between Cavan and Roscommon, organising festivals and so on.  We made sure the places in which he had lived were marked.  That achieved much in terms of increasing tourist numbers to the locality.  We should do more in the area of cultural tourism, including literature, music, the arts generally, including cultural festivals based around historic figures such as Percy French, Bishop Bedell and Patrick Kavanagh.  Some work has been done in this regard but further opportunities exist in cultural tourism and the flagship events associated with it.  Likewise, there is great opportunity, in the context of my earlier point about the diaspora, in the idea of clan gatherings.</P>
        <P>Every county and every area should have a flagship tourism project, which is vital in increasing tourist numbers to those areas.  More should be done to expand this sector.  In this context, I was pleased at the recent achievement of Geopark status for the area around Blacklion in County Cavan.  I was also pleased to learn that the Castle Saunderson project for Scouting Ireland is to progress.  The latter was the subject of an Adjournment debate which I initiated some months ago.  That project has the potential to encourage many youngsters from various countries to become regular visitors to Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have many excellent hostelries in this State.  Contrary to what was said by a previous speaker, the demise of the Irish pub represents a serious threat to tourism.  Senator Norris said he did not favour the presentation of a stereotypical image of Ireland as a place with a drinking culture.  We all agree with that but the Irish pub is a unique establishment and it had enormous potential.  Something will have to be done to revive the Irish pub, such as providing alternative ways of ensuring local people can get to the pubs.  It was the local characters who made the Irish pub an attraction to visitors, and we must be careful in dealing with this issue.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the House is discussing this matter.  It merits many further hours of discussion because it is not possible to do it justice within the time constraints.  I urge the Government to accept the amendment as a realistic assessment of the difficulties in the industry at present and the need for the Government to be more proactive in dealing with them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="309"/>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion on tourism.  We should note the impressive figures for the number of overseas visitors to this country.  The number exceeded 8 million for the first time in 2007, an increase of more than 33% since 2001.  That is a most impressive statistic and the Government and the State agencies involved in this area are to be commended on the work and focus that has been brought to this important sector of our economy.</P>
        <P>However, we are entering difficult times and it will be necessary to re-examine the strategies we are using.  In a time of economic downturn tourism will be an extremely important sector.  Visitor rates might be affected and we might find it more challenging to attract long distance visitors in particular.  We will have to examine how we can refine our strategy in this area to ensure we will continue to have the same success we have enjoyed in recent years in attracting visitors to the island.</P>
        <P>Ireland is an attractive and scenic island.  Its landscape and built heritage attract visitors.  We have a strong literary and musical culture and a strong sense of our history.  All these factors have resulted in visitors being keen to come here and experience the culture.  Some Members have referred to the number of people who fly into this country.  Dublin Airport is considered one of the busiest in Europe and is an important hub.  However, we must consider the issue of rising energy prices and the fact that the low cost air travel that is available at present might not continue to be available in the foreseeable future.  The Green Party believes we must focus to a greater extent on the European and domestic markets.  When energy prices are high we must be realistic about how far visitors will be prepared to travel.</P>
        <P>Dublin city is and will continue to be a great magnet for tourists.  There is a very strong sense of heritage in the city.  Its built environment is important and our planning policies have increasingly protected that environment in recent years.  There are historic parts of the city but there are also new and emerging parts of the city that have more modern architecture.  This is happening in a way that allows the newer developments to sit comfortably beside the more historic parts of the built environment, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>We must consider how to make the city more attractive by looking at best practice elsewhere and seeking examples of best practice among the leading cities in the European Union.  Many prominent European cities have gone green.  Going green means embracing, in a wholehearted way, eco-tourism, which is a growing trend that is increasingly popular with consumers.  The city of Freiburg in Germany is a good example of a city that has promoted and developed eco-tourism.  We can learn from that city and a number of others in Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>What would greening Dublin mean?  For a start it would mean improved cyclist and pedestrian facilities.  That requires more cycle lanes and the new free bicycle scheme that is due to be introduced early next year.  We will know Dublin has truly arrived as a European city when it is as easy to cycle around the city as it is to drive.  Unfortunately, at present people are taking their lives in their hands in certain instances when they choose to cycle in the city.  That should not be the case.  We must make space on our roads for cyclists and encourage more people, both tourists and residents, to cycle in their daily lives.  Providing cycle lanes will be important in that regard.</P>
        <P>The free bicycle scheme will be an interesting experiment.  Other political parties have been critical and alleged that the bicycles will end up dumped in the Liffey and so forth.  We must trust that Irish people will recognise what a valuable convenience it will be to be able to pick up a free bicycle at one point in the city, cycle to another point and leave the bicycle there.  I believe that facility will be welcomed by many people, particularly late at night when they are trying to get home and are unable to get a taxi.  These are positive initiatives that must be <Col N="310"/>pursued.  In the budget this year the Government allocated &euro;5 million to the development of cycle lanes in Dublin.  That is a positive development.</P>
        <P>There also must be more high quality public spaces in Dublin city, particularly to host cultural events.  I commend the Festival of World Cultures, which has taken place for a number of years in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is a good example of how public spaces can be used to host cultural events which attract a growing following every year.  Dublin city has events such as the St. Patrick&rsquo;s day parade and other cultural events which are a core part of tourist activity in the city.  Improving public spaces in Dublin city is important.</P>
        <P>Traffic management and control are also important.  This is a contentious issue but everybody who lives in Dublin is aware that in recent years the city has become increasingly congested and often grinds almost to a halt.  We must recognise the impact this will have on tourism, whether it is tourist buses trying to get around the city or visitors trying to drive from one place to another.  We will have to bite the bullet and examine approaches to managing and controlling the volume of traffic in the city.</P>
        <P>We must also make Dublin more family friendly.  There must be more focus on local parks and playgrounds.  I visited New York recently and was struck that Manhattan, despite being a city with a high population density, has many urban parks that are available to families with young children.  In Dublin, we must give more thought to this issue.  The families who visit the city, in addition to the city&rsquo;s residents, would greatly appreciate the availability of local parks and playgrounds.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We should make the most of the River Liffey.  It is an important asset for the city.  We must develop the attractions that are made available on boats, barges and so forth.  We must also examine the development of local markets.  Again, there is great interest in food markets, particularly in other European cities.  Ireland has been always strong in local food production and we have seen the emergence of an increasing number of farmers&rsquo; markets in recent years.  These should be encouraged.  Alongside the markets there should be a system of allotments.  It is the allotments, which have now gone out of fashion, that encourage food production in urban areas.  The new name for allotments is &ldquo;community gardens&rdquo;, and they encourage communities to get involved in producing food in their local areas.  There can be a link between the community gardens and the local markets.  All of this is a tourist attraction as tourists are interested in seeing such activity.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Public transport must be improved.  It is important that the metro project that is planned to extend to Dublin Airport proceeds despite the economic circumstances.  We must also increase the number of buses on our roads and connect the two Luas lines.  These developments are most important.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the hinterland of Dublin.  We cannot forget the importance of providing recreational opportunities for tourists in the hinterland areas of Dublin, such as the Dublin Mountains, Bray Head and the Sugarloaf.  My colleagues in Bray Town Council have secured a special area order designation for both Bray Head and the Sugarloaf.  These are extremely positive developments as they will protect and preserve those areas for recreation and as amenity areas.  That will be particularly important for tourism in the future.</P>
      
        <P>We must make the most of the cultural options provided by the new non-Irish populations, especially in Dublin city.  New cultural quarters are emerging informally and they should be developed to prove Dublin is a truly multicultural city and to provide different cultural experiences for visitors.</P>

      <sTitle>Hospital Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Chathaoirligh, thank you for accepting my motion on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
        <P>Bantry General Hospital is very important to the region I represent.  It has a catchment area of about 65,000, and it may be the most peripheral outreach hospital in the country.  It is a fantastic hospital and is relatively modern, built around 1960.  A renowned surgeon ran it single handed for many years, who was a &ldquo;jack of all trades&rdquo; who could turn his hand to anything. <Col N="312"/> May God be good to Sean Baker, who died recently.  In many ways, the hospital is going from strength to strength.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the current consultant surgeon is due to retire soon and there are concerns that he may not be replaced, due to the remote location of the hospital.  If he is not replaced, it will have a huge effect on surgical procedures in Bantry.  I am lobbying hard to get him replaced.  I have been told by GPs and by other physicians in Bantry that without the consultant surgeon or a replacement, the anaesthetist will also have to go.  That would have a serious knock-on effect on the medical unit.</P>
        <P>Ironically, the Fitzgerald Report in 1968 called for outreach services in the area.  I have no problem with outreach services, which are essential.  An acute hospital review was carried out by the HSE, which was not published, and I am very fearful.  Emergency services must be maintained at the highest level.  I wrote to Professor Drumm requesting that he visit Bantry.  If somebody has an accident in Bere Island, Castletownbere or in any other part of the peninsula, he or she is almost two hours from Cork University Hospital across a difficult road network.</P>
        <P>There must be ways to reconfigure what is out there.  The hospital was visited by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health and Children and by the current Minister.  They were astounded at the modern surgical unit and equipment there.  It was state of the art in 1960, and the quality of the equipment is <i>par excellence</i>.  It is very important that this is maintained.  I cannot accept any diminution of services.  Many positive things have happened there.  A CT scanner was eventually installed there and extra beds were provided for the rehabilitation of patients such as those who suffer from strokes or who have had extensive surgery.  This hospital is vitally important for the people I represent.  We cannot allow a situation to arise where the consultant surgeon is not replaced.  That would mean the end of surgical procedures and would have an inevitable knock-on effect on the excellent medical unit, which would be a disaster.</P>
        <P>I know an individual much younger than me who was working at home during his child&rsquo;s mid-term break from school.  He complained to his wife about pains and he was rushed to Bantry General Hospital.  He got a massive heart attack as he was entering the hospital.  There is no way he would have made it alive to Cork in two hours.  His life was saved in Bantry, where the doctors stabilised his condition.  He was transferred to Cork in 48 hours and had successful open heart surgery.  He is now fighting fit and back at work.  This is just one example of hundreds that demonstrate the importance of maintaining this service.  I hope the Minister of State has good news for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children. </P>
        <P>I am pleased to confirm that the Minister is committed to ensuring the future viability of Bantry General Hospital as a health care facility.  The HSE is working in this context.  Beds in the hospital continue to be utilised on a clinical needs basis and a 24-hour emergency surgical service continues to be provided.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive commissioned Horwath Consultants, in association with Teamwork Management Services, to examine the arrangements in the HSE southern region for the provision of acute hospital services there with a view to identifying the best configuration for the future, including arrangements for accident and emergency, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, and diagnostic services.  The consultants&rsquo; review has been completed and represents an important input to decisions to be made by the HSE on how best to configure acute services in the southern region so that the population of Cork and Kerry can be assured of safe, effective and efficient care into the future.</P>
        <P>As for the surgical service at Bantry, the Minister for Health and Children understands that the present consultant surgeon is due to retire in 2009.  The Senator will appreciate that the <Col N="313"/>provision of acute hospital services, such as surgery, must occur within structures whereby doctors are members of clinical teams and also where they undertake a sufficient volume of work to ensure their skills are maintained.  These are among the considerations which the HSE must take into account in determining how best services in Bantry General Hospital should be delivered into the future.</P>
        <P>The Minister understands that the HSE&rsquo;s National Hospitals Office is considering this issue at present in the context of developing a framework for the future configuration of hospital services in the region generally.  The HSE has advised that among the features of the new configuration will be the development of outreach clinics in specialties such as dermatology and obstetrics and gynaecology so that the need for patients in the Bantry area to travel to Cork city for consultations will be reduced significantly.  The HSE has indicated it is engaged in a consultation and discussion process with a range of interests, including staff in the hospitals concerned, members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives, concerning the best configuration of services for the future.  I thank the Senator again for having raised this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise recommendation 1283 of 1996 by the Council of Europe concerning history and the learning of history in Europe.  I am sure some will wonder why I am raising this matter on the Adjournment.  As a member of the Council of Europe, I was tasked with writing a report on how we teach history in areas of recent conflict.  Many member states look to Ireland as an example of how to do it correctly.  My report, which is available on the web, indicates that while we are making changes, there is still a long way to go, North and South, in how we teach the subject of conflict.  As Mahatma Gandhi said, unless we start with the young, we will have the potential for conflict in the future.</P>
        <P>This Council of Europe recommendation, dating back to 1996, underscored the fact that people have a right to access their history whether they then embrace or reject it.  Politically, history can help or hinder Europe&rsquo;s future depending on the role it is given.  It was felt that students must be given an opportunity to examine critically both what they see and hear around them in the various media available and through school sources.  It would help them to understand the complexity of issues, appreciate diversity and recognise the distortions stereotypes can create.</P>
        <P>By continually using a variety of sources to develop a critical mind, we can assist in overcoming the temptations some politicians and others &mdash; especially in central and eastern Europe, but not necessarily devoid from ourselves &mdash; might have to manipulate the single static vision of history or the single truth.  Objectivity should be aspired to by all involved, whether in the classroom, written or visual media, lecture halls or elsewhere, to avoid religious and political bias.  It was felt at that time, and it still remains the same, although there have been some small changes, that there must be more to history than politics.  The role of women and minorities was to be recognised and there was a need for controversial, sensitive and tragic events to be balanced with more positive and inclusive topics that extended beyond national boundaries and spanned cultural, philosophical, economic and political movements.</P>
        <P>By opening up to other views of the same event by schools in other countries, it would facilitate important exchanges between students.  Approaches to learning must continue to expand on the technologies and forms of educational experience used with the more equal treatment of a varied approach and a recognition of out-of-school facilities and influences.  Support for teacher training was a central goal.</P>
        <P>I am interested to know where the Council for Cultural Co-operation now stands, given that it was to assist in teacher training and form interactive networks to enable them to maximise the crossover of innovative methods.  The same co-operation potential existed for historians <Col N="314"/>and teachers.  It is important historians should have some concept of the reality of the classroom and how to reach the target audience.</P>
        <P>Much work was done concerning international textbooks, which is supported by the George Urquhart Institute.  There was also a focus on trying to get teachers more involved in history teaching associations such as Euriclio.  There was to be a European charter that would protect teachers from political manipulation and a similar protection for historians was identified.</P>
        <P>Another important recommendation called on governments to provide adequate and ongoing finance for historical research, especially concerning bilateral and multilateral commissions on contemporary history.  The work on &ldquo;Across the Borders&rdquo; was to assist more tolerant attitudes as historical accounts would gain a breadth of experience.</P>
        <P>In that context, I recently spoke in an Adjournment debate about Ballykinlar internment camp in County Down.  I must declare a personal interest in this matter in that my grandfather spent 13 months as an internee there between 1920 and 1921.  I have called for the camp to be turned into an interpretative centre.  Avoiding our past creates the potential for more problems in future.  Earlier today, I spoke on Radio Ulster with DUP member, Jim Wells, who was upset that I had the audacity to interfere in the business of the United Kingdom and what was happening in County Down.  However, we must embrace and engage with our history.  As for the War of Independence, we have had an Irish solution to an Irish problem by avoiding it.  We should reach across and begin to investigate our own history.  Our primary sources for that era have gone and the secondary sources are beginning to reach the same stage.</P>
        <P>To embrace fully the Council of Europe&rsquo;s recommendation 1283 of 1996, we must work bilaterally on historical projects which eventually would begin to mend fences and break down barriers.  Until there is a political will to drive this forward, it will not work.  We have seen the results of the peace process in the North, but we must attain in the schoolroom an identification of who we are and where we come from as well as dealing with the image of the other in history teaching.  Seeing any event from more than one perspective is the only way we can ensure peace will reign in future.</P>
        <P>I trust that as well as having an answer to the issues I have raised, the Minister of State will take on board also the history teaching project to which I referred.  It would be an uncontroversial historical project undertaken on a cross-Border basis.  While I appreciate the difficulties everyone experiences when dealing with such sensitive issues, they must be dealt with.  Otherwise we will face the same problems as other countries that avoided dealing with their own histories in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science on this issue.  Recommendation 1283 of 1996 by the Council of Europe stresses the importance of history as a gateway to the experience and richness of the past and of other cultures.  It emphasises the potential of history either to contribute to greater understanding, tolerance and confidence or to become a force for division, violence and intolerance.  The recommendation urges that history in schools should show how historical knowledge is arrived at, use information from a wide variety of sources, develop critical thinking, optimise the use of information and communications technology, and be as balanced and objective as possible.</P>
        <P>The history of Europe, its main political and economic events, and philosophical and cultural movements should be included in syllabuses.  In addition, out-of-school links should be encouraged as well as links between history teachers and historians.  Independent national associations of history teachers should be established and linked with Euriclio, the European association.  The project &ldquo;The Image of the Other in History Teaching&rdquo; aims to promote intercultural dialogue and tolerance, openness to and respect for others, human rights and democracy and <Col N="315"/>an approach to the teaching of history that increasingly reflects the increasing cultural and religious diversity of European societies.  The project, due for completion in 2009, will produce guidelines on history teaching and recommend strategies and approaches for implementation.  It will create a supporting website and provide for networking of trainers and resource centres.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, a revised curriculum in history at primary level was introduced in 2006, prefaced by a comprehensive programme of professional development for teachers.  The curriculum is concerned with the knowledge and interpretations of the lives of people in the past and their influence on the present, as well as enabling children to experience how historians go about their work.  The programme is designed to promote awareness of the groups, individuals, events, cultures, beliefs and values which shaped the lives of people in Ireland, Europe and the wider world.  The skills of working as a historian form a fundamental pillar of the approach, developing an awareness of time and chronology, change and continuity, using evidence from a variety of sources, appreciating cause and effect, and developing empathy.  An important emphasis is placed on local studies, as well as appreciating a range of perspectives and realising that evidence can be interpreted in a number of different ways.  A wide range of strand units are available covering early, medieval and modern history in Ireland, Europe and the wider world.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, the emphasis on the development of historical investigation skills is continued in the junior cycle history curriculum.  Students learn how to locate and select historical information from a variety of primary and secondary sources and examine it critically, detecting gaps, inconsistencies and bias, again appreciating that evidence may be open to more than one interpretation.  At leaving certificate level, a revised history syllabus was introduced in 2004 and is assessed based on a written terminal examination and a report on a research study.  The research study allows students to select a topic of historical significance, locate and select primary and secondary sources, evaluate their relevance and prepare an extended essay setting out their planning and approach to the study, and their findings and conclusions.</P>
        <P>A documents-based study forms part of the written examination.  Students choose from a wide variety of topics, following either a programme on early modern Ireland and early modern Europe and the wider world, or later modern Ireland and later modern Europe and the wider world.  In either case, culture, religion and science, society and economy and politics and administration are the strands around which the curriculum is built.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, is satisfied that the emphasis on using evidence, critical evaluation and understanding issues from a range of perspectives, along with the emphasis on how culture and religion can influence our historical understanding, are in keeping with best practice in the teaching and learning of history.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published guidelines for teachers to accompany each syllabus and comprehensive curriculum support services are provided by the primary curriculum support programme and the second level support service.</P>
        <P>The History Teachers&rsquo; Association of Ireland is actively involved in keeping Irish teachers in contact with new developments in historical research and with international thinking in this area through affiliation with EUROCLIO and other international bodies.  The Scoilnet website provides more than 1,000 links to primary and secondary sources for history, tied in to topics in the curriculum.  This also includes &ldquo;Look at History through the RTE Archives&rdquo;, &ldquo;Discovering Women in Irish History&rdquo; and links to libraries and archives throughout the world.  There is also a guide for teachers in using the Internet as a teaching tool and exploring the Internet using authoritative sites for history.  <i>The Irish Times</i> digital archive, running from 1859 to date, are also made available free to schools.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Department of Education and Science published &ldquo;Looking at History&rdquo;, an evaluation of history in 50 post primary schools.  This shows that most teachers presented satisfactory evidence of subject planning, that membership of the History Teachers&rsquo; Association of Ireland has been a valuable resource and that teachers were positive about the impact of the <Col N="316"/>professional development supports provided to them.  The report shows a slow but certain growth in the use of ICT in history.  A wide variety of effective teaching and learning strategies were observed allowing for careful differentiation between varying ability ranges.  The evaluation shows significant and successful work was seen in making historical material relevant to students&rsquo; needs, and in making support material available.  A small number of schools had established links with schools abroad using video conference and e-mail facilities, and the establishment of an independent student history association was cited as an example of good practice.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is networked with curriculum and assessment agencies internationally and its work is built on research and continuing dialogue and engagement with a wide range of stakeholders.  The history curriculum has moved away considerably from the regurgitation of facts and events to one where the focus is on using evidence, detecting bias, critical reflection and evaluation, and the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, believes in keeping with best international practice.  The Minister will closely monitor the outcome from developments in regard to the Council of Europe project.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position on this matter to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree the senior cycle review of the curriculum has been well accepted by the teachers and everybody else?  There is a very strong sense that the junior certificate needs the same because the curriculum is far too heavily loaded for teachers to be able to implement the level of detail that needs to be covered.  In Gaelscoileanna, there is a difficulty in sourcing material as Gaeilge, which needs to be addressed.  In the current in-service training for leaving certificate, which has been extremely good, there is a concern that the history support service should remain operational.  If the Minister wants to hear the most up-to-date views on the history, they are contained in this report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter concerns the need for the Minister for Education and Science to recognise the necessity of core funding for the continuance of deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin.  The Minister of State will be aware that Trinity College, Dublin is the only college where deaf studies are taught in Ireland.  It has done a magnificent job in teaching deaf studies and Irish sign language.  The school is concerned there may be a curtailment in its funding during this year.  It is very important that we get a statement today reassuring us there is no intention on behalf of the Government to do anything of the sort.</P>
        <P>The Centre for Deaf Studies currently trains five to ten Irish sign language-English interpreters a year, which comes to a total of approximately 50 in the Republic of Ireland when 200 are needed.  Even the stark figures will demonstrate to the Minister of State the fact the centre is operating on a shoestring when I tell him &euro;440,000 a year is what it needs to continue.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, deaf people in Ireland are chronically unemployed.  They appear to be discriminated against in a way that minorities should not be.  It would be a great tragedy if the funding which the centre expected, has received in the past and hopes to achieve in the future is curtailed.  It would be another indication of the fact minorities are being victimised or, at the least, neglected in this budget, when minorities of this sort should not be touched.  If there are to be cutbacks, they should not affect deaf people, disabled people or minorities of any sort.</P>
        <P>Deaf people are four times more likely to be unemployed in recessionary times and, as the Minister will know, we are now in recessionary times.  If there are cutbacks in this area, that figure will increase.  This is a serious and inhumane situation which requires close attention <Col N="317"/>from the Minister.  Earlier this year, I believe in August, the Higher Education Authority ended core funding to higher education bodies.  Instead, it set up a strategic innovation vulnerable subjects fund, which I understand has a pot of only &euro;1 million, and if the two Trinity College applicants succeeded, on their own they would cause that figure to go over that limit.</P>
        <P>The Centre for Deaf Studies put in an application in September and it is extremely worried that it now has enough funding to last it only until the end of December.  It has not received a reply from the HEA and wonders about the reason for that when it only has sufficient money to last about another five weeks.</P>
        <P>In terms of its needs, the centre requires &euro;440,000 a year to keep it to its current levels; that is without any increase.  It does not occupy space within Trinity College Dublin, which puts it at a severe disadvantage for rent.  It spends &euro;100,000 a year on rent and non-pay costs, which are almost inevitable as it cannot find space within the university and therefore has more expenses than if it were on campus.  The pay costs take up the remainder of its budget.</P>
        <P>The core funding is essential but it is even more essential that it is not cut because the strategic innovation vulnerable subjects fund is matched against the core funding fund euro for euro.  Any reduction in the core funding by the Minister, therefore, would mean a reduction in the strategic innovation vulnerable subjects fund.</P>
        <P>I will give the Minister of State some examples of where deaf people will suffer.  It will mean cutbacks in the blended learning degree with the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, NUI Cork and Limerick Institute of Technology.  Although the Department has given the go-ahead for an M.Phil in deaf studies for teachers of the deaf, if there is no increase in core funding there will be no course.  It will mean a curtailment of its signal project, which will need to be cut back because the ability to pay external lecturers will be curtailed also.  It will mean a similar curtailment in the D-Signs project and the training of Irish Sign Language interpreters will cease.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue for a small minority of people &mdash; perhaps 5,000 &mdash; but it will affect 95,000 people.  There is about a 10:1 ratio in terms of people who are affected by one deaf person because of the necessity for them to learn sign language also.  I ask the Minister to assure us that there will be no cutbacks that will handicap the deaf further.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s position on the matter.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the Centre for Deaf Studies represents a constituent part of Trinity College Dublin.  The Universities Act 1997 confers autonomous statutory responsibility on universities in regard to the day-to-day management of their affairs and it is a matter for each university to manage their financial resources.</P>
        <P>Through the Higher Education Authority, the designated body responsible for the planning and development of higher education and research in Ireland, universities receive a recurrent block grant.  This year, the HEA provided Trinity College with specific funding of &euro;474,000 to provide for the centre, an increase of &euro;24,000 over the 2007 allocation for the centre.</P>
        <P>Trinity College has again made a request to the HEA for specific funding for the Centre for Deaf Studies for 2009.  That request is under consideration with the HEA.  The Minister for Education and Science does not have a role in that process.</P>
        <P>With regard to general recurrent funding allocated by the HEA, it is a matter for each institution to determine how it is applied and therefore Trinity College, as an autonomous body, may determine the use of funding and may allocate additional funding to the centre over and above that provided by the HEA if it so wishes.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, would like me to point out that significant investment has been made over the years in the higher education system.  Overall provision for the third level sector has increased from &euro;1.5 billion in 2004 to &euro;2 billion in 2008.</P>
        <P>The overall allocation for the sector in 2009 will be in the region of &euro;2.1 billion, which takes account of the general public sector reduction in the payroll which is applicable to all higher level institutions.  It will be a matter for the institutions to manage their resources in 2009 and, where necessary, to effect economies across all levels of activity, including increased collaboration between universities, and between the university and institute of technology sectors.</P>
        <P>In recent years, recurrent funding allocated specifically to the university sector has increased from &euro;631 million in 2004 to &euro;831 million in 2008.  That represents an increase of some 32% since 2004 and an increase of almost 120% on 1998 levels.  This excludes separately provided programmes of funding for capital, research and development and the strategic innovation fund.</P>
        <P>The multi-annual strategic innovation fund for higher education was introduced by the Government in 2006 with an allocation of &euro;510 million over the period of the national development plan.  The fund is intended to be a major catalyst in bringing about substantial change and quality improvement in our higher education institutions and promoting system-wide collaboration that draws on all institutions&rsquo; collective strengths.</P>
        <P>Projects approved under the fund are aimed at institutional reform, enhancing teaching and learning, improving access and life-long learning, and enabling the development of fourth level activity.</P>
        <P>I understand Trinity College was successful under the strategic innovation fund specifically for the Centre for Deaf Studies.  Trinity, as the lead institution, was awarded &euro;1.28 million multi-annual funding under the strategic innovation fund 2 for diploma courses which the university has developed to improve education and career opportunities for deaf students.  This collaborative proposal with the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, will make these diploma courses available nationwide via distance learning, implement a BA degree option, and research develop, implement and evaluate appropriate assistive technologies for the teaching of Irish Sign Language, ISL, and deaf studies via the Internet.  I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.</P>

	<P>In his reply the Minister of State stated, &ldquo;Trinity College has again made a request to the HEA for specific funding for the Centre for Deaf Studies for 2009.  That request is under consideration with the HEA.&rdquo;  How long will that take?  These people are working to a budget for 2009.  When can they expect to have some certainty in preparing for their courses and their overheads for 2009?  The least that could happen is that they would be told what they expect to get and whether their funding will be cut.  When will they know because it is now November?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask my Department to make some inquiries with the HEA and to bring the Senator&rsquo;s queries directly to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister do that as soon as possible please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.</P>
