	<P>I have received notice from Senator Michael McCarthy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to reinstate immediately the social welfare office in Dunmanway, County Cork, and to restore urgently the level of service provided at the office prior to its temporary closure in July 2007.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Alan Kelly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline if the Government is fully committed to providing the funding and work necessary to rehabilitate the Silvermines dumps, in particular the Gortmore area, which is deemed to pose a serious environmental and health hazard due to the exposure of elevated levels of lead and other toxic chemical residues.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline the financial resources he proposes to allocate from this year&rsquo;s budget to facilitate the installation and commissioning of high speed broadband networks in Dunmore East and Tramore, County Waterford.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline any efforts currently being made to pursue the provision of a cross-Border or Border business park in north east Donegal, given the ongoing interest in this concept in the north west for many years.</P><Col N="1510"/>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the length of time that capital funding will continue to be unavailable to Good Counsel College in New Ross, County Wexford, due to the ongoing discussions regarding school amalgamations in the New Ross area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to publish a complete list of all school projects in the building programme together with indicative times for completion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators McCarthy, Kelly and Coffey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senators Keaveney, John Paul Phelan and Doherty may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

	<P>Three reports into the misdiagnosis of breast cancer in the Midland Regional Hospital will be published today.  I was concerned when I heard this morning that the patients involved had not yet been contacted to be told that the reports were being published.  I hope that is rectified before the press conference today at which the results will be announced.  However, even if they are contacted today, it is still too late.  They should have been contacted before the story reached the media about the reports being published.</P>
        <P>These reports must not sit on shelves, but must inform future practice.  The confidence of women and their families in the breast cancer care services must be restored.  The critical issue is how we move forward.  There must also be <Col N="1511"/>accountability where we understand what went wrong and learn from it.</P>
        <P>It was very disturbing to read this morning about the cutbacks in the HSE.  We will need a discussion in this House about the hundreds of millions of euro in cutbacks which are apparently being planned.  It was also disturbing to hear that every vacant post on 31 December 2007 is now deemed to be a post that no longer exists, no matter what the reason for the vacancy on 31 December.  This has great implications for all kinds of services across the country.  I would like to know the up-to-date position on those cutbacks and the implications for services.  It is a cause of much concern to everyone in this House.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have been saying in the last few weeks that we need to discuss topical issues as they arise, unlike the pharmacy debate yesterday, when we had a discussion after the key decision had been made.  I request that the Leader make time available tomorrow for a debate on the reports to be published today, as this would give Senators an opportunity to read the documents.  It would also require a change in the Order of Business to reflect a decision to discuss what is current and important.  If it is not possible to make such a change, I ask that a debate be arranged for Tuesday next.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Reverend Ian Paisley announced his intention to resign from office in May.  While historians will judge Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s overall contribution, the issue that is uppermost in our minds today is that he said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the past year.  We have all been pleased to see work commence in the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland.  Recently, the Heath, Social Services and Public Safety Committee became the first committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly to visit the Oireachtas.  It had a successful meeting with the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which was wonderful.  In that regard, this is an appropriate time to have the debate on Northern Ireland requested by Senators Cummins, Quinn and Doherty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the points made concerning the reports due to be issued today on developments at Tullamore Hospital.  During the course of the discussion of the issues that gave rise to the reports, there was a rush to judgment regarding the role of an individual who, it appears, has been found not to have been responsible.  This serves as a good lesson about the ease with which a person&rsquo;s reputation can be publicly destroyed.  While I speak without having the facts before me, it is a matter of concern that a person who appears to have taken a professional, responsible approach to her work has endured a difficult time during which she became the focus of blame.  I will save further comment on the matter until a full debate takes place.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the reports for <Col N="1512"/>next week to ensure Senators have an opportunity to say what needs to said on the issue.  </P>
        <P>Last night&rsquo;s meeting between members of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party and the Minister for Education and Science has been widely reported.  I hope it went well.  Given the smiles on their faces this morning, Fianna F&aacute;il Senators appear to have been reassured, bought in or whatever is the appropriate term.  I ask that the House be given a report of the meeting outlining what new plans the Minister has in store.</P>

	<P>What secrets on autism and other issues must be related at a private meeting and kept from the rest of us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we no longer allowed to have meetings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the slightest problem with Fianna F&aacute;il Party members meeting Ministers.  The issue is whether new information is available of which we all need to be made aware.  I want to know what those attending the meeting were told about the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  Having discussed this issue several weeks ago, Senators are no wiser about when the legislation will be commenced.  </P>
        <P>On the current debate on autism and the ABA approach, while many parents believe ABA is a magic wand for addressing the requirements of their autistic children, this may not necessarily be the case.  A full debate is needed on the issue.</P>
        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act must be commenced as soon as possible.  Parents are involved immediately when a child&rsquo;s assessment takes place, the psychological report is drawn up and resources are planned.  They know from the beginning what their child may need.  Without being critical of parents, many of them have observed that ABA systems work perfectly for some children with autism.  However, they may not work for all children with the condition and it is possible that people are being misled in this debate because it has focused on ABA rather than autism and the wider issue of the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  As I have stated previously, until this legislation is commenced, parents and professionals will not know what are the real needs of children with special needs.  It is appalling that the legislation has not yet been implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that if the Minister for Education and Science has something she wishes to say or con<Col N="1513"/>cessions or variations in policy planned, she should make a public announcement in the House, rather than at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  I raised this issue a couple of weeks ago.  </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The chorus line on the Government benches has reduced this serious political and constitutional issue to one of jealousy.  Government Senators should understand that our system does not have a parliament within a parliament but a single Parliament.  They gave out on the previous occasion I raised this matter and asked whether Senators should be prevented from speaking to Ministers.  I have no problem with the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party holding meetings with any Minister.  The issue, however, is that on a matter of public concern, which has been debated in the House, including by Members opposite belonging to Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, Senators have an equal right to participate in debate and be informed as to whether policy changes are likely.  This should be done in public in Parliament rather than in some back room. </P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the retirement of the Reverend Ian Paisley, about much has been written and spoken in the past 12 hours or so.  It is appropriate that the House should congratulate Dr. Paisley on his retirement and note the incredible achievements in the North for which he and others have been responsible in recent years.  On a personal level, the House should wish him well in his retirement.  However, as we reflect on the past 30 years, it is ironic that those who now rule the roost in the North fought the longest and hardest, were at many junctures least open to compromise and, in some cases on both sides, were responsible for visiting the worst miseries on the people of the North and the rest of the country.  I am not complaining &mdash; history sometimes flows in this way &mdash; but we must understand the lesson of what has taken place here when we examine other conflicts around the world where the option of negotiating with those involved in different struggles is so quickly rejected.  This lesson from the past 30 years could be brought to bear when we analyse developments in other parts of the world. </P>
        <P>I support the call made by Senator Doherty yesterday for a debate on the North as we have not had such a debate since he and I were elected.  A debate is important because the issue has moved on and the fault lines in the North and politics generally have changed.  They are no longer about the old struggles but about social and economic issues, the development of the economy, North and South, the eradication of poverty, tackling disadvantage and taking action <Col N="1514"/>on taxation and public services.  I and many other Senators would like an opportunity to have a cross-party debate on our vision for the future of the country, North and South.  It would be the first such debate since the momentous changes in the North over the past year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the proposed publication of the referendum Bill on the Lisbon treaty tomorrow.  It is anticipated that the legislation will come before the House for adoption in the next two weeks.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to address the House while the debate on the Bill is taking place.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister on a number of issues, for instance, the information that will be provided to households about the treaty.  Several parties have pointed out that a copy of the treaty is not available to members of the public in an easily understandable and digestible format.  This is a concern.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach was questioned on the issue he noted that a very good annotated version of the treaty produced by the Institute of European Affairs is available.  This is not sufficient.   When the referendum commission is established it will have 90 days to perform its functions, one of which will be to provide information on the treaty.  It is important the information provided to households can be absorbed and digested.  The best information I have seen on the treaty in summary form is the booklet produced by the National Forum on Europe, which is neutral, comprehensive and easy to read.  I hope the referendum commission will provide similar information.  I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs be invited to address the House when we are discussing the referendum Bill in order that we can seek clarification on these issues.</P>
        <P>When will the House have a serious debate on the Lisbon treaty and matters arising therefrom?  A report this morning indicates that the gas supply to the European Union is threatened again because Ukraine has informed the Union that it may have to interfere with the supplies of gas.  The EU receives approximately 25% of its gas supplies from pipelines that come through Ukraine and because of the current debt dispute between Ukraine and Russia the EU&rsquo;s supplies may be interrupted.  That points to the need for the European Union to become much more self-sufficient in the area of energy.  The Lisbon treaty contains, for the first time, a measure to allow shared competence to exist between the EU and its member states in the area of energy.  Those are the issues we should debate fully in the House and I ask the Leader to clarify the opportunities that will be provided to the House in the critical months leading up to the referendum to allow it debate such issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the issue of men&rsquo;s health and mental health and I revisit it again today in light of the case in which <Col N="1515"/>Judge David Anderson criticised the Health Service Executive.  It is time we had a major debate on the functioning of the HSE.  Yesterday, Judge Anderson criticised the dysfunctional HSE after it failed to have a representative at his court.  We were promised action with A Vision for Change.  Mental health is an issue that concerns every one of us and if it does not, it should.  If the HSE can treat that young man, who is facing 27 charges and has no access to care or treatment, in that way, it will happen to other people in society.  We were given a promise with A Vision for Change but there has not been any action.</P>
        <P>I am led to believe there have been cutbacks regarding the implementation of A Vision for Change.  I ask the Leader for a debate on mental health and on the HSE because there does not appear to be any accountability.  On occasion the Cathaoirleach, as is his right, has ruled health matters out of order on the Adjournment because they are the responsibility of the HSE.  Who is it accountable to ultimately and when can we get answers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who was born in Derry at the end of November 1968, the retirement of Dr. Paisley is a momentous occasion.  The point was made earlier that the people who were the strongest in saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; have become the strongest in saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  At the recent Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis the wish was expressed by a number of delegates that Dr. Paisley would not retire in the near future, which is some change to have lived through.</P>
        <P>As I am writing a report on the way history should be taught in areas of recent conflict I agree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s sentiments that there is much to learn from what has happened.  It is difficult to explain what happened but we should consider that countries like Bosnia have a minister for education for Serbs, a minister for education for Croats and a minister for education for Muslims.  Imperfect as the situation may be in the Executive currently and challenging as it is to have one that crosses a number of divides, there are lessons that must be learned.  Whether people are involved in the problem, the solution or both, we must recognise that the situation in the North has moved on significantly.  I would like to think that the retirement of Dr. Paisley will not change that in any way.  If the reason given on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, that his wife did not want to see the grandchildren seeing what the children had gone through, was the only reason it happened, it is a good enough reason.</P>
        <P>The second issue I want to raise is related to the autism debate.  I fully endorse what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  It must go beyond ABA.  There is ABA PECS, the TEACCH programme and many other aspects.  In my own experience music therapy has brought speech to people with no speech and a reduction in repetitive behaviour in <Col N="1516"/>autistic children.  It has a role and therefore the issue about special needs is a wider one.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Leader and the Minister who came to the House less than a fortnight ago to discuss this issue.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was part of her contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not come in yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very much part of the solution and must be dealt with.  The implementation of the EPSEN Act was very much part of what she spoke about that day.</P>
        <P>In that context, I congratulate the Cork Institute of Technology.  Some of the money it is getting for research will go towards examining music as a therapy and teaching music as a subject as well as what other people would call the more important issues such as researching MRSA and technologies.  Will the Leader indicate if it is possible, in the context of a substantial amount of money being allocated to institutes of technology throughout the country, including Letterkenny, to get an update from the Minister on the way that money is channelled and how it links in to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the needs of the businesses as well as the graduates on the research side?  There is a great deal of work going on at third level and the co-ordination of all that is worthy of debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in congratulating Dr. Paisley on his retirement.  He was a frightening ogre in my childhood and youth but however slowly it came about he should take a bow today because he negotiated in the end and that must be noted, unlike the entrenched position taken by the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, with pharmacists.  Like me, many Members are concerned about the slow death we are now likely to see in rural Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business.  I want to hear questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may finish this point.  I call it a slow death because we are not about to see the visible closures of pharmacies but we are now seeing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with the outcome from the Minister, Deputy Harney.  Today, 500 pharmacists will gather for an unprecedented meeting.  They have been largely a peaceable people and they have put in place measures to ensure no patient is hurt today, unlike what was said in the House last night.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for the full and immediate implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  That will ensure there is an appeals process in place for parents of children with special educational needs and go towards helping them achieve their appropriate entitlement under our Constitution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I ask the Leader to intervene with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a special case with which the adoption board must engage immediately.  A young Galway couple from Connemara have adopted a baby in the United States.  They are living there currently but want to repatriate here and gain full citizenship rights for their adopted child, which is the right of any adopted child.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to reassure the couple that the Adoption Board will work to ensure the legal issues will be addressed and that it will be flexible in meeting that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the views expressed by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Keaveney regarding autism.  Discussions on autism and in particular education generally concern ABA.  I support the view that we should be talking about child centred and demand led services.  Will the Leader arrange for the schedule for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act by the Minister for Education and Science to be provided, which would be helpful for Members of the House?  I know with regard to autism many Members of the House will push other issues with other Ministers.  It would be beneficial to have the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.</P>
      
        <P>I support what has been said about the pharmaceutical supply chain.  It is regrettable that a number of community pharmacists, which do such good work, have closed and the services are not available.</P>

	<P>We all experience difficulties with regard to transportation in our areas, in particular around the capital city.  Will the Leader arrange an overview from the various agencies involved in the delivery of Transport 21, including the Dublin Transportation Authority, the Rail Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority, with regard to the required connectivity?  We need to know where we are with public transport, the integration of public transport links and other issues such as the outer orbital route.  This would be helpful.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I defy the Cathaoirleach to show me that in a book.  I will continue to state this because I believe in telling the truth.  The Reverend Ian Paisley undermined by accusing of <Col N="1519"/>treason not only Captain Terence O&rsquo;Neill for meeting Sean Lemass but also Brian Faulkner, James Chichester Clark and David Trimble.  What motivated him was ambition.  There was no repentance.  At least the provos expressed regret.  In my opinion he shamed his cloth by using the language of the Bible to divide and separate people and I am glad he is gone.  I hope better will come.  I have stated severe things about the provisional movement of the IRA but I believe fair is fair and I, at least, will tell the truth about this day.  I am glad that for whatever reason he managed to be an instrument at the end towards some degree of reconciliation but I do not think it was his motive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader consider No. 17, motion 36 on the Order Paper with regard to the M3 motorway and Tara?  This is in light of the fact that Dr. Jonathan Foyle, chairman of the World Monuments Fund, described driving the motorway through Tara as being comparable to the destruction of the Buddhas at Bamiyan by the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Our national poet, S&eacute;amus Heaney, stated the motorway &ldquo;literally desecrates an area &mdash; I mean the word means to &ldquo;desacralise&rdquo; and, for centuries, the Tara landscape and the Tara sites have been regarded as part of the sacred ground&rdquo;.  Will the Leader organise a debate on this before it is too late?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago, I raised the issue of catchment boundaries for school transport and I called for a debate on it.  The present system is in existence since the 1960s.  With the change in demographics we must have changes in how we respond to transport requirements to ferry our pupils to and from schools, especially in rural Ireland.  We have had large hikes in the cost of school transport recently with increases of up to 40%.  I do not know how many Senators are aware of this but any rural Senator certainly should be aware of it.  For those in junior cycle the term charge has gone from &euro;33 to &euro;46 and for those in senior cycle it has increased from &euro;51 to &euro;71.</P>
        <P>This issue must be debated because the Minister has increased these school transport charges without any due cognisance of the service she is delivering, its quality or even the times at which students are being delivered to their schools.  I am aware of some students in school an hour and a half before school starts and who are left there an hour and a half after it finishes.  It is a terrible indictment of our school transport system to have children between the ages of 12 and 17 with long days and inadequate school transport.  However, the Minister can hike up the price at the stroke of a pen.  This is not acceptable and she should be brought before the House to debate this important issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to rural services in general, and this is an extension of the school transport issue, a number of Senators called for a debate on <Col N="1520"/>balanced regional development.  I support this call.  It is in the programme for Government but I still have not seen any proposals come to this House for debate.  We certainly have a need to debate it and many would agree.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely mentioned the Dublin Transport Authority and connectivity in transport services.  I would like to see how the Government proposes to promote the better integration of transport throughout the country and not only around the vortex of Dublin city and the east coast in general.  We have a country with regions and the Government needs to realise this.  It is important we debate it.</P>

	<P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in welcoming the publication of the report into cancer care in the midlands, which is overdue.  I thought we had learned our lessons with regard to timelines for publication and giving those affected adequate time to study these reports prior to publication.  It is not right or proper that people are given hours to study them before they are published.  I hope this will change but, unfortunately, it has not changed yet.  People should be treated with dignity and given more time to study reports into issues which directly affect them.</P>
        <P>I remind the House of the outstanding report into the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case.  She is very concerned about its publication.  I understand the Health Information and Quality Authority has an issue from a legal perspective with regard to its publication.  I raised the fact that legal necessities must be dealt with and the report must be published so lessons can be learned.  I encourage that the fine line which exists in this regard be decided upon soon and that the report be published.</P>
        <P>Genuine concerns about changes in the economy are raised given the February results, particularly with regard to tax receipts.  We have known for a while that stamp duty receipts are down.  I do not want to scaremonger but we need to have a debate on this with the Minister for Finance.  A change has occurred in the economy with regard to corporation tax, VAT and capital gains tax receipts which have decreased considerably.  We are talking in the region of &euro;470 million.  Capital gains tax receipts have decreased by 34%.</P>
        <P>With the change in the economy we are seeing redundancies.  This House has debated the issue of lifelong learning.  We must examine the changing economic situation and how it will affect us socially.  I hate the word &ldquo;reskilling&rdquo;.  It is not an appropriate one for people who are already skilled.  We must examine how people&rsquo;s skills can be moved and diversified into new areas of industry so people are not left for long on dole queues.  This would be a good debate.  Comments such as those made by the Construction Industry Federation with regard to attacking employees&rsquo; pay and conditions are not helpful.  It is negative energy <Col N="1521"/>and we need to use positive energy to address this issue quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Many calls were made last week for a debate on anti-social and criminal behaviour following the tragic deaths in Dublin.  The vigil which took place over the weekend underscores the magnitude of the issue we face.  It is incumbent on us as legislators to recognise what is happening in our society and seek to do more about it.  I call for a debate on the related issue of school attendance rates.  One child out of every 20 has serious difficulty in regularly attending school while one in every five portrays frequent difficulty.  When I attend meetings on truancy with schools and garda&iacute; in the Dublin Central constituency, this is noted as the cause of much difficulty in the community.</P>
        <P>If young children, particularly young boys, drop out of school and facilities are not in place to get them back into the system, they are left open and prone to many outside and malign influences that lead to criminal difficulties later in life.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue?  We must also discuss how the National Educational Welfare Board is tackling the issue and how it is short of resources to ensure young people are supported to attend school regularly and open to positive influences.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on how images of explicit violence are being mainstreamed in society.  A current movie centres around people who are captured for torture.  Last week&rsquo;s review of the film in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated it was another film about torture.</P>
        <P>An advertisement for this movie on Dublin&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Connell Street has an image of a man, manacled, being tortured.  I call for a debate on the imagery young people&rsquo;s minds are being exposed to, particularly when advertisements and images far too regularly show men and especially women either being tortured or infer it.  When extreme violence is mainstreamed by our entertainment industry, unfortunately it creates an environment in which extreme torture and violence are seen as mainstream as opposed to things we should deplore.  If the Leader organises a debate on that issue, we would be able to contribute to it in a positive way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Kelly said he did not like the term &ldquo;reskilling&rdquo;.  I am convinced reskilling should be the essence of our education.  We talk about education as not being there to teach people things but to teach them how to learn.  We need lifelong learning and to be able to learn many new skills during our lifetime.  Leaving school, believing one does not have to learn again, belongs to the past.  We must be enthusiastic about reskilling and lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>I do not watch television very often but I did see the two recent programmes &ldquo;Dirty Money&rdquo;.  I was startled by what was happening with organised crime ten years ago.  What jolted me was that <Col N="1522"/>we as a nation could not agree on how to deal with the problem until the murder of Veronica Guerin.</P>
        <P>I believe we are in a similar crisis now.  Do we have to wait for another crisis to occur involving organised crime?  This is not just about organised crime.  We must question what we must do to tackle such events, including the recent killings of two young Polish men in Drimnagh.  I am sure all sides in society and both sides of the House are united on this issue.  However, in 1997 we were only jolted into tackling this problem together when Veronica Guerin was killed.  We must see this as a wake-up call so we do not wait until the crime situation gets even worse.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>In today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Vincent Browne has an article titled &ldquo;Gobbledegook and the case against Lisbon Treaty&rdquo;.  His argument is that the treaty is difficult to understand because the compendium version of the treaties, including the amendments, is not available.  His argument is ill-informed and quite ridiculous.  All the information is available.</P>
        <P>We have had referenda on the Singe European Act, and the Amsterdam, Maastricht and Nice treaties.  All have been amendments to previous treaties.  The core of Vincent Browne&rsquo;s criticism is that we are only voting on the amendments and not a complete treaty.  That, however, has been the position on all previous referenda on amendments of treaties.</P>
        <P>Information on the Lisbon treaty is available in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> and from the Institute of European Affairs.  A track-changes version of the treaties has been produced to allow readers to identify the line version which gives the amendments.</P>
        <P>I do not understand Vincent Browne&rsquo;s claim that the treaty is only understandable by lawyers as he is a lawyer himself.  He is an influential commentator.  To claim the treaty is incomprehensible when all information is available from the National Forum on Europe, the Institute of European Affairs or the Oireachtas is unacceptable and an absurd argument.  It is a refrain from quite a number of people in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; camp and is ill-informed.  It is important it is rebutted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the matter of the recent discovery of high levels of radon gas in a home in County Tipperary.  A sense of complacency may arise concerning radon gas levels due to the maps detailing projections of high radon gas levels.  The maps may lead to a false sense of security for many who think they are safe because there is a low level in their area.  Legislation governing the building industry requires that new homes built since 1998 must have a radon barrier, but this barrier is just a sheet of plastic.  Before a sub-floor is laid, the sheet may have a hole punctured in it to drain off water that may have accrued on it.  In this country, we are very likely to have water accruing.</P><Col N="1523"/>
        <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, should be mandated and given funding to conduct studies on the effectiveness of radon barriers.  Radon gas is a killer, with 200 deaths attributed to it every year.  The Seanad must debate this issue as people&rsquo;s health is at risk.  Radon barriers do not protect houses from rising levels of radon gas.  In some states in America, dwellings several storeys high have been shown to have excessive radon levels while a dwelling next door had what are termed &ldquo;effective levels&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is time for a debate on this matter and for the RPII to assess the dangers of radon gas levels to people in both new and old houses across the country.  We have much more knowledge on health needs and issues which must be examined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last Seanad on numerous occasions I called for a debate on men&rsquo;s health.  I support Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s call for such a debate.  Unfortunately, like it or not, men are not as proactive in looking after their own health as they should be.  When they do take action, it is often at the prompting of their wife, partner, sister, friend or aunt.  In the main, they do not take action of their own volition.</P>
        <P>It is important that we have an ongoing audit of practices among professionals in the health services.  In light of the disturbing reports in the UK of a male nurse who murdered four elderly patients and attempted to murder a fifth, it is important that cross-checks are carried out on preparations when medicine is being administered to people in care.  This is accepted practice, but often practices fall down for want of the required number of personnel.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing to read about people who, over the last number of years, produced falsified qualification certificates and found themselves practising as surgeons and other medical professionals.  Many of these have got away with it but, fortunately, some have been detected.  This is something of which we must be particularly observant.  In particular, those who are hiring such professionals must ensure they are what they say they are.  That they are not always so is a proven fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I too call for a debate on the Lisbon treaty.  It is important that we have a proper and timely debate on this issue.  Many people are concerned with the implications of the treaty, whether it is further movement towards common defence, the fact that more taxpayers&rsquo; money will be committed to the European Defence Agency and to increasing our military capabilities, or the undermining of workers&rsquo; rights such as we saw in Irish Ferries.  There are many other areas of concern, including the continued committal of taxpayers&rsquo; money to nuclear energy.  We need to have an informed debate on this.  I ask that we set the date to allow an informed debate nationally.</P><Col N="1524"/>
        <P>I also echo, in the presence of the Leader, the statement I made yesterday in his absence concerning the need for a debate on the Six Counties as a matter of urgency.  I mentioned yesterday that it was likely that Ian Paisley would leave office in the not-to-distant future.  The announcement of this has now occurred.  We now have a deadline within which the debate should be held.  As part of the debate I have asked that all parties in the House support the call I have made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to invite the Northern Ireland First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, to come to the Chamber and lead the debate to mark the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  I welcome the public support expressed yesterday by the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, in this regard, but I ask other parties to provide their support also.</P>
        <P>There has been a lot of talk about Ian Paisley&rsquo;s retirement in the Chamber today.  I too wish him well and I am conscious of the role he has played in the last number of years in bringing Unionism to its current position in terms of power-sharing.  However, I am also conscious that he has led a party that has denied civil rights to Nationalists and republicans in the Six Counties for many decades.  He has been part of the problem.  Many of those in his own party still remain opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.  There was mention of saying &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Sinn F&eacute;in is the largest party in support of the Good Friday Agreement and, while we say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to British occupation and the denial of civil rights, we support the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on the Irish language in our education system.  There is a piece in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> concerning the number of students opting out of Irish as a leaving certificate subject because of learning difficulties.  Of the 11,871 Irish-born pupils who received exemptions in 2006, 6,341 studied another modern European language.  The TUI is suggesting that these are what is described as &ldquo;designer difficulties&rdquo; whereby parents are able to pay for psychological assessments for their children to allow them to opt out of Irish, although they can study Latin, French and German.  There is a need for a full debate on the role of the Irish language within our education system and how best to teach it.  The Union of Secondary Students of Ireland and Conradh na Gaeilge have an interesting policy proposal which suggests that the literature element should be removed from the Irish language leaving certificate course and made into an alternative subject.  This should inform the debate.  It is urgent that we discuss this given that there are close to 12,000 Irish pupils &mdash; as well as those from other countries, who have amounted to 10,000 over the last two years &mdash; who are opting out of taking our national language at leaving certificate level.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Kelly called for an open debate on the activities of the HSE and in particular the three reports to be published over the next 24 hours.  I can agree to have this at an early date.  I will endeavour to check the Minister&rsquo;s diary to see what can be done to achieve this.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White, Norris, Doherty and Keaveney expressed their views on Dr. Ian Paisley and his announcement of his retirement.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he says, &ldquo;I can say with certainty that the leadership he has shown in recent years means that future generations of Irish people, North and South, will live in a peace and prosperity that previous generations could only dream of&rdquo;.  I wish him well in his retirement.  At the position in Irish history at which we find ourselves we can look forward to living in prosperity and peace.  This is what we have all hoped and worked hard for.  I have already discussed with the Taoiseach the possibility of a debate on Northern Ireland and he has agreed to attend the House on or near the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  He too played a major part in achieving the Good Friday Agreement on behalf of the Irish people.  The Taoiseach will be pleased to be here for a debate on Northern Ireland and in particular the tenth anniversary of the Agreement.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Healy Eames, Keaveney and Callely expressed their views on matters pertaining to the Minister for Education and Science, particularly with regard to the debate that took place here last night.  They also mentioned autism and the challenges facing those families with children with special needs.  I will pass on the views of Senators to the Minister.  I have no difficulty with having a wide-ranging debate on this issue after the Easter recess when facilitated by the Minister&rsquo;s diary and the leaders of the parties in the House.  I agree with the sentiments expressed.  On my first or second day as Leader of the new Seanad I stated that autism was one of my priorities, an urgent issue on which I would like to make progress with the help and assistance of all parties and Senators.  I said that we could make our mark with regard to input to the Minister and the Department.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca, Regan and Doherty called for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House for a debate on the Lisbon treaty.  As Senators know, the Bill relating to the treaty will be published tomorrow and the Minister will be attending the House in due course.  After progression of the Bill through the Houses we can assess the possibility of a debate.  As far as I am concerned we can have as many debates as Senators want.  Information is what this entire ref<Col N="1526"/>erendum is about, and it would be a terrible tragedy for any difficulty to arise because of misinformation.  I do not see any difficulty with discussing this on as many occasions as the House feels necessary.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and Glynn called for an urgent debate on mental health.  Areas of concern included the document A Vision for Change, the attention paid to this by the HSE and funding to be allocated to this area.  Senator Glynn mentioned an audit of care.  I have no difficulty in having time left aside for a debate on this.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney called for a debate on major investment over the past ten years in the institutes of technology which have been the great success story of our country, and requested that the Minister of Education and Science is present.  There is no difficulty in this taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames expressed various concerns and I will pass these on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  If the Senator wishes to have the matter as the subject of an Adjournment debate, the Cathaoirleach has indicated he will be very forthcoming in allowing time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for an update on Transport 21.  I have no difficulty leaving time aside for this too.  With regard to No. 17, motion 36 referred to by Senator Norris, I will examine this and come back to the Seanad tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey called for a debate on the challenges facing school transport and asked for the Minister to be present.  There is no problem having time left aside for this.</P>
        <P>The request for a debate on balanced regional development could be taken with the debate called for by Senator Alan Kelly.  He pointed out to the House that we should discuss the downturn in economy.  The figures for the first two months of this year show a shortfall of &euro;517 million in VAT, capital gains tax and other areas of revenue.  We must face this challenge.  It is a global issue.  The people must see how best they can work together to get over this problem and assist each other.  As I said previously on the Order of Business, the greatest challenge facing our country is competitiveness.  I intend to allow an all-day debate after Easter and during the first two weeks of our return on this issue and all matters pertaining to the economy, including the challenges facing us in the future.  I ask the spokespersons for finance of all parties in the House to note this.  The debate on balanced regional development requested by Senators Kelly and Coffey can take place as part of the wider debate on the economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for a debate on anti-social behaviour, highlighting the problems many school boards of management have with absenteeism.  The Senator gave a figure of one in 20 students having difficulty attending school.  I have no difficulty holding a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I agree with the points the Senator made about mainstream violence and the possible effects of <Col N="1527"/>quad advertisements and other advertising for films in cinemas.  The Senator referred to posters containing violent scenes.  I do not think it healthy that this is happening in our country.  The Irish Film Censor&rsquo;s Office has a duty in this regard.  As someone very closely associated with the film industry in the early years of my career, this type of advertising did not exist years ago.  We used to see the wonderful quad advertisements of &ldquo;Gone with the Wind&rdquo; and other such beautiful family posters.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Passports Bill 2007:" RHead="Second Stage"> 
    <Title>Passports Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach. </P>
        <P>The purpose of the Passports Bill is to provide a comprehensive legislative basis for the regulation and issuance of passports. Passports are currently, and have been for more than 80 years, issued under the general administrative provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  These passports are perfectly valid and the introduction of the Bill does not in any way suggest there are doubts in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is now 30 years since the courts established in 1978 the unenumerated constitutional right to travel and by implication the right to hold a passport.  It is time that we reflected the constitutional position in legislation.  The Passports Bill seeks to do that and for the first time sets out a statutory right for a citizen to a passport.</P>
        <P>The judgment in the &lsquo;M&rsquo; case clarified that the right to travel was not an unlimited constitutional right.  While refusals to issue a passport to a citizen are very rare, the Bill clarifies the circumstances in which this may occur.  I will return to this issue later.</P>
        <P>The Ireland of 2008 is very different from the Ireland of 1924.  Over the years, various administrative practices have been developed in connection with the passport application process, reflecting the changes in wider Irish society.  The Bill therefore addresses matters such as the consent of parents who are living apart and makes provision for the issuance of passports to persons who are undergoing or have undergone changes of gender.  It sets out detailed provisions for issuing passports in accordance with the applicant&rsquo;s name on his or her birth certificate, whether in Irish or English, and it deals with the recognition of changes of names whether after marriage or through established usage.  By placing these practices on a specific statutory footing, the Bill will promote greater legal certainty and clarity for the public.</P>
        <P>In including these provisions in the Bill, the Minister is not seeking to develop social policy, which is the responsibility of relevant Ministers.  However, there is an obligation on the Minister <Col N="1529"/>and the Department to provide the appropriate arrangements to permit Irish citizens to travel abroad freely and with dignity.</P>
        <P>At all times, and particularly in times of heightened security, we must be also cognisant of the need to protect the rights of the individual.  With this in mind, the Minister formally referred the draft Bill to the Irish Human Rights Commission under section 8(b)of the Human Rights Commission Act of 2000.  This was the first formal referral of a draft Bill to the commission by a Minister other than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I am grateful to the commission for its support and helpful views.  Consultations on the Bill were also held with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and I greatly appreciate the commissioner&rsquo;s input.</P>
        <P>The passport system has undergone a major overhaul in terms of technology and quality of service delivery.  Huge growth in demand arising from the increase in travel, advances in technology and changes in security requirements after 11 September 2001 have necessitated this reform.  Major innovations have included the introduction of machine readable passports, the establishment of an automated production facility and, most recently, the introduction in 2006 of e-passports.  Arising from these improvements, the Irish passport is widely seen as a high quality and very secure document.  Enactment of the Passports Bill will complement this technological reform by putting in place a clear and comprehensive framework for decisions made by the Minister, and on his or her behalf by the Passport Office.</P>
        <P>Whereas improvements in technology mean that we now have a much more secure passport, the increased security of the document must be matched by strengthening measures to tackle fraudulent applications.  Organised criminals have developed increasingly sophisticated methods to carry out their activities.  Moreover, crime does not respect borders and greater freedom of movement, especially within the expanded European Union, means that every member state has a responsibility to strengthen efforts to detect and prevent misuse of national travel and identity documents.</P>
        <P>The Bill tackles fraud in two ways.  First, it clarifies that before issuing a passport the Minister must be satisfied as to an applicant&rsquo;s identity and citizenship.  This permits the Minister to require applicants to produce adequate evidence of identity and entitlement to an Irish passport.  The normal level of evidence for most applications involves the submission of certificates of birth or a previous passport, and the witnessing of identity by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, in cases of doubt, the Minister will now have a legislative basis for requiring the submission of additional documentation or, if necessary, for requiring an applicant to attend for interview.</P>
        <P>Second, the Bill strengthens efforts to combat fraud by providing for a series of offences and penalties relating to fraudulent applications for <Col N="1530"/>and misuse of passports.  It will also enable prosecution of such offences even where committed outside the State.  This section was drafted in close co-operation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There was a positive reaction in the D&aacute;il to the Bill and a constructive approach was taken by all parties.  Several amendments were accepted and the Bill passed by the D&aacute;il, and which will now be considered by this House, represents an improvement on the draft published last April.</P>
        <P>I will now explain in brief the provisions of the Bill and I will focus in particular on issues which were the subject of discussion in the D&aacute;il.  Sections 1 to 5<b> </b>under Part 1 are standard provisions relating respectively to the Short Title and commencement date, definitions, service of notices, provision to make regulations under the legislation and expenses incurred in the administration of the legislation.  Section 3 on service of notices was added to the Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  This new section drew together provisions which previously had been repeated at a number of points in the Bill.  It deals with the manner in which decisions and information are conveyed to passport applicants and holders.<b>  </b>Section 6 provides for the right of an Irish citizen to apply for a passport and outlines the application process.  Subsections (3) and (4) address issues which may arise in connection with applications in respect of children and persons with a physical or mental incapacity.  More detailed provisions regarding consent of parents and-or guardians of children are set out in section 14, to which I shall return later.</P>
        <P>Section 7<b> </b>provides that the Minister must be satisfied as to an applicant&rsquo;s citizenship and identity before issuing a passport.  Citizenship may be acquired in various ways: most commonly through birth; by descent through an Irish-born parent or grandparent; or through naturalisation.  In some circumstances involving persons born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, it is also necessary for a parent to establish minimum periods of lawful residence in the State.  This is a complex area and the nature of the documentation required in passport applications will vary depending on individual circumstances.</P>
        <P>Section 8<b> </b>provides for the processing of personal data, including biometric data, in connection with passport applications.  Biometric technology makes use of the unique physiological features we all have.  The inclusion of high quality photographs in the Irish passport permits the generation of facial measurements and will, over time, reduce substantially the scope for fraud.  It also permits comparison of photographs at border control points to ensure that the person travelling is the real owner of the passport.  The Passport Office currently has the facility to compare electronically an applicant&rsquo;s previous and current photographs.  In time, this technology will offer scope to simplify the process for persons seeking to renew their passports.  It may reduce <Col N="1531"/>the need for submission of certificates and for authentication of identity at the time of renewal, while at the same time ensuring a more secure system.  The Passport Office is also seeking to upgrade this technology to enhance its capacity to detect and prevent multiple applications by individuals using different names and identities.</P>
        <P>There are currently no plans to include a second biometric identifier such as fingerprints or iris patterns on Irish passports.  However, it is possible that this may become standard international practice at some point in the future and it cannot be ruled out.  Accordingly, subsection (2) makes provision for the possibility of contractual arrangements with a third party to collect this information from applicants at authorised centres around the country or at locations abroad.  We have consulted closely with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding relevant provisions in the Bill, including section 8.</P>
        <P>Section 9<b> </b>deals with periods of validity of passports.  Most passports are valid for ten years but passports for children are valid for periods of three or five years depending on the age of the child.  These shorter periods of validity are necessary because a child&rsquo;s appearance will change substantially over time.  Emergency passports may be issued in circumstances where an applicant is required to travel at short notice but there is not enough time to enable production of a full passport.  Such passports are valid for one year and are accepted internationally, including under the visa waiver scheme for the USA.  The period of validity for diplomatic or official passports also varies depending, for example, on the likely duration of an officer&rsquo;s assignment to an embassy or consulate overseas.  Section 9(2) would also enable passports to be issued for reduced periods of validity in other circumstances, for example, in the case of an applicant who has a history of persistent passport loss.</P>
        <P>Section 10<b> </b>sets out provisions regarding the name in which a passport is issued.  Again, this is designed to reflect and underpin existing passport practice.  A strict approach is required regarding changes of name to safeguard the integrity of our passport internationally.  The general rule is that a passport is issued in the name of an applicant as it appears in his or her birth certificate, whether this is in Irish or English.  Where citizenship is acquired other than by birth, for example, through naturalisation, the reference point is the name on the relevant supporting documentation.  The section also provides for a change of name after marriage.  It also permits a change of name where an applicant produces satisfactory evidence to show that he or she has used that name for a minimum of two years.</P>
        <P>Section 11<b> </b>deals with gender re-assignment and outlines the circumstances where a person who is undergoing treatment or procedures to alter his or her gender, may be issued with a passport in a new gender and/or new name.  Supporting evi<Col N="1532"/>dence must be provided, including medical evidence from a registered medical practitioner.  This provision is intended to underpin existing practice of the Passport Office.  I mentioned earlier the formal referral of the Bill to the Irish Human Rights Commission, and the commission welcomed in particular the inclusion of this provision.</P>
        <P>Section 12<b> </b>outlines the circumstances where a passport shall not be issued, as well as situations where the Minister has discretion in this regard.  I referred earlier to the constitutional right to travel and to hold a passport, and to the way in which the Bill reflects the approach of the courts in so far as it has been held that this right is not unlimited.  Section 12 sets out the grounds on which a passport shall be refused.  Let me again reiterate that passports are very rarely refused to Irish citizens.  There was broad agreement in the D&aacute;il that it was appropriate to provide for an obligation to refuse on the basis that a person has not established his or her identity or citizenship.  Similarly, no difficulty was raised with regard to court orders concerning persons subject to bail orders, to cases where false information is provided or in cases where difficulties arise with parental consent.</P>
        <P>Queries were raised in the D&aacute;il as to the provision for refusal on the basis of the common good.  The inclusion of this provision is intended to provide discretion for exceptional cases.  It is also included in recognition of the fact that the common good was explicitly cited by the courts in the M case as a limitation on the right to travel and hold a passport.  Furthermore, the power to refuse a passport on the basis of the common good is itself subject to a number of restrictions.  The Minister is obliged by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to perform his functions in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and its protocols.  This means that were the Minister to refuse a passport for the common good or on other grounds, that restriction must in each case be proportionate and necessary in a democratic society.  In addition, any refusal to issue a passport to a citizen, including a refusal on the basis of the common good, may be the subject of independent appeal and is also subject to judicial review.</P>
        <P>Section 13 deals with the inclusion in a passport of information including biometric data, an issue about which I spoke already in connection with section 8.  Section 14 deals with the issuing of passports for children.  In line with passport practice and existing family law, section 14 gives precedence to the welfare of the child and at the same time safeguards the rights of guardians to take decisions regarding the child&rsquo;s welfare.  The overriding requirement is that consent of all guardians must be obtained before a passport can be issued.  Where consent is withheld, a passport cannot issue unless the other guardian obtains a <Col N="1533"/>court order dispensing with the need for that consent.</P>
        <P>In respect of non-guardian parents, the Minister is obliged to take into account all circumstances, in so far as known to him or her, before issuing a passport without the consent of a non-guardian parent.  At the same time, it is important to provide for cases where there may be difficulties in obtaining court orders, such as in cases where a child is resident outside the State with a parent or guardian.  Subsection (5) therefore provides that in such cases, having regard to all the circumstances, including whether an objection has been made by the other parent or guardian, the Minister may issue a passport where he or she is satisfied that this is required to secure the child&rsquo;s welfare.</P>
        <P>Further exceptional circumstances are provided for in subsection (6).  This provides that a passport may be issued without the consent of one or more guardians of a child where there is an immediate and serious risk of harm to the child&rsquo;s life, health or safety which requires the child to travel.  Finally, subsection (8) provides that the Minister may regard consent once given in writing as remaining in effect unless subsequently revoked by a guardian.  The intention behind this provision is to reflect the changing structure of the family where many parents work away from home.  Guardians in such situations frequently find it difficult to understand, when they have previously indicated consent to the issuing of a passport, why they have to give consent a second, third, or even fourth time in respect of the same child.  Permitting some discretion under this provision will ease the burden on such families when they apply for passports for children.</P>
        <P>Section 15<b> </b>concerns the issuing of emergency travel documents.  Emergency passports are usually valid for one year and may be issued in urgent cases where there is insufficient time to arrange the issue of a normal passport.  Emergency travel certificates may be issued in cases where travel is urgent but where an applicant is unable to produce documentation to prove beyond doubt his or her entitlement to a passport.  The certificate is valid only for a single journey and most such cases relate to an individual travelling abroad whose passport has been lost or stolen and who wishes to return to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Section 16<b> </b>provides for the issuing of diplomatic and official passports.  Diplomatic passports are issued to officers of diplomatic rank or to persons or groups of persons designated by the Minister.  The majority of diplomatic passports are issued to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to their spouses or dependents when accompanying the officer on a foreign posting, and to members of the Oireachtas.  Official passports are issued to Irish public servants who travel abroad on State business, with the principal group in this category being Irish soldiers serving abroad with the United Nations.</P><Col N="1534"/>
        <P>Section 17 requires a person who believes that his or her passport has been lost or stolen to notify the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister may inquire into the circumstances of a case and may require the provision of such information as is considered necessary.</P>
        <P>Section 18<b> </b>permits the Minister to cancel a passport in certain circumstances and provides for the surrender of a cancelled passport.  Reasons for cancellation must be provided and a decision to cancel a passport may be appealed to the passport appeals officer.  In response to comments made on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, I indicated that it was always my intention to establish an independent appeals mechanism and that I would do so by Government amendment on Committee Stage.  There was a broad welcome for this amendment which is now incorporated into the Bill in section 19.</P>
        <P>Section 19 provides that a person who is refused a passport or whose passport is to be cancelled will have a right of appeal to an independent passport appeals officer.  Before making an appeal, an appellant will have been provided with a statement of reasons for a refusal or cancellation.  He or she can then make a case to the passport appeals officer why the decision should be overturned.  The appeals officer may confirm a decision or recommend that it be set aside, and he or she shall provide reasons for this determination.  Where the Minister does not accept a recommendation, he or she shall inform the appeals officer and the appellant of the reasons for not doing so.  While judicial review proceedings remain an option for a disappointed passport applicant, this appeals procedure provides a speedy and inexpensive additional means for a person to challenge a decision of the Minister to refuse or cancel a passport.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill provides for a range of passport specific offences.  These are set out in section 20<b> </b>and include the making of false applications, possession of a false passport and sale or attempted sale of a passport.  Section 20 was amended on Report Stage in the Dail to ensure no loophole was left concerning the misuse of an expired passport.  The maximum penalties range from five to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment and-or a substantial fine.  Section 20(2) provides for a minor offence which covers situations involving the use of another person&rsquo;s passport to gain admission to a pub or club.  The maximum penalty for this offence is a fine of &euro;500.</P>
        <P>Sections 21 to 25, inclusive, set out related provisions on definitions, summary trial in the District Court, proceedings outside the State, liability of bodies corporate and an amendment to the Bail Act 1997.  Section 26<b> </b>provides that a passport will remain the property of the Minister at all times.  This reflects the long-established practice to print a statement to this effect on all Irish passports.</P>
        <P>Section 27<b> </b>is a standard provision which provides for continued validity of passports issued <Col N="1535"/>before the commencement of the Act, while section 28<b> </b>is a standard provision authorising the levying of fees for passports and other consular services.</P>
        <P>That completes my detailed statement on the purpose and main provisions of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, to the House.  This is a simple and necessary Bill.  It is surprising we have had to wait so long to debate a Bill which explicitly covers the means by which people obtain passports in this country.</P>
        <P>Passports have been a controversial subject in the past.  We all remember the passports for sale controversy where it was alleged that some people effectively were able to buy Irish passports in return for investing in Ireland.  At a time of high unemployment and business failures, such investments were welcome but the process discredited the point of holding an Irish passport.  A passport is a crucial identity document which allows a person, when travelling, to use the good name of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Passports carry a symbolism and a power.  Media reports have referred to people from other countries who have sought to use Irish passports because of the good name of Ireland abroad.  That was especially true in trouble spots throughout the world.  To have an Irish passport and be seen as Irish earned a person a warmer, and sometimes safer, welcome.  Ireland, unlike the United Kingdom, the United States of America and many of our European neighbours, is seen has having no past as a coloniser.  At present, Ireland is not viewed as a country which is intervening in trouble spots for its own benefit.  A passport in many ways symbolised our neutrality and our good reputation.</P>
        <P>The growth in the number of Irish passports being issued is indicative of the rapid increase in international travel and the growth of Ireland as an economic power.  Eight years ago, 388,000 passports were issued.  By 2003, three years later, that figure had increased by 80,000 to 468,000.  Last year, more than 630,000 Irish passports were issued.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>With new travel has come new dangers as well as new possibilities.  The reality of worldwide terrorism necessitates greater security associated with passports, something now possible with new technology, as the Minister of State mentioned.  We have seen the introduction of machine readable passports and in 2006 the introduction of biometric passports, not that many of us know what such terms mean.  I suspect that many of us have yet to get our heads around iPods and MP3 players, so we will leave this technology to the experts and hope they know what they are doing.</P><Col N="1536"/>
        <P>What surprised me was that Ireland, 80 years after independence, had no formal passport Act.  Instead general administrative rules and procedures were laid down in the likes of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  <i>Ad hoc</i> procedures and practices evolved.</P>
        <P>Mentioning the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 reminds me of the historic importance of passports in achieving our independence.  When Ireland became a dominion, it was presumed by Britain that all dominions were, in effect, extensions of Britain.  Britain did not imagine that its dominions would issue passports, appoint ambassadors, receive ambassadors or do any of the things independent states do.  The Irish Free State, however, ignored British worries and decided that it was going to issue Irish passports.  Downing Street was furious and the dominions office was shocked but WT Cosgrave and his Minister for External Affairs went ahead, making Irish people the first people in the Commonwealth outside Britain to have their own passports.  They then went further by appointing ambassadors and having the Governor General, on behalf of the King, accept credentials to Ireland from ambassadors for foreign countries.  In issuing passports, that Cumann na nGaedhael Government was telling the world Ireland was independent and not part of Britain.</P>
        <P>When we carry a passport, we do not just carry a little wallet with our details.  We carry a symbol of our fight for independence.  It may have the words &ldquo;European Community&rdquo; written on it now, which I presume will change to &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; if the Lisbon reform treaty is passed, but by having the harp and the words &ldquo;&Eacute;ire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; on it, that document symbolises the fact that we fought and achieved independence.</P>
        <P>This Bill also includes provisions to deal with the position of children when parents are separated or divorced and with the issue of people whose names change, whether through marriage, divorce or gender realignment surgery.  The latter inclusion will help solve some of the problems that arose in the case of Dr. Lydia Foy.  Dr. Foy&rsquo;s inability in law to change her birth certificate meant she could not change her passport, causing her considerable problems.  The issue of her name on her birth certificate eventually led to a court case and the landmark ruling from Mr. Justice Liam McKechnie in October last year.</P>
        <P>While there is a constitutional right to travel, that right is not unqualified.  This Bill, along with various court judgments, deals with that issue.  Of course, we also face another more sinister problem in those who use Irish passports to facilitate criminal activity.  Criminal activity using an Irish passport besmirches the name and reputation of Ireland and fraudulent use of an Irish passport must be dealt with severely.  Any misuse of an Irish passport is unacceptable and I echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy Billy Timmins, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann during the debate there on this Bill: &ldquo;It is disturbing to think that the Colombia three <Col N="1537"/>have never been charged for an offence relating to the misuse of passports.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am disappointed, as is my party, at the decision of the Government to exercise an opt-out from the justice and home affairs section of the Lisbon reform treaty and I hope this does not limit our ability to deal with criminality that may involve the use of our passports.  This is a major concern that I ask the Minister of State to consider.</P>
        <P>I also question the decision to move the Dublin Passport Office to Balbriggan.  Decentralisation is all very well if there is no need for the public physically to visit an office.  We all know the Government has created alternative ways to get a passport and it is not always necessary to visit the office but in the real world not everyone will use the new systems.  There will always be people who go to the public office and it is ludicrous to move it to a location that is difficult for most people to get to.  It should be at a central location where, if people choose to go to it, as is their right, they can get there easily.  It makes no sense to relocate the office to an inaccessible location and I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this decision.</P>
        <P>It is common practice throughout the country to make copies of passports to gain entrance to night clubs and such establishments.  Some people are required to produce a passport to enter such places but it is dangerous to ask people to carry their passports around with them.  There is now a market for identification cards and copies of passports and this matter, which I raised previously in the House, should be examined.  The misuse of passports is a serious subject.</P>
        <P>On balance I believe this is long-needed legislation.  It may be technical in cleaning up and clearing the system by which our passports operate, but a passport is a very important document in practice and in its symbolism and we must ensure it is not abused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his position.  This Bill is simple but is necessary because it will put in place new procedures in the administration of passports.  I have analysed the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech on this Bill.  It is quite detailed and says we have a right to travel so we have a right to apply for a passport.  The passport is a badge of our identity and citizenship.  The Bill refers to a minimum period of residence, the new concept of biometric data, the quality of photographs required, the validity of passports, procedures for obtaining a passport in an emergency situation, changing the name on one&rsquo;s passport after marriage or gender realignment, for example, the grounds on which a passport may be refused in the area of common good and so on.</P>
        <P>Regarding changes in issuing passports for children, the practice of having a child&rsquo;s name included on a parent&rsquo;s passport is discontinued.  The Bill also referred to the changing structures <Col N="1538"/>of families and I am running through its provisions to illustrate the details of this proposed legislation and how much work has gone into every aspect of it.  The Bill also covers lost and stolen passports and the penalties involved when a passport is cancelled.  It also goes into the new appeals system that may be used if a passport is refused.</P>
        <P>The Bill is detailed and necessarily reflects societal changes because we live in different times and the system for processing passports had to be modernised and reformed.  There has been a rapid growth in international travel and a consequent increase in demand for passports.  There have been huge advances in technology and we have had to deal with changes in international security requirements.  We have machine readable passports and now we have the introduction of the biometric passports.  These have been designed as extra safeguards to make it easy for the Irish citizen to travel abroad freely and with dignity.  Therefore, it is necessary to modernise the passport system.</P>
        <P>The Bill will bring about an improvement in the quality of service.  Usually the issue of a passport takes ten working days.  In the event of an emergency it can be provided within a much shorter timeframe and, perhaps, on a same day service, at an extra charge.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes a provision that addresses the consent of parents who are living apart when dealing with the welfare of the children.  Given the changes in society, children&rsquo;s names are no longer on a parent&rsquo;s passport.  Where parents are living abroad and consent is withheld creates cumbersome difficulties.  I am not sure the public understands how that provision will work.  If they refuse it and are living in another country, a court order must be secured.  It should be made clear the way in which this will ultimately be handled.  If I was explaining the issue I would have some difficulty getting it into my own head.  I ask the Minister of State to look at it again and how it is explained in the Passport Office.</P>
        <P>We have to be sure that the children&rsquo;s welfare is protected at all times.  In recent years we have had to deal with the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 disaster and hence the need for increasing emphasis on improving the identity of passports.  I welcome the introduction of the biometric system.  We have also had the Columbia Three incident, following which it is clearly necessary that specific legislation be introduced to cover these type of offences.  The Bill also includes the offence and penalties for fraudulent applications for misuse and abuse of passports for human trafficking, crime and so on.  I am glad to note that a special mechanism is in place to detect that misuse or abuse.  Given the expanded EU, we all have greater freedom of travel, therefore, it is even more necessary today that the integrity of the document is protected.</P>
        <P>In regard to biometric technology I understand that the processing of the application will deal <Col N="1539"/>with personal data and photographs.  I am pleased the Minister of State said that the information will only be used for passport purposes and will not be shared with other agencies.  I always worry when I read that the lines on one&rsquo;s face can be measured from photographs and that it will be known from previous photographs whether the photograph is of the individual, a makeshift of the individual or whatever.  While I welcome it for the passport system I would not like it if my photograph was lamp-posted throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Except at election time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a cause for concern but the Minister of State&rsquo;s assurance that there would be no breach beyond the Passport Office is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State gave the reasons when passports will be refused, such as, false applications, the position of false passports, use of cancelled passports and so on.  I am pleased a unit has been established within the Passport Office with trained staff who will be able to scrutinise the applications.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the matter of lost and stolen passports.  When that happens one is required to notify the Minister and the Garda.  To give a small example, I was standing in a queue at the airport a year ago when the person in front of me was asked to present his or her tickets and passport, only to discover he or she did not have a passport.  The queue was held up in a natural way but it meant there was panic.  All the person could be told was to contact the Garda or the Minister.  This was in the middle of a queue at 9 a.m.  It is important to have an official or sub-office at airports, throughout the country to handle such situations.  It could be a panic situation.  One could have been getting one&rsquo;s children ready to go on holidays and left the passport on the table.  In that case the family cannot travel.  That is what happened on that day to the family in question because the passports were not available.  Rightly, the family had to be refused permission to travel.</P>
        <P>With all the advances in technology, such as the biometric system, I would like to think there was some mechanism in place whereby it would be possible to put up on screen the person&rsquo;s details, following which a temporary passport could be issued to allow the person travel.  I ask the Minister of State to look again at that issue.  It is not fair to the genuine people.  I appreciate we have to be extra careful and stringent in regard to analysing the passport application and so on but these are genuine examples and there should be some facilities within our airports to handle such situations.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the main Passport Office was being transferred to Balbriggan.  I ask that we have a passport office in all the major <Col N="1540"/>cities to make it easy for people to make application.  Given the advances in application procedures which the Bill has outlined it would be quite simple to have offices throughout the country.  People should not have to make application through the post.  There may be problems and it would be nice if they could be sorted out locally.  Many families would prefer to do that than travel to Dublin.</P>
        <P>On the whole, the Bill is a good one.  The sections cover very wide areas.  We are living in an age of huge international security problems, international crime, trafficking and the aftermath of 11 September 2001 and the Columbia Three.  There are sophisticated criminals trafficking who can disguise passports.  Therefore, it is necessary that these reforms be put in place.  Nevertheless, I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the position regarding lost and stolen passports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House who is getting very fond of us.  I congratulate him on his explanation of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I proposed the passports for sale legislation some years ago and it was accepted in this House on Second Stage.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform went on to introduce his own Bill which incorporated what I was attempting to do.  Senator Maurice Cummins referred to this earlier.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the efficiency of the Passport Office which I have used on a number of occasions and with which I have been very impressed.  I was upset when I was not allowed to be photographed with a smile.  The official said it is supposed to be one&rsquo;s normal face.  I felt like saying, &ldquo;I always smile&rdquo;, but he would not accept it and made me take a second photograph.</P>
        <P>As someone who has a special interest in passports, I welcome this long overdue Bill.  On a matter as important as this, it beggars belief that there has been no legislation in place until now regulating the issue of passports and the other important matters covered in this Bill.  Senator Cummins educated me today.  I was unaware when we became a free State of the history of how we established our first passports and our first embassies when as a dominion we were not expected to do so.</P>
        <P>I have no great difficulty with any of the measures in this legislation, but I would like to extend our discussion to something that unfortunately is not covered here &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s non-membership of the passport-free Schengen area.  The Schengen area is a common travel area of the kind we used to have with the United Kingdom. Within that area, individual national borders do not count as places of control.  Once inside the area, one can travel freely without border controls to any other part of the area.  Since the Schengen area now includes all of the EU except Ireland and the United Kingdom, this makes <Col N="1541"/>practically the whole of Europe one big border-free area.  In recent months, I have travelled to Estonia, the Czech Republic and Brussels on a number of occasions.  I feel almost like an outsider because while others do not need passports and can have any sort of identification, I must have it.  I am also reminded of what travelling between Ireland and the rest of the world was like before the Schengen area came into being and my delight when it became necessary to only go through the blue zone instead of the green and red zones.</P>
        <P>Joining the Schengen area has naturally required a strengthening of the controls at the boundaries of the common area for member countries.  In other words, while travel within the Schengen area has become freer, getting into the area has been considerably tightened up.  This has involved a sharing of data between the 25 member states and the application of common rules for entry and for the issuing of visas.</P>
        <P>By and large, I understand the system is working well and that it is very much welcomed by the people in the countries it covers, as I have seen.  I can well understand why this is so, because I remember very clearly the excitement I first felt when the special blue customs channel was introduced at our airports for travellers arriving from elsewhere in the EU.  It brought home to me very graphically that Europe was now one big customs-free area, and, to be frank, it brought home to me the reality of the new Europe in a way that all the legislation and institutions of the EU had never done.  It was the change that caught our imagination.</P>
        <P>That was why the further step, the creation of the huge passport-free area that Schengen brought about, excited me too.  However, from the outset Ireland stood apart from the development.  We stood apart because the UK wished to stand apart, and we had to follow suit because of the existence of our long-standing common travel area with the UK.  We had, in effect, to choose between two common travel areas and we chose to stay with the devil we knew rather than the devil we did not know.  My view at that time was that this was a retrograde step.  We should always be trying to move closer to the rest of the Union, and our staying out of the Schengen process put a permanent and very real barrier in the way of that integration.</P>
        <P>Ironically, we made our decision at the same time that the benefits of the common travel area with the UK were being whittled away.  Passengers travelling between the two countries have for many years been liable to police inspection at either end of the journey and are often required to prove their identity, so much so that the carrying of passports between the two countries became advisable as a way of avoiding hassle.  In addition, Ryanair imposed photo-ID requirements on all passengers.  In practical terms, this means that most Irish citizens must carry their passports to be allowed on a Ryanair flight to any <Col N="1542"/>destination, even in Britain.  Between the Special Branch on one hand and Ryanair on the other, over a number of years this area became a common travel area in name only.  In practice, one needed a passport to go from one country to the other.  That is the reality today.</P>
        <P>The latest news in this regard is that the British intend to tighten up the external controls on the island of Britain rather than in the UK, and they will expect us to do the same.  On the basis of our history, we will probably meekly go along with whatever the British want us to do.  I do not believe we should do that.  We should detach ourselves from the British common travel area and join the much bigger common travel area that already exists across Europe, namely, the Schengen area.  This would reflect what I think we all believe, namely, that our future lies much more with being an integral part of Europe rather than simply an appendage to Britain.</P>
        <P>We broke the link with sterling and, despite all the gloomy prognostications of that time, we have prospered as a result.  We should now take the further step of moving away from a small regional arrangement that is no longer delivering benefits and instead become part of what is now virtually a continent-wide area covering 25 European countries and which is working very well.  If we are truly to regard ourselves as part of Europe, there can surely be little doubt as to which decision we should make.  While this will give rise to challenges, I believe they are surmountable.</P>
        <P>The regulatory framework for Irish passports that will be created by this Bill demonstrates that we have put in place a modern, secure, state-of-the-art system of documentation for our citizens.  We are eminently qualified to build on that by joining the Schengen area and we should do so without delay.  Because things are changing, those challenges that would have made it difficult to do this in the past can be overcome.  I would like to open out this debate because the issue is worthy of debate and of serious consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cummins set out the historical background to this issue and made the point that the passport is a symbol of our independence, which is undoubtedly the case.  It is a document that confers rights on Irish citizens to travel within other jurisdictions.  It should not be abused or misused and should be regarded as a privilege.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that many people in Northern Ireland have applied for an Irish passport since the Good Friday Agreement, not all of them necessarily Nationalists, which is also interesting.  It is good to see this happen.  We all have relatives in far-flung places.  I have a cousin, Peter Hendricks, in the United States who is second generation American.  He applied for a passport following his first trip to Ireland, when he established links with his roots and came to appreciate the history of the country from where his forefathers had come.  He was extremely anxious to have an <Col N="1543"/>Irish passport along with his US passport as it was a badge of identity for him.  While we in Ireland may often take the passport for granted, it struck me that somebody who was two generations removed from being Irish would place such value on having and holding his Irish passport.  In fact, as he travels a lot, he told me it was extraordinary how acceptable the Irish passport was in every country to which he travelled &mdash; he was not always able to say the same with regard to his US passport.  It it interesting that this should be the case.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Quinn with regard to the Schengen area and agree that we should participate in it.  The argument heretofore was that the consequence of doing so might be to create a barrier to travelling from here to Northern Ireland in particular.  However, that would not happen because it would be totally impractical.  I cannot see the British who, let us be honest, in recent decades have made the minimum investment they could get away with, investing in something which would be as unnecessary as this.  However, it is an established arrangement and I appreciate the matter must be handled with some sensitivity.  There have been some indications in the recent past that we are moving in this direction.  I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s argument in this regard.</P>
        <P>The whole purpose of a passports system has taken on a new dimension.  It was traditionally about identity and where one was from.  It was a form of identification when one moved to other countries which gave one access to them and to travel.  Because of the global security situation that now exists due to international terrorism the implications of passports has had to be examined, as has the security surrounding them.  That is why we have moved to machine readable passports.  The Minister of State referred to the obligation to prevent misuse for travel in regard to terrorism or criminal activity.  We have seen many instances of abuse in this regard by criminal elements in Europe as well as further afield.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that in areas of doubt the Minister may seek additional identification, apart from the provision of a birth certificate and Garda certification of the signature and standing of an individual.  Ireland has become more multicultural.  Up to 20% of the population has been born in other European countries and elsewhere and it is important that safeguards are in place to ensure people who are issued with passports are qualifying individuals.  The Minister also reserves the right to oblige people to attend for interview.</P>
        <P>I welcome to some extent the enabling provision that will allow for the introduction at some stage of biometric identifiers such as fingerprinting and iris patterns in Irish passports.  It strikes me that there is already a need for us to move in that direction.  It would be a very strong preventative measure for the abuse of passports <Col N="1544"/>and in particular for identifying major international terrorists and criminals.</P>
        <P>Section 14 deals with passports for children.  We have seen the abduction of children all too often in the recent past.  This is especially important given the propensity for international paedophile rings to abduct, abuse and transfer children between different jurisdictions.  There is a necessity to introduce as many precautionary measures as possible.</P>
        <P>I note that in his statement the Minister of State indicated that section 14 gives precedence to the welfare of the child and at the same time safeguards the rights of guardians and parents to make decisions regarding a child&rsquo;s welfare.  I certainly welcome that.  Section 14(8) provides that the Minister may regard consent, once given in writing, as remaining in effect unless subsequently revoked by a guardian.  Given that marriages and relationships break down, I wonder whether we should make this area tighter.</P>
        <P>We have also seen instances, especially involving members of the Islamic community who have married into a Christian family, where children have been abducted and brought back to the Islamic state of their father, in most cases, against the wishes of the mother.  Where consent is given at an early stage in the relationship it would be prudent for further consent to be required at each subsequent renewal of a child&rsquo;s passport.  It is proposed that the renewal of children&rsquo;s passports will be done every three or five years because of how they change and develop.  A period of 15 or 20 years is too long for consent to be valid.  If I am correct in my interpretation of the Bill I urge the Minister to table amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I welcome the introduction of the Passports Bill in this House.  We are conscious that it has been the subject of debate in the other House and, as the Minister of State fairly acknowledged in his speech, a number of amendments tabled in that House were accepted in the course of the debate.  That is a good thing.</P>
        <P>The principal point the Minister of State made, with which we all agree, is that something as important as the passports issuing regime ought to be put on a legislative footing and this has not been done until now.  It is important that is done at this stage so that there can be full public confidence and transparency in the system and we understand the rules and regulations and the basis upon which a passport is issued and cancelled.</P>
        <P>It is a vitally important right of a citizen to have the liberty and the opportunity to travel and what goes with that is the requirement to hold a valid <Col N="1545"/>Irish passport.  It is extremely important that persons should be able to see the basis upon which they are issued with that document and the trust that is reposed in the holder of a passport in respect of their right to travel and their right to present their documents wherever they are in the world.  This is an important right and it is vital there are clear rules in regard to the regulation of the issuing of passports.</P>
        <P>I welcome what appears to have been a comprehensive survey by the Department in respect of interested bodies such as the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Data Protection Commissioner in regard to aspects of this legislation which concern their roles and responsibilities. That is very important.  I accept this is done increasingly with all legislation where areas of responsibility arise and it is very good that it is being done in this case also.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to the question of validation by the Garda.  We have all gone to the local Garda station to get our evidence of identity signed.  It often strikes me that the garda&iacute; themselves would much prefer the system they administer to be on a legislative footing.  This is important both for the citizen and for those who have to deal with the applications.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about one or two issues and I expect to return to these on Committee Stage.  I am not sure about the provision which allows the Department to retain the services of an independent contractor or a third party to collect information from applicants at authorised centres around the country or at locations abroad.  I am not sure what is the real intent of that provision and I have some concerns in regard to it.  As we are aware, a passport, being a public document, remains in the ownership of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am a little uneasy and would like to have explained to me the basis, the relevance or the need for contracting out the collection of data related to the issuing of passports.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes provisions regarding the issuing of emergency passports and the issuing of passports generally.  This has been the subject of controversy recently.  I am not sure whether it has come up previously in the debate.  I refer to the continuing practice of politicians, whether Senators or Deputies, of getting involved in obtaining passports on behalf of citizens.  I do not for a moment suggest there is anything improper about this; it is a practice in which Members of all parties have engaged. However, I wonder whether we have not reached the stage where this process has been properly professionalised and people know the deal, the requirements and where they can get their passports.  I am uncomfortable with the notion that politicians, councillors, Senators and Deputies are the go-betweens in respect of something as important as a passport.  This is something we ought to consider ending.</P>
        <P>I note the reference in section 12 to the question of a refusal to issue a passport.  Some of the <Col N="1546"/>criteria in section 12 recur in section 18, which deals with the revocation and cancellation of passports.  We may have the opportunity to examine these individually on Committee Stage.  What concerns me and others is what looks like a catch-all provision in section 12(<i>c</i>)(<i>iii</i>) which empowers the Minister to refuse or cancel a passport where he or she feels it would be contrary to the common good that a person should have or retain a passport.  I am always uncomfortable about catch-all provisions such as that.  If we can specify other issues in the Bill, we should be able to specify pretty much all the circumstances, as best we can, whereby we think a passport might be refused or cancelled.  We might be able to revisit this on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>My time is up, but my final point is on the appeals system.  The Minister makes a decision and provides for an appeals mechanism in the Bill, but he will appoint the appeals officers.  I do not suggest there would be impropriety, but where we seek transparency in the system it is odd, although not unprecedented, that the Minister who makes a decision, say, to refuse a passport also appoints the officers who decide on an appeal.  We might reconsider that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We are seeing a lot of him lately.  It always feels a little more like home for me when this Minister appears in the House.  I also welcome Senator Quinn&rsquo;s, as always, thoughtful comments on the common travel area and the debate we need to have on whether we would be better off with our existing arrangements or the Schengen Agreement.  Generally I welcome this Bill.  The giving of legislative underpinning to our passport system is overdue.  It seeks to reflect the constitutional basis of the provision of passports and is very important.</P>
        <P>I welcome the efforts in the Bill to combat fraud in various ways and the series of offences and penalties related to the fraudulent application for passports and the misuse of passports.  In particular the section 20 provision on the use of false passports for the purpose of misrepresenting one&rsquo;s age to gain access to public houses and the purchase of alcohol is a useful step as part of a panoply of steps needed to tackle Ireland&rsquo;s ever more serious drink problem.  There may be enforcement issues.  I wonder if that provision is purely declaratory.  I wonder if the bouncers who might give evidence in related cases need to be registered.  These are general points that may require further consideration.  Overall I welcome that provision.</P>
        <P>While I reserve the right to find other concerns between now and Committee Stage, my main concern so far is the proposal to issue passports in cases of gender reassignment.  I do not want my comments on this very sensitive issue to be misunderstood.  My concern is primarily that the Government appears to be jumping the gun by seeking to make legislative provision in this area. <Col N="1547"/> In February the High Court gave the Government two months to outline how it proposes to rectify breaches of human rights.  This followed the Foy case in which Mr. Justice Liam McKechnie found in favour of the plaintiff that certain provisions of the birth registration laws, specifically the Civil Registration Act 2004 violated the right of the plaintiff to respect for her private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights because those provisions of Irish law did not provide for &ldquo;meaningful recognition&rdquo; of the plaintiff&rsquo;s new female identity.  The Government still has two months from 14 February in which to say what it will do.  The Government has yet to say whether it intends to appeal that decision.  Through this Bill one Department is cutting across the right of another Department to decide whether it wants to appeal.  It appears to be jumping the gun by incorporating the thrust of the High Court&rsquo;s decision in seeking to legislate in this way.  The Government&rsquo;s time in which to say whether it will appeal the High Court&rsquo;s decision does not appear to be respected by the incorporation of the decision in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In an unwarranted way this Bill proposes to deal with a very sensitive issue in a piecemeal manner.  Gender reassignment and the question of whether this should be recognised in various ways in various kinds of identity documents &mdash; birth registration, driving licences and passports &mdash; is a complex issue which the Oireachtas should consider in separate legislation rather than deal with in a piecemeal manner by a particular provision being made.  The Government is taking the High Court judgment as the position and cutting across the Oireachtas&rsquo;s right to consider the matter in full.  The Oireachtas needs an opportunity to think through this very complex area of gender reassignment.  Let us remember that in the High Court Mr. Justice McKechnie noted we are dealing with gender dysphoria, a syndrome where a person&rsquo;s gender identity is at odds with his or her physical sexual indicators.</P>
        <P>One might try to deal with this in various ways.  One might say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to complete recognition of the new identity in various documents.  One might say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, because there are certain objective facts; in the case of a man who has become a woman through gender reassignment, that person still has Y chromosomes.  We might argue the compassionate approach is to have a kind of <i>via media</i> where newly issued birth certificates and passports would reflect the original identity but would perhaps, to use a phrase that is used elsewhere in this Bill, contain an observation which would reflect the new situation.  Further thought is needed on this.  The Oireachtas should not be prevented from considering this sensitive issue in a more holistic way than this Bill provides by purporting to legislate for one specific area, namely, the issuing of passports.  On Committee Stage I will propose that section be deleted pending a <Col N="1548"/>wider consideration in separate legislation by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I apologise to the Acting Chairman for stretching my welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In general I welcome the Bill because it is necessary to reform many aspects of legislation on passports.  It is an important document for all our citizens and we must ensure it serves its purpose for them in terms of its security and general usefulness.  I continue to have concerns on some aspects of the Bill, which I will elucidate as I speak.  A passport is probably of greater importance to Irish citizens than to people in other countries.  We have a history of emigration and statistics about the number of passport holders in the United States show we are largely at variance with other nationalities in our practice of holding a passport and travelling outside our national territory in our adult lives.  That helps give Irish people a more rounded view of the world and we should encourage this as much as possible and ensure any administrative constraints on the use of passports are minimised.</P>
        <P>My concerns relate to the provisions on biometric data.  The need for biometric data and its acceptance in other jurisdictions is a reality in modern passports.  The security of the data and how it will stay in State control and never be accessed or used by third parties is not spelled out in the Bill and might need to be dealt with in future regulations.  Enough has not been said on that in this debate.  I would like the Minister and officials in responding to this ongoing debate to describe how such security measures can be taken.</P>
        <P>My second concerns is slightly at variance with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution. For a change, it says something positive about our legislative process that we are responding more immediately to judicial decisions.  He may disagree with the particular decision in this case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Not necessarily. That was not my point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the principle rather than the content of the decision.  There should be a greater onus on Parliament to enact legislation on foot of discrepancies that have been identified through judicial decisions.  We have not done that as well as we should have in the past.</P>
        <P>My problem with this Bill is with the specific references about gender assignation.  There is a far greater difficulty with the factual information about some of our citizens who are not being taken into account in the Bill.  I put forward this argument during the debate on the Civil Registration Act 2004 when I was a Member of the D&aacute;il.  It relates to the identity details of adopted people.  Passports and birth certificates contain the name of the person concerned as well as their date of birth.  However, owing to administrative <Col N="1549"/>convenience and an existing mindset that people who are adopted should not be given too much information lest it triggers a need to find out more about their natural parents, the place of birth of adopted people is always listed as Dublin.  On the adoptive certificate, it is listed as Dublin NC2, which is a fictitious post code which ensures people cannot even start from the right place if they happen to be from Dublin.</P>
        <P>Not only do we have discrimination between adopted people and all other Irish citizens, there is also discrimination between people who are adopted through foreign born adoptions and Irish adopted children.  Foreign born adopted children obviously would have their place of birth registered as part of their foreign adoption.  We must move away from the mindset that adopted people should have as little information about themselves as possible.  The Civil Registration Act 2004 reinforces that bias.  Unfortunately, this Bill builds on that bias and if any attempt can be made to amend it, that area needs to be tackled.  A number of adoption Bills have reinforced that mindset, but adoption legislation has been promised in the programme for Government.  However, one sad aspect of this Bill is that we will be retrenching that particular bias in this legislation when we issue passports in future.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take this up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with the appropriate officials in his Department to ensure that when Irish citizens who are adopted present their documents to leave this State, the information on those documents should be truthful.  We are doing a disservice to them and to the nature of the document itself by containing such information.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill in general as I recognise the need for reforms in this area.  I have a concern with the need for security on biometric information gathered for the issuing of passports.  I particularly have a concern with ending discrimination against adopted people in our society.  Until we end that, the hackneyed phrase of second class citizen will apply especially in this circumstance.  I ask other Members to take that into consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not expect to be speaking on this Bill until I was in the Chair, and I wish to take up from where Senator Boyle left off.  Many of my comments will be related to the fact that I am from Donegal, which is geographically north of the North and politically in the South, something that confuses in many ways.</P>
        <P>I am not <i>au fait</i> with the adoption laws in the North, but given that passports are of an all-Ireland nature and that I was born in Derry, what is the situation regarding an adopted person born there?  There is an all-Ireland dimension to most things.  I often travel down on the Enterprise train from Belfast.  In the recent past, passengers arriving at Connolly Station in Dublin would go through the same doors as everyone else onto the <Col N="1550"/>platforms, but now they are sent through a separate channel.  I resent talking about a common travel area in the island of Ireland, but is that a move to impose a passport control at the train station in the future?  Why are we being sent into a different channel?  Why was this done recently?  The clarification of this issue is important.</P>
        <P>There is a car ferry on the Foyle that goes from Greencastle to Magilligan, which is an international port.  If the authorities were being absolutely strict, passport controls could be put in place.  Security exists there, but it is a joke.  There are security checks going out of the North into Donegal and not the other way round, yet we are paying for it.  We are talking about the use of passports and the all-island concept of the passport, yet facts on the ground are not in keeping with this.  What is being done to get rid of these real borders that we are discovering?  We are paying for the security of something that has no implication.  If the security checks are in place to stop illegal immigrants going into the North, then they are certainly not doing that.  I get off the flight from Derry at Dublin Airport and I am asked for my passport.  Officials will say they are not looking for my passport, but rather my identification.  I am not sure whether the passport is a form of identification or whether it is a passport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would have been concerned about the biometric issue until my diplomatic passport was stolen, which was one of the new passports.  I had been to the US, so my iris and my fingerprints had been taken. I was very satisfied to hear that when my passport was stolen, it could not be used going to America again because my iris and fingerprint details were on it.  However, I share Senator Boyle&rsquo;s concern, particularly following the disappearance of health documentation when disks were stolen.  It is more about the safety of the information.  If one is doing nothing wrong, then one should not worry about people who might be watching.  However, no one wants that information abused or lost.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If a person whose name is Edward but is known as Ed buys an airline ticket using the latter name, he will not be allowed to travel if the name on the ticket is not the same as the name on the passport.  Some people need to be warned about that.  An information campaign could be carried out.  I was approached recently by a girl who was always known by a particular name that she preferred to the name on her birth certificate.  This name was used on her bank accounts and for other purposes.  It was brought to her attention that the use of this name was potentially illegal because it differed from the name that appears on her birth certificate.  Provision must be made for cases in which people use a name other than that which features on their birth certificates.</P>
      
        <P>I call for the establishment of a passport office in the north west.  The regions need passport offices and the population of the north west is sufficient to sustain a passport office.</P><Col N="1551"/>
        <P>Senator Alex White complained about the practice of Members intervening to have passport applications dealt with speedily.  I thank the staff of the Passport Office for the number of times they have pulled people out of holes, so to speak.  I have intervened in such cases, including one in which a woman discovered the night before she was due to travel that her passport was out of date.  The next morning she took the same flight as me from Derry to Dublin and I managed to have her case dealt with because I was coming to the House and knew the people working in the Passport Office.  I telephoned ahead and the woman, who did not have a passport at 8.30 a.m., boarded a flight at lunchtime.  I compliment the staff of the Passport Office and our consuls and embassies all over the world on the tremendous work they do.</P>
        <P>A garda is required to confirm the identify of a person applying for a passport by signing a photograph presented by the applicant at a Garda station.  After my passport was stolen, I went to Pearse Street station where I discovered a sign indicating that passport applicants must have photographs signed at their local Garda station.  Given that many rural Garda stations do not have long opening hours, surely valid identification such as a driving licence is sufficient to enable a garda in any station to sign a passport photograph.</P>
        <P>I am not arguing either in favour or against the introduction of ID cards, which is a wider debate.  On the possibility of requiring people to carry a passport to prove they are over 18 years, it is not safe to carry one&rsquo;s passport on a night out.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Second Stage debate of the Passports Bill 2007, which contains a number of positive elements.  The right to travel outside the State and the right to hold a passport are enumerated rights under Article 43 of the Constitution.  The prospect of having primary legislation clearly articulate these rights and the system governing their realisation is welcome. </P>
        <P>The Bill introduces in the Minister&rsquo;s decision making the concept of the child&rsquo;s best interest, a welcome development that is consistent with the foremost principle of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I also welcome the provision allowing for transgendered persons to change their gender on their passport.  This is the first time explicit recognition has been given to the rights of transgendered persons in law.  As such, it is a positive development.</P>
        <P>The Bill is problematic in a number of respects.  Section 12 provides for the refusal to issue passports and gives the Minister dangerously extensive powers of discretion with little transparency.  The Minister may decide either alone or on the basis of the opinion of a Government colleague to deny an Irish citizen a passport and, by extension, the right to leave the State.  The Minister <Col N="1552"/>can deprive an individual of this fundamental liberty if, in his or her view, the person may engage in conduct that would endanger public safety, would be contrary to the common good or on the often abused ground that the person might prejudice State security.</P>
        <P>I note the D&aacute;il amended this section to allow a passport appeals officer to appeal the Minister&rsquo;s decision to refuse or cancel a passport.  This provision is worthless because the officer cannot reverse the decision.  For this reason, Sinn F&eacute;in advocates the establishment of a direct channel of appeal to the District Court.  At minimum, the Bill should provide that the Minister must issue the person applying for a passport a detailed, clear statement setting out the reasons for a decision to refuse the application for a passport or the withdrawal of same.  The Bill must make provision for a prompt, independent administrative appeals mechanism.</P>
        <P>The measures on biometric data create significant human rights concerns, particularly with regard to the right to privacy.  It appears from the Department&rsquo;s briefing note that the main premise for introducing these provisions was the attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001.  It should be noted, however, that at no time has an evidence-based case been made to justify the introduction and retention of biometric and other personal information belonging to passport holders.  While I acknowledge that the world is changing and technology is developing, this highly expensive system with the potential to compromise human rights is being introduced at the insistence of the United States and for no other reason.  This issue needs to be considered very carefully.</P>
        <P>One of the core principles of privacy and data protection is that any interference with these rights must be justified and proportionate.  In July 2006, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner held that the storage of biometric data on a central database as part of the Swiss biometric passport system was disproportionate to the objective of identity verification of passport holders.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the Bill, biometric data are defined as information relating to distinctive physical characteristics and may include the measurements of same.  Currently, the only biometric use for passports are facial images, which are stored on a central database held by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Under the section, the Minister may, at any time and without consultation, extend biometrics required for passport applicants to include iris images, fingerprints and, potentially, DNA profiles.  At minimum, the Bill should be amended to limit the biometric provisions to facial images, thereby requiring any future extension to be preceded by full debate and scrutiny in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm that the use of the database and its contents will be limited to the processing required for the issuing or <Col N="1553"/>cancellation of passports, with high bar exceptions only.  According to the Bill, the Data Protection Acts apply.  However, they contain broad exemptions.  The Minister must demonstrate that the new passport system will not amount to the introduction by stealth of a massive biometric database at the disposal of domestic and foreign security agencies.  I ask the Minister of State to detail the safeguards in place to prevent the abuse of information provided for the purpose of making a passport application.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides that the &ldquo;Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make such arrangements, including contractual arrangements, as he or she considers appropriate with such persons as he or she thinks fit for the processing of biometric data in respect of applicants for passports.&rdquo;  Is the Minister seriously considering privatising the processing of something as sensitive as biometric data?</P>
        <P>There is scope for improving the Bill.  On section 3, which provides for the making of regulations by the Minister, and section 5, which provides for the performance of relevant functions by the Minister on the authority of the Government, it would be preferable if, as recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission, an explicit reference was made in the text to the obligation of the Minister to take human rights standards into consideration when making incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions.  The Bill should also refer to the Minister&rsquo;s obligation to make his decisions in a manner that is compatible with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
        <P>Most Senators and Deputies receive telephone calls from constituents who have discovered their passport has expired a day or two before they are due to travel abroad.  To address this problem, the Department should alert passport holders by post when their passport is about to expire.  Similar steps are taken to inform drivers that their vehicle taxation or national car tests are about to expire.  If warnings were issued, the process would run more smoothly because fewer people would seek passport renewals at the last moment.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney referred to people using nicknames or other forms of their name which do not appear on their passport.  I ask the Minister to address in the Bill the need to accommodate those who wish to use the Irish language form of their names on their passports.  If Senators or Deputies who use the English versions of their names on passports apply for new passports with the Gaelic versions of their names, which are the true versions in the opinion of many, they will be refused permission to do so under this Bill.  They will be refused under the current rules because there is a requirement to show that the Gaelic version of the name has been used in the previous two years for different purposes.  That is not fair.  We should encourage people to use the Irish version of their name if they so wish.  As PPS <Col N="1554"/>numbers are used in the application process there is no need for such a restriction on the use of the Gaelic name.  I ask the Minister to take on board that suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the purpose of the Bill.  Despite the massive increase in the numbers of people travelling in recent years, due to terrorist events, in particular the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States and the Bali and the London bombings, it has become necessary to implement a series of controls and checks which provide security to all travellers and people at the destination point.  The Government has taken the opportunity in this Bill to update the position by providing a comprehensive legislation basis for the regulation and issuance of passports, which is to be welcomed.  </P>
        <P>I would be concerned that the e-border would limit United Kingdom-Ireland free travel but that is happening in any event because the airlines themselves are implementing controls in that they require photographic identity.  We have enjoyed free travel between here and the UK for a long time, despite the difficulties in the 1970s and 1980s when tight restrictions were in place.  There was control but there was always a facility to pass through to the UK, as should be the case.  I refer in particular to the Republic&rsquo;s land border with the North of Ireland.  The restrictions being proposed in the UK would restrict people travelling from Northern Ireland to the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>We can appreciate and understand the benefits of the new technology, which includes biometric passports, the use of iris pattern, which is a unique method of identification, and thumb imprints which would identify the person without doubt.  Notwithstanding that, the Passport Office has committed itself to storing photographs and the biometric information, which will be securely held for the people.  There is no question, therefore, that the information would be shared with other agencies and used only for passport purposes.</P>
        <P>The current requirement for a second biometric identifier of a fingerprint or an iris pattern may become necessary.  It will probably depend on what will happen in the United States.  Currently, we provide our citizens with a comprehensive package which is well accepted.  It is a modern system.  It provides a valid passport which is useful regardless of the destination to which people travel.  Depending on what happens in the United States we will discover whether there will be a need for fingerprint or iris pattern biometric identifiers, although we hope that will not be the case.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Schengen Agreement, if the situation changes between the UK and Ireland, Ireland would have to consider becoming part of the Schengen group for passports and control.  A total of 31 states, including 27 European Union states and four non-EU member states &mdash; Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland <Col N="1555"/>&mdash; are subject to all or some of the Schengen rules, and 24 have fully implemented them so far.  In 1990, Ireland and the UK did not sign up to the original Schengen Convention and retained a right to opt out of the application of the rules after their conversion into EU law.  In that instance we have not ended border controls with other EU member states.</P>
        <P>A common Schengen visa allows tourists or other visitors access to the area.  Holders of residence permits within a Schengen state enjoy the freedom of travel to other Schengen states for a period of up to three months.</P>
        <P>The legal basis for Schengen in the treaties of the European Union has been inserted by Article 2.15 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  This inserted a new title, named &ldquo;Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons&rdquo; into the treaty, currently numbered as Title IV, and comprising Articles 61 to 69.  The Treaty of Lisbon substantially amends the provisions of the articles in the title, renames the title to &ldquo;Area of freedom, security and justice&rdquo; and divides it into five chapters, called &ldquo;General provisions&rdquo; &mdash; policies on border checks, asylum and immigration; judicial cooperation in civil matters; judicial co-operation in criminal matters; and police co-operation.</P>
        <P>This Bill merely brings us up to date with what is happening currently in the world in terms of the threats of terrorism and the obvious need for the biometric changes in our passports.  That is the reality.  The possibility of the Department of Homeland Security in the United States putting more stringent regulations in place may result in further changes in the future.  It is hoped we will not need more stringent biometric regulations but it will reflect what is happening in the world at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate on the Bill, which was constructive and informative.  It is clear from the debate and the debate in the D&aacute;il that there is a consensus regarding the Bill.  We all share a common desire to put in place a comprehensive legislative basis which will ensure the continued provision of a high quality and secure passport service.</P>
        <P>As in most countries, demand for passports here is seasonal, with a peak in demand from March to June.  As we now enter that peak season it is worth reflecting on the scale of the challenges facing the Passport Office.  The Passport Office has the largest client base of any State service.  Approximately 4.2 million valid Irish passports are held by Irish citizens throughout the world.  More than 600,000 passports were issued in 2007, an increase of over 50% on the figure four years previously.  Preliminary data for the first two months of 2008 suggest a continuing high level of demand.</P><Col N="1556"/>
        <P>A notable feature of the passport service is that it is the only State service which operates on the ground in all 32 counties.  It is very much a local service with the facility available to citizens to apply through the express post service in over 1,000 post offices in the South and some 70 post offices throughout the North.  The express post route offers a guaranteed ten working days service for applications which are fully in order.  That compares favourably with the level of service available in other EU member states.  Applicants can also apply in person at the public offices in Dublin and Cork.</P>
        <P>In reply to many of the questions raised, I would like to see other outlets, particularly in the north west, as mentioned by Senator Keaveney, in Limerick &mdash; we have a new decentralised office in the mid-west &mdash; and in the west where it is hoped to have an Irish aid centre in future years similar to the one on O&rsquo;Connell Street.</P>
        <P>When proof of travel is provided, applications can be processed within ten working days and in urgent cases.  On payment of an additional fee, an applicant can acquire a passport on the day of application or the following day.  An out-of-hours service is also available for genuine emergencies at weekends and on public holidays.</P>
        <P>The passport service is held in high regard and frequent positive comments are made about the quality of service available at the public offices.  In particular, the availability of a local office in Cork which deals with the Munster area is greatly appreciated.  This was referred to in the D&aacute;il debate.  The number and distribution of public offices will be kept under ongoing review having regard to the level of applications made from various parts of the country.  I am conscious the level of applications made through Northern post offices has risen steadily in the past two years.  This is a trend which is likely to continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The quality of service provided by the Passport Office could not have been maintained without the major programme of investment in technology of recent years.  In my opening remarks, I referred to the successful completion of initiatives such as the introduction of machine-readable passports, the automated processing system and the introduction of e-passports.  These initiatives mean we now have a modern, efficient and, above all, secure means of passport production.  It is also possible to track the progress of an application on-line.  The Department will continue to keep matters under review to see what contribution evolving technology may make in terms of the efficiency and quality of the service provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most importantly, the high quality of the passport service is mainly due to the hard work and customer service focus of the staff of the Passport Office.  I wish to place on record my sincere appreciation to them for their hard work and dedication, and to my officials in the Department, two of whom are with me today.</P>
        <P>Senators made interesting points during the debate and I will reply to some of them.  Senator <Col N="1557"/>Cummins welcomed the Bill and wondered why it has taken so long.  I agree with him that 1924 is a long time ago.  He referred to passports for sale which is a thing of the past and has no place in the modern Irish passport system.  Senators are also correct about the high reputation of the Irish passport.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Cummins that we need a clear legislative base for our passport system.  The Government is conscious of the important symbolism of the passport.  This is why we invested heavily in the technology about which I spoke.  Our passport is among the most secure in the world.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s condemnation of abuse and misuse of our passports and this Bill will make it easier to prosecute those who offend.  Senator Cummins also referred to the move to Balbriggan.  The Molesworth Street office in central Dublin, which is an important office, will remain open.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Ormonde for her comments.  She spoke about the fact that a passport is more than a travel document.  It is important evidence of our identity and citizenship.  Senator Ormonde also stated the Bill is necessary.  It is important as it gives greater clarity and legal certainty to existing and established practices in the office.  The Senator also referred to a citizen&rsquo;s right to privacy.  I fully support her on this and it is important it is maintained.</P>
        <P>On the question of difficulties at airports, to which Senator Ormonde also referred, we operate an emergency system to issue passports on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis.  Identity and entitlement must be checked and it may not be always possible to issue a passport on the spot.  We are examining the possibility of new outlets and we could consider airports as the Senator suggested.</P>
        <P>Senator Fergal Quinn referred to the Schengen Agreement.  We want to see easier travel within Europe, particularly to and from our fellow European Union member states.  However, we also should be aware of the strong implications for North-South relations.  The UK is outside the Schengen area.  We do not want to see a physical border re-established in Ireland.  I will take on board what the Senator stated and pass on his views to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Walsh raised the question of relaxing the rules on consent for children to travel.  The provision on the relaxation of rules on consent is discretionary.  It allows, but does not oblige, the Minister to regard consent previously given as valid until a child reaches 18 years of age.  It is intended to reduce the burden on families.  However, in situations where the Passport Office becomes aware of any difficulty, it may require the consent of both guardians to be given again in writing for the issue of a passport.</P>
        <P>With regard to biometrics, which was raised by Senators Walsh and Doherty, we have no plans to include a second biometric, such as fingerprints, on our passports.  Senator Walsh is correct <Col N="1558"/>to state this has been put in place in some locations, particularly in other EU member states.  We do not intend to do so but provision is made to include a second biometric in the future if it becomes a standard international practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point on gender reassignment, this provision was included in the Bill to reflect the established practice of the Passport Office.  For many years we have issued passports to persons who have changed gender.  The Foy case to which he referred does not invalidate the practice.  Should any changes be required with regard to birth certificates, these will be reflected in amending legislation.  This is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.  Senator Boyle also raised the matter of birth certificates.</P>
        <P>With regard to Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s point on travel between Belfast and Dublin, there are no plans to introduce passport controls between North and South.  Senator Doherty spoke about the appeals system.  I am glad this will be included in the Bill.  The passport appeals officer cannot overrule the Minister.  I assure the Senator we will not privatise the biometric system.  We are merely speaking about having this in place, and if necessary, a second biometric will be provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Hanafin for his remarks on the Schengen Agreement which were interesting.  The Senator made clear the reality of the situation as it exists.  This may change and it is true to state that some of the difficulties encountered while travelling between Ireland and Great Britain are to do with the practices of airlines rather than legislation or regulations.  I thank the Senators for their comments.  We will return to some of these issues on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the second of two Bills to implement the social welfare package of &euro;900 million announced in last December&rsquo;s budget.  This generous package brings total expenditure on social welfare in 2008 to just under &euro;17 billion and represents nearly half of all additional current Government spending announced in last December&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill provides for the implementation of certain social welfare improvements announced in the budget for 2008.  It also contains the statutory basis for the administration of the blind welfare allowance and the <Col N="1559"/>domiciliary care allowance by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  These schemes are currently administered by the Department of Health and Children and their transfer is part of the Government&rsquo;s health service reform programme.  The Bill also provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990, and consequential amendments to the Family Law Act 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The social welfare budget package provides approximately &euro;148 million, or &euro;194 million when the early child care supplement is included, to improve the range of supports provided for children.  The 2008 budget provided increases of 6% or above in overall child income support through a combination of child benefit, qualified child increases, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the early child care supplement.</P>
        <P>The policy direction followed by successive Governments in recent years has included the dedication of substantial resources to the universal child benefit scheme.  This represents part of an ongoing objective of reforming income support for children to reduce work disincentives by making child income support more neutral <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the employment status of the parent.  The policy focus has been driven in part by the recognition that the loss of qualified child increases by social welfare recipients on taking up employment could act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000, together with improvements in the in-work family income supplement, FIS, scheme, including the re-focusing of the supplement&rsquo;s income thresholds on larger families from January 2006, have reduced further the impact of the loss of qualified child increases in the decision to take up full-time employment.  In view of these changed circumstances, qualified child increase rates were increased somewhat in 2007 and 2008, the first such increases since 1994.</P>
        <P>The agreed programme for Government also contains a series of welfare reforms aimed at prioritising the interests of families and children.  Under the terms of an earlier social partnership agreement, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, was requested to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with qualified child increases to create a single second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.  The commitment to examining such a change was embodied in subsequent social partnership agreements, including Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The NESC decided not to adopt a definitive position on the issue and has instead recently published a paper in its research series setting <Col N="1560"/>down the complex policy and technical challenges involved.  The paper will be of help in informing further developments in this area.  The importance of targeted income support to families and children continues to be a high priority for the Government and recent changes have seen substantial improvements in this area.</P>
        <P>The 2008 budget provided for payment of an additional &euro;2 per week in the qualified child increase, formerly called the child dependant allowance, which is paid to all social welfare recipients with children.  It also provided for increased weekly income thresholds for all FIS family sizes, with additional resources being directed at larger families as research has shown that is where poverty is more likely to exist.  These improvements will benefit some 26,500 existing families and entitle a further 2,700 families to the payment.</P>
        <P>These changes represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while limiting the extent to which employment disincentives are increased.  Maintaining this balance will remain a priority in consideration of future policy changes in this area.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to continue the policy of increasing child benefit this year.  The Bill provides for an increase of &euro;6 in the lower monthly rate of child benefit and &euro;8 in the higher rate, bringing the new monthly rates to &euro;166 for each of the first two children and to &euro;203 for the third and subsequent children.  The increase in child benefit will be effective from April 2008 and will benefit more that 570,000 families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children.</P>
        <P>The Bill, on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, also provides for an increase of &euro;100 in the annual rate of the early child care supplement, bringing the annual rate to &euro;1,100 and the quarterly rate to &euro;275.  This increase will apply from the first quarter of 2008 and will benefit up to 430,000 children by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, recommended expansion of the availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, an extension of the national employment action plan, to focus on lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low-income families with young children.</P>
        <P>Recognising the high levels of consistent poverty among lone-parent families, the report also recommended the upper income limit for the receipt of the new social assistance payment should be &euro;400 per week.  The 2007 budget realised this increase and I am happy to go further in this Bill by increasing the upper earnings limit for qualification for the one parent family payment to &euro;425.</P>
        <P>The EU survey of income and living conditions statistics for 2006 suggests there is still some way <Col N="1561"/>to go in alleviating the risk of poverty faced by many lone parents.  I am still convinced the long-term aim of the proposed new social assistance payment, to help people to achieve financial independence by supporting them into training and education and enabling them to enter the labour force, offers the best way out of poverty and social exclusion.  The development of any new scheme to support low-income parents can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>That is why the non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper are being tested in two areas, Coolock and Kilkenny.  These tests are focused on identifying and resolving any practical and administrative issues which may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced.  The tests are nearing completion and a report will be made to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.  The tests will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new social assistance scheme and accompanying supports.</P>
        <P>As we all know, carers play a critical and much-valued role in ensuring that older people and those with disabilities can remain in their own homes for as long as possible.  Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  I assure Senators that we are committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum possible extent.  This commitment to carers has been reinforced in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and in the programme for Government, both of which include significant commitments in the area of caring.  These include commitments to increase the amount of the respite care grant, to keep the further development of payments to carers under review and to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The Bill provides for an increase of &euro;200 in the respite care grant, bringing the value of the grant to &euro;1,700 for each care recipient.  This measure will benefit more than 48,000 carers this year.  The increase in the respite care grant will take effect from June 2008.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support.  As a general rule only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  This has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.  As Senators know, budget 2007 provided for a fundamental reform of the social welfare system for carers in this regard.  Under the new arrangements, which came into effect in September 2007, people in receipt of certain social welfare payments other than carer&rsquo;s allow<Col N="1562"/>ance or benefit who are providing others with full-time care and attention can now retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which is equivalent to a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>These new arrangements apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.  The beneficiaries are people currently in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment, such as a contributory State pension, and people currently in receipt of other social welfare payments who are also providing full-time care and attention.  These may now qualify for an additional payment.  To date, almost 7,000 additional carers have benefited from these new arrangements.</P>
        <P>One of the Government&rsquo;s key commitments is to the development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy.  This strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key aspect of the strategy, other issues, such as access to respite care and other services, education, training and employment, will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For this reason, all relevant Departments and agencies are involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to draw up the strategy.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with the secretariat provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and includes officials from the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Health and Children as well as the HSE and F&Aacute;S.  The expertise of other Departments and agencies will be called on as required.  It is expected that the strategy will be completed by mid-year.</P>
        <P>The recent improvements in the income supports available from the Department, together with the improvements in home care and related services provided by the Minister for Health and Children in recent budgets, represent a further realisation of our vision of a co-ordinated approach to services and supports for carers in the community.  The development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas in which progress can be made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to clarify the position on young carers, which was raised during the earlier debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il.  Towards 2016 commits the Government to carrying out a study of children who have undertaken inappropriate care roles in order to establish the extent of the problem and the impact on the lives of the children concerned.  The agreement also states, &ldquo;Based on the out<Col N="1563"/>come of this study and an analysis of the issues identified, a programme of in-home supports will be developed to alleviate specific problem areas identified for children&rdquo;.  The Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children intends to commission such a study this year, following consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies.  Although my Department does not have the lead role in this study, my officials will be involved as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the administration of blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance to the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be of benefit to both the HSE and the Department.  The transfer will allow the HSE to concentrate on its core health functions and, in particular, on other aspects of its reform programme.  From my Department&rsquo;s point of view, the transfer will provide opportunities for enhanced customer service and more effective and co-ordinated administration of income support payments.  The Bill provides a framework for eligibility and a set of clear and detailed guidelines which will apply to the administration of domiciliary care allowance and blind welfare allowance.  Accordingly, mainstream income support eligibility and assessment criteria will be applied.  Most recipients of domiciliary care allowance and blind welfare allowance are also in receipt of child benefit or another social welfare payment and are therefore already customers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The transfer will make it easier for my Department to increase awareness of its services and give information on access and entitlements to all its payments.  The transfer will in effect mean that a person&rsquo;s income needs will be dealt with in one Department.</P>
        <P>It has been decided that both payments will transfer on an as-is basis in the first instance.  This is to ensure that the transfer runs as smoothly as possible and without any disruption in service to recipients.  This approach will also ensure that any necessary linkages between income support and health systems are preserved.  The transfer will be achieved with appropriate adjustments in manpower in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the health sector, and will be neutral in terms of Exchequer funds and staff numbers.  The Bill proposes to remove the existing means test for domiciliary care allowance, which is applied solely to the income of the child.  I did not feel it was appropriate to include this part of the existing scheme in the proposed legislation.  On transfer of domiciliary care allowance this means test will no longer be applied.  The transfer of these payments within mainstream income support legislation is an appropriate development and will provide a more streamlined, consistent, and efficient customer-oriented service to recipients of domiciliary care allowance and blind welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that the Green Paper on Pensions was launched in October 2007 fol<Col N="1564"/>lowing an intensive review of the pension system by several Departments and the Pensions Board.  Publication of the Green Paper was a Towards 2016 commitment.  The document comprehensively addresses issues relating to social welfare and supplementary pensions in Ireland.  The Green Paper does not recommend any particular course of action but rather sets out the challenges facing our pension system now and in the future.  It clearly sets out the current situation and the implications, from an economic and social perspective, of various suggested courses of action.</P>
        <P>Views are being sought on the issues raised in the Green Paper through a consultation process which has been taking place since its publication.  This process is being facilitated through the website <i>www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie</i>, where people can make submissions and express their views on the important issues raised in the Green Paper.  It also provides information on the Green Paper and on events relevant to the consultation process.  I am happy to inform Senators that approximately 80 submissions have been made through the website to date.  Interested parties can also make submissions directly to my Department and I encourage all Senators to use this consultation process as an opportunity to express their views on this important matter.</P>
        <P>The Department also organised a number of regional seminars during the last week of February and the first week of March, the first of which took place last week in Dublin.  Further seminars took place in Waterford on Monday and in Cork yesterday, and today there is a seminar in Tullamore.  The final regional seminar will take place tomorrow in Sligo.  These seminars will be followed by a major conference in Dublin in May.  This extensive consultation process will ensure that all those who wish to contribute to the debate are given an opportunity to do so.  The consultation process will provide an important and valued contribution to the development of a framework for comprehensively addressing the issue of pensions over the longer term.  The Government plans to have completed this framework by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill, which includes new measures and amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990, and a small number of other Acts.  Sections 1 and 2 provide for the Short Title, construction, collective citation and commencement of the Bill and contain definitions of certain terms as they apply throughout the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for an increase of &euro;6 in the lower monthly rate of child benefit and &euro;8 in the higher rate, bringing them respectively to &euro;166 and &euro;203 per month.  The increase in child benefit will be effective from April 2008.  Families who receive the monthly payment via their bank accounts will receive the budget increase from April 2008, while those who receive payment via personalised payable order books encashable at post offices will be paid, as has been the case in <Col N="1565"/>previous years, in the first week in May 2008, backdated to April 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for an increase of &euro;100 in the annual rate of early child care supplement, bringing the annual rate to &euro;1,100 and the quarterly rate to &euro;275.  The increases will apply from the first quarter of 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for the implementation of Council regulation 259/68 to allow an official employed in a European Communities institution to transfer the actuarial value of their pension rights from the social insurance fund into the pension scheme of the European Communities institution, PSEC, and for the transfer of the actuarial value of their pension from the PSEC to the national system.  Currently a person employed by an EC institution is not covered by the protection that normally applies to EU citizens under EU regulation 1408/71 which ensures that other member states take account of PRSI contributions paid in Ireland.  This section makes provision to enable the transfer of any such contributions from the social insurance fund to the PSEC.  It also provides for the transfer of contributions from the PSEC to the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that a person transferring back to illness benefit from invalidity pension will be entitled to a full personal rate of illness benefit where they have the required number of contributions in the relevant tax year.  Section 7 provides that a person moving from disability allowance to the non-contributory State pension at age 66 will not receive a lower rate of payment owing to a less favourable capital disregard on the non-contributory State pension scheme.</P>
        <P>Section 8 raises the earnings limit for receipt of one-parent family payment to &euro;425, as announced in the budget for 2008.  It also provides for the income to be assessed in a manner to be prescribed by regulations.  These will provide for the disregard of social insurance, health and superannuation contributions and trade union subscriptions for the purposes of assessment of earnings for one-parent family payment.  Section 9 increases the respite care grant to &euro;1,700 as announced in the budget for 2008.  The increase will apply from 5 June 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the deletion of the outdated term &ldquo;penal servitude&rdquo;.  It also provides that a person shall not be considered to be detained in legal custody for the purposes of entitlement to disability allowance when he or she is detained for treatment under an admission order or renewal order made under the Mental Health Act 2001, under section 38 of the Health Act 1947 under sections 4 or 5 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, under section 17 of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act 1821 or under section 2 of the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883, and that these provisions which are beneficial to the individuals affected will be deemed to have come into effect on 1 June 2005.</P><Col N="1566"/>
        <P>Section 11 provides that a home maker may include a person who is resident in the State, is a member of the Defence Forces or the spouse of such a member, is a civil servant in the Civil Service of the Government or the State, is in the service outside the State of the Government, the State or an international organisation, or is a volunteer development worker.  The section also provides that a deciding officer may decide the question whether a person is to be deemed a home maker at any time.</P>
        <P>Sections 12 to 14, inclusive, set out the conditions for entitlement to blind welfare allowance, the rates of payment, the provisions for the calculation of means, the consequential amendments and the transitional provisions to allow for the transfer of the administration of the scheme from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Social and Family Affairs with effect from early 2009.</P>
        <P>Sections 15 to 17, inclusive, set out the conditions for eligibility for receipt of domiciliary care allowance, the rates of payment, the consequential amendments and the transitional provisions to allow for the transfer of the administration of the payment of an allowance for the domiciliary care of children from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Social and Family Affairs with effect from early 2009.</P>
        <P>Section 18 clarifies the provisions for appeals for supplementary welfare allowance and inserts amended provisions for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance, including the transitional provisions for the continuation of payments under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme as determined by the Health Service Executive on the transfer of the operation of the scheme to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Section 19 clarifies the late claims provisions for the respite care grant.  Section 20 clarifies the provisions concerning the making of regulations relating to payment to persons other than the claimant or beneficiary.  Section 21 corrects an omission from the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.  Section 22 amends section 343 of the principal Act by removing the provision that a decision on any question relevant to criminal proceedings shall be conclusive for the purposes of such proceedings and replaces it with a provision that any such decision will be admissible as evidence in such proceedings.  Section 23 provides for a technical amendment to correct the text inserted by the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.</P>
        <P>Section 24 provides for the disregard, for the purposes of rent and mortgage interest supplement, of any amount of carer&rsquo;s benefit in excess of the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; in line with current arrangements for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It also provides for changes in the rules for the calculation of the income disregard.  The legislation is being amended to state <Col N="1567"/>that the disregard applies to all income and to clarify that additional income includes earnings, family income supplement and all maintenance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 25 provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.  These changes mainly arise from the recommendations of the report of the Pensions Board to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on trusteeship.  The report was published in November 2006.  The recommendations in this report are aimed at enhancing both the governance of occupational pension schemes and the protection of the pension rights of scheme members.  These changes will facilitate the implementation of recommendations in this report.</P>
        <P>Section 26 provides for the definition of the principal Act for the purposes of Part 3.  Section 27 proposes to bring registered third party administrators of pension schemes under the remit of the Pensions Act.  Third party administrators are currently unregulated for scheme administration work carried out on behalf of the trustees of pension schemes.  The Pensions Act is being amended to bring such third party administrators within the remit of the Act and covers certain core functions that they perform on behalf of trustees.  Pension scheme administrators will now be required to register with the Pensions Board before they can carry out these core functions and the Pensions Board will have responsibility to audit administration service standards and to remove registration or apply sanctions if required standards are not met.</P>
        <P>Section 28 provides for enhancements to the existing provisions for the training of trustees of pension schemes as recommended in the Pensions Board report.  While trustees are required at present to disclose in their annual report whether they have access to trustee training, continuous and quality training is not compulsory and research has indicated that ongoing quality training is not the norm.  The proposed amendments will put an obligation on employers to arrange trustee training for each individual trustee within six months of his or her appointment and at least every two years thereafter and will put an obligation on trustees to undertake this training.</P>
        <P>Section 29 and Schedule 2 provide for a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 which are mainly technical in nature.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a small number of amendments to other Acts as follows: Sections 30 and 31 provide for consequential amendments to the Family Law Act 1995 and the Family Law Divorce Act 1996 to mirror the amendments made above to the Pensions Act 1990 on the matter of the definition of a defined contribution scheme.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the Minister for Social and Family <Col N="1568"/>Affairs to the House and thank him for taking the time to discuss the important matters relating to the Social Welfare Bill 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the increases in social welfare payments made in the 2008 budget.  I am aware that the social welfare package and support services announced in the 2008 budget was &euro;980 million.  This money will undoubtedly help to make life easier for families living on social welfare.  However, careful budgetary planning and implementation are necessary to ensure that social welfare benefits those most in need.  Unfortunately, the Government has failed to provide support for a number of groups in society.  Groups such as the working poor, lone parents and carers continue to be neglected by the State.  The key issues faced by these important sectors of our community have not been addressed.</P>
        <P>The startling fact is that almost one third of all households at risk of poverty today are headed by a person with a job.  This has been stated in both Houses on a number of occasions but no effort has been made to eradicate this problem.  Consequently, the problems for the so-called working poor have worsened.  Every day we hear stories of marginalisation and deprivation in society.  We are aware of the social implications of such neglect on our society &mdash; rising crime rates, unprovoked violent attacks, a rise in the number of people involved in criminality and gang warfare, sick people unable to afford basic medical care, the acceptance of drug abuse in society and the list can continue.</P>
        <P>To tackle the issues of social deprivation we must first address the issue of poverty.  CORI has stated that the only way to eradicate poverty is to make tax credits refundable.  This would enable people on low pay to benefit from the full value of the tax credits, to which they are entitled.  People in this category do not pay income tax or pay related social insurance.  Consequently, they are the only people who do not benefit from budget changes.  I accept that budget 2008 provided significant resources.  I welcome the increases in child income supports but I have serious concerns about the real impact these changes will have in terms of tackling child poverty and of assisting the most disadvantaged in our society.  In 2006, according to an EU survey on income and living conditions, 11% of all children under 14 years of age were living in consistent poverty and 20% were at risk of poverty.  Effectively, these were children living in families whose income was below 60% of median income.</P>
        <P>While there have been increases in the qualified child allowance, child benefit, back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the early child care supplement, the reality is that child income supports for children under six years of age have only increased by &euro;5.69 per week.  I ask the Minister to consider how much it costs to feed and clothe a pre-school going child.  Sadly child poverty is a harsh reality for many Irish children.  I am aware of children who go to bed hungry and <Col N="1569"/>cold, without enough fuel or warm changes of clothes and shoes.  Although some attempts have been made to combat poverty there is still a long way to go to fully tackle this issue.</P>
        <P>I turn now to the issue of rent allowance and rent supplements.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs pays rent supplements to persons who rent private accommodation but are unable to afford the cost.  These payments are means tested and most recipients depend on welfare payments as their main source of income.  Contrary to the intentions of the scheme, rent supplement has become a <i>de facto</i> long-term housing support for the many households who qualify for social housing but who do not have access to it due to inadequate supply.  It has been noted by Threshold that the failure to provide sufficient social housing has resulted in many households having no other option but to rely totally on the private rented sector and the inadequate subsidy that rent supplement provides.</P>
        <P>Yesterday in my constituency clinic, I met a young girl who works one day a week and who was offered &euro;25 per week rent allowance.  She is living at home in her parents&rsquo; local authority house.  She shares the box room with her nine year old son.  This is not a suitable situation.  She is on the local authority housing list since her child was a baby and there is no prospect of her getting a house because her housing is not deemed overcrowded until her child is ten years of age.  There is an inadequate supply of local authority housing.  Official figures show that over 43,000 low income families are on local authority housing waiting lists because they cannot afford to buy a house.  People in receipt of rent supplement earn little more that the minimum wage and cannot afford to buy a home.</P>
        <P>An insignificant rental supplement scheme only serves to put additional pressures on already financially overstretched families, forcing them into poor, rat infested, fire traps that are damp and dirty and sometimes even lack basic necessities such as fridges and ovens.  I have seen such deplorable accommodation.  The top payment in Dublin for rental supplement is &euro;130 but the rental rates for the cheapest bedsits in Dublin stand at &euro;150 per week.  The current system is insufficient because it does not and has not responded to local rental charges and does not reflect the changes in the rental market.  I ask the Minister to review rental caps to ensure they reflect real market costs, so the people facing poverty are allowed to live in decent accommodation.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, many people, including many of my constituents, find it hard to get decent accommodation because landlords do not accept rent supplements.  Landlords are reluctant to accept it because it is paid in arrears rather than in advance, which is the norm for the rental sector.  Individuals and families in receipt of the rental supplement are disadvantaged because they cannot pay their deposit and first month&rsquo;s rent up <Col N="1570"/>front.  Landlords are most likely to accept tenants who can pay up front.   In some cases the rent supplement recipients have to wait up to six weeks for their payments and, in other cases, after processing the application the tenant is refused and left in a situation where he or she owes the landlord six weeks&rsquo; rent.  The current rental supplement system is fair neither to the landlord nor the tenant.  Are there plans to introduce changes that will allow the rent supplement to be paid in advance rather than in arrears?</P>
        <P>The sad reality about homelessness in Ireland today is that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 people currently living on the streets.  Occasionally, exceptions to rental caps are made for people who are homeless but in practice this does not happen often.  As a result, people who live independently remain homeless and are vulnerable to the dangers of living on the street.  The Minister should address the rules governing rental caps to allow more exceptions to be made for the homeless.  There must be a review of several aspects of the rental supplement scheme to ensure that it adequately assists the people it is supposed to support.  Local authorities are assuming responsibility for the long-term housing needs of people who have been on rent supplement for more than 18 months under the new rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which I welcome.  There are a number of pilot programmes under the RAS where people who are homeless are moved from emergency accommodation into longer-term accommodation.  One of the main problems with the rental accommodation scheme, however, is that it is extremely slow.  A total of 1,000 of 33,000 qualifying recipients have transferred from rent supplement to RAS since September 2005.  That is very low.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, spoke in the Seanad on 18 December last year on the Social Welfare Bill.  She stated that poverty is likely to be more concentrated in larger families.  The new family income thresholds, while substantially increasing all payments, concentrate additional resources on larger families.  This improvement continues the refocusing of thresholds towards larger families, thereby further targeting resources at low income households.  I welcome the sentiment of the Minister and the concentration of family income support on low income families.  However, the Government has failed to encourage lone parents to go back to work.  This budget was clearly not welfare-to-work proofed.  Part-time workers, for example, stand to lose &euro;2.40 from their family income support payment.  The family is recognised as the backbone of society.  It is the basic unit in society where children are taught to interact socially.</P>
        <P>The national action plan for social inclusion recognises the importance of education for a child&rsquo;s development and future well-being.  The current back to school allowance provides children aged between two and 11 years with a &euro;200 allowance.  Children aged between 12 and 22 <Col N="1571"/>receive &euro;305.  This money does not just cover school uniforms; it also covers transport, school lunches, educational trips, school bags and school books.  Without adequate funding we are taking a serious risk that those who cannot afford to fund their children&rsquo;s education may simply not send them to school.  The small increase promised in the 2008 budget amounts to 39 cent extra per week per child.  This does not cover even the cost of a bus fare, which is 60 cent for a schoolchild.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s existing policy on habitual residency means that children who are living in direct provision are not entitled to child benefit, but to a mere &euro;9.60 per week.  This issue has been raised many times in this House, the Lower House and at committee level.  It is shocking that a First World country would allow discrimination like this to continue.  It is not only morally and ethically wrong but is, I believe, illegal.  I ask the Minister to change this policy so that all children can be treated the same.  In the programme for Government we were promised that the State would eradicate child poverty by 2008 but this date has now been pushed back to 2012.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned carers and I welcome the study to which he referred, on young carers, commissioned by the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  Regarding the national carer&rsquo;s strategy, I welcome the fact that the Minister has appointed a working group, which he said is due to report mid-year.  I ask him to specify when exactly in mid-year the report can be expected.  When will the report on young carers be published?  Those young people are missing out on education, holidays, social interaction and so forth.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the fact that the means test has been removed for domiciliary care and the blind welfare allowances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  I welcome the increases in social welfare payments, which were also largely welcomed by CORI and Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy at a recent Oireachtas committee meeting.  </P>
        <P>I also welcome the fact that many agencies of which I am aware, including the legal aid centre in Coolock, the family mediation centre in Raheny and the Money, Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, centres benefit from the fact that the Minister takes a keen personal interest in their work.  I thank him for that.  I recently attended a function at which the Minister opened a local call centre in the MABS office in Lombard Street.  All of the aforementioned agencies play a very important role in our communities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that section 28 deals with the issue of pension fund trustees who need training.  Last week I spoke to a trades union official about this issue and he made the point that mistakes have been made by pension fund trustees because they were not up to speed, which cost <Col N="1572"/>pension funds dearly, in some cases.  I welcome what is a very important provision in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden referred to the issues of planning and control, which are very important.  One must have control and planning in place or abuse of the system will take place.  I am glad something is being done in this regard.</P>
        <P>The work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs impacts on nearly every person in the State.  The Department administers some 50 different schemes and services, with over 1.5 million people receiving weekly payments.  More than 570,000 families receive child benefit for 1.1 million children each month.  The Minister has focused on child poverty and on the less well off in our society, including the elderly, which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Departmental expenditure in 2007 was &euro;15.3 billion and the projected expenditure in 2008 is &euro;17 billion.  With this level of expenditure, I am pleased the Minister and the Department are concerned to ensure that fraudulent and other irregular payments are kept to the minimum.  Given the level of expenditure, any incidence of fraud and error, however small, would result in a significant loss to the social welfare insurance fund, from which benefits are paid to the Exchequer and from which social payments are made.  The prevention of fraud and abuse of the system is an important part of the day-to-day work of the Department and it is vital that we pay the right person the correct amount of money at the right time.  We must ensure that systems and procedures are in place that prevent and minimise the risk of fraud and error at the initial claims stage.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently checking the records of thousands of Irish pensioners living abroad, following concerns that welfare payments were made to people who have died.  A total of 35,000 recipients of the contributory pension are living outside the State, mainly in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada.  These countries do not automatically alert Irish authorities when an Irish citizen dies.  The Government&rsquo;s contributory State pension is a social insurance payment made to people aged 66 or over, based on their PRSI contributions.  A total of 237,000 are in receipt of the pension, 14% of whom are resident abroad.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcements made by the Minister and his Department regarding a number of control measures which are under way to ensure that errors or irregular payments are kept to a minimum.  Officials conducted 345,000 welfare reviews last year, on a regular and targeted basis.  Prosecutions are also an important deterrent of social welfare fraud.  During 2007, 361 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office for prosecution, 243 of which were finalised in court.  A total of 26 cases of personation were referred by social welfare inspectors to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2007 for follow-up investigation and possible prosecution.  These cases included people <Col N="1573"/>cashing a payment belonging to another person and people working under another&rsquo;s PPS number.  The Department&rsquo;s programme for 2008 provides for some 463,000 reviews to be undertaken, including 123,000 medical reviews.</P>
        <P>Non-Irish nationals in receipt of child benefit whose children reside abroad will be required to clarify every three months that they continue to be employed in this country.  Other non-Irish nationals will be required to certify twice annually that they or their children continue to reside here.  A life certification project will be undertaken on the 14% of recipients of the contributory State pension who reside abroad.</P>
        <P>These safeguards must be put in place to ensure that everybody gets a fair share of the cake.  We cannot give everybody their fair share if some are falsely receiving payments.  Residency checks will be undertaken on non-Irish nationals in receipt of unemployment payments.  The habitual residence requirement was first introduced as a qualifying condition for receipt of certain social welfare payments, with effect from 1 May, 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the ten new EU accession states, without the transitional limitations imposed by most of our EU neighbours.  It is a very important condition which ensures that abuse is curtailed and minimised.</P>
        <P>The habitual residence condition means that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have little or no connection to this country cannot avail of assistance schemes or child benefit.  In particular, a person who has not obtained permission to work here and who does not have the means to be fully self supporting will not satisfy the habitual residence condition.  I have heard of cases where people came here for a few weeks at Christmas or at other holiday periods and attempted to claim social welfare benefits.  That cannot be tolerated.  Anybody who fails to satisfy the habitual residence condition and is suffering financial hardship can apply to the HSE for an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme; such payments are not subject to the habitual residence condition.  Non-nationals with no means of support may be assisted by the reception and integration agency to travel back to their own countries.</P>
        <P>From 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2007, approximately 16,000 claims relating to complex habitual residency condition, HRC, issues affecting returning Irish emigrants were decided on.  Of this, around 1,700 claims, about 10% of the total, were disallowed.  There was some evidence of abuse of child benefit allowances for asylum seekers.  A person still in the asylum process has not yet received permission to reside in Ireland and, therefore, cannot be considered to be resident.  For this reason persons engaged in the asylum seeking process do not qualify for child benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, asked me to seek clarification on a situation con<Col N="1574"/>cerning a person who contacted him and said that on returning from the United States to live in Ireland he could not claim for six months.  I do not believe that is the case but perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise an issue that I tried to raise in the past year, previous to the Minister becoming the incumbent of his high office.  The Minister is a practical man and I do not believe he will disagree with me on this subject, though his answer may be another matter.  I am referring to the issue of a spouse employed by a spouse, which will often happen in accountants&rsquo; offices, veterinary surgeries, dental practices and so on.  This issue relates to people who are genuinely working, not those playing the old soldier, and I support any investigations into this that are deemed necessary.  I refer to those who work a full day, take holidays when they are entitled to them and make pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions.</P>
        <P>It appears that in this situation a person pays, has deductions made and makes contributions under class A stamps.  The person continues to make these contributions and they are accepted by either the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the Department of Finance.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong because this may have changed in the past month.  When these people make early claims for maternity benefit and later claims relating to a contributory old-age pension they are told they are not entitled to do so because stamps accumulated while employed by a spouse are not taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>I can see from the Minister&rsquo;s reaction that he has not dealt with this matter before.  I know him long enough and well enough to understand that if he makes a commitment to deal with this he will do so.  This issue relates to inequality and it is anti-family because it suggests that the smart thing to do before claiming one&rsquo;s pension is to divorce one&rsquo;s partner and then claim the pension.  One could then remarry in the future.  Perhaps some of this should be dealt with under civil partnership.</P>
        <P>I raised this subject as an Adjournment matter with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor a year ago this week.  I was given the impression &mdash; I am sure <Col N="1575"/>the Minister&rsquo;s advisers will confirm this &mdash; that a review was being carried out to identify issues arising from this matter.  This topic was raised previously by farming organisations because farmers&rsquo; wives dealing with book keeping is a growth industry.  People working from home may present a different issue but I agree with the thrust of their argument also.  I am referring to husbands and wives who work full-time in their spouse&rsquo;s accountancy office, dental surgery or doctor&rsquo;s surgery, receive a salary, keep books properly, make proper deductions and claim a contributory pension.  This situation is bad enough but if they were to claim a non-contributory pension the spouse&rsquo;s ordinary income would come into consideration and they probably would not qualify for it.</P>
        <P>This issue discourages pension scheme take-up.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole wrote an article on how few women are covered by pension contributions and the issue I have raised relates to this.  I will not be present for the Minister&rsquo;s reply but I will pay attention to it so I ask him not to let me down by referring to people who may be claiming incorrectly.  I am not speaking for those people; I am only referring to cases where the Department is satisfied that a person has done or is doing the job he or she claims to have done.  There are issues of equality and fairness in this matter.  This is also a family issue because we are trying to encourage people to work from home so this matter should be carefully examined.</P>
        <P>In terms of where this issue should go, I studied the law relating to this area and the constitutional position on equality.  My colleague, Senator Mullen, could interpret the law better than I, a lay person, in this situation.  I referred to <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by J. M. Kelly, a legal bible for the layman, which legal practitioners use as an early textbook but the rest of us still refer to in its various editions after 20 years.  Professor Kelly, Mr. Gerard Hogan and others would share the view that this looks like invidious discrimination.  While there are a variety of entitlements, one could even accumulate the entitlements of both parties in this situation.  I am referring to last year&rsquo;s figures, prior to the Minister&rsquo;s huge salary increase.</P>

	<P>I welcome Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s contribution, which raises an interesting issue, and I am also interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.  </P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s renewed focus in this Bill on removing poverty traps and raising the income levels at which recipients of the lone parent allowance can receive benefits is welcome.  In order to tackle poverty, it is vital that the social welfare system removes disincentives to entering the workforce, so raising the income limit from &euro;400 to &euro;425 is a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The House may remember that in February 2006, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, made a number of proposals in respect of the lone parent allowance.  Among these was an initiative to remove the infamous cohabitation rule, which discouraged lone parents from living with another person.  Such a disincentive means that the lone parent of a child is penalised for living with the other parent of the child.  Discouraging the two parents of a child from living together can hardly be good social policy.  I am on the record in this House as saying that children have better outcomes when raised within a family based on a traditional marriage, an assertion backed by the best social science research over 25 years in the US and UK.  This is not a slur on the thousands of other families, including single parent families, many of whom do a heroic job raising children in difficult circumstances.  I simply aim to repeat what the evidence tells us.  That said, even an arrangement in which the mother and father of a child live together unmarried, where both are in receipt of the lone parent allowance, is better than the situation that still exists, where the presence of the extra parent, usually the father, is actually penalised.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Barnardos, the children&rsquo;s charity, for the past five years has been running an initiative called &ldquo;the Da project&rdquo;, which engages with the fathers of children who attend their centre in Cherry Orchard, encouraging them to become more involved in their children&rsquo;s lives.  At the launch of the evaluation of the project last year, Fergus Finlay, the chief executive of Barnardos, stated that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Recent research shows that greater engagement of fathers in the care and rearing of their children, particularly in the early and pre-teenage years, can result in many social, educational and psychological benefits for children.  These range from better social skills, fewer emotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, better school performance and less chance of getting into trouble with the law.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Recent research from Sweden confirms this; children do better on a range of measures when their father is around.</P>
        <P>Yet two years after the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, announced plans to make the relevant changes to the social welfare code, the cohabitation rule depriving lone parents who live with <Col N="1577"/>another remains in place.  I understand that there are some details of the plans proposed by the former Minister which are opposed by lone parent groups, including the proposal that, were the two people in receipt of the proposed new benefit to live together, they would receive not a full payment each but a combined payment which would be the equivalent of 20% of the full amount.</P>
        <P>I also appreciate that, in these matters, the devil is very much in the details.  Nonetheless, I would ask the Minister to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  The philosophy behind the proposed change is positive and we should not let technical details prevent its implementation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week, it was reported that the National Economic and Social Council proposed a measure to tax child credit for wealthier parents and to put a tax on the child benefit of every third and subsequent child.  It made this proposal on the basis that it believes the current child benefit system is &ldquo;hugely inefficient&rdquo; at tackling poverty, because the same payment is given for every child.  That may be the case but the fact that the same amount is allocated to each and every child might suggest that the sole or even main purpose of the benefit is not to tackle poverty, but to assist parents with children, and remove any possibility of discouraging parents from having children.</P>
        <P>Quite apart from the unedifying spectacle of the Government discouraging parents from having more than two children, the policy rationale behind taxing the child benefit on each third and subsequent child is, to my mind at least, very cloudy.  Ireland faces the prospect of an aging population.  The Pensions Board reckon that we have 20 years to prepare for a situation when the percentage of people at retirement age will rise from 10% to 20%.  This has serious implications for our current pensions system.</P>
        <P>In such a scenario, it hardly makes sense for the Government to encourage parents to have fewer children.  I need not dwell on the social realities which already act as burdens on working families; child care costs, long commutes, high mortgages and a tax individualisation system which almost mandates both parents to enter the workplace.  I hope the Government does not add to this already bad situation by taking up the NESC&rsquo;s policy proposal in this particular area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the passage of the Bill through the House and its prior passage through the D&aacute;il.  It is the third item of automatic legislation that stems from budget 2008, the other two being the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, which takes care of provisions put in place from 1 January onwards.  This legislation will deal with future increases in social welfare expenditure from 1 April onwards.  It confirms that the Government is meeting its commitments in the programme for Government and under the social partnership programme to those in our society who are living without.  I hope these commitments <Col N="1578"/>will be met over the lifetime of the Government, including the increase in the State pension to &euro;300 per week.  On those grounds the Bill is welcome and is a statement of the Government&rsquo;s intent on striking a balance in the area of social provision and in emphasising the importance of social policy in general. </P>
        <P>There are two areas where, of necessity, the Bill is treading on water because of ongoing work.  It had been hoped that the national carers&rsquo; strategy, as indicated in the programme for Government, might have been ready by the end of 2007 and could have helped to inform this Bill.  Due to the administrative constraints of a number of Departments involved, that was not possible.  While it has been established, it is an ongoing process.  There have been a number of meetings of the consultative committee and I am confident that later in the year, in informing the 2009 Bill, we will have those recommendations on which to work.</P>
        <P>There is only a small reference to carers, that is, the welcome increase in the respite care grant.  Everyone in the House would acknowledge the importance of the national carers&rsquo; strategy and in ensuring a range of measures will be in place for next year&rsquo;s Bill which will meet an ongoing commitment that most of us in political life have towards carers.  It is a commitment that values their work, which is of particular relevance to the Irish situation where the existence of people in the home and the community is an opportunity to offer levels and standards of care that cannot exist in State-funded and State-directed systems found in other countries but which, to date, we have not funded or properly acknowledged.  That is one of the issues on which the national carers&rsquo; strategy will come to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>While there are detailed pension provisions in the Bill, much ongoing work is needed.  Consultations on the Green Paper on pensions will come to a conclusion in mid-2008.  Many of us look forward to that because there are important decisions to be made in regard to the balance between a State provision, the encouragement of private pension provision and whether, as in the past, it should be done through tax mechanisms, or whether there are other ways of encouraging people to have a State pension which is adequate, and may be added to in terms of private pension provision.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest the contribution of Senator McFadden who articulated a long-held Green Party position on refundable tax credits.  The Commission on Taxation is due to meet and to report by the end of September 2009.  That in itself will be another contribution towards important debate in this area.</P>
        <P>What we need to do in the whole area of social welfare policy is to get away from talk of the actual amounts of the payments involved and into a more detailed examination of the categorisation of the payments and whether the existence of certain types of payments and their categories are <Col N="1579"/>impediments to people progressing in life.  Welfare traps exist because of the way in which the welfare system is structured.</P>
        <P>It takes a degree of clarity and, that much abused term in political debate, courage, to tackle some of these inconsistencies because to achieve a long-term benefit there might be a short-term disadvantage.  I am aware the Minister and his predecessor have tried to deal with the inconsistencies and contradictions that sometimes arise in trying to bring about change, particularly in the area of payments to lone parents.  That debate has been well informed and has engaged with representative groups of lone parents.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the changes that will eventually come about will recognise the need to acknowledge the income-maintenance needs of families who exist in that situation and the need for people not to be perpetually in situations which become welfare traps.  Given that most lone parents are women with children, the balance we need to achieve is that women are given the opportunity to improve themselves through education and to contribute as needs be to the workforce.  There is also a balance to be struck in terms of meeting child care needs and the role of a stay-at-home parent or a parent who can stay at home as often as possible.  This is the contradiction that most of the studies are trying to bridge.</P>
        <P>In regard to the reforms that might come about in the yeas ahead, I give credit to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the way in which it has improved its customer relations.  That is probably not acknowledged enough.  Down through the years, in periods of unemployment, I recall visiting unemployment exchanges and trying to account for personal welfare needs.  I was struck by the interface that took place, the public relations element and how lacking it was.  We have come a huge distance since then in terms of how information is provided to people and how they are dealt with at a more human level, which many of us would admit did not happen in the past.  This should be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>The type of reforms and balance we need to achieve in terms of customer service is centred on how people access the service.  There has been controversy in the past, and this is ongoing with regard to how information technology can be used best to benefit all in our social welfare system, as well as how it might be at times intimidating for older members of our society.  While I am not sure if it is an area for which we can legislate, I would like some type of acknowledgement from the Minister and the Department as to how this area is being tackled.  If we want to have a welfare system for the 21st century, it must involve our citizens in helping to shape that.  In any case, this has yet to happen.  We are still dealing theoretically with many of the modern ways of producing a social welfare service.  My hope is that this Bill which, as I said, is treading water, <Col N="1580"/>will be a small step towards achieving that type of change.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the Bill and its provisions.  The three major areas in social welfare relate to pensions, lone parents and carers and in that regard the Bill could have addressed many of the anomalies that relate to pension entitlements, particularly for women and retired people with integrated pensions, who will have to wait for another year.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed no steps have been taken to improve the situation facing lone parents.  Decisions need to be made on long-promised reforms of the system of supports for lone parents.  Measures that facilitate the return to work for lone parents must not worsen their situation financially.  The current system traps lone parents in unemployment or underemployment, which can create a barrier to stable relationships.  The rate of poverty for this group is actually rising, as evidenced by recent statistics, and one in three households with consistent poverty were found to be headed by lone parents.</P>
        <P>The cohabitation rule is a major issue.  It should be abolished to allow genuine reform to take place as it makes no sense from either a social or family perspective to keep people apart.  However, as the current rules governing cohabitation would see their welfare payments very significantly reduced, people must take the option of staying apart.</P>
        <P>Child care is a huge issue and because it is so expensive it remains out of reach of many lone parents.  Adequate affordable child care is a must for this disadvantaged group.  Training opportunities are also vital as many are denied opportunities to remain skilled or cannot avail of upskilling or training opportunities for those not previously in the workforce, which is important.  Any reforms of the system should allow lone parents to exercise the option of full-time parenting when children are young without suffering socially or financially.</P>
        <P>Every public representative could relate umpteen cases of constituents who have problems with regard to returning to work.  Two cases that came to my attention and that of my colleagues in recent months illustrate these points well.  One was referred to in a letter I received, which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am a mother of 3, currently receiving lone parents.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Before my breakup, I was a full time employee, working at the highest level of my experience.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In previous years, due to this woman&rsquo;s circumstances, she had been unable to work.  Her youngest child was starting school in September and she decided to take the opportunity to try to get back into the workforce.  The only entitlements she had been receiving were one-parent family allowance, <Col N="1581"/>rental income supplement and she had received medical cards for herself and her children.  She received maintenance from her ex-partner, which was declared, and her entitlements had been means-tested and the necessary deductions<?oasys _jy ?>made.</P>
        <P>She was successful in receiving a CE scheme through F&Aacute;S to work locally.  She took up this employment towards the end of June.  She was earning a wage but she took up the employment with the understanding from F&Aacute;S that CE schemes were structured as a path to reintroduce people back to the workforce while enabling them to keep any entitlements they were receiving.  Unfortunately, that was not the case for this woman.  Her one-parent family allowance has been reduced by &euro;92.50 per week and her rental income supplement has been slashed so that the payments now provide her with only &euro;276 a month towards her rent, which is &euro;1,200 per month.  Before she took up employment, &euro;837 per month was paid towards her rent.  As matters stand, when she added up all the deductions and factored in that she must pay for child care while at work, she would be &euro;84.05 per week better off if she was not working.</P>
        <P>That intolerable situation is a reality for many.  The Minister should have the desire to ensure that people can move from welfare to work.  We all know of real-life cases.  A second letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am an unmarried mother of one.  I am currently living with my partner who is a stay at home father. I wish to query the governments treatment of unmarried parents in this day and age.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My boyfriend applied for social welfare payment a few years ago before our daughter was born.  He was told that due to the fact that he did not have enough contributions the welfare payment he was entitled to would be calculated on a means basis.  He provided all relevant details to the official.  He was told that because he was living with me and I was working, my income would have to be taken into account when assessing his means.  At the end of this process he was told that he was entitled to ... &euro;20 a week.  It is shocking that anyone would be expected to live on this amount.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Under the taxation rules I am not entitled to use any of his tax credits as we are not married.  In addition to this I am not entitled to claim single parent credits as we are living together.  I feel that it is very unfair that we are treated effectively like a married couple for social welfare purposes and as single people for taxation purposes but not single when it comes to claiming single parent credit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an anomaly.  These are real stories, not just stories made up to look good in print.  I do not want to waste the Minister&rsquo;s valuable time but there are many cases I know of from my clinics which demonstrate this point &mdash; I am sure my colleagues know of similar cases.  Parents in this <Col N="1582"/>situation should live together and should not have to suffer financially or socially.  It is difficult to argue with any of the points made in those letters, all of which stand up to scrutiny.</P>
        <P>It is not defensible to have a welfare system that penalises lone parents who decide to go out to work and penalises cohabiting couples for living together and rearing their children.  The incentives and supports, both in terms of welfare and taxation, would seem to be there for such parents to live apart.</P>
        <P>There is an urgent need to reform how the rent supplement scheme works from the points of view of both taxpayers and recipients.  There is a major problem with the inadequate exchange of information between the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  As well as needing assurances that money paid out by State agencies is subject to tax by those who receive it, we should also have assurances that all landlords are registered with the PRTB.</P>

	<P>The way the rent supplement scheme operates has come under criticism from a tax perspective from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We should have amendments calling for rent supplement to be paid directly to the landlord and for landlords to be registered.  There is a ludicrous situation where tenants are required to deduct 20% of rent for tax purposes in the case of non-residential landlords.  The onus for deducting this tax should be put on the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this generous package of measures, which represents nearly half of all additional Government spending in the budget this year and brings spending on social welfare to nearly &euro;17 billion.  That is a long way from where we were ten or 15 years ago.  The Government has again underlined its commitment to improving the position of those less well off in our society.  The Bill introduces a number of key improvements in the area of social welfare, including increases in child benefit, early child care supplement and the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>We are entering a period of below-trend growth in which matters are not as clear as they were a couple of years ago, not just in Ireland but globally.  Our first priority has to be to ensure the vulnerable within our society are protected.  Budget 2008 provided significant resources to allow us to address the needs of those most disadvantaged and a number of these increases are provided for in this Bill.  The approach taken by the Minister in recent years has enabled us as a society to deliver significant improvements for people on low incomes.  This continues to be the best way for us to deliver natural social welfare <Col N="1583"/>enhancements in a sustainable way.  The key to this is sustainability.  We must ensure into the future that whatever measures we introduce work for the people who must access our welfare system.</P>
        <P>In line with this overall approach, the improvements in social welfare benefits and, in particular, child care payments provided for in the 2008 budget amount to an additional &euro;957 million in 2008 and &euro;980 million in a full year.  The Government has increased significantly financial support for children in recent years.  It intends to continue to do so by increasing child benefit and the early child care supplement which has been very successful.  Section 3 provides for these increases.</P>
        <P>The Bill goes some way also towards reforming income support for children to reduce work disincentives by making income support less relevant to the employment status of the parent.  This has been a significant issue, especially for lone parents.  Welfare increases should not act as a barrier or disincentive to any parent who wishes to take up a chance of employment, training or education.  As we are aware, this policy has formed an important part of social partnership agreements.  We must maintain the balance between tackling child poverty and encouraging and assisting families to access education, training and employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>Supporting lone parents is once again a key priority of this legislation.  The increase in the upper earning limits for the one-parent family payment will help those people to access work and training that fits in with their responsibility as parents, which is in the interests of the children as well as the parents.  It also offers the best way out of the very difficult position in which people sometimes find themselves.  I see this daily at advice centres.  I am sure the same is true of Senator Prendergast and others.</P>
        <P>I am told that young parents, especially in inner city areas and predominantly though not exclusively women, have difficulty in accessing any kind of training or employment opportunities solely because they would lose the benefits they have gained as part of the support system for lone parents.  This is a significant worry for young people who find themselves in that position.  The changes made in this legislation will help to tackle this aspect of the matter.  For these measures to work, we need co-operation between a number of agencies and Departments.  I look forward to the results of the pilot projects under way in Coolock in Dublin and Kilkenny, which were mentioned by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Sections 6 and 7 relate to transfers.  For many years, particularly in respect of the Department of Social and Family Affairs but also in other Departments, the issue always arose of whether people were getting their entitlements and if they would be entitled to an increase in the event of a change to a different payment.  Under section 6, a person transferring back to illness benefit from <Col N="1584"/>invalidity pension will be entitled to a full personal rate of illness benefit, assuming he or she has the required number of contributions in the relevant tax year.  Section 7 provides that a person moving from disability allowance to a State pension at age 66 will not receive a lower rate of payment.  Again, the emphasis is put on providing the maximum amount of payment to which a person is entitled.</P>
        <P>There has been much discussion of carers in recent years.  The Government has recognised, and continues to recognise, the significant contribution to society made by carers and this is evident in the increase in carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  The respite care grant was increased last year from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500.  Section 9 further increases it by an additional &euro;200 to &euro;1,700, as announced in the budget.  This measure will benefit approximately 48,200 carers this summer and underpins our commitment under the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>Simply to have a day off or a one or two-week holiday can make a significant difference to people who care for parents or children.  In some cases, this can be a decisive factor at a time when a person has to make a choice to put his or her family member into some kind of supported medical facility or to care for him or her at home.  The respite care grant has proven its worth over the years.  The changes made last year are welcome but we need to examine the manner in which the respite care grant is administered because there are long waiting lists and difficulties in that regard.  In one case I dealt with I was told the person who was entitled to the respite grant would have to go on a waiting list.  Some of the Health Service Executive administrative practices need to be examined.</P>

        <P>The discussion of pensions in recent years has helped to highlight the importance of this area.  This legislation deals with a number of issues in respect of pensions in general.  Part 3 and sections 26 to 31, inclusive, provide for amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 and some consequential amendments to the Family Law Act 1995 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  There has been considerable discussion about pensions and their future administration.  This is an issue that concerns everyone, not just young people.  The last thing on the mind of a young person starting out in his or her career is to start a pension or whether he or she will have one on retirement.  As time goes by, people realise the importance of having a pension.</P><Col N="1585"/>
        <P>There are changes in the Bill in respect of how pension schemes are administered and who administers them.  The proper regulation of trustees and third party administrators is crucial to ensure persons&rsquo; rights to their pension when they reach that stage of their lives.</P>
        <P>Overall, the Bill provides for a number of substantial and very welcome increases in social welfare.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  The budgetary provisions are also welcome but it is important we put them in context.</P>
        <P>In many ways the Minister is in a great position in that he has had a tremendous innings in Government with ten years of prosperity.  The Government has rightly invested in social welfare.  In doing that, however, we have increased the vulnerability of some sections of the population.  The Minister will not agree with me but there is a growing divide between different sections of society.  We have created a new type of poverty for young families in terms of child care, housing costs and the inability of local authorities to meet affordable housing demands or to provide social housing.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald referred to the Health Service Executive and respite care beds.  I tabled a motion on the Adjournment last week on this issue.  We cannot keep blaming the HSE.  It was set up by Government but it is no longer accountable to anyone.  We all have to address this political fault.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the national carers' strategy.  I wish to give every possible enhancement to the role of the carer in society.  Carers play a key role in the community, caring for and putting people first, which is something we all should do.  They are people centred.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to devise a national carers' strategy.  The report on this matter was due a long time ago.  The Minister indicated the report would be available mid-year, which is an ambiguous term.  I respect the Minister and I hope we will have the report of the working group on the national carers' strategy because it is important.  Many people involved in caring believe they will never see a national carers' strategy.  Our party espouses a one-stop-shop approach.  I will not go through all the different measures regarding carers but we need to underpin the work they do.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to discuss a national waiver scheme for people on social welfare who pay a refuse collection charge.  In many cases private operators undercut the price for refuse collection charged by local authorities.  In five or seven years many local authorities will have privatised the collection of municipal waste.  As the Minister is aware, when competition is introduced and the local authority no longer has a role in refuse collection the company with that job can do whatever it wants.</P><Col N="1586"/>
        <P>Senator McFadden was correct to state that poverty remains part of society.  When one looks around any city or town one sees people who are homeless, begging and living in poor conditions.  This is unacceptable.  We are a rich society and the divide between rich and poor, which should not exist, is growing.  The reality of the budget increases for many citizens is that they are gone before they get them owing to increases in the cost of heating, lighting, groceries etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week in the D&aacute;il Deputy Olwyn Enright and today Senator Nicky McFadden revealed that one in nine children lives in consistent poverty.  We must support our families.  We must give the necessary structural support to our young families who travel longer distances, wait longer in traffic, pay inordinate child care costs and are put to the pins of their collars to pay mortgages.  One of the best ways to enhance families is through child care and social welfare.</P>
        <P>What is the aim of the provision of social welfare?  What do we mean to do with it?  Is it to support people, enhance their lives or get them out of poverty?  I sometimes wonder if it benefits those who need it most.  People have become more marginalised.  In all our clinics we meet people under pressure who feel they are not being looked after properly.  Nowhere is this greater than the private rental sector and, within that, the living conditions of some of our citizens.  Last week I visited a bed-sit in Cork city.  As I am in Parliament the strongest words I will use to describe it are &ldquo;absolute squalor&rdquo;.  We force people to live in these primitive, inadequate and horrible conditions.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald spoke on interdepartmental connectivity and the need for co-operation, and she is correct.  I ask the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the HSE and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to work with the Private Residential Tenancies Board to ensure we have proper, effective regulation and accountability in the private rented sector.  Senator Prendergast referred to the level of required payment of rent supplement.  We need to have all landlords registered with the PRTB as a matter of course.  When people get grants for education in vocational education committees, it is a requirement that their landlords be registered.  We must ensure all landlords and tenants are protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In many cases rent must be paid in advance while the Department pays rent allowance in arrears.  This leaves those in receipt of rent allowance at a disadvantage.  They cannot compete on a level playing pitch because landlords will not accept rent in arrears.  We must address this fundamental issue.  A landlord will always choose a tenant who can pay up front rather than somebody who might struggle to make payments.  That puts many tenants, many of them single people and single parents, at an unfair disadvantage.  I ask the Minister to examine that.  The state of rented accommodation must be examined.</P><Col N="1587"/>
        <P>Single men are at a disadvantage in society.  I am not being sexist.  Young single men are discriminated against by social welfare and local authorities in the provision of housing and are being put into any old hovel.  I am sure the Minister can relate to this in his city of Waterford.  If not, I hope he comes to Cork to rectify that.  I have met two or three young men in my clinics in recent weeks, genuine guys, some of whom are down on their luck and perhaps in trouble with alcohol, who want to make amends in their lives and who live in wholly inadequate bed-sits.  We must cater for single men between the ages of 20 and 40 who are being discriminated against and who need to be looked after.</P>
        <P>The increases in the 2008 budget will have a minimal impact on poverty and the growing divide.  I do not mean this in a political way, although the Minister will take it as a political statement.  This Government&rsquo;s legacy will be a growing marginalisation of people in society, which should not occur.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I had not anticipated speaking on this debate but by a curious piece of serendipity this morning I received a letter from an ordinary citizen, not a constituent, and I would like to put it on the record and ask the Minister to examine the queries in it.</P>
        <P>Before I do that, I feel myself very lucky in my pension arrangements because I have a pension from Trinity College.  I anticipate receiving a pension from the Oireachtas and because I have passed the magical 20 years, I have the maximum.  I even managed to extract from the Department information on the stamps I paid before Trinity sold the pass and moved to a different pension scheme and I am entitled to the glorious sum of &euro;114 per month as a result of my stamps.  I am very lucky and am grateful for it.  However a large number of people in this country have no pensions at all.  We need to worry about that.  There should be universal, mandatory, properly funded pensions.  There is a difficulty because of the age profile but we must examine that.</P>
        <P>It would be a good exercise in public information if the Minister could put on the record the social welfare entitlements and take-up of our immigrant and asylum-seeking community.  I say this because I think they are modest, but there is a terrible myth that Irish people are being disenfranchised.  They are getting more than we are, so to speak, and are receiving all these social welfare perks.  It would be a healthy exercise if the facts were made public.  I recently dealt with some people from Mosney and the social welfare benefit they get is pretty small.  No one is going to have a junket on that.  It would be good for Irish people to know the facts.  I am not antagonistic to immigrants or asylum seekers.  Their state is not luxurious in the manner people think.  If there are social welfare fraudsters, they should be <Col N="1588"/>intensively investigated because to take money from the income of the poor is one of the meanest frauds.</P>
        <P>The letter I received is from a gentleman in County Wicklow.  He writes:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Mr. Norris,</P>
        <P LI="1">I am an ordinary person working for the local authority for the past ten years.  We have by law to contribute to the spouses and orphans scheme.  A few years back, one of my workmates&rsquo; wives [I do not think he meant his workmate had a collection of wives; it was not a harem.  He means the wife of one of his workmates.] died suddenly and left him to rear three children.  It appears that he has to die, not the wife, in order to benefit from the scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a real situation that must be examined.  If there is an insurance and social welfare benefit, and if we respect the family, which we are everlastingly being told we do in this House and the Constitution, surely when one partner dies and there has been a scheme we should make provision to include some cushioning for the bereaved partner.  It was much worse years ago because when my father died, my mother received nothing.  If she had died, he would have received a housekeeper allowance.  It was crazy.  Women were not valued at all.</P>
        <P>The man&rsquo;s letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Also, single people are forced to pay into this scheme.  Sir, why? [with a big question mark]  Why should single people be forced to pay for someone else&rsquo;s widows and orphans?</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have no problem paying for other people&rsquo;s widows and orphans schemes but one needs to get something back and be able to participate in at least some of the social welfare benefits.  If single people do, there is an information task there to let people know.</P>
        <P>He goes on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">The scheme does not apply to same-sex couples or cohabiting couples.  I downloaded the Act and studied it carefully, Sir.  It discriminates against all.  Unless you are married the State does not recognise partnerships and the children of partnerships cannot benefit from this scheme.  Predominantly this scheme was set up to help these very same people.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He said he brought it to his union&rsquo;s attention but received no information from it. We will have to look at this area, although I do not know how accurate it is.  Same-sex couples certainly derive no benefit in many cases, something which will have to be examined.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to say that the Government &mdash; I know it was not the Minister &mdash; acted in the most miserable fashion when a case was taken by a same-sex couple against a transport company to derive for the employee&rsquo;s partner those benefits which were given to both married and cohabiting heterosexual couples.  The Equality Tribunal <Col N="1589"/>found in their favour, but when the case went to the Government, instead of operating to address the injustice and the discrimination, it redefined &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; to swindle them out of it.</P>
        <P>We had a debate on this issue last week and some speakers said that if we recognised these relationships, there would be tax implications.  Of course there would be tax implications, but at the moment people like me find that the State&rsquo;s hand is often in our pocket.  We pay taxes and it is not fair to say that we should continue to pay taxes and get nothing back.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the case of a man, who does not appear to be gay and certainly does not say it, whose married workmate seems to have suffered discrimination.  He puts it into a context which we will have to examine.  At the moment, the State is benefiting unjustly from gay people who are statistically higher <i>per capita</i> earners.  I do not think that is fair, although I have no problem in paying for the widows and orphans of my colleagues and my fellow citizens.  That is what life is about.  I believe in the good old communist maxim, &ldquo;From each according to his ability to each according to his needs.&rdquo;  That is the way society should be run.  I do not mind paying for ten extra people to have their teeth done or their spectacles adjusted and so on, but I want to be the 11th.  I do not want to be kept out of the scheme because that makes me feel unequal, even with my three pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators from all sides for their contributions to this debate and for the recognition of the improvements in the social welfare system over recent years.  There is now an emphasis on those who are less well off and we are targeting children, lone parents and those who clearly are in danger of living in poverty.  We use the resources of the State on behalf of the taxpayer to maximise the payments into those areas.  That is what I have tried to do in the social welfare package this year, and more than 50% of the allocation on current spending from the budget went into that package.</P>
        <P>We will get into the different elements of the Bill tomorrow and many issues raised by Senators will be dealt with specifically.  I do not wish to give a short answer to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, but I will try to look at the issue he raised in a more complete manner.  I am not saying what the answer will be, but he will get my full attention to deal with that issue specifically.</P>
        <P>We have looked at the child care package this year to target children in families that are in danger of being in poverty.  More than &euro;190 million is being assigned to this, with money going directly into the monthly child benefit payment and the qualified child increase of &euro;2 for what was the child dependant allowance.  The family income supplement is a very imaginative way of ensuring people who go back to work are not disadvantaged but have their payments enhanced. <Col N="1590"/> The children in those families will gain from this, which is an important element.  The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance benefits 180,000 children.  We are getting to the point where the maximum number of children will benefit from that allowance.  We also increased the early child care supplement to &euro;1,100 per child per annum.  There is clearly a direct correlation between what we have attempted to do in recent years, perhaps with fewer resources this year, and targeting those in need.</P>
        <P>As long as I am in this Department, I intend to maximise these resources for those in danger of poverty rather than using universal payments to resolve everything.  Some of the changes in recent years have demonstrated that where resources are used in a targeted way, the maximum benefits can be obtained by those families.</P>
        <P>Ireland is quite generous in its contributions to child supports.  Let us say there are three children in a family who are entitled to all the income supports, one of whom is under six, another between six and 12 while the third is over 12.  The child payment to that family is now more than &euro;12,000 per annum.  That is a significant amount of money and I am only referring to the portion that goes to the income support per child.  That equates to an income support of more than &euro;77 per week per child, on top of entitlements the parents may have in other income supports.  Twelve thousand euro to such a family is not inconsiderable and would probably rank among the best in Europe.</P>
        <P>Let us take another example of a family with four children, one of whom is under six, two of whom are between six and 12 and the fourth is over 12.  That is not uncommon, particularly in the families whom we are trying to target.  The direct cash payment from the State to such a family is &euro;15,949 per annum, which equates to around &euro;76.68 per week per child.  These are just the targeted resources relating to the children in those families.  The attempt of the State on behalf of all taxpayers is not inconsiderable in its socioeconomic impact.  Using these resources in a targeted way delivers directly to many of these families.</P>
        <P>The rent supplement allowance was referred to and there was much debate on this when we discussed it in the other House.  There will be similar debate tomorrow in this House on Committee, Report and Final Stages.  This is a support to individuals and the payment does not go to landlords or anyone else.  It is an income support to less well-off people at an individual level who need the payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="1591"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate on this issue, there was a suggestion that this was a payment to landlords, but it is not.  In some cases we make a direct payment to the landlord on behalf of a small number of individuals who request it.  That helps the individuals who for different reasons may not be capable of managing the money themselves.</P>
        <P>It is true to say it is a short-term support, but in recent years it has become a much longer-term support than was originally intended.  Following discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the rental accommodation scheme, the objective has been to move people from long-term supports to reduce that scheme to what it was intended to be, namely, a short-term benefit to individuals.  We can get individuals onto local authority schemes and get them housed in a much better way.  That process is under way but it will take time to move such a substantial number of people from the current system to the local authority scheme.</P>
        <P>I also indicated I would review the rent allowance scheme, including payments, ceilings and so forth, by mid-2008.  This review will indicate to the Department what measures should be taken in this area.  This issue will be addressed in tomorrow&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>All speakers referred to lone parents and the cohabitation rules, which I am fully committed to abolishing.  It is far better for children when both parents are involved in their upbringing.  The archaic approach whereby one parent cannot become involved in the upbringing of children without the family losing income is wrong in a modern society.  While views on how to change the current system differ among stakeholders, I am determined to arrive at a position by the end of the year, from which this issue will be addressed in legislative and policy terms.  The best approach by far to removing the threat of poverty and getting people out of poverty is to get them into part-time or full-time employment.</P>
        <P>It is evident from much of the research carried out in this area that many lone parents, particularly younger girls, left school with a poor level of education.  For this reason, educational issues must be addressed before many lone parents can re-enter the workforce.  Many of them need to engage in training to equip them to enter employment.  As Senators noted, the management of child care to facilitate lone parents to return to work must also be addressed.  F&Aacute;S and the various Departments and local agencies engaged in this area must come together to work out the methodology of addressing the issue of lone parents.</P>
        <P>Many speakers referred to the pilot studies in Coolock and Kilkenny which take a holistic approach to facilitating lone parents in returning to work.  One of the interesting facts to emerge from the studies, which are almost complete, is that parents who have voluntarily engaged with <Col N="1592"/>the system have found it to be non-threatening.  The first thing to cross the minds of many people who are invited by the authorities to discuss their position is that they will lose benefits and come under pressure.  This is not the approach being taken.  We are concerned with the needs of lone parents and their children.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the need to provide financial supports, facilitating lone parents to return to the workforce improves their sense of self-worth and the coherence and structure of their families.  They then believe they have a much more positive role in the community than was the case when they were entirely dependent on State supports.  The Department wants to pursue this approach.  I intend to ensure the fundamental disagreements and different perspectives that have emerged among some of the stakeholders in areas such as child support and poverty traps are resolved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although Senators have raised a number of issues requiring further attention, the debate has been largely positive.  I do not deny that improvements and further supports are always necessary to better the lives of individuals and families.  I accept the points made by Senator Norris and note the letter he cited.  As the Senator will accept, gender equality and equality for people in same sex relationships are important issues for the Government which are being worked through with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and a number of Oireachtas joint committees.</P>
        <P>We cannot do everything overnight but any fair assessment of developments in the past decade would show that in parallel with the focus on our great economic achievements, we have also concentrated on socioeconomic issues and the less well-off.  Irrespective of whether one is extremely wealthy, it is in the interests of all citizens to maintain the socioeconomic balance.  If economic success produces a disjointed outcome and widens income gaps, everyone loses &mdash; not only those at the lower end &mdash; because society becomes less coherent and less able to work in a harmonious and successful manner.  For this reason, my predecessors and I and officials in the Department have worked hard to ensure substantial increases in the resources available to address this issue.</P>
        <P>Fifteen or 20 years ago the work of the Department was focused on unemployment.  This year, less than 9% of the Department&rsquo;s budget, which stands at &euro;17 billion, is allocated to measures in the area of unemployment.  This demonstrates substantial policy development in the Department and Government recognition of the fundamental need to substantially increase the resources available to the less well-off.  Developments in the area of pensions are perhaps the best case in point.  Some years ago, when the Government undertook to increase the old age pension payment to &euro;200 per week, doubts were expressed about whether we would achieve this <Col N="1593"/>commitment.  We have surpassed this target within the timeframe we set.  The current target of raising pensions to &euro;300 per week is fundamental and will be achieved.  The targeting of resources to children has also delivered clear benefits.</P>
        <P>This has been a positive and interesting debate in which all sides have shown general support for developments in the area of social welfare.  The Government intends to target and maximise resources to benefit the less well-off who need support to be able to fully participate in society and enhance their lives and those of their children.  This legislation will make a positive contribution towards Government objectives.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann supports the commitment in the Programme for Government to work to bring into being an Electoral Commission.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is a pleasure to move this motion this evening in Green Party Private Members&rsquo; time.  I welcome the fact that an amendment to the motion has not been tabled and take it as a general degree of interest among all the parties in this Chamber in working towards a necessary reform of our political system.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a number of measures designed to reform the political system.  In a previous session in this Chamber we discussed the possibilities of Seanad reform and some weeks from now we will see the first phase of a process of local government reform with the publication of the Green Paper.  The issue of an electoral commission is a third part of that package of reform measures and it is one that is treated emphatically in the programme for Government.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Electoral Reform&rdquo;, the programme for Government states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will establish an independent Electoral Commission to take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight. This Commission will:</P>
        <P LI="2">Implement modern efficient practices for the conduct of elections, becoming a stand<Col N="1594"/>ing Constituency Commission for the revision of constituency boundaries.  We will, in its terms of reference, stress the importance of avoiding, where at all possible, the division of small counties or small parts of counties into separate constituencies.</P>
        <P LI="2">Take charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.</P>
        <P LI="2">Assume the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission in relation to electoral expenditure and examine the issue of financing of the political system.</P>
        <P>The broad range of support for the idea of an electoral commission is based on the fact that it will not only help improve the business of politics in this country but make the nature of elections more efficient.  What we are talking about in a stand alone, independent body is incorporating many of the functions that are dispersed through our current system.  The Minister is here this evening representing the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, having specific responsibility for local government but also for the electoral process itself.  Many of those functions are devolved to local authorities, not only in terms of the electoral register but also in providing the personnel needed to run an election, especially an election count.  The time has come to bring all those functions into one body that will provide a consistency and a cohesiveness that has been lacking to date.</P>
        <P>Electoral commissions operate effectively in other jurisdictions and I hope the Minister, in initiating the process of bringing about this reform and achieving levels of support from other parties in that process, will instigate an all-party process of consultation to ensure that the electoral commission promised in the programme for Government will come into being with the greatest possible levels of support.  I emphasise that because the programme for Government has been often criticised in that events overtake matters and what comes out as a good intention turns into an aspiration and an unachievable goal.  The programme for Government is emphatic in regard to an electoral commission.  It does not state that we will investigate or consider an electoral commission.  It states, &ldquo;We will establish an independent Electoral Commission .....&rdquo; and that must be on the basis of all-party consultation and support.</P>
        <P>There have been difficulties in the past regarding the compilation of the electoral register.  Questions arise about the degree of national co-ordination that exists in compiling that register, the level of effort and willingness each local authority can put into the compilation of its own local register and the consistency that applies throughout the country.  A national body would address many of those concerns.</P>
        <P>A constant situation arises in terms of electoral boundary commissions which are established as <Col N="1595"/>and when censuses are completed.  They have been independent for the past number of decades but they are a separate organisation.  In the remit of an electoral commission we may avoid some of the controversies that occur from time to time.  It has been the practice in the previous electoral boundary commission reports that Ministers for the Environment do not interfere with its recommendations.  They have been instituted, as suggested, and I believe that will be the case again but to put a Minister for the Environment into a situation where he or she has the ability to decide whether the recommendations are right or not is a political pressure that should not exist in the system and one that would be alleviated by the existence of an independent electoral commission.</P>
        <P>We are all familiar with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  It is a body that has improved the public perception of politics and helped those of us involved in political life to better account for ourselves.  It is not dealing with all the areas with which it could deal and is probably not operating to the level of support, in terms of resources, that it needs.  A stand alone electoral commission that would not only absorb the current functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission but enhance those functions would improve the quality of democracy in politics.</P>
        <P>The running of an election in terms of its personnel, the location of the polling stations, the appointment of polling clerks and election count supervisors and deciding who participates in counts are functions that are partly national and partly devolved at a local level.  We must have more consistency in that regard to ensure those areas are properly tackled.</P>
        <P>It is in the last line of the section in the programme for Government on electoral reform on which most public and political debate will be needed.  The programme for Government refers to not only assuming the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission but also examining the financing of the political system, and different political parties have different approaches to that.  The purpose of the motion is not to go solely into that area but I would argue that an independent, stand alone electoral commission will take much of the unnecessary political debate out of that and make it a topic of public interest if it is done by an independent body.  I refer not only to the way money is collected in elections but the way it is spent.</P>
        <P>Many of us believe the current regulations, while they have introduced some measure of fairness into a system that was not always fair, still do not properly account for the nature of expenditure in elections.  After the release of statistics following the 2007 general election, I was portrayed as the third highest spender in my constituency which I know not to be a fact because the regulations account for the three weeks of the <Col N="1596"/>election campaign and not the many months of political activities that take place before that.</P>
        <P>Another aspect which is not taken into account is that, while political benefits for those in public office, in terms of paid political staff, access to Oireachtas facilities and the like, are measured, the money that goes into individual campaigns from people who do not hold public office is not.  Our systems of measurement are unbalanced.  The mechanisms we use are not only unfair to those who take part in the election process but also to those expected to police these systems.  If one speaks informally to those who work with the Standards in Public Office Commission one begins to understand they implement existing legislation to the best of their ability but they are increasingly frustrated that this legislation does not allow them to do the job they could be doing rather than the job they are doing.</P>
        <P>I would like this debate to address how to make the existing system work better.  The programme for Government is clear that the way to do it is through a stand-alone independent electoral commission.  As this will necessitate a consultation process prior to new legislation and the formation of a body, all of us involved in public life have a responsibility to put interim steps in place.  If we have a piecemeal system between national and local government how can we make it work more effectively until we have in place an independent electoral commission?</P>
        <P>I am interested to hear how those in the Opposition benches, who I take it from their failure to table an amendment are largely supportive of what we suggest, make particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested to hear from all sections of the House what proposals they might make in this regard.  It is important to recognise that the need for this exists not only in terms of efficiency.  We need a body such as an independent stand-alone electoral commission to have and restore public confidence in politics.</P>
        <P>I would like to think the Minister is open to suggestions.  The Green Party is open to such suggestions and the programme for Government makes a firm commitment that this will come into being during the life of the Government.  On these grounds, I am happy to move this motion.  I look forward to the ongoing debate and the co-operation needed to bring into being something <Col N="1597"/>which I, my party and the Government believe is a necessary reform of our political system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to the House.  I also welcome this opportunity to discuss the establishment of an independent electoral commission which, as Senator Boyle stated, forms part of the programme for Government.  The Green Party was active in negotiating its place in the programme for Government.  It is important to improve the electoral system because the effect of this would be to increase public support and confidence in the system.  I am happy to second the motion proposed by Senator Boyle.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister has taken action on this commitment so quickly.  The Minister is developing the reputation of being a reforming Minister.  Given his wide brief, he has taken action on a number of key areas contained in the programme for Government although he has only been in office for several months.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a full-time and independent electoral commission is a priority.  It is a challenging and ambitious endeavour because it will involve consolidating much of the existing electoral legislation.  Over the years, many changes have been made to our electoral system in an incremental way.  The aim of establishing an electoral commission will be to consolidate the legislation, make it far more coherent and modernise the system.</P>
        <P>An issue which I hope the electoral commission will address is one which was live before the general election last year, namely, the voter registration system.  This needs to be radically overhauled and for a long time, the Green Party has called for it to be changed.  We believe the way voters are registered should be linked to the PPS system and that people should automatically be registered on the basis of their national insurance numbers.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the debacle which happened several months prior to the general election, when it became obvious that serious inaccuracies in the electoral register had developed over years, bred a certain lack of confidence in the election process itself on the part of the public.  Many people in my constituency of Wicklow contacted me because they were unsure as to whether they were registered to vote.  Some were alarmed because they had been left out of the loop and were not included in the electoral register.  They were concerned they would be deprived of the important opportunity to vote.</P>
        <P>A priority for the electoral commission should be to take responsibility for the voter registration system, overhaul it and establish a rolling electoral register.  For a long time, the Green Party has advocated extending the option of postal voting to all registered voters and to explore the options presented by e-voting.  Increasingly, we find young people in particular find it difficult to <Col N="1598"/>be in a certain place on voting day to cast their votes.  Often, people are disenfranchised because of problems with geographical location.  For this reason, the opportunities presented by e-voting mean we can be more flexible in our approach to allowing people opportunities to participate on election day.</P>
        <P>The electoral commission should also address the decline in voter turnout.  This should be of concern to all political parties because over the past decade or two a trend has appeared whereby fewer voters turn out, not only in general elections but also in local and European elections.  It is in all our interests that we have a thriving democracy and that people participate and feel a sense of ownership over the electoral decisions made.  This can only be done by participating in electing politicians to office.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the trend showing a decline in voter turnout suggests a voter education role for the electoral commission, with a far more vigorous programme particularly targeted at disadvantaged areas to encourage people to vote and see the importance of voting and to teach them what the political system can achieve.  This requires the support of the electorate and voter education should be an important part of the commission&rsquo;s function.</P>
        <P>Election spending is another issue touched on by Senator Boyle.  This is an important issue when we consider some of the major elections in the United States where it appears the availability of large sums of money allows certain candidates to outspend and therefore outdo their rivals.  We would not want to see such a situation arising here where only those political parties which are well bank-rolled could afford to campaign effectively and therefore be in a much better position to achieve good election results.</P>
        <P>It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that we have a fair and level playing field and that election spending is controlled to a certain extent so that we avoid a situation written about by Greg Palast in <i>The Best Democracy Money Can Buy</i>.  I hope we will always have a situation whereby our democracy is not linked to the amount of money a candidate can afford to spend.  Reasonable limits on election spending should be set on all parties and the Green Party has always supported this.</P>
        <P>The electoral commission will take on some of the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I understand these will include not only election spending but also the standards in public office function of the existing commission.  There has been a good deal of concern in recent years about the issue of standards in public office.  Some incidents in the local government decision-making process have caused people to look for tighter scrutiny and accountability, especially in planning decisions which can be, by their very nature, controversial.  It is important there is always a sense that local authority decisions are made for the right reasons and in the public interest.</P><Col N="1599"/>
        <P>The Standards in Public Office Commission has always had an important independent function in investigating standards with Oireachtas Members.  I suggest to the Minister that the proposed electoral commission should have responsibility for ethics standards in local government.  The Planning and Development Act 2000, which deals with ethics in local government, allows local authorities to investigate themselves when complaints are made against them about unethical practices.  This does not conform to any national or international best practice which would not expect a body to investigate complaints made against it.</P>
        <P>Establishing an investigative function such as this in the proposed independent electoral commission would be very much in the public interest.  If a complaint were made about a local authority, the independent and impartial body could investigate it to decide whether it deserved further investigation or was vexatious without any basis.</P>
        <P>Giving this function to the proposed independent electoral commission will instil greater public confidence in local government.  I hope the Minister will ensure the commission has all the powers it needs to ensure the electoral system is improved, modernised and serves the public interest as well as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to the House for the debate on this motion on the establishment of an electoral commission.  He is one of the few senior Ministers who regularly attends the Seanad.  As an Opposition Member, and like many of my colleagues, I appreciate this.  I hope he takes the Opposition&rsquo;s views on the motion on board as it will be of great benefit for democracy.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle was surprised that no amendment to the motion had been tabled.  The proposal for an independent electoral commission was part of Fine Gael&rsquo;s election manifesto and I was pleased the proposal was included in the programme for Government.  Like many other proposals in the programme, the devil is in the detail.  By what criteria will the electoral commission be established?  What resources will be allocated to support it?  A realistic timeframe for the delivery of the commission needs to be put in place.  Its establishment would be welcome to oversee an independent and credible democratic system.</P>
        <P>Electronic voting, to which Senator de B&uacute;rca referred, has garnered much criticism and negative publicity over the past five years.  Perhaps an electoral commission might take the hard decision to abandon the electronic voting machines lying in storage and costing the State much money.  If the Minister made that decision sooner rather than later, he would get much credit.</P><Col N="1600"/>
        <P>I assume the commission would oversee the drawing up of constituency boundaries and local electoral areas.  The demographics of the east coast and regional towns have changed dramatically in the past ten years.  While submissions have been invited for the current review of local authority areas, the review needs to be done quickly.</P>
        <P>Cities, counties and towns should not be divided by obvious geographical boundaries such as mountain ranges because it is not feasible.  D&aacute;il constituency boundaries often overlap with local authority electoral areas which causes much confusion with many constituents, not to mind public representatives.  For example, the Suir electoral area is for Waterford County Council but a quarter of the area falls to the D&aacute;il Tipperary South constituency, creating much confusion on representation.</P>
        <P>The Minister seems in favour of larger local electoral areas.  I am concerned such areas may tip the balance in favour of representatives from large urban areas while representation for outlying rural areas will suffer.  For example, the population of Tramore, County Waterford, has increased dramatically in recent years.  In next year&rsquo;s local election, the town&rsquo;s large population could elect the majority of councillors while the outlying rural areas could be under-represented.  Representation of our large rural population must be taken into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently visited the independent Electoral Office for Northern Ireland, headed by Douglas Bain, from which there are many lessons to be learned.  It carries out much of the work proposed for our electoral commission.  Northern Ireland also has an independent Electoral Commission.  Not to confuse the two, the Electoral Commission deals with the same matters as our Standards in Public Office Commission.  I assume the Minister is proposing an amalgamation of the two functions when establishing the proposed electoral commission.</P>
        <P>The Electoral Office for Northern Ireland administers elections and compiles the electoral register.  It has achieved high levels of efficiency in compiling an accurate electoral register.  It also has responsibility for polling stations and the running of elections.  The key to its success is its independence and its permanent and dedicated staff.  It staff&rsquo;s day-to-day function is to ensure the electoral register is kept updated and to promote the registration of new voters.  A permanent staff can dedicate resources to it, not like the present system in the Republic where local authorities, already stretched for resources, allocate staff in a piecemeal fashion to electoral registration.  That is why we have a disaster of an electoral register.</P>
        <P>It is a disgrace that one year after the 2006 census, many people were disenfranchised for the general election.  This year&rsquo;s annual budget for the electoral office in Northern Ireland is &pound;2.8 million, approximately &euro;3.5 million.  We spent &euro;5 <Col N="1601"/>million before the previous general election trying to update the electoral register and it was still a disgrace.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Lessons can be learned and the tabling of this motion shows the Green Party is genuine in its attempt to address this matter.  Fine Gael will support the Minister as best we can but only when we see the detail.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to the use of personal public service numbers for electoral identification purposes.  Northern Ireland has a system of electoral identity cards which is why there is much accuracy and efficiency with its register.  As these are verified ID cards, they can be used by youths to gain access to pubs and clubs or to buy alcohol, and airline security will accept them.  It is a multi-use card and we should consider its introduction.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is considering this.  With regard to the national insurance number, the health service in the North has a reciprocal arrangement with the electoral office whereby it notifies the office if a person moves from one location to another so that the electoral register is updated.  Much good work is being done in this area.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate.  We have much ground to make up in terms of promoting democracy in Ireland and the electoral commission can play an important independent role in this.  All political parties play their part in promoting democracy, but the electoral commission can play a special role by promoting the independent view and developing ways to generate interest among our youth.  It should work with youth organisations and in conjunction with school civics programmes to encourage a realistic view of engagement with the democratic process.  It is essential for the future of this country that young people take an interest.</P>
        <P>There are some stark statistics in this regard.  In one survey, just over 40% of young adults aged 18 to 19 and only 53% of those aged 20 to 24 indicated they had voted in an election.  Voter participation increases rapidly with age thereafter, reaching a high of almost 90% for those aged 65 to 74.  That tells me that although people take a deeper interest in the democratic process as they get older, we have a major job to convince our young people to engage in this process.</P>
        <P>I welcome the possibility of an electoral commission.  It will have a significant role to play.  Does the Minister have a timeframe for its delivery?  Will it be resourced properly, as is the one in Northern Ireland?  If the Minister ensures it is, there will be considerable benefits for the democratic process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this <Col N="1602"/>important issue and I thank my Green Party colleagues for tabling the motion.  There is a fair degree of consensus in the House on this issue, which is welcome.  I have listened with interest to the contributions of Senators.  It is especially timely that the Seanad should consider this matter now and provide its input as we embark on a programme of significant change in an area of public policy which is key to the well-being of our democratic system.</P>
        <P>The system of electoral administration in Ireland has been built up incrementally over the years in response to particular circumstances.  Some elements of the system, such as the role of the county registrars and sheriffs, have their foundations in traditions going back well into the 19th century and beyond.  Conversely, we also have experience of more modern reforms such as setting up and later legislating for independent commissions charged with drawing up boundaries for D&aacute;il and European constituencies and the oversight of electoral spending and donations by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Other bodies involved in electoral administration include the Referendum Commission, local electoral area boundary committees and local authorities.  We can pride ourselves on an electoral system that enjoys widespread public support and confidence.  However, there is no electoral system or administration of such that cannot be improved.  We are at a stage at which we must reform the system of electoral administration by establishing a full-time and independent electoral commission to take charge of all relevant electoral functions.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government agreed between the Government parties contains a commitment, referred to in the motion before the House, to an electoral commission along these lines which will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices, draw up revised constituency boundaries, take charge of compiling a new rolling national electoral register, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission with regard to election spending, and examine the issue of financing the political system.  A single impartial body with this mandate will achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in electoral management.  It will modernise our electoral system and bring greater professionalism and expertise to its role.  Beyond that, it will enhance transparency and, ultimately, generate greater confidence in public life.</P>
        <P>The advantages to be gained from an electoral commission are plain to see.  Indeed, the idea is not a new one.  The establishment of such a body was, for example, a key recommendation in the First Progress Report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, published in 1997.  In 2006, the Commission on Electronic Voting recom<Col N="1603"/>mended an independent commission on electronic voting, in keeping with best international practice, which would have responsibility for relevant aspects of electoral administration and oversight.  In 2007, the Taskforce on Active Citizenship recommended the creation of an independent electoral commission to encourage everyone who is eligible to register and vote in elections, to support voter education programmes and to provide data, research and analysis on political engagement and awareness.  Senator Coffey referred to this in his contribution, and I will return to the questions he addressed to me.</P>
        <P>If the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of establishing an electoral commission is well founded, and I have no doubt it is, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; is perhaps more challenging.  This reform project spans the entire electoral agenda and is clearly the most far-reaching and ambitious reform measure affecting electoral administration in Ireland since the foundation of the State.  The establishment of an electoral commission will be a major body of work.  Issues arising for consideration will include international best practice, the commission&rsquo;s structure and functions, to whom it reports, its relationship with other bodies in this area, and the approach to be followed with regard to the extensive legislation that will be required.  Internationally, there are different models of electoral commissions, ranging from a single commissioner with a number of deputies to a board of commissioners.  These will need to be examined in detail.</P>
        <P>The scope of the planned commission relates to the duties and responsibilities of the constituency and local boundary commissions, the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referendum Commission.  It also will have responsibilities with regard to returning officers, local authorities and the Registrar of Political Parties, as well as my Department and the Department of Finance.  The wider issue of voter education and awareness also will need to be considered.</P>
        <P>In taking forward the work, consideration will need to be given to consolidating the existing electoral legislation.  There are 25 separate Acts in seven codes dealing directly and solely with electoral matters.  These electoral Acts are a very complex set of interrelated statutes and the functions of a new commission would probably affect all of them.  There is also extensive secondary legislation as well as EU directives required to be given effect in Irish electoral law and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta elections, for which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is responsible.  In considering the right approach to the extensive primary legislation required, it may be appropriate to consolidate the electoral legislation into a single body and within that, where <Col N="1604"/>necessary, to reassign electoral responsibilities from existing bodies to the commission.</P>
        <P>As a first input to this work, a procurement process is under way in my Department to commission a preliminary scoping study on the issues involved in an electoral commission project.  I expect to be in a position to appoint a person to undertake the study shortly.  Those invited to tender have been advised that the key elements to be included are as follows: an overview of the present arrangements for electoral administration in Ireland; an examination of relevant models of electoral commissions in other countries, taking account of relevant international research; identification, assessment and ranking of options for an electoral commission, including possible structure, functions and relationships with other bodies involved in electoral policy and administration; and recommendations for approaching the modernisation and consolidation of legislation in the context of the establishment of an electoral commission and the phasing of its introduction.  As I stated in the reply to a recent parliamentary question, we also need to address the matter of political funding, which was raised in the Seanad by my colleague Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca.  I expect this work to be under way by the end of March and to be completed within an eight-week period.  I refer here to the scoping document and not to the legislation required because, as Senators will appreciate, there is considerable work involved.</P>
        <P>The establishment of an electoral commission is not a quick-fix solution.  It is, however, the right one.  It will require significant commitment and political co-operation to bring it to fruition.  Despite the challenges, I believe there is a real need for an ambitious programme of electoral modernisation and reform centred on an independent electoral commission.  I assure the House that I accept fully the need to build maximum political consensus in this area if real progress is to be achieved and I welcome the input of Senators today in this regard.  I look forward to engaging with all parties and interests as we further this vital work and I am pleased we have consensus on this.  I would like to address some of the issues raised.  The suggestions and proposals put forward are positive and constructive, and I am open to them as we progress the work.  There is a possibility for widespread consultation given the initial scoping document.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised a number of issues and if I omit any of them I hope he will come back to me.  On the question of the size of constituencies, I favour larger ones.  There is a good reason for this.  Under the Constitution, constituencies are allowed contain up to seven seats for general elections.  We have not had many seven seat constituencies because the terms of reference given to previous boundary commissions excluded the <Col N="1605"/>possibility.  This constrained their work to a significant degree.  It meant we received reports from those bodies that many deputies find unpalatable.  I have received such complaints.  It would be far better to have a broad range of larger constituencies because that is more in the spirit of proportional representation.  Also, if we examine the size of constituencies in other countries where proportional representation operates, we see there are no three seat constituencies.  We now have a preponderance of such constituencies in this country for general elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the terms of reference for the local elections it is suggested that, in exceptional circumstances, three seat constituencies can be created.  Otherwise, constituencies should have between four and seven seats.  That is the best way forward for both local and general elections.</P>
        <P>Senators know how this operates too, and that we now have a committee dealing with urban and rural areas.  The terms of reference are basically the same.  I do not see a pattern of under-representation for rural areas emerging from that process.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will address some of the other issues raised by the Senator.  Part of the idea is that the commission would deal with all matters relating to elections.  I hope we can learn lessons from Northern Ireland and other countries.  It should be possible to get an accurate electoral register.  The commission can do this job.</P>
        <P>As a serving Deputy I am aware there is an inconsistency now between the various local authorities and how they collect and present the data.  Some of them do not properly record data on computer.  Most deputies would like to get the information in a consolidated form to use it for their own records.  An electoral commission would be of invaluable benefit to deputies and to the wider public.  As other Senators wish to contribute I will take further questions at the end of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is one of the few senior Ministers who comes to the House and appears to listen, which is novel and nice to see.</P>
        <P>Most political parties should not have a major issue with this.  It is something for which my party has a track record in terms of the legislation introduced by the former Minister, Deputy <Col N="1606"/>Brendan Howlin.  Much of it still stands and provides the basis for election spending rules and the way in which elections are conducted.  I wish the Minister well in this.  I hope it will bring some form of consolidation of legislation and also modernise it.</P>
        <P>Voter participation is an area that must be dealt with by whatever commission is set up.  I will not go into detail but the Senators will know what is meant.  The programme of reform intended to address this has diminished over the past years.  It needs to be accelerated.</P>
        <P>I have looked at the commitment regarding an electoral commission in the programme for Government.  The Minister mentioned a standing commission to deal with elections, electoral reform and constituency boundaries, etc.  More detail is needed.  Senator Boyle provided some clarification but more is needed, including clarification on what is meant by a standing commission, how it would operate, etc.  There will be concern if that much is not known in advance.  We have an independent constituency commission so I would like to know more about the proposed role of a standing commission.</P>
        <P>I accept that it would be preferable if counties, particularly smaller ones, were not divided.  It is ridiculous that small areas are taken from some counties that then have no necessary correlation with the parent constituency.  In many areas across the country there are constituencies which are trans-county and trans-local authority.  Following the implementation of the recommendations of the most recent boundary commission report in my own area, I will be dealing with three different local authorities, North Tipperary, South Tipperary and Offaly.  In addition, I will possibly be dealing with four urban areas, Templemore, Thurles, Nenagh &mdash; with which I already have dealings &mdash; and, eventually, a small part of Birr because of its connection with south Offaly.  Senators can imagine my concern.  Such situations should be avoided, although that may not be possible in all instances.  I have spoken to the county managers who also have similar concerns.  Administrators and members of the public will be affected.</P>
        <P>I would encourage the commission or any such body to take into consideration the pronouncements by the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, who made recommendations regarding the use of preliminary census figures.  In such cases there would not then be a scenario such as there is in Dublin West.  Mr. Justice Clarke&rsquo;s strong recommendation should be taken on board.</P>
        <P>Unlike Senator Coffey, I welcome the proposal regarding local elections and the three seat constituencies.  I agree with the Minister on this point.  From a PR point of view, the more we can press for what the Minister has proposed &mdash; a mix <Col N="1607"/>of four and five seat constituencies with the optimum constituency size in most cases being five seats &mdash; the better.  Six seat constituencies could be looked at from a national point of view.  There is merit in that proposal.  It does not have to apply to rural areas but could be used in certain circumstances where other criteria do not allow common geographic layers to bind.  For example, in Limerick East, 14,000 voters were transferred to Kerry North, an anomaly that one hopes the proposed commission could help avoid.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party made a submission last year stating that a fundamental requirement for the constituency commission must be to protect the element of proportionality, to ensure the closest possible correlation between the share of the votes a party gets and the number of seats it secures.  Statistics provided to the commission by my party clearly show that larger constituencies provide a greater degree of proportionality.  In that case, six seat constituencies would be welcome.  Unfortunately this was not taken into account.  In Kerry South, for which I have a deep love, the franchise and proportional representation will now be called into question because it will only have two seats in the next election.  That is a genuine concern.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes the law should be changed to allow for a two stage process to the finalisation of future reports.  If the commission is not in place, we believe that initial submissions should be made and a preliminary report produced.  Any commission in place should not have to automatically act on further submissions but it should take them on board.  It would be a two step process, and any major concerns which build up a head of steam could be aired.  People would be happy that they were aired, even if they were not taken on board.  A number of Members of this House have expressed concerns about Limerick, Kerry, Leitrim and so forth and that would be a way of airing those concerns.</P>
        <P>I will not delve into the ridiculous nature of the electronic voting issue other than agree with Senator Coffey that the Minister would get credit for acknowledging that it has not worked and getting rid of the machines.  I laughed when somebody appearing before one of the Oireachtas committees congratulated the Department on the machines only costing &euro;500,000 per year.  It was down from &euro;750,000.  We need an electronic voting mechanism but we do not need an electronic counting mechanism.  We could have one but we must also have a verifiable way of doing it.  I am not convinced that anything else is required.  I do not believe in IT gimmicks.  There must be a consistent approach to how elections are managed across the country.  There are issues with how some local authorities do things and with the people who work for local authorities working at <Col N="1608"/>election counts and so forth.  There is inconsistency in how matters are dealt with and that is not proper.  I do not wish to take the route taken in the US, which is worrying to say the least.</P>
        <P>We must ensure the electoral register is accurate, can prevent fraud and is simple to use when people are trying to register.  I agree with the Green Party that PPS numbers should be used.  It has been successful in Northern Ireland.  It is accurate.  The PPS number is what a database analyst would call a unique key identifier.  It travels with the person wherever they go.  Use of the PPS number would limit concerns about fraud, nature of use and so forth.  As the winner of the national e-Government award two years ago, I am still not convinced about e-voting and voting on-line.  My knowledge of the subject leads me to believe it is open to fraud.  Postal voting should and could be used more extensively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister will support the Bill on local election spending, sponsored by my colleague, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  Everybody has concerns about this subject.  Although provision was made in the 1997 Act introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, relating to local authority electoral spending, it was never implemented and in 1999, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government got rid of it.  I hope the Minister will change this and accept Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s legislation or implement such a measure as soon as possible.  If one can spend as much as one wishes in a local election, one does not know where it could lead.  It could bring one into the Seanad.  It is amazing what can happen if one can get onto a local authority in the first place.  The amount of money that is spent sometimes is worrying.  A number of Members have expressed their concerns about this in the past.  I believe local authorities and local representatives should be brought under the remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
        <P>Specific concern has been expressed by the Standards in Public Office Commission &mdash; this should be brought to the attention of the electoral commission &mdash; that if it or people working for a future commission repeatedly make strong recommendations, they should be taken on board and implemented.  The Standards in Public Office Commission has made certain recommendations regarding the provision of inquiry officers, where a complaint has not been made about a public representative.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Finance should take this recommendation on board and implement it.  If there were an independent commission in place, it could take care of it.  It is a concern, however, that this has not happened to date.</P>
        <P>I welcome this proposal although we must wait for the legislation.  The timeframe of eight weeks <Col N="1609"/>is good, if ambitious.  I wish the Minister well with it.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre&rdquo; is an old adage in the Irish language and we have made a good start here today by accepting this motion without amendment.  It is a victory for common sense and a recognition by all sides of the House that something must be done in this area.  I compliment my colleagues, Senator Boyle and Senator de B&uacute;rca, for putting down the motion.</P>
        <P>Unquestionably, something must be done with the electoral system.  To a certain extent successive Governments have indulged in self delusion over the years with regard to the electoral register.  The register has not worked, is not working and, if the current process continues unchanged, it will continue not to work.  There is recognition by all sides of the House that proactive measures must be taken by the Minister, as outlined in the programme for Government, and that there must be a common approach to resolving the difficulties.  The fact that there are 25 Acts in seven codes dealing directly or solely with electoral matters is evidence that we must consolidate our approach to this problem.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the use of PPS numbers.  That proposal was made in Northern Ireland, as Senator Coffey mentioned, and it appears to be working there.  In a few months I will be 29 years in public life as an elected representative in local authorities and the Seanad.  After every election there is controversy on all sides of the political spectrum about the register of electors.  Nothing seems to work.  Throwing money at the current system is like throwing water into the sea.  It is not working so we must go back to the drawing board.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to consider making electoral registration compulsory.  In my experience, people deliberately opted not to be included in the register.  Generally it was for spurious reasons that would not stand up to scrutiny.  Members of the House will be able to conjure reasons for people not wishing to go on the electoral register.  I am not sure the tax man would be in any doubt about them.  We must also examine the role of local elected representatives.  Members have made points about local and national constituencies and my colleague, Senator Ellis, will wish to comment on the breaching of county boundaries and the division of counties.  I agree with the opposition to such divisions.  We are a Celtic race and, as such, we are resistant to change.  If we put in a system today and left it in place for 30 years, it would be resisted all the way to hell and back on its inception but after 30 years we could not try to change it, because that would be resisted to hell and back too.  We are a funny race in that regard.</P><Col N="1610"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Voter apathy was raised by Senator Coffey and he is absolutely right.  There are large urban electoral areas with very low turnouts.  I know of one county borough where the turnout, if my memory serves me correctly, was in the late 20s.  That is an outrageous scandal.  Good men and women fought hard and gave up their lives for democracy in this country.  To see that thrown away in the manner in which it is by people not bothering their heads to turn out &mdash; with only 28%, or 30% or even 40% voting in some areas &mdash; is an insult to the whole concept of the electoral system.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P Just="Left">I do not know if the Minister is aware that we have a junior county council in Westmeath.  It is a marvellous idea and compliments the teaching of civics in our schools.  We should put a spotlight on the teaching of civics because it is very important.  If the installation of a junior county council is not practised in other local authorities, I ask the Minister to ensure it is done so in the future.  It is very important and is working very well in County Westmeath.  I do not see why it could not work elsewhere.</P>
        <P>If we are to improve our electoral system it can be done only by mature, measured and meaningful proposals.  In that context, I compliment the Members on the other side of the House, who did not table an amendment to this motion.  There is a clear recognition by all sides of this House that in terms of electoral reform, the register of electors and other areas, we have a problem.  The only way we will solve that problem is to work together, with a meeting of minds and a mature approach to the issue.  This debate is a victory for common sense.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer briefly to the issue of boundary extensions.  As a former long-standing local authority representative, until the abolition of the dual mandate, which I supported fully, I believe we must have a more sensible approach to the issue of boundary extensions.  During my first term as chairman of Westmeath County Council in 1988-89 Athlone Urban District Council, as it was known then, made an application for a boundary extension.  The issue dragged on for donkey&rsquo;s years.  We must get by an impasse like that.  I am sure that scenario is replicated all over the country.  There must be a more proactive and speedy way of dealing with such applications.</P>
        <P>With regard to election spending, I ask the Minister to examine an issue which does not really apply to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, but to local authorities.  We must recognise that membership of local authorities, county councils, county borough councils and large urban district councils such as Bray, Tralee, Dundalk and so on, as well as the five borough councils of Kilkenny, Sligo, Clonmel, Wexford and Drogheda is a full-time job.  I am speaking here as someone who was nominated to this House and was a member of two local authorities.  It is a full-time job.  I ask <Col N="1611"/>the Minister to closely examine how people who are in employment can also serve as public representatives.  At the moment, on Westmeath County Council, approximately 12 or 13 members out of 23 are devoting all of their time to their council work.  This may not be pertinent to today&rsquo;s discussion but it is something that must be tackled.  The Minister has proven in his short term in office that he is prepared to grapple with such problems, take them by the scruff of the neck and shake the dead wood off them.  Something must be done in this area.  I wish the Minister well.  He has set himself a timescale of some eight weeks in terms of bringing forward proposals.  Is that correct?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome this motion and compliment my Green Party colleagues on tabling it.  I found everything the Minister said encouraging and refreshing and fully endorse it, as does my party, as Senator Coffey has already said.  I agree with the views expressed by Senators Boyle, de B&uacute;rca, Coffey, Kelly and Glynn.  </P>
        <P>The establishment of an independent electoral commission with responsibility for electoral administration and oversight is a basic <i>sine qua non</i> in any top-flight democracy, which we proclaim ourselves to be.  The commission will include a standing constituency commission for the revision of boundaries and there is obvious and eminent sense attached to that proposal.  The programme for Government refers to avoiding, where at all possible, the division of small counties or small parts of counties into separate constituencies.  In that context, I was going to refer to Leitrim, but my erstwhile colleague, Senator Glynn, is smiling and I have no doubt that whatever I might say on the matter, he would more than adequately cover the subject.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the commission would take charge of a new, national rolling electoral register, which is also essential because quite frankly, as several speakers have already indicated, the register was, and still is, in absolute rag order in many areas.  I agree with the proposal made by Senators opposite that we should use PPS numbers.  Senator Glynn had some interesting comments on why people might wish not to be included on the electoral register.  He is probably correct.  He might know more about it than I do but I have no doubt he speaks the truth in that regard.</P><Col N="1612"/>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government refers to an examination of the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission regarding electoral expenditure and the issue of the financing of the political system.  Senator de B&uacute;rca raised the issue of responsibility.  We all await, with bated breath, the judgment in the famous case, de B&uacute;rca vs. Whittle, whenever it will be reached.  The Minister referred to local authorities in this regard and they should be included, for all the obvious reasons, including ethics and transparency.  A person should not be allowed to have any hand, act or part in investigating himself or herself on foot of complaints.  That has absolute, inherent conflict built in.  I endorse what was said in that regard.  It appears the Minister intends to include local authorities in the electoral commission and the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission will come into play there.</P>
        <P>I am reminded that there is no such thing as a free lunch.  It is a natural trait.  We all suffer the effects of original sin.  People who might want to fund candidates might expect a reward.  If they are handing over big bucks, they may expect a return on that investment.  My experience in the business world is that this is natural.  If one makes an outlay in terms of expenditure or investment, one expects a return.</P>
        <P>Electronic voting machines should also be included in this.  I agree with some of the previous speakers, it is time to sell the machines.  The Commission on Electronic Voting was set up but I believe these machines are not suited to the Irish character and I do not think they will ever be acceptable without a verifiable paper trail.  I do not know whether the machines are capable of being modified to allow for such a provision; perhaps somebody is still studying them but they are costing a fortune to store.  Perhaps an emerging democratic African state could use the machines; there must be people somewhere in the world interested in them.  I hope somebody is trying to sell them so we can cut our losses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We mentioned local authorities and I understand the Minister said that responsibility for them will come within the ambit of this.  The Minister has appointed electoral area boundary committees and I see no harm in this matter being part of the responsibility of the commission.  There is nothing wrong with the committees or the eminent people he has appointed to them.  I believe the committees share a common chairman in an eminent former Secretary General of the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One term of reference refers to a need to respect constituency boundaries and another specifies that the number of seats in a constituency will be between four and seven.  In some exceptional circumstances a three seat constituency could be allowed.  Which constituency boundaries are to be respected?  There is no elec<Col N="1613"/>toral Bill to give legislative effect to the findings of the constituency commission.  My colleague, Senator Ellis, is smiling behind Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s back and I suspect he is thinking of Leitrim in this regard.  I agree with the Senator regarding Leitrim as I thought the manner in which it was divided was unfair.  How was it not possible for Leitrim to either exist on its own as a constituency or to stay fully joined with Sligo?  It has been split in two.  I will leave this matter to Senator Ellis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps in his response the Minister can clarify whether the intended boundaries will be respected rather than the ones in which the last general election was fought.  We all tend to think of our own localities and in Kerry the large town and hinterland of Castleisland and the townland of Cordal are to join the constituency of Kerry South, which is greatly welcomed by the Members from the area.  However, does this mean Castleisland and Cordal will come into the Killarney electoral area, which is currently a six seat area?  It could be expanded to become a seven seat area &mdash; it would have to &mdash; but it would still be too large so some parts would have to be hived off, perhaps to the Killorglin electoral area.  How would this impact on Dingle, a three seat area and, as a peninsula, a natural area?  It stretches a little outside the peninsula to ensure it is big enough to warrant three seats.  I would like to hear the Minister respond on the matter of three seat and seven seat constituencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister was interesting and refreshing and he spoke of the possibility of seven seat constituencies; apparently this is provided for constitutionally but has been limited by the terms of reference in the past.  I look forward to this and accept the Minister's contention that it would be more in the spirit of proportional representation.  There is consensus in the House but perhaps not on this matter.  That is what I meant earlier when it was pointed out that there is no amendment proposed for this motion.  There is no amendment because we heartily concur with it; perhaps the opposition is behind the backs of the Green Party Members of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I may welcome this motion more than any other Member of this House because I have often raised this matter on the Order of Business.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, and understand that the Minister left the House with good reason.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement of intent regarding the electoral system.</P>
        <P>I have a great bone of contention with the electoral boundary commission and the changes it has made.  The commission sought submissions from the public and 75% of submissions sought Leitrim to be included in a constituency as an entire <Col N="1614"/>county.  The commission seems to have been entirely opposed to the submissions it received and, to add insult to injury, it has refused a freedom of information request seeking the basis for its findings.  It is wrong that a commission does not have to make available the documentation it consulted in taking a decision.  The Minister is well aware that he must reply to FOI requests but, because a commission ends on the day it makes its report, I am told we will not receive an explanation for the decisions made.  This is despite the fact that all of the documentation is still in the possession of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  To add insult to injury, the officer who first refused the request was part of the commission&rsquo;s secretariat and this is totally wrong.  I have written to the Ombudsman to see if anything can be done but I doubt it can.</P>
        <P>An electoral commission with the independence and capabilities to deal with all electoral matters, including local government, Seanad, D&aacute;il and presidential elections and referenda, is a great idea.  At present elections are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There is a great deal of legislation deriving from various Acts that spread across many Departments and I believe it is time this became the responsibility of a single Department.</P>
        <P>I also believe it is time to examine how constituencies are decided on.  Senator Coffey said that county boundaries should be sacrosanct but it would take a constitutional amendment to achieve this.  At the moment every challenge that comes before the courts relating to representation changes the field on what is tolerated as acceptable regarding constituency boundaries.  This was part of the problem facing the members of the boundary commission; they claim their hands were tied and that the bind was strengthened by the judgment on the case last year involving Deputy Finian McGrath and former Deputy Catherine Murphy.</P>
        <P>This House and the public must decide whether we want to widen the tolerance of what is acceptable.  We must decide on whether we wish to increase the membership of the D&aacute;il, because doing so is the only way this can be achieved.  The alternative is to face the continual court challenges that have gone on for some years.</P>
        <P>It is only fair that I should deal with my own county.  I remember when Leitrim was divided between three constituencies: Donegal South-West, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon-Leitrim.  It was that way for over 20 years until the 1981 election, when Leitrim was a single unit for the first time since the 1950s.  This shows the type of representation the county has received, though I do not mean this as any reflection on the people who represented the county then or who represent it <Col N="1615"/>now.  Leitrim has no Deputy in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann due to the gerrymandering it has experienced at the hands of the last two boundary commissions.  The last one has guaranteed that nobody can be elected from the county to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In the Leitrim end of the old Roscommon-South Leitrim constituency, which was the one I fought on the last occasion, every vote cast was only 80% of a quota.  That is an indication that people there feel they are being duped and that they can never have anybody to represent them.  The new changes will mean it is nearly impossible to have anybody elected because of the division of the county into two greater parts.  How do we explain to the people in Leitrim that they will never have a Deputy for the foreseeable future?  Senator Coffey mentioned that parts of Waterford used to be in and out of Tipperary but I do not know what is the present position.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the recommendations of the new boundary commission report may be legislated for the next general election.  Part of Offaly goes into Tipperary; west Limerick goes into Kerry; the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, is divided in two at Main Street in Swords.  The constituency of Dublin North had been a natural accepted geographic area for many years.  These are the issues that have to be discussed if anything is to be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An all-party committee of the House should be set up and given the same powers as any of the Oireachtas committees and asked to report within six months on the best way of ensuring people are represented.  We all know about county loyalties.  One has only to go to a Munster final, a Connaught final or any other GAA final to discover how strong are county boundaries.  The River Shannon is a boundary for much of my county.  Cortubber is just across the bridge in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Roscommon.  If Roscommon is playing, the blue and saffron flags are displayed at Gings at the bridge and the green and gold flags are displayed at the other side of the bridge.  County loyalties will always remain.</P>
        <P>If something is to be done about county boundaries a root and branch approach will be required and it will need all-party consensus.  Having listened to Senators Coffey and Kelly that consensus exists and having discussed the matter with people across the political spectrum, it is clear that people want county boundaries brought back and used as the marker for constituencies.  There is a further reason for this in that many county operations, local authorities, health board regions, tourism boards and so on operate on a county boundary basis.  It is time we decided to give it the respect it needs by ensuring that constituency boundaries are county based.  It means there may have to be give and take in regard to the number of D&aacute;il Members but I do not think <Col N="1616"/>anybody has a problem with that.  The one thing the public want is representation and as near as possible to them.</P>
        <P>Given the changes taking place in the population base, rural areas will be left without representation.  One that is coming down the tracks is Mayo which will soon be a four seat constituency if the population of the east coast continues to grow.  One can imagine what it is like trying to run a four seater constituency of the size of County Mayo.</P>
        <P>At its last revision, if the boundary commission had not decided to protect two three seat constituencies between Kerry and Limerick, it would have meant that Leitrim would have been an entire constituency.  Submissions were made to the boundary commission.  It galls me that the report went against every proposal submitted by the public not only in Leitrim but throughout the country.   Perhaps it is time this and the other House decided to set up an Oireachtas committee to deal with this issue and ensure legislation is introduced at the earliest possible date.  It will not be ready for the Bill the Minister has proposed but it should be introduced to ensure that at the next general election, even if it means having a referendum, county boundaries become sacrosanct with regard to the electoral system.</P>

	<P>Curim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Sargent.  I compliment my Fine Gael Party colleague, Senator Coffey, on his fine speech on this motion.  To enlighten Senator Boyle, the reason there is no amendment is that it is Fine Gael Party policy to support the electoral commission.  If we are serious about reform of the political system let us not have a fudge, as we had from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  </P>
        <P>Given that the local elections take place in 2009, why wait until after 2009 to introduce reform that we all agree is necessary?  At present there is no spending limit on local elections.  Let us have real reform.  There will be no opposition from this side of the House.  I suggest the reform be introduced now and used in the local elections of 2009 as the experiment of the electoral commission to be fine-tuned and tweaked for subsequent elections.</P>
        <P>At present we have cheque book politics in Irish society.  We have tokenism in regard to spending at elections.  It is a farce.  Members opposite are participating in a sham.  Spending limits come into force once the Taoiseach dissolves the D&aacute;il and for the three week period of an election campaign there is accountability.

I also want to see Irish politics clean.  The way to do it is to bring the electoral commission into being and have accountability.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey referred to the electoral register.  We should implement his suggestions although I do not necessarily agree with the concept of forcing people to register.  We are a democracy but I am willing to go along with new measures.  If the PPS system works or if people are forced to sign up to the register and fined for failure to do so, let it be because we need to enhance people&rsquo;s co-operation.  One way that can be done is by not having electronic voting.  There is nothing better than having a count with the peann luaidhe and the pen.  Last night we watched MSNBC until 7 a.m. There was a core computer printer and a code analyst but not the cut and thrust of the count.  We have all been there: one is on the verge of winning or losing, and a vote shifts here or there, but there is <Col N="1618"/>accountability.  There is no greater buzz than that of election count day, whether one is winning or losing.  We have all had the good and bad days.</P>
        <P>I was amazed that so many Acts are involved in this process &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Gormley, stated there are perhaps 27.  Let us have an electoral commission.  Let us have one body that runs the whole operation.  However, I do not want us to throw out the baby with the bath water.  There are many local government officials who have been involved in elections and have done a great job in the counting of votes.  I thought one of the best ideas was to get rid of canvassing on polling day and stop people giving out literature outside the gates of polling stations.  I did this since I was a child but I thought it was the greatest waste of time.</P>

I hope we will not do that.</P>
        <P>It makes no sense that Leitrim is divided into so many different parts.  It should be part of a constituency where it has a chance of having a D&aacute;il representative elected, such as it had with the former constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  Mr. Gerry Reynolds of Fine Gael was a great Deputy but his chance was taken away.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, is present in the House.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Department should consider introducing spending limits for the period between elections.  The situation at present is crazy, given that people can frontload spending in the months before an election and spend thousands if not hundreds of thousands of <Col N="1619"/>euro.  It is not a level playing field.  If we want to enhance democracy, let us have a level playing field where the ordinary person can participate.  I would like the Minister of State to bring the following message to the Minister.  Let us introduce spending limits for the period between elections as part of the work of the commission because it is badly needed.  The situation at present is a joke because the system can be abused and there is no accountability.  We need to have traceability for the period between elections.</P>

Unfortunately, as we did not have the adjustments and reforms, it was our own citizens and democracy that suffered as a result.  However, I agree with the proposal that there be an independent commission to review constituency make-up and boundaries, and to deal with all of the legislative change which is needed given the ethics and standards in public office legislation.</P>
        <P>This is especially apt in light of the shortcomings of the constituency commission report last October, which failed to seriously examine the changing demographics of this State.  Given that the demographic trend is all in one direction, we need to take this on board.  The commission also did not address the problems created as a result of breaking county boundaries, to which Senators referred.  Its work amounted to minor cosmetic changes, some of which cut across traditional county boundaries and will require further revision and adjustment within a few years.  Serious concern has been raised in County Leitrim, where an atrocious decision has left it without a Deputy.  The commission appeared to ignore the much more radical approach that was required and did not admit that the earlier decision to divide Leitrim between two new constituencies was a mistake.</P>
        <P>An independent electoral commission might look more seriously at the proposition that there are too many three and four seat constituencies, <Col N="1620"/>which tend to benefit the two larger parties.  There is a case for such constituencies where they match county boundaries but in general my party would support the idea of larger constituencies.  This would benefit parties such as my own but it would also benefit Independents and the smaller groups who want to have a voice in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed legislative change to allow for six seat constituencies, as was originally envisaged when the current PR voting system was introduced.  Not only would this more properly equate the seat share to vote share but it would also lessen the need for regular readjustments of smaller constituencies.  This is a matter I would like the electoral commission to examine seriously.</P>
        <P>The creation of a genuine independent electoral commission to examine these matters would also avoid the insinuation that the process has been used to further the interests of the governing party or parties that establish such a body.  I am not suggesting this was the case in regard to the recent commission report but there have been incidents in the past &mdash; I am glad they are consigned to the past &mdash; where it would appear that the Government of the day benefited unduly from changes that took place in the constituency make-up.  The famous Tullymander case in the mid-1970s was designed to assist the then Government parties of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition.  In order to avoid such a prospect in the future, I would support the establishment of an electoral commission as proposed here, namely, one made up of experts and completely independent.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the use of PPS numbers for registration and electoral purposes.  This is long overdue.  While the Minister said a scoping document will consider international best practice and that the process for this will begin in March and conclude within eight weeks, we need to consider the follow-up to this.  When will we see real reform?  When will we begin to shape up the electoral register?  It was a disgrace last year that field officers were put out into the counties with only a couple of weeks to try to update the register.  The results of that were a disaster, particularly in my own county and in parts of Dublin, where thousands of people were disenfranchised and taken off the electoral register because of lack of resources, time and proper planning.</P>
        <P>The Minister is trying to look forward and to have proper electoral reform but in the meantime people are losing out.  I know of one case where Donegal County Council, of which I was a member, honoured a certain family and gave them the freedom of the county.  A number of weeks later, the woman of that family found she had been taken off the electoral register.  There is nothing worse for somebody who has been voting all her life than to turn up to cast her vote at a <Col N="1621"/>polling station to be told she has been taken off the list.  All the questions arise as to who took the person off the list, whether it was a political party or political interference and all the rest.  There is a need to deal with this matter in a transparent way.  The PPS system is the best way and I cannot understand why we are not taking it seriously, particularly as it could happen outside of the overall reform.</P>
        <P>There needs to be an easier way for people to get onto the register.  This is very difficult, particularly in rural areas where Garda stations are only open for a couple of hours on a Saturday.  It is particularly difficult for young people to get on the supplementary register, for which an application must be signed by a Garda.  We need to look at international best practice.  Elsewhere, it is possible to register people on college campuses and on the way in to polling stations, so as to make it easy for them to participate in the democratic process.</P>
        <P>I hope the commission will examine all aspects of voting in elections.  We need Seanad reform, but that is a debate for another day.  The Minister referred to international best practice.  I hope he will adopt some of these progressive international practices and allow Irish citizens in the Six Counties as well as the Twenty-six Counties to elect the President and thus participate in the democratic process.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made in recent weeks to the American elections.  Americans citizens in this State have been able to cast their vote for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or John McCain.  I want a person from the Falls Road, the Bogside or the Shankill Road to be in a position to be able to vote for our President in the future.  I also want to be able to see an Irish person who is living in Cricklewood in London, or in Glasgow or America to be able to vote for our President.  I hope the commission takes these issues on board.  Go raibh maith agat.  I, again, applaud the Green Party Senators.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Green Party motion which has the full support of the Fine Gael Party.  This is an important issue and today&rsquo;s debate is only the start of the wide-ranging discussion we need on the matter.  It is only right that the Minister would set up a tender process to examine how the system will be structured.  A great deal of work and an enormous effort is involved in the compilation of the electoral register, on polling day and in counting votes.  A large cohort of people is <Col N="1622"/>involved in ensuring the democratic process works well.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Coffey said about voting machines.  The Minister acknowledged Senator Coffey&rsquo;s point but he should make an immediate decision to sell the machines.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but we receive no benefit from the money currently spent on the storage of e-voting machines.  I hope the Minister will act promptly in this matter.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Ellis, who is from County Leitrim, on the remarks he made about that county.  The county should be re-united for electoral purposes.  The boundary commission should have examined this matter in more detail.  It is very poor form that County Leitrim has no representative in the D&aacute;il.  It is bad form that Leitrim was divided in the first place.  I hope the Minister will examine this issue again and that in future the electoral commission will do so.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of cases where counties have been divided.  The most recent report proposed to add a slice of County Limerick to County Kerry and Senator Coffey referred to County Waterford.  I recall when County Mayo had two three-seater constituencies.  One part of County Galway was added to the constituency of west Mayo and another part was included in the constituency of east Mayo.  Nobody knew whether they would be in for one term or two terms.  Parts of counties that are added to bigger counties do not get the full representation they would have received had they been retained with the county boundaries.  I support Senator Ellis&rsquo;s points in this regard.</P>
        <P>Everybody should have to register to vote.  Senator Glynn referred to a number of reasons why people should register.  Jury service is one important reason, as those who are not on the voting register do not get called for jury service.  This is a very important part of our democratic make-up.  There is an obligation on us as legislators to ensure everybody is registered to vote once they reach the age of 18.  It may not be mandatory for people to vote but it should be mandatory for them to register to vote.</P>
        <P>I support what Senator Doherty said about the difficulty experienced by some people in getting on the electoral register.  I deplore the amount of money wasted prior to the general election in order to get people on the electoral register.  I was contacted at the time by a person from Naas who <Col N="1623"/>had to travel to Maynooth to get a garda to sign the necessary form.  It is difficult to imagine that one would have to travel this far to get a garda but this case was replicated in every constituency.  In many cases when one goes to a Garda station one only meets the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; on the door and it is not much good to only speak to someone if one wants a form signed.</P>
        <P>We cannot hinder people from getting on the electoral register.  We should help them.  There must be a better system of registration than is the case at present.  Local authority revenue collectors could play a greater role in this regard.  They should be properly financially resourced in order to do this job.  When the extra funding was provided by the then Minister, Deputy Roche, prior to the previous election, in some cases people went into urban and rural areas who did not know where they were going or what they were doing.  A great deal of money was squandered.  A better system must be put in place.  More efficient use can be made of revenue collectors because they know exactly where they are going and who are their clients.  They know the constituents and the housing estates.  In most cases they know the rural areas also.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate and compliment the Green Party on bringing it forward.  This is an important issue and there is a great deal of merit in what is proposed in the motion.  This is Fine Gael Party policy also.  I accept it will be a big task to bring all of this together.  The Minister appears to be taking the correct approach.  I am delighted that he said he expects to receive a report in eight weeks&rsquo; time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all who contributed to the debate this evening.  It has been a rare occasion of harmony descending on the Seanad Chamber in Private Members' time.  I cannot remember a Private Members' motion in the lifetime of this Seanad where there was such a degree of consensus.  On a personal level I am heartened by it as it will help the eventual progress of necessary legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>The debate has been characterised by a number of useful points about what needs to be addressed.  The Minister made significant commitments as to how he intends to proceed.  He indicated the production of a scoping document is expected at the end of May.  This will give us an indication of how an electoral commission can come into being and what kind of commission it is likely to be.  When we have that type of detail we might have small ripples of political dissent because the idea of a commission depends on how wide-ranging or all-consuming it would be in its functions and how deep would be its remit.  I am still hopeful that the trend of all the contributions this evening would indicate that a general <Col N="1624"/>support exists and will continue to exist until we have that necessary reform.  All involved in the debate recognise that change is necessary.</P>
        <P>Many of the points raised go beyond the formation of an electoral commission but they are worth commenting on because a future commission could deal with such issues, although it is probably our responsibility to deal with them before a commission comes into play.  I sense a degree of consensus for spending limits in local government elections and they are easier to put in place than the convenient fiction we have for general elections of covering a three-week campaign in that the date of a local election is constitutionally known.</P>

	<P>I am in favour of extending it to general elections.</P>
        <P>Proportionality is an important part of the remit of a future electoral commission.  The Constitution says D&aacute;il constituencies should have between three and seven seats.  We have no seven seat constituencies, but have five seaters at most.  Senator Doherty mentioned this in his contribution and might be interested that in the early years of the Free State a constituency in Donegal returned nine members.  He would be satisfied if such a state of affairs returned.  Senator Ellis mentioned the anomalous situation in County Leitrim, which does not have a large enough population to return a D&aacute;il Deputy.  Alone it would return one and a bit but that does not fall within the Constitution&rsquo;s requirement of having at least three Members.  There is an argument for examining the Constitution in terms of country boundaries not being breached but it is a wider debate.</P>
        <P>There is an argument in the contributions of Senators Ellis, Burke and Doherty for the need to get a proper balance between rural and urban representation.  The demographics of this country are heavily weighted towards the east coast.  The population in the greater Dublin area, despite its <Col N="1625"/>size, is out of kilter with the rest of the country.  We should ask whether population ratio alone is the best determinant of parliamentary representation.  It is worth debating whether geographical representation and different sectors of society should be taken into account.  If today&rsquo;s debate has facilitated those ideas being aired, I am grateful to the Members for taking that opportunity.</P>
        <P>The real benefit of an electoral commission is to address the issues of voter awareness and participation, however that is done.  The value of tonight&rsquo;s debate should be to establish new structures that will help future generations of voters and citizens to have confidence in the political system and I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>

	<P>I thank the Seanad staff and particularly the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.  I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen.  This is the second occasion on which I have raised this matter on the Adjournment.  I have made numerous representations to the Minister, and colleagues in the D&aacute;il have raised the matter on my behalf.  This is of the utmost importance to the people of Dunmanway, and I cannot stress that enough.  Dunmanway has been forgotten for years by successive Governments and has lacked support and investment because of that.  Nevertheless we have a strong community spirit, and the community and the local authority have just published an ambitious strategic plan for the town&rsquo;s future that sets out a broad blueprint on where the town should be going regarding strategic investment and infrastructure.  There is a very strong air of confidence there, which had been lacking for many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The social welfare office closed last July because of the untimely death of the branch manager and it has not reopened.  In an era of decentralisation we must ensure as many services as possible are retained in rural towns such as Dunmanway, which is the geographical centre point of west Cork.  BIM and the Department of Transport are in Clonakilty or on their way there.  It is important that a service such as this that is connected with an arm of the State is retained in one of the towns near the location of decentralisation. <Col N="1626"/> The office has not reopened since its temporary closure last July.  A number of other offices in other west Cork towns have had to process claims from Dunmanway.  There is no difficulty with accommodation.  The premises from which the office used to operate is still available and there is no question of accommodation being a difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Minister will not admit it here this evening but it is creating difficulties for other offices in other towns that have had to deal with it.  It also creates difficulty for people who have to travel from Dunmanway to other west Cork towns to process their claims.  There is no DART service.  There is a bus service, but it is not convenient for people who want their social welfare claims processed.  There is no readily available public transport that can get them in and out of other towns in a reasonable timeframe.</P>
        <P>As a result of the closure three jobs have been lost.  We had a manufacturing facility from the 1970s up to the late 1990s when, sadly, it closed with the loss of 120 jobs that have never been replaced.  While three jobs might not sound like much in the national scheme, in an area like this is it very important.  The people of the area, those who worked in the office before and others who have an interest in that want the office reopened and the service retained.  Can the Minister assure us this office will be reopened for the people of Dunmanway?</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for taking this Adjournment matter and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, for being present.  This service is needed and must be retained in the area.  The office must be reopened.  There is no difficulty in competition for the contract or accommodation.  There is a strong spirit and appetite locally for this office to be reopened and I appeal to the Minister to look favourably on this matter.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator McCarthy for raising this important issue.  As he said, many of my colleagues from both Houses from the area have raised this issue with me in the recent past.  I understand the importance of the office and its impact locally, particularly on our customers.  The Department delivers a front-line service to its customers through a network of 59 local offices and 66 branch offices countrywide.  The main services provided from these offices include jobseekers&rsquo; payments, one-parent family payment and a customer information service.  The 59 local offices are staffed by departmental staff and the branch offices are run by branch managers who are employed under a contract for service by the Department to administer certain social welfare services to members of the public in their catchment areas.</P><Col N="1627"/>
        <P>As explained to the Seanad previously, due to the sad and untimely death of the branch manager in Dunmanway arrangements had to be put in place immediately to ensure continuity of service to customers.  All claims originally catered for in Dunmanway were transferred to the Department&rsquo;s office in Bantry as an interim arrangement to ensure that payments were not interrupted.  The number of customers involved was approximately 350 and arrangements were subsequently made to distribute the claims between five neighbouring branch offices in Bandon, Bantry, Clonakilty, Macroom and Skibbereen.</P>
        <P>In cases where customers are living more than 16 km from their designated branch office, their signing arrangements were changed to quarterly signing as opposed to the normal monthly signing arrangements.  This means that these customers need only call to the branch office once every three months.  Service to customers has not been interrupted by these arrangements and payments are continuing as they fall due.  It is open to people residing in the Dunmanway catchment area who become unemployed to make a claim for jobseekers&rsquo; benefit or allowance at any of our offices convenient to them.</P>
        <P>It is open to people residing in the Dunmanway catchment area who become unemployed to make a claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit at any of our offices convenient to them.  Customers claiming illness benefit can forward medical certificates direct to the illness benefit section in Dublin, or to any local office or branch office.  There is a social welfare inspector located in Dunmanway and this service is being maintained.  The office of the inspector is open to the public on Tuesday mornings and deals with any information queries.</P>
        <P>A strategic review of customer-facing services is being undertaken this year, as provided for in the Department&rsquo;s modernisation action plan.  The purpose of this review is to determine what services will be delivered in the Department&rsquo;s front-line environment in the future.  This review is being undertaken to identify the range of the Department&rsquo;s customer-facing services and related activities that would be most appropriately delivered in a front-line environment, the locations from which these services would be best delivered, and the layout of the offices that would enable optimum delivery of these services.</P>
        <P>Having considered the nature and extent of future customer facing services, the terms of reference for this review provide for recommendations on the criteria used to determine the locations in which the Department should have a local office or branch office presence.  The position on the branch office in Dunmanway will be considered in the light of the outcome of this review.  I say that genuinely to the Senator.  There <Col N="1628"/>is a review taking place at the moment and I am obliged to take account of what has happened in Dunmanway.  I would like to bring it to a resolution as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish to raise a very important issue on the Adjournment, namely, whether the Government will honour its commitment to clean up the Silvermines dumps, which have remained idle since mining operations ceased in the area in the early 1980s.  This issue has been discussed in the House before, but changes that have taken place recently have brought the issue to the fore again.  A number of reports were carried out by the EPA, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Teagasc, North Tipperary County Council and so on.  Therefore, there is much awareness of this issue.</P>
        <P>There was a very lengthy campaign by the residents in Silvermines and the surrounding areas to have the Silvermines mining area cleaned up, especially the Gortmore tailings pond.  The latter area was investigated by the EPA, which in its report described it as &ldquo;a perpetual risk to human and animal health&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A commitment was given by the Government two years ago to provide &euro;10.6 million to rehabilitate and clean up the Gortmore tailings pond and five other old mine sites in the Silvermines area that cover approximately 150 acres, as they were deemed to pose environmental and health hazards.  The tailing management facility in the townland of Gortmore contains the toxic remains of millions of tonnes of lead, zinc and silver silt, which were once delivered by a pumping pipe from the metal ore processing mill at Silvermines, approximately one mile away.  The report also indicated that if the Government and North Tipperary County Council failed to take safety measures to prevent humans and animals being exposed to lead and other toxins used in the mining industry, they could leave their health at risk.  This could lead to lead, arsenic and cadmium poisoning, and we have seen already the impact of this on animals.  The report stated that it might take up to 20 years to have serious effects on <Col N="1629"/>humans, but those 20 years are up and there is serious concern among the residents.</P>
        <P>The commitment by the Government aimed to clean out the Silvermines areas over a phased basis, beginning with the most vulnerable areas such as Gortmore and then moving on to other vulnerable sections of the old mines.  However, it has recently been revealed by North Tipperary County Council that the cost of the clean up of the Gortmore area alone has risen to around &euro;7 million, which is more than twice the &euro;3 million that was allocated by the Government at the time.  This is because the clean up work now envisaged for Gortmore needs to be far more extensive in order to protect human health.  The tender for the work will go out soon, but it appears the works will have to be reduced sizeably because the budget is not available.</P>
        <P>In essence, we need a commitment from the Government to provide the funding required to get the full work carried out.  It has been admitted by the county council that it will have to break up this work into a number of phases in order to get it done, and that only phase one will be delivered this year.  This phase will supposedly include basic provisions to ensure dust particles containing lead and other toxic substances will be prevented from blowing around farms and across farmlands.  The provisions are basic as only the most vulnerable areas will be covered.  The council has stated that depending on the budget allowed in 2009, it will address other areas in the Silvermines.  The director of environmental services in North Tipperary County Council has admitted his concern for future funding provision for this work and this has raised alarm bells in the area.</P>
        <P>There is a specific concern here regarding funding provision and the Government&rsquo;s commitment on this work.  Is the Government fully committed to its initial promise two years ago of &euro;10.6 million for the clean up operation?  Will the Minister provide additional funding to ensure the work to preserve human health is carried out, given that initial quantification of the cost has been seen already to be out of date?  Why will the Minister not inform North Tipperary County Council how much of the &euro;10.6 million it is to allocate to the clean up operation in Gortmore in 2009, if there is no problem with the funding?  It has allocated only &euro;3 million to date.  Is there a specific issue?  The people should be made aware of such an issue if it exists.</P>
        <P>The residents of the area would welcome confirmation that the funding will be provided for this work without any conditions and in the appropriate timeframe.  It is essential for their future well being.  As someone who knows these people well, has relations living in the area and whose family members worked in the mines, I would also welcome a positive response.</P><Col N="1630"/>
        <P>The group here would like to meet the Minister if possible.  He is on record as saying it is disgraceful that successive Governments over 20 years have allowed this environmental pollution to continue in the Silvermines area.  We hope the Government will fund the appropriate clean up in order that the people there can live without fearing for their health in the future.</P>

	<P>I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who is at an official function.</P>
        <P>Since the matter was last raised in the House in April 2005 there has been substantial progress on the rehabilitation project, which I am happy to outline here today.  On the previous occasion the matter was raised, the then Minister outlined the Department&rsquo;s priority to put in place a credible remediation proposal that would effectively address the long-standing concerns of the local community.  Furthermore, priority was also placed on addressing the issue of the legal responsibility of Mogul of Ireland Limited to remediate the mine workings under clause K of its mining lease dating from 1965.</P>
        <P>I will outline the history of the Department&rsquo;s attempts to get the leaseholder to meet its legal liabilities.  Mogul of Ireland Limited was first put on notice by the Department in December 1999 about its liability.  However, after a number of meetings and various proposals put forward by the company throughout 2003 and 2004, serious doubts began to emerge concerning the company&rsquo;s financial and technical capability to carry out the works to the standard required.  The Department finally concluded that Mogul could not deliver a satisfactory rehabilitation programme, and that further dialogue on this issue would serve no purpose.  The EPA and North Tipperary County Council, which worked closely with the Department and its consultants at all stages, concurred with this view.</P>
        <P>The Department, through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, moved to enforce compliance on Mogul through the courts.  In January 2007, it formally issued a motion for judgment on Mogul in the High Court.  While settlement talks were ongoing in this matter Mogul went into liquidation in July 2007.  The Department is continuing to seek a satisfactory resolution to this matter with Mogul&rsquo;s liquidator, although given the limited assets of the company the potential for a return commensurate with the cost of the rehabilitation works is minimal.</P>
        <P>Aside from the enforcement of the company&rsquo;s legal liabilities, the Department has actively engaged in preparing plans for the rehabilitation of the area, implementation of which required new legislation.  The power of the Minister to undertake, or procure the undertaking of such <Col N="1631"/>works is not specifically provided for in the Minerals Development Acts.  Special provisions were therefore included in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 to give the Minister powers to expend funds on mine rehabilitation projects.  In addition, the Act conferred upon the Minister or his agent powers to prepare and implement mine rehabilitation plans, as well as powers of entry onto land where necessary.  The Minister was also given powers of compulsory acquisition of lands where necessary for the purposes of implementation of mine rehabilitation plans.  These are essential to ensure that the project could be planned and progressed without running the risk of encountering unnecessary and possibly lengthy delays.  The Act also contained a provision giving the Minister or his agents discretionary powers to recover State expenditure on rehabilitated lands.</P>
        <P>These legislative provisions were an interim measure pending enactment of a comprehensive minerals development Bill, which is currently with the Parliamentary Counsel of the Office of the Attorney General for drafting.  The Minister hopes to bring the legislation to Government later this year and the interim legislation will be repealed when it is enacted.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, the Government approved the appointment of North Tipperary County Council as the Minister&rsquo;s agent for the carrying out of the rehabilitation project.  In 2006, following a competitive tendering process, North Tipperary County Council appointed Golder Associates to finalise the design and manage the implementation of the rehabilitation programme as set out in the conceptual plans prepared by SRK Consulting in 2005.  This work continued throughout 2007, with particular focus on the Gortmore site.</P>
        <P>The Minister is pleased to inform the House that Part 8 planning permission for the rehabilitation of the Gortmore site was obtained by North Tipperary County Council on 17 September 2007.  Since then, the project team has been engaged in preparing a shortlist of suitable contractors to undertake construction work on the site.  Tender documents are almost completed and the Department expects that tenders will be invited from this shortlist in the near future.  Rehabilitation work on the Gortmore site will commence once this tendering process is complete.</P>

	<P>I would appreciate if the Minister would ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources a question on my behalf.  Given that &euro;3 million of the &euro;10.6 million has been allocated this year and accepting that the cost of the works will be in excess of the latter figure, will the Minister outline the dates for the staged release of the funds in order that a <Col N="1632"/>proper assessment can take place of the volume of work that each phased allocation will cover?  Local people would like to know if certain areas will be prioritised and how much money will be allocated for phase 2 in 2009 or 2010.  Without such information, they will not be able to determine how much funding will be available each year.  I would appreciate if the Minister would obtain a statement providing information on the phased roll-out of expenditure on the works. </P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House, of which he is a former Member.  This is my first opportunity in an official capacity as Senator to address him.  It is a nice coincidence that Senator Ormonde, who is also a proud Waterford person, is in the Chair.  As we all know, we have to punch above our weight when we are up here in Dublin in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The issue I raise, the roll-out of broadband in the county towns of Tramore and Dunmore East, is probably close to the Minister&rsquo;s heart.  I understand the towns were included in a roll-out programme proposed by the South East Regional Authority to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  My information is that much of the funding allocated to resource the implementation of metropolitan area networks, MANs, in towns such as Tramore and Dunmore East has been diverted by the Minister into the greener homes scheme and other areas.</P>
        <P>I seek a realistic timeframe for the delivery of broadband to Tramore and Dunmore East.  As the Minister is aware, the former has the largest population of any town in County Waterford.  Between the 2002 and 2006 censuses, its population increased from 8,100 to 9,100.  Dungarvan, the official county town of Waterford, which has a population of only 7,800, has a metropolitan area network in place and ready for connection to a high speed broadband network.  The population of Dunmore East has also grown rapidly and currently stands at almost 1,600.  The Minister knows that broadband is essential infrastructure, on a par with electricity, water and sewerage.  It is vital to have a high speed broadband network in place to give people access to educational and business initiatives and general information.  Areas without access to a high speed broadband service are at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party has a progressive policy to introduce a practical programme to deliver broadband to all towns and counties.  I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response and <Col N="1633"/>thank him for coming to the House to hear my contribution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who is attending an official function.  I am pleased to update the House on the availability of broadband services, including in Dunmore East and Tramore, in which I have a particular interest, and Government initiatives to assist the telecommunications sector to deliver next generation broadband.</P>
        <P>The provision of broadband services is a major priority for the Government.  In this context, the primary role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  The broadband market is fully liberalised and regulated, where appropriate, by ComReg, the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.  However, where markets fail in the telecommunications and broadband sectors, Government must act.  Government infrastructure policy addresses market failure through investment in international connectivity and regional backhaul, the construction of the open access metropolitan area networks, part funding rural broadband access networks under the group broadband scheme and upcoming national broadband scheme.</P>
        <P>The MANs programme involves the construction of high speed, open access metropolitan area networks in towns and cities nationwide in partnership with local and regional authorities.  MANs are State owned, open access telecommunications networks in towns and cities which are offered to telecommunication service providers on a wholesale basis to allow them to provide services without the need to build their own networks.</P>
        <P>Phase one of the MANs programme saw the construction of duct and fibre networks in 27 cities and towns.  A total of 94 towns were selected for investment under phase two.  Open access masts or high sites were proposed for 22 of the phase two towns, including Tramore and Dunmore East, to attract wireless operators.  There have been a number of developments since the <Col N="1634"/>decision to proceed with phase two was made.  All towns selected for investment under the MANs programme now have at least one broadband provider.  Tramore and Dunmore East have broadband providers competing over multiple technology platforms &mdash; DSL, wireless, mobile and satellite.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources commenced a value for money and policy review of phase one of the MANs programme last year.  This report is almost complete and will be published in the coming weeks.  The Department has also prepared a draft policy paper on next generation broadband networks, which will review current communications infrastructure policy and provide options on the optimum future role for Government in facilitating the roll out of high speed broadband networks.</P>
        <P>An international advisory forum made up of international experts in the electronic communications sector met last week to critique the draft policy paper.  The paper will be soon published for public consultation.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances, the Minister has decided that it would be prudent to delay the signing of contracts for the construction of new networks, including those at Dunmore East and Tramore, until he has had an opportunity to consider and assess the implications of the value for money report and the outcome of the consultation on the next generation broadband policy paper.</P>
        <P>I understand major advances in technology have taken place recently in some of these areas.  I am aware from general discussion that the Government is trying to identify the best approach to achieving its objectives in this area.  I want to ensure that Tramore and Dunmore East are included in the next stage of broadband development.  The report to be published shortly will inform the debate.  In the meantime, the MANs under construction in 66 towns are proceeding as planned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The State has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage where the market has clearly failed.  Direct Exchequer funding has already been provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the provision of backbone infrastructure and to upgrade local access infrastructure.  Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 we plan to invest a total of &euro;435 million of Exchequer funding in communication and broadband infrastructure.  The money is available; it is a question of maximising its use.</P>
        <P>In 2007, some &euro;35.68 million was spent by the Exchequer on broadband projects and provision is made for some &euro;53.63 million this year.  This investment is primarily directed at meeting commitments under the metropolitan area networks <Col N="1635"/>programme and the national broadband scheme.  Later this year the NBS will begin providing broadband services to those areas of the country currently not served by broadband providers.</P>
        <P>The Government will take decisions regarding the allocation of the uncommitted portion of the NDP allocation in light of the policy priorities arising from the next generation broadband policy framework.  The objective will be to maximise the impact of the allocation available and to ensure the on-time delivery of next generation broadband by competing service providers to Irish homes and businesses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I assure the Senator and the Acting Chairman that I will take particular notice, as I do of all matters to do with our own constituency, when these decisions are being taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and in particular his reassurance that both Dunmore East and Tramore will not suffer from the lack of funding.  I accept prudence is required in the rollout of public infrastructure but I hope there will not be any unnecessary delays.  We are all aware that there can be delays in the public system but broadband is such an essential infrastructure its speedy rollout is essential.  Ireland is behind in that regard and we have a good deal of catching up to do in that regard.  I am reassured following the debate.</P>
