	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re European evidence warrant; No. 2, motion re judgments <i>in absentia</i>, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 3, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2; and No. 3<i>a</i>, motion re earlier signature, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 3.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of issues to be raised.  I wish to comment on the banking decisions that have been taken, the call from this side of the House for a debate on the Lisbon treaty following the European Council, which is not on this week&rsquo;s agenda, and events in the Equality Authority.</P>
        <P>Is it intended to introduce legislation this week on the banking sector?  What the public needs from the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, at present is clarity, detail, accuracy and clear policy on this area, but the information we have been given is general.  Many questions arise about the capitalisation of the banks, not least whether it will ensure that businesses and the economy will benefit.  Representatives of the banks appeared before the finance committee today and they had a different view on the situation from that of small businesses.  The banks&rsquo; representatives say that credit is not a problem whereas small businesses say it is.</P>
        <P>The Minister must come to the House to clarify his intentions.  Equally, with regard to the management of the banks following recapitalisation, will the current management continue in place?  What price is the Government exacting for this huge amount of money and how will that be dealt with?  A series of questions must be asked.  I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business to provide that the House discuss this issue and be brought up to date on the Government&rsquo;s thinking.  We need greater clarity on the Government&rsquo;s approach; the one thing people need from the Government is clarity and detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is to ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to detail and discuss his proposals on bank capitalisation.  Many questions arise to which there are no answers at present.  Senators have asked repeatedly for detailed information.  We do not want announcements continually made elsewhere.  I ask for a debate in the House.</P>
        <P>I also referred to the European Council.  Senators understood the House would be given feedback on the decisions taken at the meeting.  Will the Leader indicate if a debate on this issue is planned this week?</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come before the House to clarify the future role of the Equality Authority and explain how the authority will do its business in future.  The Fine Gael Party will move an amendment to the Order of Business to facilitate a debate on the issue.  The chief executive officer of the Equality Authority has <Col N="3"/>resigned and its funding has been reduced by 43%.  Last week, Senator Boyle of the Green Party expressed concern about the role of outside influences.  I ask the Leader to clarify what outside influences were brought to bear on the Government to take a decision which completely undermines the equality structure, the roots of which are to give people basic rights.  It appears the authority&rsquo;s work will be severely compromised.  The Minister must come before the House to clarify how it can possibly continue its work in light of the loss of expertise it will experience as a result of a botched decentralisation and a funding cut of 43%.</P>
        <P>It appears the CEO of the Equality Authority was willing to work with a reduced budget but this was not considered acceptable.  How will the authority&rsquo;s work continue?  Will the Minister come before the House to explain precisely what is the position?  Will the Leader clarify what is the hidden agenda being referred to in the media and what are the outside influences coming to bear on Government decisions?  Who exactly are the people to whom the Green Party is referring?  Who influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision on this matter?  These are some of the questions we have for the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald raises a crucial issue.  As I stated last week, the Taoiseach travelled around Europe talking about negotiating a deal which had not been discussed in this House or the Other House.  That is unacceptable, bad politics and a stupid strategy, as is the fact that banking representatives appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service this morning without prior discussion of the issue in either House.  Questions are being raised about this matter, including, from a Government point of view, by Senator Boyle.  This creates a difficulty.  If others on the outside &mdash; shady influences &mdash; are having a bearing on Government decisions, we deserve to know the reason.  If the Government wants a consensus approach to be taken to issues such as Europe and the economic crisis, this is not the way to go about it. </P>
        <P>I repeat a question asked many times.  How will recapitalisation of the banks help the economy?  I do not want to be told that greater confidence in the banks helps the economy.  While it helps bank share prices and is good for bank directors and shareholders, it does not necessarily benefit businesses and those who depend on them.  I want to know what is the direct link between bank recapitalisation and the economy.</P>
        <P>If the Government puts &euro;5 billion of public money at risk in supporting the banks, what will it receive in return?  While it is good the Government has decided to appoint directors to bank boards, what action is it taking on banking management and policy?  Until now, bankers received bonuses and advances on the basis of the amount of business they had written and the amount appropriate for securitisation.  I presume the position is changing and risk assessment and other benchmarks will be considered when determining what is successful banking.  We need to hear about these matters to learn what changes will be made.</P>
        <P>We hear a great deal about &euro;5 billion here or there but in the real world people cannot come to grips with the idea that we can set aside &euro;5 billion to support the banks when we cannot support schools, we are cutting back on accident and emergency services, houses are being repossessed from those who cannot afford to pay their mortgages and companies could, with additional investment, create more jobs.  I am not saying whether these things are good or bad.  I am saying that is what ordinary people are talking about.  We need to make the connection.  It is not good enough for us to be seen to be listening to the banks and calling them in, and the banks calling the Taoiseach aside and asking for things, while the rest of the world is going over the edge, as it were.  There is something unacceptable about it and it needs to be explained.</P>
        <P>We need to ensure there is a solid banking system.  The question I ask should not lead to the conclusion that we should not be doing our best to sort out the banking system.  Recapitalisation does not necessarily do what is wanted.  Ordinary people need a precise explanation on <Col N="4"/>how it will help them in the long term in their world, whether in education, health or business.  This is not happening and if we do not have a debate on it, it will not happen.  I second the motion on that basis and ask the Leader to think seriously about conceding the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Picking up on the frustrations expressed by my colleagues, it seems that these Houses are the last place the people should look to see what is being debated and what are the major decisions of Government.  Ministers have come to this House in recent weeks on the request of Members from both sides to present the economic plans or proposals they may have.  They have failed lamentably to do that and have come here with speeches instead.  As people on this side of the House have noted, they have not included a single proposal.  How can the Government attend a meeting with the social partners at 11 o&rsquo;clock this morning at which the Government presented the bones of an economic plan?  One would pinch oneself on what passes for democratic debate and scrutiny in this country because the Government goes to the social partners in the first instance and not the Houses of Parliament.</P>
        <P>It is an extraordinary situation and Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct regarding the banks.  Senator Fitzgerald also raised that issue and I support her proposal.  She rightly asked for the Minister to share with the House such decisions he has made on the banks.  The problem is worse because other than the decision made at the end of September regarding the guarantee and on which the Government is still dining out, no decisions have been made on the banks.</P>
        <P>The Minister appears on television occasionally, looking and sounding decisive but not making a single decision.  One could not make this up if one wanted to.  The Government is inviting the banks to get back some time in January on what they think should happen on the Government&rsquo;s proposals, such as they are.  What are the proposals and decisions made by Government?  There is none and that is the problem.  Perhaps that is why there is no debate on these issues in the House.  The Government has nothing to propose.  Members of this House are right to be frustrated about the manner in which they are being treated by the Government on these crucial issues.</P>
        <P>When we look for clarity, it is almost as if we are wasting our breath because we are not getting anything.  We are getting no proposals, clarity or decisions, except vague references to economic plans and proposals being brought forward in the proverbial new year.</P>
        <P>At the risk of sounding as if everything is doom and gloom, I will make one positive point.  Will the Leader convey my congratulations to Limerick County Council on a gem reported in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers which I welcome, namely, its decision to assign a budget to commence work on the great southern trail, a cycle route along the route of the old Limerick-Kerry railway line?  It is the sort of small initiative that should be taken and supported.  This will come forward in 2009.  Can the Leader take an initiative, perhaps with other leaders, to organise among Members of the Seanad a cycle trip along this route next summer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not encourage him.  He will take the Cork-Dublin route with a bicycle if we are not careful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate on the economy is ongoing in this House, as is the question of our financial institutions, and I am confident there will be further debates.  There is a need for legislation, especially on the National Pension Reserve Fund.  I am sure it will come before the House at the earliest opportunity and will again give Members the chance to talk about it.</P>
        <P>In announcing the bank guarantee scheme in October, the Minister for Finance was clear that recapitalisation may be possible.  That is now even more clear as the Government has announced that a fund will be made available should banks avail of it.  However, this should <Col N="5"/>not be taken as a negotiating process.  If the State is to get involved in the business of recapitalisation, it must be done on stringent conditions, the first of which is that the money has to be made available for direct lending.  We must learn from the mistakes of other jurisdictions, when billions of euro, dollars and sterling were put into other financial institutions with no net effect.  I hope that any future debates we have on the issue will outline that.  The issue of governance must be also addressed.  The people who got us into this mess cannot be trusted to get us out of it.  The political system will collectively relay that message when we need to make these decisions.</P>
        <P>I have already stated my unhappiness with the decision of the Equality Authority.  Some Members are confusing the contribution I made on the absence of human rights recognition in the Charities Bill 2007 with my position on the Equality Authority.  I do not believe there are outside influences affecting this, but rather unelected influences within the Government that are having a disproportionate effect.  There are personal agendas and biases that are informing policy in this area.  The Equality Authority was prepared to take a 33% cut in its budget, and this could still have proceeded as long as the utterly stupid proposal to relocate to Roscrea did not go ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the authority is to have a shared secretariat with the Irish Human Rights Commission, it can operate only when both agencies are in the same location.  This is one of the reasons for the resignation of the chief executive of the Equality Authority, and it is a reason for the need to examine how policy is made in this area and how it can be consistent with simple economics.  If we are cutting down on Government agencies and on departmental expenditure, we cannot proceed with something that involves the additional use of public expenditure to move public servants from one part of the country to the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The only way we can solve this problem is by making sure the shared secretariat between the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority is a physically shared secretariat in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am somewhat shocked by what Senator Boyle said in reference to unelected people within this Government having an influence on policy and major decisions.  I do not need to point out to Senator Boyle that he is in the Government.  The people to whom these unelected officials report are politicians who head up the Government in the first place.  It seems the issue is not so much about the excessive influence of officials who report to the Government of which Senator Boyle is a member, but rather the lack of influence of the Green Party to stop or reverse decisions it opposes.  It is a terrible precedent for this House to stand up here and assign responsibility for political decisions to officials within Departments, rather than to the Ministers who head up those Departments in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Did I say that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Did I mention a particular official in a particular Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will stick to the Order of Business.  We will not go down that road.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Senator the opportunity to correct me, but the person responsible for this is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and not his officials.  The Senator should address his comments to the people with him in the Government, rather than to the people who report to the Minister in the first place.</P>
        <P>I support all my colleagues in the call for a debate on the conclusions from the European Council last week.  I was lucky enough to play a role in drafting the report that was debated last week.  The main conclusion of that report was that the Oireachtas needs to be more relevant and play more of a role in European debates and European policy discussions.  There is not a chat show, television programme or political website in the country that has not discussed the decisions made last week in Europe.  The following week, no time has been allocated for a discussion on the matter in this House.  We should be discussing two significant points.  First, we should be given an opportunity to understand the agreements the Government claims to have delivered and ensure that such concessions have been gained in the right areas, as demanded by the Irish people.  Second, we should be able to discuss the legal status of those agreements and concessions, which will be of substantial value in the debate that will unfold.  Why is such a debate not happening here?  Why has time not been provided for such a debate in the schedule for this week?  When I raised this point last week, I somewhat angrily asked the Leader if he thought we were all fools because it was clear he did not want to have this discussion in here.  I am afraid the reality, which is that he thinks we are all irrelevant to this debate, is somewhat scarier.  As bipartisan support will be needed on this issue, discussions should be taking place in this Chamber and elsewhere in the Oireachtas.  Yet again, that is not happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the House will be delighted that Senators Quinn and Hanafin and I were present for all three hours of this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, at which there was an informative debate with representatives of the banking sector.  It was interesting to hear the views of those involved in small and medium sized enterprises and banks.  It was clear to anyone who attended the meeting that there has been a lack of communication between the banking sector and small and medium sized enterprises.  Following today&rsquo;s meeting, there seems to be a clear understanding, particularly on the part of the two largest players in the banking sector, of the need to acknowledge that communication difficulties exist.  If Senators speak to their party colleagues who attended the meeting, they will find that the understanding to which I refer is shared on a cross-party basis.  The Small Firms Association has suggested that round-table discussions be organised periodically, perhaps through the Irish Banking Federation, to ensure that problems which arise are considered.  The morning&rsquo;s meeting of the joint committee was a good and positive one.  Perhaps the committee should deal with issues of this nature more frequently.  It is clear that there have been misunderstandings on both sides.  There is a broad acknowledgement that communication has been poor.  Various messages have not been transmitted.  The two biggest banking institutions were adamant at this morning&rsquo;s meeting that they are open for business.  They want to discuss the various issues with industry representatives.  I hope improvements can be made as a result of today&rsquo;s meeting, to which members from all parties and Independent members made a very good contribution.</P>
        <P>I was disturbed to read a Sunday newspaper report on the third national infrastructure conference, which was held in Croke Park recently.  A senior representative of Goodbody Stockbrokers who addressed the conference suggested that after the roads between the main urban centres are finished &mdash; none of the roads in question is north of a line between Dublin and Galway, by the way &mdash; all remaining public funds should be invested in attracting foreign direct investment to Dublin.  That point of view is disgraceful in the extreme.  It is unprofessional for a representative of a body like Goodbody Stockbrokers to make such a remark, especially as <Col N="7"/>such bodies tend to be employed by State agencies to carry out work as professional experts.  It is criminal in the extreme to give space within society to such insular views.  It is important to have balanced development in this country.  Dublin, which is our capital city, Cork, which is our second city, and the other large cities should have infrastructure that is appropriate to their needs.  It is not appropriate to neglect the rest of the country, however.  I refer in particular to that part of the country north of a line between Dublin and Galway.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>For four and a half of my six and a half years in this House, I have been calling for a debate on the lack of progress being made with the national spatial strategy.  If one listens to the official from Goodbody Stockbrokers I have mentioned, the policy to be followed by the arms of the State and the so-called experts in the financial and consultancy worlds should be the deletion of the national spatial strategy.  It is clear that we will not have time for a debate on this matter before Christmas.  We should have an opportunity to examine these issues after Christmas, as a matter of the utmost urgency, perhaps as part of a debate on the national spatial strategy.  Perhaps we could discuss the HSE under the same heading, as it seems to be intent on following the same path as the representative of Goodbody Stockbrokers I have mentioned.  Many of us did not agree with the decision to abolish the health boards in the first instance.  The HSE is now intent on recreating the health boards, with the exception of the former North Western Health Board.  I am afraid to say the north west continues to suffer the most neglect.</P>
     
        <P>While, on behalf of the many fishermen in this country, I am sure we all wish our colleagues, who are negotiating the fishing quotas in Europe at present, well, it is ridiculous in the extreme and clearly part of our excessive pursuit of political correctness to say that we will put quotas or bans on fishing for pleasure.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business that we take No. 28, motion 31, &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann condemns utterly the disgraceful action of the Government in destroying the Combat Poverty Agency [which we are doing today by the way] and the Equality Agency and the gutting of the Irish Human Rights Commission and calls on the Government to rescind these decisions.&rdquo;  It is a shameful day for the Seanad that Part 5, section 30 of this Bill purports to destroy the Combat Poverty Agency.  From those Government benches last week we heard a clear statement that this was not a money-saving exercise and it would actually cost money.  Let us not have lies about that.  This proposal will cost money to kick the poorest and the weakest elements of our society.  It is a complete and utter disgrace.  It was done in the week in which we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We followed it up then.  We got all mention of human rights removed from the Charities Bill despite the fact that these provisions exist in all the neighbouring jurisdictions, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England.</P>
        <P>However, it did not stop there.  We attacked the Human Rights Commission and savaged it.  We then had a 43% cut in the Equality Authority, absolutely destroying its work as everybody knows, and it was deliberately done.  In other words every single element concerned with human rights is being eliminated.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> celebrated human rights week and this matter by ignoring it and instead devoting an entire page to a scurrilous attack on Mary Robinson.  Thank God for <i>The Irish Times</i>, which on its front page yesterday gave us a good hint as to what may well have been in Senator Boyle&rsquo;s mind.</P>

	<P>I am on the Order of Business and I want to say this, which is very important because it leads to a situation where I believe the Government is in great moral danger.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to help the House because questions have been asked about these influences.  The front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> carried an article about the Equality Authority making a complaint to the Garda because of the alleged disclosure of information which is prohibited under the Act.  This was disclosure of information that came about during the course of an investigation.  A Roman Catholic chaplain in a prison was assaulted.  He tried to get a copy of his terms of employment but was denied them.  The court directed that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should make this information available to him, but that was not done.  He then alleged discrimination, but he was not found in favour of on that one.  However, subsequently when this information was leaked from the Irish Prison Service by a named official, the Equality Authority found it was justified and he was awarded &euro;40,000 in compensation.  That amount of money is not awarded unless there is something to it.  It was appealed but the appeal was dropped and the &euro;40,000 was paid over.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not made the point, but I am going to make it.  The point is that the person involved is now the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The destruction of the Equality Authority, the authority that filed this complaint, is coming from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In these circumstances there are grave questions to be answered by Government.</P>
        <P>I would also question the actions of the chairperson of the Equality Authority in issuing such a statement after the chief executive had resigned.  I have never seen such an extraordinary act of treachery.</P>

	<P>There are grave issues facing our community and society, one of which is safety and security in our own homes.

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I make the point because I stood here last week to speak about a similar incident in East Wall.  It is happening a little too frequently.  I therefore ask the Leader to investigate, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner, how we can assist in this area.  We have seen a large increase in such horrible tragedies.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of the economy and the banking sector over a considerable period.  I have made known my views and I have also let the House know that I have done some research in this area.

        <P>What I am concerned about, as I have said clearly, is that there is a lack of confidence in the economy.  We require an impetus, which the economic plan may provide.  At the moment there is a paralysis that is causing serious difficulties.  We know we are in a recession and that 2009, going into 2010, is going to be a difficult time.  We stand up here week in week out and ask for a debate on this or a debate on that.  We know there are serious difficulties in the economy and with the financial institutions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader agree with the other leaders of this House &mdash; given that we have entered a prolonged period in which there will be recurring issues &mdash; to allocate time in the first and second quarters of 2009 for briefings and discussions on matters of importance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Donohoe mentioned the Lisbon treaty.  It is extraordinary that on the Order of Business we have, again, a number of issues concerning European legislation.  They came into this House, were referred to committee without debate, came back from committee and now the Leader has them on the Order of Business.  Motions on the European evidence warrant and on judgments <i>in absentia</i> are two important pieces of legislation that will not be debated in this House.  I repeat what I said before, that the Leader seems determined that this House will not have a role to play in scrutinising EU legislation and being informed about EU legislation.  The framework agreement to deal with the issues that have been raised during the Lisbon treaty debate and referendum was a very important decision of the European Council last week.  What is to be welcomed is that this is a sign that Europe is prepared to respond on each and every issue that is raised by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All this time, all we have are the issues.  The Government has not put to its colleagues in Europe the way in which those issues can be resolved and the formulation that is required.  We still have only a framework agreement.  It is regrettable the Taoiseach seems determined to go alone on this.  It is the same as in the first Lisbon debate where he played party politics with this issue.  There is no effort made to engage the political parties in these Houses nor the political leaders outside.</P>
        <P>When the bank guarantee was introduced we raised the issue of recapitalisation as being a prerequisite for the banks to get on a sounder footing and play their role in the economy.  It was denied by the Minister for Finance that this was necessary and, slowly but surely, we wait for the crisis to happen.  Now the decision has been taken to allocate money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  What is proposed?  The Minister has said to the banks, &ldquo;Come back to me with your ideas&rdquo;, which is a bit rich at this stage.  The banking system has been frozen for the past four months.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will be in recess soon and there will be no debate in these Houses in January on these issues.  Once again, the Minister is playing for time.  Senator Alex White referred to the fact that the Taoiseach will meet the social partners about the economic recovery programme.  I suggest he is meeting the social partners for ideas because it does not appear that either the Minister or the Taoiseach have their own ideas as to how we will get out of this economic and banking crisis.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised very eloquently by Senator Norris about the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission, we live in hard times and in recessionary times, but we should not forget the basic principles with which we have to comply to ensure that people who are discriminated against or ill treated are given a fair deal.  The Equality Authority, the Irish Human Rights Commission and these other bodies which have a vital role to play not only in <Col N="11"/>overseeing these issues but also in implementing our international obligations, whether they be United Nations, Council of Europe or European Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well known that every generation fights the next war with the weapons of the last.  Nothing that I heard today from any Member still measures the extent of the economic crisis, recession and more that is ahead of us.  Even the smallest anecdotal encounter with the public will tell one that there are more lay-offs, shorter working times and people being stood down than ever appears in our newspapers.</P>
        <P>We do not still measure the extent of this crisis.  We should be talking about a national government, war-time measures and states of emergency.  No economy in Europe is as exposed as Ireland&rsquo;s.  No banking system, except perhaps the American one, is exposed to such levels of toxic debt.  No wonder the Stock Exchange, which always measures what is wrong, knew exactly what was wrong with the Irish banks.  Recapitalisation at the level of &euro;10 billion will not solve our problems.  The problem starts with every consumer, every man, woman and child in the country.</P>
        <P>If the banks are capitalised, they may or may not lend it to the people who need it.  The Small Firms Association may or may not be correct about the need for capital.  Fundamentally, <Col N="12"/>it comes down to every man and woman with an income deciding to spend or not.  If they do not decide to spend, this economy will not move.  The &euro;10 billion would be far better employed by giving everyone in the country &euro;5,000 to go out and spend.  As we can see on Grafton Street, when the sales are on and the prices are right, people will go and spend.</P>
        <P>The income must be given to the people who need it &mdash; that is every man, woman and child in the country &mdash; not to banks or intermediate bodies.  It is ridiculous to have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance meeting the social partners today.  The only reason he should be meeting them is to tell them he will not be giving the agreed pay increases because the country has not got the money.  The only people who should be made pay up are the construction industry.  Their workers are at least entitled to the pay increases in the private sector.  We are just dreaming along towards a massive recession.  I predict unemployment will hit 500,000.  I predict there will be riots like those in Greece.  There is a <i>lumpenproletariat</i>, as we see in Limerick and saw in the Love Ulster riots, waiting to jump up on any legitimate protest.</P>
        <P>As to what happened to the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, which he endured very bravely, I hope it will allow him to come to the House to tell us what it was like to be a victim of crime.  There should be less of this ridiculous nonsense of Senator Norris talking about politically correct quangos that rightly fell.  All they ever did was cause trouble, creating minority grievances where they were never before, telling people they are ethnic groups when they are not.  They had little enough to bother them, whingeing about <i>Sunday Independent</i> articles, a small bit of gaiety to the nation.  It is about time they got a grip on the real world.  In the real world, the Irish banking system is exposed to massive levels of toxic debt which will not go away.  It cannot be dealt with by a partisan Government with the Opposition shouting and complaining.</P>

What Senator Boyle raised are serious issues, as were Senator Norris&rsquo;s.  After the budget, I asked the Leader if there was any coincidence that the one Government body critical of the Government&rsquo;s policy is being dismantled by the Government.  I do not think there was.</P>
        <P>According to some reports today, the 2009 Health Service Executive service plan contains proposals to introduce cuts in accident and emergency services in Dublin and Cork.  Anyone who knows anything about accident and emergency services will know they are overstretched to say the least.  Trolley Watch, a service provided by the Irish Nurses Organisation, reported this morning that 339 people were on hospital trolleys in accident and emergency units throughout the country.  This is one particular health area that does not need further cuts because it is overstretched.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader ensure the Minister for Health and Children gives a guarantee that there will be no reduction in accident and emergency services?  I have argued that the HSE is not politically accountable and masks the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  Given that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is no longer attached to a political party and may not stand in the next general election, what mandate has she in relation to health policy?  Where did it come from?  Was it debated at her party&rsquo;s national <Col N="13"/>conference?  Is it Government policy, by and large?  Is there any level of contact between the Minister and the HSE to ensure vital services such as accident and emergency are not further downgraded?</P>
        <P>I welcome, however, the Minister&rsquo;s direction to the HSE that colonoscopies should be performed within a month of a general practitioner&rsquo;s referral.</P>

        <P>I want to raise two points, about the Lisbon treaty and the HSE service plan.  The latter has been seen by RTE.  The renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty was seen exclusively by &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  When will the Government treat these Houses with some level of democratic respect and discuss what is happening in regard to the Lisbon treaty with this House first?  To keep saying that we will keep the Commissioner is probably missing the point with regard to the fundamental aspects of workers&rsquo; rights.  In order for the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty to be passed the Government will need the goodwill of other Members and parties in both Houses.  There must be reassurances in respect of workers&rsquo; rights in order for us to support the Lisbon treaty.  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come into the House and discuss the Lisbon treaty with us.</P>

        <P Just="Left">We have had the bail-out scheme and we now have recapitalisation.  When will we ensure that the Government will give a guarantee to homeowners that they will not have their houses repossessed for the duration of the current economic difficulty?  We have given major assurances and guarantees to banks and we should guarantee to homeowners that their houses will not be taken from them by these banks during the term of the recession.  We should also give a guarantee that when, not if, the next reduction in the ECB rate is announced, which I suspect will be in January, it will be passed on to those who do not have tracker mortgages.  It is currently left to the discretion of the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would welcome a debate on the workings of the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the human rights commission.  It is worth putting on record that the Equality Authority was set up in 1997 with a budget of &euro;378,000.  In the 11 years since then &euro;47 million of public funds has been spent.  The human rights commission was set up in 2001 with a budget of &euro;278,000.  Since then, &euro;12 million has been spent on it.  We can all raise a hue and cry about various issues but, without pre-empting the debate, it is worth mentioning some brief points.  This year the Equality Tribunal&rsquo;s budget increased by 15% in line with the social partnership commitment to get rid of the backlog of work it is doing on cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rent savings of &euro;240,000 would be made by moving the authority to Roscrea.  There was a once-off allocation in 2007, the European year of equality, of &euro;320,000 for that year.  It rolled on to 2008 but it has been got rid of.  This is part of the amount referred to in the swingeing cutbacks.  The anti-ageism campaign, which was rubbished in the other House by Deputy Alan Shatter, cost &euro;230,000.  He said it was inappropriate and a waste of money.  That is more of the money that has been prudently cut back.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the human rights commission can easily survive some of these practical cuts.  It is a regrettable step that the chief executive resigned.  The authority is doing wonderful work.  In this day and age, when we hear Senator Harris refer, <Col N="14"/>rightly, to the crisis ahead of us and job losses, this man had a contract for in the region of &euro;160,000 or &euro;170,000, as he admitted on local radio, and he signed the contract on the understanding he would move to Roscrea.  We should get the facts before the House.  All we have heard today and the last day is a one-sided debate.  The Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the human rights commission are doing excellent work and they can and will survive.  Some of these cutbacks are practical.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It makes no sense that rental accommodation for the Equality Authority and the human rights commission costs &euro;750,000 when the property market has collapsed.  If the move to Roscrea was decided on it should go ahead.  If that saves &euro;750,000 on rental accommodation, so be it.  Many of the points being raised relate to sensible savings when we look at the facts and consider prudently what must be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for an amendment to the Order of Business.  We have such vagueness and indecisiveness regarding the non-decisions on the serious banking situation that it looks as though the Minister is allowing the banks to find their own solution and offer it to him.  He has had them in for tea and biscuits a few times but nothing has happened.  He wants their number to reduce from six to two and certainly not more than three.</P>
        <P>I accept we do not want the equity houses or venture capitalists to come in.  I agree with the approach on co-funding to allow investors, especially shareholders, to participate.  This is very important.  However, we have had nothing but procrastination and prevarication.  The Leader owes it to the House to have the Minister come here.  This compares unfavourably with the Leader&rsquo;s decisiveness and the urgency he attached to this House sitting all night to get the guarantee scheme through.  However, we have had nothing since.  We need detail and the time for this is now.  We need it before Christmas.</P>

	<P>The motion was passed and I believe the Taoiseach will bring it forward as part of his plan to meet the Government&rsquo;s green requirements.  I hope Senator Boyle and his party will support it.  These are positive proposals.  Between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs could be created in the industry and it is essential that we deal with it together.

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of what has come from all sides of the House today, we should have a debate on social partnership and whether it has served its use and is relevant any more.  Senator Alex White touched on the fact that the Taoiseach will meet the social partners apparently to reveal an economic plan before he reveals it to elected and appointed Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  This leaves us continually as spectators.  For Senator Butler to state this has happened for years makes it worse.  Senator Butler is correct that it has happened for years.  We have been spectators in matters of great national importance for years and all sides have accepted it.</P>
        <P>There are people outside this House pulling the strings of power.  Less than two weeks ago, the Minister for Finance, in an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, gave a broad hint that the pay increases due to the public sector under the partnership agreement would not be paid next October.  Within 24 hours, the Taoiseach, having been in touch, not with his political colleagues, fellow parliamentarians or members of the Cabinet but with trade unionists, decided to undermine his Minister for Finance.  There are people who have greater influence than the Minister for Finance on decisions taken about the economy.</P>
        <P>What role do the Seanad and D&aacute;il have in this area?  It is a serious matter which we should be able to debate.  We should admit that we are fast becoming political eunuchs.  I notice the Cathaoirleach is restless.  I remind him, however, that he gave significant latitude to other speakers.</P>

	<P>If the Cathaoirleach will indulge me, I wish to comment on the request for a debate about the banking sector.  I was not at this morning&rsquo;s meeting which Senators Quinn, Hanafin and MacSharry attended.  However, I watched every moment of it on the monitor.  My abiding impression is that the bank representatives have learned nothing.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Donohoe, MacSharry, Callely, Regan, Harris, McCarthy, Coghlan, Buttimer and Ross called for an urgent debate on the banking sector to provide clarity and detailed information on the latest developments and to address their various concerns.  The Minister for Finance will be in the House on Friday morning for the debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  Colleagues will have an opportunity on Second Stage to raise many of those concerns with him.  I undertake to allow a day-long debate on the economy in the first or second week after the Christmas recess.  I agree with the proposal that we should review the situation every quarter in terms of developments in the economy and how best we can encourage and facilitate the Minister and his Department in this regard.</P>
        <P>In regard to the planned second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, I will endeavour to have a debate take place, if at all possible, before Friday.  I respect the views of Senator Donohoe, who had the honour of chairing the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union.  He must be congratulated on the tremendous commitment shown by him and his colleagues on the sub-committee and the work they did.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take on board Senators&rsquo; views in regard to the Equality Authority.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs will be in the House shortly to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Colleagues may avail of this opportunity to make known their strong views on this matter.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan pointed out, the Government has been extremely generous in its funding of the equality agenda.  It was the <Col N="17"/>Fianna F&aacute;il Party which established the authority in 1997 with an initial investment of &euro;378,000.  Since then, more than &euro;45 million has been provided to the authority and at least another &euro;30 million to the Equality Tribunal and the human rights commission.  A substantial allocation has been made for 2009, notwithstanding the unprecedented economic difficulties we face.</P>
        <P>There is no question of the Equality Authority being dismembered.  Funding will be allocated for at least 38 staff, which is five fewer than the original staff level.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan observed, the budget for the Equality Tribunal will be increased by almost 15% in 2009.  The simple fact is that the cost of rental accommodation for the authority in Dublin is  &euro;450,000, while the same standard of accommodation can be found in Roscrea for &euro;120,000, which gives a saving of &euro;330,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government negotiated that rental price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, the authority spent &euro;220,000 on public relations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Somebody has been doing a little work on the figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It spent &euro;100,000 on consultancy fees last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>How much did the Minister spend on consultancy fees?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan pointed out, the ageism campaign, which was opposed by Deputy Shatter, cost &euro;230,000.  There are major savings to be made.  Given our current economic difficulties, all expenditure must be absolutely essential.</P>
        <P>We must commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the action he has taken in this area.  Members should note that an additional &euro;1.5 million has been allocated for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition, Garda numbers are increasing by 400, with an additional &euro;18 million set aside for Garda overtime and &euro;21 million for Operation Anvil.  These are extremely important allocations in the fight against crime for which Members on all sides have been calling.  This puts in perspective the commitment of the Government and the excellent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>Senator Alex White offered his congratulations to Limerick County Council on its decision to assign a budget to commence work on the great southern trail.  I agree with him in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry called for a debate on the national spatial strategy.  This is an excellent proposal and I will certainly allow the necessary time as soon as possible on our return after the Christmas recess.  I agree that the north west is the part of the State which seems to be suffering most from cutbacks in investment by the Health Service Executive.  I will take into account the Senator&rsquo;s strong views on this matter.  The Senator also called for a debate on the fishing industry.  We have had that debate already this session and will have another such in the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, which was seconded by Senator McCarthy.  In this last week of the session, I can only propose for debate on legislation which I am required to propose.  Perhaps Senator Norris will put his strongly held views on this matter to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who will be in the Chamber shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly will.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="18"/>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has been most agreeable, notwithstanding his strong views.  However, we must deal this week with the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Finance (No. 2) Bill, two of the most important Bills to come before the Houses of Parliament every year.  It is an important week in which a large volume of work must be processed by Members.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely expressed condolences to the family of the young woman murdered in Howth.  I join with him in offering our condolences to her family.  It was a terrible murder.  I offer our support to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on all the good work they are doing in this area at this difficult time.</P>
        <P>I offer support also to our colleague and friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, on what must have been an horrific experience yesterday.  It is good to see him come out of the experience alive and well and going about his business again.  That is as much as we can hope for when these unexpected events take place in our country on what is now, unfortunately, a daily basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment as it is not necessary.  Comprehensive legislation is in place which covers all aspects of control activity.  Senators will have noted recent figures which show the Department&rsquo;s success in combating welfare fraud and error through prevention, detection, deterrence and debt recovery.  This is done at various stages from the point at which a claim is made and throughout its life cycle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A large number of people are actively engaged in ensuring taxpayers&rsquo; money goes to those who deserve it.  The Department uses targeted control measures as well as regular controls of individual applications, monitors employers' PRSI payments and carries out reviews.  Prosecutions have also been brought before the courts.</P>
        <P>As I indicated, the legislation is in place and anti-fraud measures are a central part of the Department&rsquo;s work.  Approximately 600 people are employed at local and regional level to work actively in this area.  While I appreciate the reason the Senator seeks to ensure the Department performs this function, I assure her the necessary legislative powers are in place.</P>

	<P>While I am aware that many checks and balances are needed to assess child benefit applications, delays of up to 12 months are experienced in processing these applications to identify fraudulent claims.  Is it possible to expedite the processing of child benefit claims?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct that there have been some delays in processing child benefit claims.  These largely occur in the case of claims made by non-nationals living in Ireland for children who are non-resident.  Processing such applications requires a large number of checks to be made in the home country of the families in question to ensure the child exists and the family is not in receipt of other payments.  While this has caused delays, in recent weeks the child benefit section has made a concerted effort to clear arrears.  Senators will note from figures on payments made this year that expenditure on child benefit has increased considerably.  This is primarily due to arrears being cleared rather than an increase in claims.  The Department aims to clear the balance of arrears. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Many people are becoming unemployed and lodging claims for benefits.  It is a matter of considerable concern that it takes eight to ten weeks to process many of these claims.  Are these delays also due to checks being carried out or can they be explained by pressure on services or a shortage of staff to deal with them?  Is it a case of checking out the credentials of claimants and so forth?  The problem described by the Minister should not be as significant in the case of claims for unemployment benefits.</P>

	<P>I concur with Senator Fitzgerald.  I am aware that there has been a problem for some time and it has been accepted practice that processing claims takes eight to ten weeks.  The Department gave an explanation and stated that people receive an immediate gratuity or some other payment from their employer to tide them over.  It seems harsh that people should be placed in this position. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The issue on which I ask for further information is recent newspaper reports, which I presume may have some substance as they appeared in reputable newspapers, that some of the Polish workers who were formerly employed here are flying over on cheap flights and collecting social welfare payments as if they were still resident here.  I do not want to tar all Polish workers as I believe only a small minority is involved, as is the case in every community.  There is, therefore, nothing anti-Polish in raising this issue.  If, however, the reports are true, it is an abominable practice because it diminishes the pot for the rest of those experiencing difficult circumstances during a period of economic turbulence.  Does the Minister have further information on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Two separate issues have been raised.  The length of time required to process claims is due to the pressure caused by the number of applications being received.  Unfortunately, all offices have experienced a large increase in the number of people applying for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  To ensure we can expedite the processing of claims, approximately 30 additional staff were made available some months ago.  The Department also received sanction for 115 extra staff who are being recruited from other Departments and moved into the relevant offices.  We also established a special unit in the Townsend Street office consisting solely of deciding officers.  They will take claims from throughout the country and work very quickly through them to try to ensure people with claims can receive them before Christmas.  We are targeting claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit.</P>
        <P>The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit never takes as long because it is directly related to people having paid their social insurance stamps.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, because it is a means tested <Col N="22"/>payment, can take longer.  We are very conscious of it and hope the extra staff in the special unit will help to expedite issues.</P>
        <P>On the question asked by Senator Norris on potential fraud, there was anecdotal evidence some months ago that this was happening.  To combat that, rather than having people sign on once a month and have their payment paid electronically through their bank and not have to collect it in person, I decided people could sign on once a month but had to collect their payment in the post office every week.  The measure applied to new claimants and we are satisfied it has cut down substantially on any potential fraud.  It is something we must keep under close control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris has covered some of what I wanted to say.  Some constituents brought a matter to my attention of a situation where a landlord has a partner living under the same roof and the partner receives rent supplement.  The evidence is anecdotal.  I believe the situation is widespread in north Dublin.  Is the Minister aware of this?  If it is happening, what can be done about it?  It is something I have not come across before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the clarification the Minister has given.  It is a good idea to have payments collected weekly.</P>
        <P>Another element in the article I read stated that people are not normally asked for clear or photographic identification.  Can the Minister consider introducing that through regulation?  The same article had a build-up of so many incidental facts that an accurate case was suggested.  It was suggested that some people were getting colleagues or friends to sign on for them and there was no photographic check, such as a driver&rsquo;s licences or passport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Brady&rsquo;s point on rent supplement, it is an area where, because we are spending &euro;410 million, we must keep under control who is receiving it for whom.  It can be difficult because we give it to the individual tenant rather than to a landlord.  Records would not be kept under the name of a landlord but under the name of each individual tenant.  I will check if we can have further control on that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris is correct.  We do not look for photographic identification.  When people come in to claim they must bring all their details with them.  If we have evidence that people are signing on behalf of others, which was the story we both read, we must see how we can ensure the right people are getting the money.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 10 and 11, but in Part 1, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;Spouse&rdquo; shall be construed to include marriages and civil partnerships between persons of the same sex which would be recognised in other jurisdictions.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an attempt redefine the term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; to include same sex couples.  In an extraordinary move a number of years ago, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Mary Coughlan, on foot of a decision by the Equality Tribunal which found a case of serious discrimination and violation of human rights because a transport company had denied the same rights to a spouse in a same sex relationship that were available to heterosexual couples whether they were married or not, chose not to address this discrimination but copperfastened the violation of human rights by redefining &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; to exclude people.  We were told, four or five years ago by the then Mini<Col N="23"/>ster, Deputy Coughlan, that this matter would be addressed speedily and was a temporary tidying-up operation.  It has been consistently long-fingered.</P>
        <P>It is disgraceful that this Government, as far as I know, is the only one in Europe to have introduced highly discriminatory legislation of any kind against citizens in the last 15 years.  Citizens were reassured by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, that they had exactly the rights, that it was the responsibility of the law to justify and vindicate those rights, and that sexual orientation must never be used as a reason for discriminating against people.  In an attempt to be helpful, as I always am, I tabled this amendment to address this glaring, blatant and mean-minded attack on the civil and human rights of a vulnerable minority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The reason is the preparation of the Civil Partnership Bill which, as the Senator knows, is due to be published early next year.  It will give civil partnership registration for same sex couples and will also confer a range of rights and obligations.  I intend, following the passing of that Bill, to ensure equivalent social welfare treatment will be extended in a future Social Welfare Bill to the category the Senator is talking about.  It is appropriate at this stage, given how advanced the Civil Partnership Bill is, to wait until the issue is dealt with in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not wish to impugn the Minister&rsquo;s honour or goodwill in this matter, since the Social Welfare Bill was used as an instrument to discriminate viciously against gay people, it is perfectly appropriate that it be used in a positive manner to remove the discrimination.  There is nothing to prevent that in the future.  It can be done now quite easily, simply and technically.  It would be a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>I have heard about this Bill for the past four years.  It has now been postponed until the end of 2009.  I had a Civil Partnership Bill on the Order Paper of the House for four years and it was kicked to touch every time.  I cannot remember how many committees there were.  There was the Anne Colley committee, the human rights committee, the committee on the constitution and old Uncle Tom Cobley and all.  The whole gasworks were involved in it and they all said, &ldquo;Yes, go ahead and do it.&rdquo;  The courts said the same.  I do not know what the problem is.  It is being long-fingered again.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister that justice delayed is justice denied.  I look for the amendment to be accepted.  I am not anti-family.  I would like the Minister to know that because a Senator from Wexford on the Government side of the House produced material on supporting the family.  It was apparently intended to undermine those of us taking a progressive point of view.  I offered to sign it and begged to have it given to me so I too could support the family.  I did not come out of the hot tap in the bath.  I came from a family.  I support the family.  I do not support it with uncritical fervour regardless of whether the father is fiddling with the children or there are other types of abuse going on.  There are some pretty rotten families.  To use the family as a scapegoat for denying people human rights is an idiotic piece of nonsense.  I do not accept what the Minister has to say on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The difference between now and previous occasions is that the scheme for the Civil Partnership Bill was approved by Government last year.  Preparation is well under way, unlike previous occasions when generalities were being discussed.  That Bill will have a significant impact on same sex couples and on their rights.  Therefore, it is appropriate to wait until that Bill has dealt with those issues so that I can then follow it up afterwards in a social welfare Bill, which is my intention.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="24"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her courteous response.  This will be my last intervention on this matter.  To have something in the heads of a Bill does not matter a tuppenny damn.  In the Charities Bill 2007, we had a clear indication that human rights would be included as it had been included in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales and even Australia.  However, it was suddenly whipped out.  How do I know that my human rights will not be whipped out at a convenient moment?  The fact that it is in the heads of a Bill has no significance whatever in law.  That is what we are here for.  We are not here to daydream about how wonderful it might be in 2009 if the Government gets itself together and does something.  We are here to legislate.</P>
        <P>With the greatest regret, I do not accept what the Minister has to say.  I have had too many promises for too long.  There has been too much of what the late Sean O&rsquo;Casey would have called &ldquo;prognostication and prevarication&rdquo;.  I will call votes on all these things from now until the Government stirs itself and does something.  It has been long enough in the waiting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is obvious that increases in social assistance payments are to be welcomed in any debate on social welfare.  Such payments are made, following means tests, to assist those who have not paid sufficient PRSI contributions.  This section lists the allowances <Col N="25"/>to which it refers.  Like many other Senators, I made specific reference to carer's allowance during the Second Stage debate.  I asked the Minister to give serious consideration over the next few months, as plans are being made for the next budget and social welfare Bill, to the possibility of removing the means test element of the carer's allowance payment.  This proposal has been around for almost as long as the carer's allowance payment.  One of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, discussed this issue in this House on a number of occasions.  When he gave us an estimate, or guesstimate, of how much the removal of the means test would cost, the figure in question seemed quite reasonable.  I appreciate that this debate is taking place in difficult economic times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The carer's allowance payment has helped to transform the lives of thousands of people in all parts of the country.  It allows many elderly people to remain in their own homes and communities, which is where they want to be.  The State is getting extraordinarily good value for money from the carer's allowance scheme.  A little flexibility has been introduced to the scheme over the years.  It has been decided that a carer does not need to reside in the same house as the person being cared for, as long as there is a sufficient link between them.  I welcome the decision to improve the income disregard figure significantly.  I hope that kind of policy will continue.  The kernel of the matter is the issue of universality, which we recently debated in the context of medical cards and college fees, etc.  If there is one statement we should make in the context of universality, it is to give full support to elderly people who wish to remain in their own communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is currently introducing the fair deal nursing home scheme.  I am sure it will represent an improvement on what is in place at present.  Regardless of how good the fair deal scheme will be, or how well we look after people when we give them beds in nursing homes, our aspiration must be to help the maximum possible number of people to remain in their own homes and communities.  The carer's allowance payment is a key aspect of this policy position.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to ensure her political priority in her current portfolio is to dramatically reform the carers allowance scheme so that everybody who provides full-time care to those who need such attention gets the maximum carer's allowance payment without being subject to a means test.  Such a strong statement of social solidarity would make it clear that this country has an ethos of looking after its elderly people.  We all aspire to be elderly at some stage in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The care of the elderly in this country is not just a matter for nursing homes.  Most people prefer to remain in their own communities, regardless of how well nursing homes are run, how clean the beds are and how fine the rooms are.  The carer's allowance scheme plays a significant part in allowing people to remain in their homes and communities with their families, friends and neighbours.  The Government, and society as a whole, are getting excellent value from each payment of approximately &euro;240 a week.  I appreciate that we will not change the carers allowance regime this afternoon.  As I do almost every year, I plead for improvements in the scheme.  I am glad that Ministers and Governments have listened and made improvements in the past five or six years.  The real step that needs to be taken, politically and economically, is to declare that we will ensure that those who provide full-time care to elderly people who need such attention will be rewarded with the maximum carer's allowance, which is a modest payment.  I know what we should do if we have to decide whether to pay &euro;250 a week to a carer, or to direct between &euro;500 and &euro;800 to a nursing home.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to put this matter at the top of her agenda as she plans for the next few difficult months and the inevitably difficult budget that will follow the recent budget.  In times of difficulty and limited resources there are areas of economic and social policy in which we must try to make a real difference.  In the social welfare Bills in the past five or six years, the one area that stands out is the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I welcome those improvements.  One funda<Col N="26"/>mental further step needs to be taken.  It is a political statement of ethos as to what we stand for regarding our elderly.  We want to see the maximum numbers of our elderly living out their lives in their homes and communities.  I would like to get the Minister&rsquo;s views on the matter.  She should give it serious political attention in the coming months.  There have been reports and analysis.  We now need genuine political will.</P>
        <P>I strongly commend the attitude of one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  He made a difference through various amendments to regulations and rules.  He seemed willing to work towards removing the means test for this payment.  I ask the Minister to continue that work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit was disallowed.  In my Second Stage speech I referred to the Christmas bonus for jobseekers.  I ask the Minister to review that entire section.  It is wholly unfair that people made redundant in recent months will be unable to avail of a Christmas bonus and that their payment will run out after 12 months instead of 15 months, which was the case heretofore.  These people have paid their tax and PRSI for some time.  In my Second Stage contribution I referred to a lady who worked for 12 years and will now have nothing to supplement her income.  I wish to address the issue of mortgages later.  These people are really strapped for cash.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my Seanad colleagues regarding the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance is not always needed for an elderly person.  I know a relatively young man in his 50s who is severely disabled and is having awful problems getting the allowance.  In south Tipperary no home help has been allocated since August despite the same money having been allocated for the service.  Is there any reason for this being so?  I support my colleague&rsquo;s comments on the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Those in receipt of this benefit are set to lose up to &euro;40 per week if they are disallowed it as a result of different means testing now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I just came in on this debate and have not read too much about it.  I agree with all the points made, certainly by Senator Bradford, on the home help and carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It is all about community and how we can best keep the elderly and those who are not well in their own families, which would be ideal.  No doubt the Minister will have great empathy with the points made here this afternoon.  Although perhaps not in the short term, the Minister might keep this in mind.  We would all like to find ways we can best help the community and improve society by having those people within the environment of their own families and neighbours, who want to help.  Many people would benefit from the carer&rsquo;s allowance in this regard.  In the long term the Minister might rethink the issue and might include it in her agenda for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully appreciate what Senators are saying about the value of carers in our community and that they support looking after the young and old in their own homes.  At present approximately 44,000 people are in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment.  Of those 14,200 are getting the half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Of course each of these will get the increase set out in the section of &euro;7 or &euro;3.50 for the half rate.  To remove the means test completely would cost &euro;150 million in a full year.  I would question whether that would give us the best value for money.  Senator Prendergast raised the need for more home help, which involves the Department of Health and Children.  Some carers would claim they would like to see the money that goes towards means testing going towards more home help, more respite care, more community facilities and more day-care services that would be of support to carers who really need it rather than lifting the means test and giving it to those who may have financial means even though their demands as a carer would be great.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>A carers&rsquo; strategy is being prepared and is being co-ordinated through the Department of the Taoiseach, because it involves more than just social welfare and affects the areas of health and facilities.  That strategy will be available in the new year.  I am not convinced that amount of money is best spent by lifting a means test particularly when there are demands of all other areas.</P>
        <P>The Christmas bonus has been always given to long-term social welfare recipients.  That is why some people who have recently lost their jobs do not get it.  These are people who would have been in employment until recent months.  While I know it is very difficult for them now, the people on social welfare would have been depending on their &euro;200 a week all year and have come to look forward to that Christmas bonus.  I am glad we were able to give the 100% again this year despite the difficulties we have with our finances.</P>
        <P>For those who cease to get jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit after one year, of course, if they do not have any other means, they will move on to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is at the same level of payment.  In all these payments we are particularly conscious of the difficulties people are having.  One of the reasons there is such pressure on the Exchequer funding is that the budget for my Department is already &euro;19.6 billion just trying to support people, not only the pensioners and carers who we regularly expect to be claiming, but also unfortunately the unemployed following a significant increase in the live register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I would have had a view of her ideology on many issues and would have expected her to be more sympathetic.  As I said, I believe one of her predecessors, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, not in the sense of producing reports, but in the ongoing engagement he had with us politically, was moving in a more positive direction on carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that her budget was &euro;19.6 billion, which is enormous but necessary and admittedly difficult to find.  If we put the &euro;150 million on the other side of the equation, I would contend that if the means test were eliminated for the carer&rsquo;s allowance the &euro;150 million probably would be insufficient to pay for the extra claims that would come on board.  It is like the ongoing arguments on child benefit, third level fees, medical cards for the over 70s etc. that will never conclude.  At some stage it is necessary to make political decision, notwithstanding the cost.  We need to make the political decision that we value people who provide full-time care and attention to a family member, relative or neighbour and that we also encourage the concept of elderly people spending their futures in their homes and communities rather than in nursing homes.  I do not want to be seen as critical of nursing homes because I recall canvassing at some of them in an election and the proprietors felt I was public enemy number one, simply because I firmly believe that people if at all possible should be encouraged to remain in their homes and communities.</P>
        <P>The &euro;150 million is a substantial amount.  At the moment the Department of Health and Children is paying out enormous sums in nursing home subvention schemes, often paying the enhanced subvention.  In many cases the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is paying out &euro;600 to &euro;700 per week to look after a person in a nursing home.  That person may well be much happier at home and if &euro;250 or &euro;260 a week were paid to a neighbour, family member or friend to look after the person, it would be win-win for everybody concerned, including the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I appreciate what the Minister said but I am a little disappointed with her overall response.  I had hoped she would reflect further because over the next ten to 20 years, as the demographic trends will show, care of the elderly will be a major issue.  We can build all the bright shiny nursing homes we like and put all the elderly people in there if we wish.  That might be some people&rsquo;s view of a solution, but it is not mine.  We need a strong political statement that we <Col N="28"/>will encourage and support people who wish to stay in their homes and communities with their families and friends.  There are many ways of doing this, but in view of what is before us today, the carer&rsquo;s allowance is key.  It is not even the amount of money involved; it is the fact that the State recognises the work carers do for elderly people, relatives, friends or neighbours.  From the point of view of policy, this is something the Minister should consider more fully and with more of an open mind.  I appreciate that &euro;150 million is a large amount of money and probably would not be enough to cover what I am looking for, but the costs on the other side are large also, with subventions and all the other financial remedies that have to be applied when people are not in a position to stay at home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, I am concerned that we are creating a welfare state.  We are almost encouraging people to be on long-term unemployment benefit.  The idea that a person with large mortgage repayments, car loans or credit card bills &mdash; having paid PRSI, which is insurance against unemployment &mdash; is not entitled to benefit is something with which I am not happy.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this.  Like Senator Bradford, I am not happy with her response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is just not possible to pay the Christmas bonus to everybody who is claiming, although I appreciate the difficulties some families have.  People who are running into difficulties with mortgage interest repayments and so on should certainly investigate the mortgage interest supplement.  So far we are providing mortgage interest support to more than 7,000 people.  It is a particularly difficult situation and I have asked that the banks enforce the code of their own federation and refrain from foreclosing on people and taking houses from them where there are facilities to restructure their interest repayments or to re-mortgage.  Benefit will of course be paid to people for 12 months, subject to their having the required stamps, but jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will be available thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the number of eligible persons and proportion thereof availing of the Family Income Supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The reason for this amendment is the number of people who are eligible for FIS but do not claim it.  I remember discussing at length during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill last year the number of people who were not aware of the supplement and were not availing of it.  A report on how many people are availing of the supplement would be useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McFadden is right in thinking that the family income supplement is a valuable payment in cash to low-income families.  Given the evidence we have seen of the difficulties faced by some low-income families, it is important that they can benefit from it.  It is true there has been a lower than anticipated take-up of FIS, but this has improved as a direct result of advertising campaigns.  Once people realised it was there they did benefit from it.  Even public representatives can usefully let people know about its availability.  What I was anxious to do this year, through the thresholds, was to ensure that more people could benefit from the supplement.  Whereas 27,000 people benefited from it in 2008, I anticipate that <Col N="29"/>at least another 2,000 will benefit from it next year because of the changes in the budget.  Next year we will be paying &euro;181 million through this scheme.</P>
        <P>We have been carrying out a study on why people do not take up the FIS.  The ESRI did early research and found that only about one in three of those eligible were actually claiming the supplement.  We have been considering why families who should qualify and who did qualify did not take it up.  When I have the results of that research I will lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and we might get another opportunity to discuss it.  It will certainly guide us in ensuring that those people who do qualify get the supplement.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be off the mark with regard to this query, but this is the only section that seems remotely related to it, as the section mentions reckonable income for social insurance contributions.  I refer to something I raised on Second Stage.  The Minister intended to work on the area of retrospective collection of social insurance contributions from the spouses of self-employed persons.  I am speaking particularly of the spouses of farmers who pay PRSI and qualify for a full contributory pension when they reach the age of 65.  We had better use politically correct language, although what we are basically talking about is farmers&rsquo; wives &mdash; we will have to strike off the record the mention of wives.  The relevant provision was introduced in 1988, but some farmers&rsquo; spouses did not pay PRSI &mdash; although they were contributing fully to the running of the farm, and in many cases either fully owned or part-owned the farm &mdash; because the tax and social welfare returns were done in the other person&rsquo;s name.  Queries on this issue have gone on for ten years, and now the Department has reached some degree of compromise with the IFA and other interest groups.  Leaflets have issued to say that people can seek to have their records considered retrospectively and can make retrospective PRSI contributions to the Department so that they will qualify for pensions in their own right.  We are talking about a small number of people, perhaps a few thousand.</P>
        <P>I wonder how the Department&rsquo;s proposal is progressing.  A leaflet was certainly produced, because I received it from a number of people who were very happy to see it, but in the few cases I have been pursuing, progress seems to be slow, although they have not been rejected.  I appeal to the Minister to try to resolve the issue.  I am not sure whether I am on the right section, or whether there is any relevant section, but the words &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; gave me a little manoeuvrability.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach would be aware of many of these cases. <Col N="30"/> Accountants thought they were doing people a favour by suggesting that all the accounts be in one person&rsquo;s name, but spouses have lost out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am listening to Senator Bradford, and the issue about which he is talking is quite convoluted.  I really need to study this.  We are talking about spouses, farmers&rsquo; wives, farmers&rsquo; husbands, who is a partner, who is paying PRSI, who has not paid PRSI and who is doing the returns.  I would hate to be in that league of thinking because they would buy and sell me.  I would not be able for the way Senator Bradford presented the cases about which he is talking.  I am glad it is the Minister who is to answer this.  It is complicated.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I fail to see how this fits in with stallion fees, stud greyhound fees and profit from woodlands, but I am always happy to take the Senator&rsquo;s questions.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This has been an issue for a long number of years but the spouse, or both partners, has to be able to prove that a partnership existed.  During the year my Department and the Revenue Commissioners agreed on what were the issues indicating that a partnership had existed, such as joint bank accounts or cheque book signatures, and the information in the leaflet to which the Senator referred is very valuable and useful.  It is not just a case of turning up and saying, &ldquo;I worked on the farm all my life.&rdquo;  It must be based on some sort of partnership.  I will get more detailed information for the Senator if that is of assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13- ?><Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>

        <P>Sections 9 to 12, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4: </P>
        <P LI="2">In page 9, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following subsections:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the link between receipt of lone parent allowance and the commencement of employment.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the progress made to support and encourage one parent families in entering the workforce.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My strong view is that there are very few incentives for lone parents to go back to work.  I am sure the Minister in her clinics has come in contact with many lone parents who may be working part-time and find that they are probably better off not working and instead stay at home and keep all their allowances such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowances, their <Col N="31"/>medical card and supplementary child care allowance.  Their grant for the provision of school books is now gone.  These allowances are an automatic entitlement for those on social welfare whereas a person working for 20 hours a week will lose those benefits.  I have first-hand knowledge of these people who lose their benefits.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to say that since I last stood here, nothing has changed.  I was one of those lone parents.  In the 1980s I remember getting an increase of &pound;1 in my wages and I lost &pound;80 in allowances, which was the equivalent of my mortgage repayment.  I was in dire straits but I was fortunate in having a good family.  If I did not have my family at that time I would have been better off not working.  Thankfully I was able to stay in my job but this situation is something very close to my heart and I really empathise with lone parents.  These are well educated women who want to give good example to their children and who desperately want to be in the workforce.  They value the social aspect of work, they want to give good example to their children and they want to escape the poverty trap.  The only way to get out of the poverty trap is not to be on social welfare but rather to work and better oneself.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.  I am not happy with the way the situation has progressed in the past year and I ask for the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept this amendment but I share Senator McFadden&rsquo;s views on the need to ensure we support lone parents.  Senators will be aware that the Government published a discussion document on supporting lone parents and we have been working very actively on it in the past few months to try to bring new proposals to a conclusion.  These proposals not only deal with return to work but also issues of payment, cohabitation, back to education and child care, as there are many issues to do with supporting lone parents.</P>
        <P>In recent years significant changes have been made in the area of income disregards and working hours.  I recently met a group of lone parents and one woman told me she dreads getting a routine increase in her pay every January because it impacts on her book and people depend on the book.</P>
        <P>We are also very aware that despite the significant decrease in poverty levels, according to last year&rsquo;s figures and in the Silke report and the decrease in consistent poverty, unfortunately it is still the child of a lone parent who is four times more likely to be in poverty.  There is a need to address this issue.  We have carried out two localised studies in Coolock and Kilkenny, using a focus group and talking to other Departments, because the availability of child care is a very significant issue.</P>
        <P>We are also examining methods in other countries.  Many countries cease paying a one-parent family allowance when the child is six months, for example, in the case of the United States, and in places such as Finland, Sweden, Canada and New Zealand, it is three, four, five or six years.  The United Kingdom is reducing the age to which payment is made to ten years.  In Ireland as long as the child is in full-time education payment is made up to the age of 22.  There is, therefore, no incentive for any lone parent to return to education.  The intention is to start working very early with the lone parent, from the time she makes her claim, to help her prepare for the day when she will not be a full-time carer of her child but will have had access to education and training.  We have appointed new facilitators and more will be appointed early next year to start work with these lone parents.  There is a big demand for facilitators who will help bring people back into education.  It is my intention to publish the long-term proposals for lone parents in the spring and for that reason I will not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a perception that lone parents will try to dodge in any way they can, they want to work and to receive the lone parent allowance and they will do everything to take as much as they can from the State.  Is there a perception that lone parents want it all and the Minister has a problem trying to work through what they are saying and thinking?  I ask for the Minister&rsquo;s view as that occurred to me as the Minister was replying.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="32"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a number of myths about lone parents.  There is the myth that there are hundreds of teenage mothers, which is not so; the number of teenage mothers is substantially reduced.  There is the myth that lone parents have a number of children, but the majority of lone parents have only one child.  I launched some very good research which was published recently byOne Parent and which has highlighted these issues.  It shows the real desire of lone parents to go into education and to return to work, and we can tap into that desire.</P>
        <P>It has been found in other countries that a voluntary system does not work so it is a case of finding the balance between supporting the lone parent in returning to education and training and being able to reach her potential, and being able to look after her child, which is the first interest in many cases, and ensuring she does not become trapped in dependency on the book.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>While I acknowledge that the Minister has put in place liaison officers, sadly, there are far too few of them.  Some 50 officers would be required to provide a nationwide service because there are many lone parents.  I disagree completely with Senator Ormonde.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not mean to misinterpret Senator Ormonde, but in my experience, a number of lone parents are very eager to work, are well educated and are desperate to give a good education to their families.  I disagree with the Minister, they have not been incentivised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsections:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the number of people in receipt of rent supplement on the waiting list for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the reform of the Rent Supplement Scheme.</P>
        <P LI="1">(6) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on paying Rent Supplement in advance rather than arrears.</P>
        <P LI="1">(7) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on requiring landlords to register with the PRTB in order to be eligible for rent supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The rental accommodation scheme is similar to the family income support.  It is a very good scheme but there are some anomalies with regard to having to be on rent allowance for a certain length of time.  People do not necessarily know about the rental accommodation scheme.  That is not an issue for the Minister but I ask that she examine the fact that people must be on the rent supplement for so many months before qualifying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McFadden on this very good amendment, which is one from which we can derive much information.  The Minister referred to 115 staff that would be brought into the Department.  Where do these people come from?  I fully agree that there must be a degree of flexibility in other Departments to allow the Minister to take people from other Departments and bring them into the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Perhaps it is a new phenomenon in Departments but it is welcome.  We should have more flexibility.  What Departments are these people coming from or are they temporary staff to do this job?</P>
        <P>The amendment will require extra work but it is a worthwhile amendment.  I hope the Minister will accept it.  It is an important function of the Department that we would know how many people are in receipt of rent supplement and how many are on the waiting list.  It is a valuable amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The rent supplement scheme is important in helping people find accommodation.  It is always intended to be a short-term payment.  The way it complements the rental accommodation scheme is very important.  I do not propose to accept the amendment but I will keep the rent supplement under review because of the amount of money we spend on it.  Some 70,000 people benefit from rent supplement.</P>
        <P>There is good co-operation with the councils in implementing the rental accommodation scheme.  In recent years, 15,800 rent supplement recipients have been transferred to the rental accommodation scheme and other social housing options.  In excess of 10,000 other rent supplement recipients have been assessed with a view to transferring them to the rental accommodation scheme.  I envisage that continuing and improving over the next few months.  That scheme rests with local authorities.</P>
        <P>Regarding issues with landlords, our contract is with the tenant.  We give the payment to the tenant.  As soon as payment has been activated, we notify the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, electronically so that it can follow up to ensure the premises is registered.  We <Col N="34"/>find that, with the availability of more premises, rents are coming down and people can get better quality accommodation, which is important.  I will keep the issue under review because it is a substantial sum of money helping a substantial number of people.</P>
        <P>I can tell Senator Burke where the staff are going but I do not know from where they are coming.  We do not yet have the detail but I will pass it on to him if I get it.  It is open to all Departments.  The important thing is that it is not additional staff coming into the Civil Service.  They are coming from other Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a new development that people are moving around within Departments?  Has it always been the case or are people more flexible now in respect of moving from one Department to another?  It is a good idea that people would be flexible and that where there is an overload of work, people can move from one Department to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure of the exact answer to the question but there was a Government decision to facilitate the move of 115 people so perhaps it is the exception rather than the norm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>A report on the number of landlords that have registered with the PRTB is a good idea from the point of view of having a record of landlords.  While not pressing the amendment, I ask the Minister to consider this useful exercise.  Some landlords get away with blue murder in respect of the condition of their apartments.  There must be regulation on the number of landlords and how they treat their tenants.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the number of eligible persons and proportion thereof availing of the Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This concerns the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  I referred to it in my contribution on lone parents but it also affects low income families.  In one situation there were two children at either end of the spectrum.  One was an 18 year old doing his leaving certificate and the other was a youngster making her first holy communion.  Both were costly to their parents in respect of buying shoes, clothes or books now that the book grant is gone.  I seek more flexibility and a degree of human interest.  There should be more support to encourage people to remain at work.  This should always be the ethos and it should not be the case that they do not qualify because of one euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  This is a valuable scheme which supports many people and the amount of money provided in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance covers what it is intended to cover, namely, a uniform and shoes.  I would not pretend that it also covers school books and I appreciate the pressure on people in <Col N="35"/>this regard.  This year, &euro;49 million is being spent on it and 200,000 children are benefiting.  When I looked at what we would do next year, the choice was to increase the amount of money available to people or increase the number of people who might benefit from it.  In line with Senator McFadden&rsquo;s thinking, I was more anxious that more people should benefit.  For that reason, instead of increasing the amount I increased the number of people and approximately 18,000 more families will benefit next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and I welcome that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Given all the various price increases, the prices of clothing and footwear have fallen over the past 12 months and I anticipate this will remain the case.  I appreciate the value of the scheme and I will try constantly to ensure that more families benefit from it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a second-tier, employment neutral, child income support payment to target child poverty levels.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This concerns child poverty.  Many children remain in consistent poverty and, with the introduction of the income levy and increases in accident and emergency charges and energy and food costs, a report should be compiled on the introduction of a second-tier employment neutral child income support payment to target these children.  I appreciate the Minister has tried to do this with regard to child benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  An issue is raised with regard to children being at risk of poverty.  As has been mentioned, most of these children tend to be the children of lone parents and they must always be a target group.  Payment of child benefit has always been the way in which we have supported families.  Child benefit is paid in respect of approximately 1.071 million children.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government refers to a second-tier payment.  One of the difficulties is that, despite research carried out by Dr. John Sweeney on this matter, no consensus has been reached on how it would be made.  This has also been examined by NESC with regard to combining the qualified child allowance and the family income supplement.  We have a number of ways to support children.  The ESRI research on the family income supplement indicated it could help to support families.</P>
        <P>I am not sure how quickly we can move on this in the absence of consensus.  This year, to try to target support for the children most in need, rather than increasing child benefit, which is received by everybody and for which we did not have sufficient money available in the <Col N="36"/>budget package, I increased the qualified child allowance by &euro;2.  At least it is targeted at the people who need it most.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I must accept the Minister&rsquo;s reply, but I am not very happy with it.  Any organisation will tell us about the number of children who avail of this and if a breakfast club or other such facility was not provided by organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul children would go to school hungry.  Children go to bed cold.  Between now and next year I ask the Minister to consider a two-tier payment to target the most vulnerable children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on eligibility criteria for the Early Childcare Supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is also important.  While everybody recognises the benefit of the early child care supplement, it would be useful to have a report on the eligibility criteria laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The early childhood supplement is designed to support the cost of child care and not only that but to support parents in looking after their children wherever they choose to do so.  It is a good scheme.  Changes have been introduced by the budget, largely as a cost-saving measure and to ensure that we continue to target children at pre-school age.  When it was introduced it was on a quarterly basis until the child reached six years of age.  The majority of children are in school by the age of five and a half years so the payment will stop from then and it will be paid as a monthly allowance rather than quarterly.  I do not see the need to accept the amendment to make reports on the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to payments ceasing when the child reaches five and a half years, when children go to school they finish at 2 p.m. and parents incur major child care costs after 2 p.m.  It is a bit mean and callous to remove the payment for those six months.  It is one of those little social welfare provisions that has been snuck into the budget about which people will not be aware until next year.  I completely abhor it and I think it is mean.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The savings from this next year will be &euro;97 million, which is a significant amount of money.  Given the way the scheme was devised in the first instance, the parents of a child born in March received the payment for the full quarter of January, February and March, which meant they received a payment for a child not yet born.  If a child was six in January the parent received the payment for January, February and March.  It has been changed to a monthly payment from the time the child is born until he or she reaches the age of five and a half.  It was always designed to support children in full-time child care and the costs paid by parents for that rather than after school care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, before section 24, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;24.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the implications of easing the qualifying criteria for Back to Education Allowance so that unemployed persons, low income earners and persons dependent on social welfare can avail of the payment immediately.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is important &mdash; it was raised by my colleagues in the Lower House on several occasions &mdash; as it concerns the back to education allowance for unemployed persons, low income earners and people dependent on social welfare.  The impetus of the amendment is that those categories of people would be able to immediately avail of the back to education allowance and not have to wait for a year.  It seems stupid, particularly in this economic downturn, that people must sign on for an entire year prior to availing of the back to school allowance.</P>
        <P>Everybody agrees that education is the key to getting out of this recession.  People will be demotivated because there are no jobs, not even the most low paid jobs, and I cannot understand why the Minister would have them wait for an entire year and be paid by the State for doing nothing while they could be upskilling, retraining or getting ready for a job.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s amendment.  It is regrettable that people who have lost their jobs, or self-employed people who have lost their businesses, cannot avail of the back to education allowance if they have been in receipt of social welfare for less than six months.  It is unreasonable that such persons must waste a year before they can participate in this scheme.  I am aware of  people, including hairdressers and other self-employed persons who have lost their businesses, who are in very difficult circumstances.  The Minister should take on board this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The back to education allowance is an important benefit and one that I have promoted since my appointment.  One of the positive statistics to emerge from the latest Central Statistics Office data is the 24% increase in the numbers participating in the scheme.  This indicates its effectiveness.  The scheme was designed to support the long-term unemployed and to offer particular support to those without second level education, who are the most likely to remain on the live register in the long term.  That is why the time requirement for such persons is only six months, while it is 12 months for those with a higher educational attainment.  However, for those participating in the education action plan, the timeframe is nine months, and those in receipt of statutory redundancy may obtain it immediately.  Unfortunately, increasing numbers are finding themselves in that situation.</P>
        <P>From the time people sign on the live register, they will be interviewed every three months, and more and more will become involved in the employment action plan.  However, I must ensure at all times that the scheme is not abused.  For example, we do not want a situation where people who have done their leaving certificates sign on for three months and avail of the back to education allowance even though they intend to go to college in any case.  It is a generous scheme, paid at the top rate of the relevant payment.  In those circumstances, people would receive &euro;200 per week in addition to a third level grant.  It is a valuable scheme but it must be targeted at those who will benefit most from it.  Lone parents are benefiting as well as those who are unemployed.</P>
        <P>I will, however, keep the matter under review, particularly as the live register is growing, to ensure we are targeting those who require upskilling.  There is good co-operation between my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in regard to F&Aacute;S, and the <Col N="38"/>Department of Education and Science in seeking to ensure that more people are interviewed, supported and offered training places with F&Aacute;S and that places which have not been taken up on post-leaving certificate courses and in the institutes of technology can be availed of.  That co-operation is working well, in conjunction with the work of the facilitators in encouraging people to avail of that support.  The 24% increase in participation is encouraging.  I assure Senators, in light of my personal interest in the matter, that I will keep the scheme under review to ensure we are targeting the correct people for support.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, before section 24, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      
        <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART 2A</P>
        <P Just="Center">Reporting Requirements</P>
        <P FLI="1">&ldquo;24.&mdash;The Minister shall provide that the following reports shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 3 months of the commencement of this Act:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) A report on the adequacy of each social welfare payment.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) A report on the eligibility criteria for the Disability Allowance.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) A report on reducing application processing time for social welfare supports.</P><Col N="39"/>
        <P LI="1">(4) A report on the removal of the Habitual Residence Condition from the Child Benefit payment.</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) A report on the progress made in tackling:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) Child poverty.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) Pensioner poverty.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) Lone Parent poverty.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) Poverty of the long-term unemployed.</P>
        <P LI="1">(6) A report on increasing the Living Alone Allowance.</P>
        <P LI="1">(7) A report on data security within the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P LI="1">(8) A report on the nature of the anti-fraud initiatives that are in use or consideration for future use by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P LI="1">(9) A report on the possibility of extending the free travel scheme to include other services providers in relation to free travel benefits for people in rural areas.</P>
        <P LI="1">(10) A report on the rationale for keeping Qualified Child Allowances at a low level over the past decade.</P>
        <P LI="1">(11) A report on the amalgamation of any and all agencies into the Department and the rationale thereof.</P>
        <P LI="1">(12) A report on the number of people who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments who are seeking mortgage Supplementary Support.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I ask the Minister that a number of reports would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They include a report on the adequacy of each social welfare payment, the eligibility criteria for disability allowance, reducing application processing time for social welfare supports, and the habitual residency condition for the child benefit payment.</P>
        <P>All those areas speak for themselves and, while I accept there have been increases in social welfare payments, the question arises as to whether they are just to meet the rising cost of living.  I do not believe those increases are adequate.</P>
        <P>The habitual residency condition for the child benefit payment is unfair.  We have enshrined the rights of the child in our Constitution and this benefit should be equal and fair.  I ask the Minister to address that issue when replying.</P>
        <P>We spoke earlier about child poverty.  That is also a worthy request.  We spoke also about lone parents and how to incentivise people and get them off long-term unemployment.  Some of my colleagues spoke about the value of the F&Aacute;S community employment schemes, asked that they be protected and that positions would be available for long-term unemployed people on CE schemes.</P>
        <P>Subsection (12) in the proposed new section calls for a report on the number of people who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments who are seeking mortgage supplementary support.  The Minister has already said that 7,000 people are in receipt of supplementary help from the Department of Social and Family Affairs but many more people will be looking for that help after Christmas.  It has been said also that some employers are holding off making people <Col N="40"/>redundant until after Christmas.  I dislike using those words because of the fear being experienced by people.</P>
        <P>We had a dramatic Order of Business earlier where Senator Harris called for a state of emergency to be declared.  I believe we have no idea what is going on or how to deal with the crisis.  I do not understand how it is of any advantage that a bank would repossess a home.  The Minister referred to that issue earlier and in the lower House, Deputy Michael Noonan spoke about what is happening in the United Kingdom with the banks&rsquo; moratorium on mortgage repayments and the interest payment guarantee.</P>
      
        <P>Now that talks are taking place with the banks, we have the upper hand with them.  We have bailed them out.  Both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have been most supportive because we need the banks.  Now it is their turn to look after the people by being sympathetic and not putting pressure on unfortunate people who find themselves, through no fault of their own, without a job.</P>
        <P>I am particularly anxious that subsection (12) in the amendment is fulfilled and that a report is issued on the number of people who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  The full extent of that problem will not be visible until early in the new year.</P></Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The adequacy of social welfare payments will always be questioned.  We have always tried to maintain the basic rate of payment at 35% to 37% of the average industrial wage and we succeeded in doing that again this year.  Obviously, it was not possible to be as generous in the budget package this year as in previous years but we provided for a 3.3% increase which we anticipated would match inflation for next year.  It will probably be far more than inflation and some people are even predicting there might be deflation next year.  Within that budget we had to target the people who needed the help most.  The increase of &euro;7 in many of the payments was widely welcomed.</P>
        <P>The mortgage interest supplement has been, until this year, a little known and little used welfare payment.  There are 7,000 people currently in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 70% on this time last year.  It demonstrates the need for the payment.  The estimate for this year is approximately &euro;26 million.  There is a higher estimate for next year but I am not sure that it will be sufficient to meet demand.  People who are having difficulty with their mortgage payments should go to their financial institution and reschedule their payments.  Unfortunately, many people put the matter to one side, let the problem run and do not deal with it.  The advice from the money advice and budgeting service is that people should deal with the issue immediately by going to their financial institution to discuss restructuring.  The mainstream financial institutions are willing to do that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Last year there was a total of 50 repossessions of houses by the banks.  Obviously, there is an increase in repossessions but some of them appear to be by sub-prime lenders rather than the financial institutions governed by the Banking Federation code.  Again, I urge the banks to be flexible and understanding with people.  The banks will be unable to sell the house anyway and the people will end up losing their home, living on rent supplement, going on the RAS scheme and getting a social house.  At the end of the day the State pays everywhere and the bank will be left with a house it cannot sell.  The mortgage interest supplement scheme is available to help people in paying their mortgage interest.</P>
        <P>Other issues are dealt with in the amendment.  I am aware the mechanism in the amendment is used by Senators to raise these issues because it is difficult to put down an amendment on a social welfare Bill that might impose a cost on the Exchequer.  However, constant reviews are <Col N="41"/>carried out on some of the major payments.  Different payments are reviewed every year to ensure we are meeting the requirements of those most in need.  We will continue to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I take issue with the Minister about the banks.  She echoed every word I said about them but I believe the Government has a responsibility to negotiate a deal on behalf of people who find themselves in a position where their house are repossessed.  I have gone to the MABS with people and they have been told to go to the bank to negotiate a deal.  The bottom line, however, is that people have no money.  Regardless of how well they budget or keep their affairs in order, they are at the mercy of the bank.  If the bank tells them it will repossess their house, they will end up in social housing or in receipt of rent supplement, as the Minister correctly pointed out.</P>
        <P>The Government brokered a deal for the banks.  The Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet can equally broker a deal on behalf of the people and ensure there is a moratorium on payments for people who find themselves in this very serious situation.  The problem will become more apparent in January and February.  I urge the Minister to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s comments and I echo her request.  How many people are having their houses repossessed each week?  As the Minister said, it will be a far greater strain on the Government to have more people in need of rent supplement or being put on the RAS scheme, while the banks will have houses they cannot sell or use.  It makes more sense to have some type of system whereby people are only required to pay interest until their position improves.  The banks are not the only ones hurting in this situation.  It goes down the line and it is the most vulnerable people who are being badly affected.</P>
        <P>There is constant reference to next year.  Next year is the week after next, which is very close.  The bleakness will not go away.  People seem to be focused on one day, Christmas, but for many the reality and worries afterwards will be far greater and harder to deal with.  They are frightened of what is coming down the line for them.  Every day the radio and other media reports are getting worse, with reports on the bleak economic outlook, how fruitless the situation is, the trouble the banks are in, the international situation and the crises here and there.  People are extremely worried.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator McFadden that we have the upper hand with the banks.  If the Government is in negotiations with the banks to arrive at a deal that will bail them out, we must be in a position to say to people: &ldquo;It is coming down the line and because we have been able to do this with the banks, hopefully they will be able to do this for you.&rdquo;  That is what we are seeking.  It is not an unreal expectation or request.  The Government has the remit to do it.  The proposal should be given serious consideration.  The amendment is good and seeks something positive, and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support the amendment, particularly the element Senator Prendergast singled out, the issue of mortgages.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business for many months before the situation became disastrous.  I am concerned about it.  At least, mortgage interest rates have fallen.  However, we are moving towards a situation of considerable unemployment and the point made by my two colleagues about the banks is significant.  The banks are being bailed out by taxpayers&rsquo; money but there is still a significant number of repossessions.  Over the past six months to a year I have put on record the steady increase in the number of repossession orders given by the courts in Dublin.  One of the judges drew attention to this as an important and significant fact.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by pointing to the biblical lesson in this.  There is a parable in the Bible, with which the Minister will be familiar, about a man who is in debt to his master.  The debt was forgiven by his master but the man was then utterly severe with somebody lower down the <Col N="42"/>chain of indebtedness and insisted on his pound of flesh.  The master took a grim view of that and of somebody whose debt had been forgiven being so unfeeling and callous.  There is that element in the banks.  They got themselves into this situation because they could not be bothered with the little people, the people who were described by an American woman, whose name I cannot recall, as the little people who pay taxes.  These are the people who take out bank loans and so forth.  We have all seen the way in which the banks have treated ordinary customers with indifference and went after big corporate sources, futures, derivatives, gambling on the Stock Exchange and so forth.  When they got themselves into trouble, however, they had to seek money from the taxpayer.  That is all I have to say in support of my two colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the previous three speakers on the issue of house repossessions.  When the State, Government and taxpayer is coming to the aid of the banking and financial institutions in a fashion not yet determined, we need to demand some form of reciprocation.  That so many people have difficulty with their mortgage repayments is a cause of grave concern.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of court orders for repossessions being granted each week is staggering.  While action is not taken on foot of many of these court orders, once granted a repossession order may proceed.  This leaves many people living in fear of losing their homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the mechanisms in place to address this issue.  The supplementary welfare system, for example, provides assistance for people in difficulty with mortgage repayments.  We must send a strong political signal to the banks and mortgage agencies that we expect them to tread softly with regard to those in difficulty.  As many Senators noted, the economy needs a banking system and financial houses if it is to survive.  On the other hand, mortgage companies and banks also need customers and home owners if they are to survive.  The Minister, Minister for Finance and Taoiseach should hold direct talks with the lending agencies to impress on them &mdash; we do not need to implore or beg them &mdash; that the financial institutions must respond to the generosity of the Government and taxpayers by showing flexibility, compassion and common sense to those experiencing financial difficulty.</P>
        <P>Jobs are being lost at a record rate and the trend is set to continue for some time.  However, like all economic cycles, the current one will come to an end.  The majority of those experiencing mortgage difficulties are responsible citizens who are not seeking a free lunch but time and space to get their financial affairs in order.  The financial institutions should respond generously and in the same fashion as the State responded when they found themselves in a difficult position in recent months.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am on record as asking financial institutions to show forbearance with clients, not to foreclose early and to give people an opportunity to reschedule their payments or pay only the interest on mortgages, an issue raised by Senator Prendergast.  However, arrangements the Government makes on behalf of taxpayers to ensure money is made available more freely to the banks in order that small businesses can secure loans, overdrafts and credit are with the main financial and banking institutions.  In general, these institutions are not seeking repossessions in the courts.  It is the sub-prime lenders and mortgage companies, some of which gave mortgages too generously in the first instance, which are trying to claw back properties.  For this reason, I am not sure to what extent the Government can influence the major banks.  When I referred to this issue in conversation with the chief executive of one of the two large banks the other day, I was informed that the bank in question had only two or three repossessions.  The Government is examining this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast referred to a sense of doom and gloom among members of the public.  While there is no doubt she is correct, Ireland continues to attract significant foreign direct <Col N="43"/>investment.  Many major projects have been announced in recent months, for example, by Pfizer, Intel and Coca Cola, which will create jobs.  Infrastructure is still being built and the Government continues to invest heavily in a range of projects.  The Government will also announce an economic plan aimed at regenerating the economy.</P>
        <P>I accept that many people are losing their jobs.  Unfortunately, my Department has made provision for an average of 290,000 people being on the live register next year.  This is terrible for the individuals in question and their families but we must ensure Irish entrepreneurs and companies around the world know that Ireland is open for business and has a well-educated, flexible and adaptable workforce.  Employers like being here because the workforce is so flexible and adaptable.  While the news on the jobs front has not been good, there is scope, through good economic planning, to be able to improve matters.</P>

	<P>Has the Minister held direct talks with the financial institutions on this issue and, if not, does she plan to do so?  I noted her remark that she had made her views known.  The Minister or other Ministers should discuss this issue with the banks and other mortgage lenders and strongly impress on them the Government&rsquo;s thinking and position on this issue.  Will she consider doing this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not held formal talks.  As I indicated, however, I had a casual conversation with the chief executive of one of the large banks.  The Government deals with the major institutions whereas the companies taking cases to court tend to be sub-prime lenders.  I have discussed the issue with the Minister for Finance and I may discuss it again.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, before section 26, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;26.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on data protection policies and procedures within the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on progress and savings accrued to date as a result of the Department&rsquo;s anti-fraud initiatives within the Department of Social and Family Affairs.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P FLI="0">The issue of fraud arose in our discussion of an earlier amendment.  While I am aware the system has been tightened up dramatically in recent months, a report on savings which have accrued as a result of the Department&rsquo;s new anti-fraud initiatives should be laid before the House.  A taxi driver in Athlone told a friend of mine that he hops on Ryanair flights to visit his family who live abroad but claims social welfare and child benefit payments here.  Unfortunately, neither I nor my friend know the identity of the man in question, although I attempted to find out who he was.  However, he was laughing at the way in which he was looked after and treated in this country.  I am sure there are similar cases.  While I welcome the hard line taken by the Minister on one level, as I indicated on the issue of child benefit, we must avoid penalising ordinary, honest people who are not being fraudulent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>To give the Senator an idea of the control activity which has taken place this year, at the end of September almost 290,000 reviews and 2,300 employer inspections had been carried out.  These measures produced savings of &euro;337 million.  The special investigation unit is doing more regular interviews of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments recipients, especially those with high risk ratings.  These may be the people to which the Senator refers.  Since July, the unit has secured savings of &euro;5.7 million.</P>
        <P>We have been targeting child benefit and there is a high risk group there.  There are potential savings of &euro;13 million in that area.  We take this matter very seriously, to the extent that prosecutions have been taken.  By the end of 2007, 361 cases were sent to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office and 243 cases were finalised.  There were 26 cases of personation, which addresses the issue of photographic evidence raised by Senator Norris.  By the end of October this year, almost 300 cases had been sent to the courts.  We take fraud very seriously in the Department.  I do not think there is a need for a report on it, but I will make information available at any time.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14: In page 21, before section 26, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;26.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a review on the effectiveness of the Fuel Allowance in view of rising energy prices.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The Minister shall, within 1 week of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the progress of the National Carers Strategy.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the eligibility criteria for the Carers Allowance with a view to recognising and supporting the work of young carers.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the financial implications of providing Carers with a full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance/Benefit for every person they care for.</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of extending the number of hours a week a Carer may be employed while retaining entitlement to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P LI="1">(6) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report considering the implications of awarding PRSI contributions to carers on the same basis as paid contributions so that carers can improve their pension entitlement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are a number of issues in this and I will try to be as brief as possible, particularly on the effectiveness of the fuel allowance.  The Minister emphasised that the greatest advantage is the extension of it rather than the &euro;2 increase.  That is not adequate.  It sounds very dramatic, but there are people who go to bed early because they are too cold to sit up at night.  I ask that a report be laid before the House and that research is done to see how people are coping with rising energy costs.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford spoke about carers, who comprise a very disappointed group.  The increases they received in the budget are only inflationary.  There is not a penny extra for them and they feel let down and betrayed.  I insist that a report be produced on the national carers strategy, which has been sought for a long time.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford spoke about the disregard for people who want to work.  It is very difficult for carers, who are emotionally and physically worn out.  They are exhausted.  There is no incentive for them and they are suffering.  According to carers, there are 3.5 million unpaid hours.  There are 161,000 carers in the country and they are saving the State a significant amount of money by caring for their loved ones.  The optimum situation, as Senator Bradford stated, is for people to be able to stay at home.  It is a saving and it is foolhardy not to listen to them and consider their views.  The Minister stated how much it would cost to have no means test &mdash; I cannot remember the figure &mdash; but it is something she should look into because in the long run it will cost significantly less to keep a person at home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have addressed the issue of carers and we will produce the carers strategy.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  Regarding the fuel issue, at the time budget submissions were made fuel prices were at the highest level ever and they are now at the lowest in 20 years, so now is a good time to buy.  Pensioners in particular were glad of the two week extension, which ensures the fuel allowance is received from the end of September until, I hope, the beginning of the warmer weather.  It is paid for 32 weeks.</P>
        <P>There is also the household benefits package.  The price of gas and electricity might rise but that does not affect household benefits because the State will pick up the extra payment for that as the pensioners receive units rather than a particular amount.  Approximately 300, 000 people benefit from the fuel allowance scheme at a cost of &euro;170 million.  Next year it will cost more than &euro;200 million.  The electricity and gas allowance costs &euro;170 million and benefits 358,000 people.</P>
        <P>It is very costly to support people with fuel but it should also be seen in the context of better housing stock and central heating being installed in new council homes, warmer homes improvement schemes and other activities designed to support people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept much of what the Minister is saying, I am also very disappointed because I am sure she is aware that in rural Ireland people are no longer able to cut turf, and when one is older one cannot do such things.  As I said repeatedly, &euro;2 is not enough to buy a bale of briquettes, not to mention the cost of a bag of coal.  I am very disappointed.</P>
        <P>The rolling out of these schemes is not consistent.  In some areas, particularly in Dublin, they benefit those who need them most but that is not the case in rural Ireland, where they are not rolled out to the same extent.  Some examples are schemes for the insulation of houses, replace<Col N="46"/>ment of windows and so on.  I ask the Minister to take a keener look at this area in terms of consistency throughout the country and increase the fuel allowance by the price of a bag of coal.</P>

	<P>I will comment briefly on section 28?  I pay tribute to the work that is done by the money advice and budgeting service.  It is an important arm of the social welfare system.  It does a great deal to assist people who are bewildered by the financial predicament in which they find themselves.  I commend any provision the Minister might consider that would strengthen this worthwhile service, to which I pay tribute.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 30 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P><Col N="47"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose this section of the Bill, just as I will oppose every section in Part 5.  It may seem like a slight waste of time to oppose the definition of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; for the purposes of this part of the Bill.  I will give my reasons for opposing Part 5 when we reach section 31, which provides for the dissolution of the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Norris in opposing Part 5 of the Bill.  The Combat Poverty Agency has made a number of presentations to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  The agency has been exemplary in carrying out its research function.  Its professionalism and expertise have allowed it to operate as an independent voice.  It has been highly critical of a number of developments.  It has spoken out on fuel poverty, for example.  I completely disagree with the proposal to abolish the agency.  I oppose Part 5 of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what my colleagues have said about this excellent agency, which has done immense work over the years.  I regret the Government&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the agency, which provides a great service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators are aware, Part 5 of the Bill is necessary to give effect to the Government decision to integrate the Combat Poverty Agency with the Office of Social Inclusion in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The decision arose from a recommendation made by a review group that was established on foot of a Government decision in June 2007.  Long before I was appointed as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, it was decided that it was necessary to review the role of the agency in light of changes that had happened in the preceding years.  Other agencies and structures had been established to do the work associated with combating poverty that is central to the work of the Government and is of interest to all Senators and Deputies.  Although the legal wording of section 31 of the Bill refers to the &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; of the agency, it is not intended to absorb it without recognition into the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It is intended to enhance both sections, the Office of Social Inclusion and the Combat Poverty Agency, both of which do good work.</P>
        <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was established at a trying time in Ireland, when it was decided that there was a need for a body to highlight issues, conduct independent research and contribute to Government policy.  Those aims and aspirations are as relevant today as they were then.  We have to look at what has happened in the meantime.  The community and voluntary pillar has a valuable role in social partnership.  There are offices of social inclusion in various Departments.  A number of good non-governmental organisations contribute to policy-making and participate in the social inclusion and budget forums etc.  The Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion has been mentioned.  There is a high level group of Government officials in this area.  Many people have contributed to the significant amount of research that has been undertaken in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  An independent voice has been given to those who experience poverty.  One of the things the Combat Poverty Agency has been very good at is helping people to participate in domestic and EU forums in this country and in Brussels.</P>
        <P>I envisage that all the work I have mentioned, such as the research and policy advice that directly gives a voice to those who experience poverty, will continue in an enhanced and focused way that ensures we get the best possible value from the skills of the staff of the Department and the agency.  That was the intention of the review in the first instance.  The challenge we face is to ensure that the new structure works.  Although the board members and staff of the Combat Poverty Agency to whom I spoke expressed their disappointment with the Government&rsquo;s decision &mdash; they wanted the agency to be retained as an independent body &mdash; they are willing to co-operate to ensure that the work of the agency continues and is enhanced.  I am satisfied that we can and will work with them to ensure that happens.  I appreciate that <Col N="48"/>other issues will be raised by Senators as this debate continues.  The section of the Bill under discussion provides for the dissolution, in a legal sense, of the agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This section is strenuously opposed.  I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments during the debate on section 30.  She seemed to be somewhat queasy about accepting responsibility for this decision.  She pointed out that the original decision was not made on her watch.  I agree with that and accept it.  If she had been there, perhaps a voice might have been raised against it.  She honestly accepted that there continues to be a need for independent research etc. and she suggested that this need could be met within the Department.  That has not been the experience of any professional body I have ever come across.  I have been involved in politics and management long enough to know that the proposal to incorporate, absorb or swallow the agency into the office of social inclusion is bad practice and will inevitably militate against the independence that is necessary.  It has to be considered in the context of the destruction, in effect, not only of the Combat Poverty Agency but also of every other organ that has spoken out on behalf of marginalised people.  The Government has a really shameful record in this regard.  I am sorry that some of my decent friends are involved in it.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, used soft language when she said that the work of the Combat Poverty Agency will be &ldquo;enhanced and focused&rdquo;.  I would hate to be &ldquo;enhanced and focused&rdquo; in this manner because it would mean the extinction, in effect, of the life form that I am.  If it is not the case that the agency is being made extinct, in effect, why is every group speaking out, as a coalition, against this savage attack on the most vulnerable people in society?  In the week in which we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is absolutely insufferable that the Government is embarking on such a swinging series of demolitions.  I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I spoke at great length about this issue.  I do not intend to be tedious on this matter, unless I am seriously provoked.  I am sure I would be restrained by the Cathaoirleach if I were to attempt to be tedious.</P>
        <P>I do not believe for a single minute that any money will be saved as a result of this proposal.  Questions about the nature of these savings have been asked by Senators on the Government side.  During the break, while we were waiting for the last division to take place, I checked whether anything was lingering in my little postbox and I was rather interested to find a document setting out the details of a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;50 million that is being provided for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on section 31 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and we are not discussing agriculture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am exactly concentrating on that.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his guidance.  The point I am making is that the Government can suddenly, at 6.50 p.m. on a Tuesday, find &euro;50 million lying around the place, but apparently we are told there must be all these swinging cuts that do not save a penny, will create inefficiencies in the system and will deprive people of their rights.  The Minister may well have been supplied with facts or figures <Col N="49"/>that might appear to show otherwise.  I will find great difficulty in swallowing them.  If there is any serious intention to try to hoodwink people about this, why not subject it to an independent cost-benefit analysis and let us know what are the facts.  I challenge the Government to do that.  I bet it would not have the courage to do so because it knows what the answer will be, as do a few wise old birds on the other side of the House.</P>
        <P>I am opposing this section.  I shall probably confine myself to that one vote.  It shames the House that these words should be read into the record: &ldquo;The Agency shall be dissolved on the commencement of this Part.&rdquo;  What an awful thing.  As we go into the worst recession this country has probably ever seen, the Government addresses it, as it addressed the question of inequality and discrimination, not by curing it, not by reaching out and trying to do something positive, but instead by a negative and destructive action, by collapsing the agency that is more than ever needed during these difficult times.  This is a shameful day&rsquo;s work and I shall certainly call a vote on this issue as I understand my colleagues who have spoken so effectively this afternoon also wish for a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also amazed that the Minister would argue that the work of the Combat Poverty Agency would continue in a more focused manner following its abolition than if it were to continue.</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to comment further.  It is beyond belief that she could argue that.  The Labour Party will certainly be opposing the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly appreciate the interest and passion of the Senators on this matter.  The interest and passion is more about combating poverty than in just having an agency, and everybody would share that.  That will always be at the core of my policies, particularly in the portfolio I now hold.  Senators will be well aware that the development of the DEIS scheme in education was about doing the same thing.  When I talk about a focused way, I mean ensuring there is not overlap and duplication and that it can work closely with other State agencies and Departments, including the National Economic and Social Development Office, the National Economic and Social Council and others I did not mention earlier.  It can be very focused because it can start work immediately on, for example, preparing for the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion in 2010.  As a group, they will be working closely on that and it gives them a set project to do.  Together they will benefit from it.</P>
        <P>Research is a really important part.  I know that Senator Norris of all people would appreciate the importance of evidence-based work.  It has been a measure of the importance they attach to it that the Office of Social Inclusion and the Combat Poverty Agency have commissioned research.  While that will continue, it will not be just research commissioned as a result of a request, but they will initiate that type of work.  We can only combat poverty if we know where is the particular need.  They will be able to identify it from work and research they will do.  They will continue to do that work, sharing the expertise they will have from the new division.  At a strong policy level they will undoubtedly be able to enhance their work.  They will be able to do it in a way that will feed into the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and to the various other bodies I mentioned earlier.  They will also bring their skills and expertise to it in a way that will ensure that the voice of people experiencing poverty is heard.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the work that has been done in recent years.  However, the review was established not as a budgetary issue, but to ascertain how the work can continue in a way that will benefit policy most and to ensure it is feeding in properly.  As a result of the review, this was the recommendation.  From the manner in which the board, the staff and officials in my Depart<Col N="50"/>ment are working through what I appreciate is a difficult time for the staff, it is clear they are very anxious to ensure they keep working on the projects and research they have been working on and that they can start preparing for the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion as a joint group.</P>
        <P>I believe the integration &mdash; not the abolition &mdash; of the agency into the Office for Social Inclusion will ensure we are drawing from the best of the skills and talents of both groups.  The Office for Social Inclusion as it stands will also be disbanded and an entirely new unit will be set up.  The agency should in no way feel that it is just being brought into an existing office.  It will be a new unit and that will give everybody an opportunity to draw on the best of what they do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister will be familiar with the historical use of the word &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo;.  It was used by Henry VIII.  He dissolved the monasteries, and there is not much left of them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is dissolution.  I agree that, of course, they are co-operative &mdash; that is their spirit of professionalism.</P>
        <P>On the basis of this series of scandalous attacks on human rights, I will write to every international organisation I can think of indicating the approach of the Government.  It should be shamed internationally as well as nationally.  I certainly propose to do this, as I did when we had the awful collaboration between the Government and President Bush&rsquo;s regime on the issue of rendition flights.  Our Minister went over to appear before the parliamentary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the section, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, but it is not relevant to the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wrote to them and said they should not believe a word of what is being said because the Minister will tell them it was never raised.  I mentioned all the debates and so on in which it was raised.  I am going to make sure this news travels.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister said that the agency can continue to be independent.  Will that really be so?  In that case, why does the Government routinely include in legislation a section restricting criticism of Government policy on the part of civil servants?  Such sections have appeared in many Bills in recent years.  That is the official position.  Civil servants cannot be allowed to be critical from within Departments.  That is the problem.  I know the Government does not like criticism &mdash; of course it does not.  None of us particularly likes criticism, but it is a very important element of democracy.  The Minister says everybody feels the same way, but they do not.  The Government has lost touch with reality &mdash; not all its members, by any means, but a significant number of them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, said last Friday that nobody gave a damn about the removal of the medical card entitlement from the over 70s because there was only one person in the Gallery.  She was <Col N="51"/>blithely ignoring the fact that that person represented 10,000 pensioners.  The Leader told us it was great for shopping to have all these protests, and another Member on the Government side said they had only come up for the craic on the day.</P>

	<P>I am responding to what the Minister said.  She said that everybody was very supportive.  That is the extent of the sympathy that exists in some sections, although by no means all.  There are splendid people on the Government side who have a heart.  It is important that these matters are placed clearly on the record.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter this evening.  I wish to speak about two separate but related issues on road safety.  In the run-up to Christmas and with the dark evenings we are all conscious of safety.  We opened a new fire <Col N="54"/>station in Moville yesterday and the difficulties faced by the emergency services at this time of the year were to the fore.</P>
        <P>Traffic islands are an issue throughout the island of Ireland, and the North is no different from the Republic in this regard.  When I ask the NRA about traffic islands the answer I always receive is that they are lit.  However, they are not all lit.  Sometimes the lights do not work.  I am also told that they are all painted.  However, the fact that they are painted is only effective during the day, and during the day it is not an issue.  It is at night that the issue arises.  A simple suggestion is to place a couple of cats eyes on the cement base of the traffic islands.  This would increase visibility and ensure people in cars have the best opportunity to see them.  When they see the island they will be much more aware of pedestrians who may be standing on it mid-point crossing from one side to the other.</P>
        <P>I had to raise the issue in this way because I contacted the Minister directly on a number of occasions and I was told it was a matter for the NRA.  When I went to the NRA I was told it was a matter of road safety.  It goes around and around and I cannot get anybody to take responsibility for the issue.  Some of the roads are not NRA roads, they are local authority roads.  Will the Minister of State establish who has the capacity to deal with this matter?  Will it be done on a North South basis with the Minister in the North?  As I stated, both sides of the Border are as bad as each other and it is as dangerous on either side.</P>
        <P>Like all of my colleagues, I drive a great deal and I am on the road most of the time.  I also walk a great deal when I am in Dublin.  This evening, as I crossed Kildare Street I saw a number of cyclists going around with no visibility aids whatsoever.  When something happens it can be the cyclist&rsquo;s fault or the motorist&rsquo;s fault but if one is not visible one does not help the chances of people avoiding one.</P>
        <P>In the good old days when there was no technology a dynamo ensured there was always light on a bicycle.  In this age of technology will the Minister of State, if he has special responsibility for this, examine at European level the manufacturing of bicycles to ensure they are manufactured with an in-built light?  It should not be technologically impossible at this point in time to be visible when cycling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should step up a campaign with regard to what one should wear when cycling.  The other day, I walked the two miles from here to where I stay.  A total of 25 bicycles passed me at various points on the journey, of which 13 had absolutely no visibility aid on either the cyclist or the bicycle, approximately three cyclists had a florescent strip on their bodies and another four had something on the front or back but not on both front and back.  Accidents are waiting to happen due to the non-lighting of bicycles and the non-visibility of traffic islands.  Both issues can be easily solved and I ask the Minister of State to take an interest in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, had to rush away after dealing with the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 and she asked me to thank the Senators for their co-operation on the Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Government has invested significant resources in the area of road safety in recent years.  The Road Safety Authority was established in 2006 and is doing much to improve driver behaviour and training.  Under the Roads Act 1993, the National Roads Authority is specifically charged with the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.</P>
        <P>To discharge this function the NRA invests significant funds in identifying and improving sections of national primary and secondary roads which are the scenes of accidents.  They <Col N="55"/>achieve these safety improvements through a combination of various low-cost improvements such as better road markings, the use of continuous white lines, improved advanced signage and the provision of additional road studs, or as they are more popularly known, &ldquo;cats-eyes&rdquo;.  Other more expensive remedial works can involve re-alignment of bends, improvement of sight lines at junctions or the removal or rationalisation of junctions if considered necessary.</P>
        <P>The NRA and the local authorities employ skilled professional staff who are responsible for implementing safety measures on our roads.  It is not my intention to issue them with directions on specific issues such as the deployment of cats eyes.  A range of measures are available and the NRA and the local authorities have experts and they do what is appropriate.  It would not be appropriate for me to tell them what they should or should not do on specific roads.  Otherwise, we might as well take it all back into the Department.</P>
        <P>Running alongside the safety remediation work is the much bigger national roads programme.  Under this programme the roll-out of the major interurban routes continues at a rapid pace.  These new high-quality dual carriageway or motorway type roads provide a much safer road network by separating local and regional traffic streams and providing less opportunity for collisions.  As these new sections of road are opened they take the heavy through traffic away from the increasingly inadequate single carriageways.  These revert to being used by local traffic which makes them safer.</P>
        <P>All of the Government agencies work in their individual areas of expertise and together have a beneficial impact on reducing the sad death toll on our roads.  Overall, Ireland saw a considerable reduction in fatalities last year which was much improved on ten years previously when in 1997, the number of people killed was 472 people.  Last year this figure was 339.  We have seen further improvement this year and the latest figures show that as of today, the number is down more than 50 on the same period last year.</P>
        <P>According to the European road safety performance index programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance based on current trends.  Last December was a particularly horrific month.  One must be conscious of road safety at this time of the year but there is a real chance that the number of fatalities this year might fall below 300.  However, 300 is 300 too many as it means that this Christmas 300 families will be mourning the loss of a loved one.  As well as those who are killed, approximately ten times this number, or 10,000 families, will be coping with the effects of a serious injury to a family member.  The road safety strategy is in place and its overriding aim is to reduce fatalities to 60 per million or 250 a year.</P>
        <P>The legal position on the lighting of bicycles is unambiguous.  For use in a public place, bicycles must be fitted with a white front light and a red rear light.  They must also be equipped with a red rear reflector.  A person who fails to comply with these requirements faces a fine of up to &euro;1,000.  Persons who use a bicycle at night without proper lighting, as well as breaking the law, are putting themselves at serious risk through their own irresponsible behaviour.  The matter of cyclists&rsquo; visibility is primarily one of personal responsibility and it is difficult to see how action at European level would lead to improved behaviour.  The rules of the road offer clear practical advice to cyclists to make themselves less vulnerable, such as attaching reflective material to their bicycles, wearing a reflective armband, and wearing a &ldquo;Sam Browne&rdquo; reflective belt or vest.</P>
        <P>A new cycling strategy is currently being finalised and is expected to be announced early in the new year.  This will address all issues relevant to cycling with the intention of creating a greater culture of cycling.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the ongoing saga of the Castletownbere sewerage scheme and treatment plant.  I became a member of Cork County Council in 1985, which seems a long time ago, and it was already an issue at that time.  It might be wrong to use the word &ldquo;fudged&rdquo;, but it is one of the schemes in County Cork which has been kicked to touch.  There have been more passages of play at national and council level than there would be at the best Munster versus Clermont rugby game.</P>
        <P>I have raised the position of this scheme for many years.  The treatment schemes at Bantry, Schull, Baltimore, Dunmanway and other locations in west Cork are due to proceed after many years of deliberation and requests for funding.  I was told six or seven years ago in this House that the funding was in place for the Castletownbere scheme but that there was a issue in regard to its location.  In the wake of various plans, consultants&rsquo; reports and site appraisals, will the Minister of State outline the up-to-date position on the provision of a sewerage scheme and treatment plant for Castletownbere?  Is the funding still in place and when is it proposed to commence?</P>
        <P>Castletownbere, like any other town, deserves proper facilities.  The lack of a sewerage scheme and treatment plant has hindered its progress and development in recent years.  Dinish Island has an exceptionally successful fish processing industry but it is being hindered by this lack of facilities.  At one stage, the council and the Department differed as to the best location for a sewerage scheme.  I hope there has been a meeting of minds in this regard and that I will be able to impart the good news to the people of Castletownbere that the scheme will commence early in the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for the opportunity to clarify the position in regard to the Castletownbere sewerage scheme.  The scheme has been approved for funding under the rural towns and villages initiative of my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 at an estimated cost of &euro;5.2 million.  This programme envisages a total investment of more than &euro;485 million on new and improved water and sewerage infrastructure in County Cork, with some &euro;122 million earmarked for the western division of the county. The Minister is aware that the people of Castletownbere are keenly looking forward to their new sewerage scheme, which is essential for economic and other development in the town.  He is also aware that Castletownbere is the largest town on the Beara Peninsula and that it is designated as a development node in the county development plan.  The north and west Cork strategic plan also identifies Castletownbere as an area where significant growth is expected.</P>
        <P>The proposed sewerage scheme involves the construction of a new waste water treatment plant and the upgrading and improvement of the sewerage collection network in the town.  As well as meeting strategic needs, it will also end the current discharge of raw waste water to the sea.  At present, my Department is awaiting submission by Cork County Council of the preliminary report for the scheme.  I understand this will set out the design parameters and objectives of the scheme and that the council expects to provide it to my Department by mid-2009.  In particular, the preliminary report will identify the most appropriate location for the new waste water treatment plant.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council examined the possibility of building a waste water treatment plant to treat waste water from the town and from the fish processing plant on Dinish Island.  I understand this combined treatment option is no longer being pursued and that the site selection process for a municipal plant has short-listed three possible locations which were recently put out for public consultation.  Once the treatment plant site has been determined, the council will <Col N="57"/>have a definite proposal to incorporate into the preliminary report for the scheme.  This will receive early consideration on receipt in my Department with a view to the Castletownbere scheme advancing to construction stage as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council is also drawing up a preliminary report for the Castletownbere regional water supply scheme which will improve the water supply treatment and distribution system in the town and surrounding areas.  This scheme is also included for funding under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme.  I understand the council&rsquo;s general aim is to deliver the water supply and sewerage schemes in tandem.  My Department will do everything possible to facilitate that.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, for coming to the Chamber to respond to this Adjournment matter.  Given the amount of coverage and discussion already given to the particular incident I am raising, I will focus on several issues of particular concern.  Several inner-city communities are under assault from the activities of a small number of families and individuals.  The tragic murder of Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Kane in East Wall is the latest manifestation of this.</P>
        <P>East Wall is part of my constituency and an area I know well.  Much of the discussion that has taken place arising from this murder tends to include such phrases as &ldquo;social breakdown&rdquo; and &ldquo;social decay&rdquo; and references to the negative aspects of life in that community.  One of the reasons I raise this matter on the Adjournment is to emphasise that some aspects of this analysis are incorrect.  The communities in the East Wall and the adjacent areas of the North Strand and North Wall are the opposite to what has been depicted by the media coverage.  These areas are characterised by strong communities and a spirit which is largely unique in the areas of Dublin I have tried to represent.  It is almost a rural spirit in terms of people&rsquo;s relationship with their neighbours and their efforts to look out for one another and in terms of the strength of local institutions such as schools, churches and voluntary organisations, as well as the extent of co-operation with Dublin City Council.  However, I am struck by the fact that in the discussion that has taken place thus far, the context is largely one of community breakdown.  The opposite is the case.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The murder, and much of the criminal activity, took place against a background of amazing community strength, which makes what we are discussing here even more disturbing.  The criminal activity and the terrorism in the area is occurring on roads in neighbourhoods and districts characterised by a strong community spirit, wonderful skills, great churches, neighbours and people who look after each other and themselves.  The one point I want to emphasise to the Government is the need to take a different approach to the way we have tackled issues like this in the past in that we must accept that a very small number of individuals and families are causing the terror people are experiencing.</P>
        <P>In terms of how we move the issue forward, we spend a great deal of time talking in this House about the need for stronger policing and, undoubtedly, there is a need for that.  I am a member of the policing forum that deals with that area and there is no doubt about the need for stronger community policing in the area.  Notwithstanding the brilliant work garda&iacute; in Store Street and Fitzgibbon Street stations are doing, they need to have the ability to do more of that wonderful work.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>There is also a need for a change of attitude on the part of the Judiciary and the institutions that support the work being done by the garda&iacute;.  In addition, there must be much more support for families in the area.  On the one hand stronger policing is required but on the other we need stronger families because it is those family units that will stop children being out on the streets almost 20 hours a day.  They will prevent children aged four, five, six and seven years being out on the roads intimidating people and creating the type of atmosphere in which serious criminal activity can flourish.</P>
        <P>The approach we should adopt in areas like this one must include organisations such as the National Education Welfare Board and it must ensure that the funding and support some of the schools have in the area is not threatened but increased because, regardless of the funding we allocate to support the garda&iacute;, they cannot patrol every laneway and street corner.  A preventative model must be adopted.</P>
        <P>I wanted to put my concerns on the record of the Seanad.  I have done it elsewhere but I wanted to raise the issue here also.  I emphasise to the Government that the issues we are discussing are not ones of community breakdown or districts and neighbourhoods letting themselves go, so to speak.  In the areas we are talking about the opposite is the case.  Communities are trying to look after themselves and they are doing that very well.  That makes the episodes we are discussing more shocking and means we must treat them in a different manner from the way we have done up to now.  I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House and look forward to his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is unable to be present this evening due to other business but I assure the Senator and the House that the Minster and I share his concerns. </P>
        <P>The death of Mr. O&rsquo;Kane is deplored by all right-thinking people and our sympathy is with his family and friends as well as the community in East Wall.  A person has been charged in connection with this killing and Senator Donohoe will appreciate that, consequently, I am greatly constrained in what I can say about the specific incident.</P>
        <P>The Minister attaches the highest priority to tackling organised and gun crime and bringing those involved in such activities to justice.  One of the main priorities he has set for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2009 is to target gun crime, organised crime and drug related crime through a range of measures, including the use of the Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region in 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  Under Operation Anvil, up to the end of November, 1,200 firearms have been recovered in Dublin and 1,000 in the rest of the country.  There have also been over 7,000 arrests for serious crimes, such as murder, robbery and burglary, and 67,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.  In this way, the garda&iacute; will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly.</P>
        <P>At a time when the public finances are under pressure, the Minister will ensure that top priority will continue to be given to frontline policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from &euro;20 million to &euro;21 million.  Other key operations will be maintained through 2009, and any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish frontline <Col N="59"/>policing.  While the allocation for overtime will be reduced, the increase in the numbers of garda&iacute; which has taken place will more than compensate for that.</P>
        <P>Since his appointment, the Minister has been concerned at the number of handguns that have been licensed in recent years, following a series of judicial decisions.  While the vast majority of licensed firearms holders pursue their interests legitimately, the reality is that the overall number of weapons in circulation and the type of those weapons can contribute to the development of a gun culture.  The Minister has therefore brought forward proposals which include, with limited exceptions in regard to Olympic sports, no new licences being issued for handguns and existing licences being renewed only if they fully meet the requirements of a much more stringent regime.</P>
        <P>The Minister attaches great importance to tackling crime by juveniles in a focused and comprehensive way.  The Children Act 2001 is now fully in force and provides a modern framework for responding to the needs of young people who come in contact with the criminal justice system.  The Irish youth justice service has been established to develop an integrated response to youth offending.  This response is set out in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010, launched last March.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has already been made in implementation of the strategy.  Additional funding has been provided for projects developed by young persons probation, a dedicated unit of the probation service, to allow for the expansion of the use of community sanctions.  The Judiciary has been briefed on the non-custodial sanctions available under the Children Act 2001 and dedicated court officers have been appointed to courts in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Furthermore, the Government has approved the recommendation of an expert group on detention to develop new integrated national children detention facilities on the existing State-owned Oberstown campus to cater for all children up to 18 years old who are ordered to be detained by the courts.  This will also facilitate the transfer of 16 and 17 year old boys from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution into the children detention school model.</P>
        <P>The net effect of this effort is to create a more co-ordinated strategic approach, which makes better use of existing resources, creates positive working relationships among stakeholders and delivers better outcomes for children in trouble with the law and for the community in general.  The Minister and I are convinced this is making a difference.</P>
        <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme is operated by Garda juvenile liaison officers.  It has proved to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It also enables referral to the Garda youth diversion projects which are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives operating separately from the diversion programme.  There are 100 of these projects operating in various locations throughout the country, including four operating in the East Wall area.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes there is a great responsibility on parents for the behaviour of their children.  The Children Act 2001 provides a number of measures relating to parental responsibility in respect of children involved in anti-social behaviour and children found guilty of offences.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that public disorder offences make up a significant proportion of crime committed by juveniles and are an issue where co-operation between the garda&iacute; and the local community is vital.  That is why the Minister is proceeding with the roll-out of the joint policing committees, following their successful pilot phase.  As part of this pilot phase, a committee was established in the Dublin City Council area and further sub-committees in each of the city&rsquo;s five areas.  These committees enable local authority representatives and officials and the garda&iacute;, with the participation of Oireachtas Members and community interests, to get <Col N="60"/>together in a structured way to discuss matters affecting the policing of the area.  The Minister believes that this approach has great potential.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that the Minister attaches the highest importance to tackling the serious threat posed by firearms.  The garda&iacute; will pursue relentlessly those who use firearms in the commission of crime and the Minister will provide both the resources necessary to do this and legislation required to prevent the availability of such weapons.  He is also committed to the implementation of the integrated response to youth offending set out in the national youth justice strategy.</P>
