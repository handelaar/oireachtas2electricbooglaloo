	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to examine the potential to link PRSI contributions in the UK with those made in Ireland</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to reassess the budget proposal to reduce tax relief on dental treatment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the financial crisis that is being experienced by Donegal County Council, which has led to the announcement that 238 employees of the council are to be made redundant and to outline whether the moneys to be collected from the &euro;200 levy to be applied to all non-principal places of residence has already been included in the contribution made to the council in the form of the local government fund.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Council framework decision on combating terrorism, back from committee, to be taken without debate; and No. 2, Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill 2008, Committee and Remaining Stages.  It is proposed that No. 1 shall be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and that No. 2 shall be taken at the conclusion of No. 1.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader request that either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs make a statement in the House before the former travels to Brussels to present his proposals for a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  A statement on this matter should not be made in Europe until the Taoiseach or the Minister come before the House.  Since the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty, there have been massive cuts in public services and the <Col N="494"/>budget, which was introduced in October, is extremely anti-consumer in nature.  If there is another referendum on the Lisbon treaty next year, a general election should take place at the same time, otherwise that referendum will be guaranteed to fail.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Finance to come before the House?  The Minister has not appeared in this Chamber in quite some time.  The position in respect of the economy, particularly with regard to the banks, is changing daily.  There is a need for a serious debate on this matter.  There is a short article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> which highlights the position of the Harvey Norman chain, which has stores across the globe.  It is pointed out in the article that even though the position globally is difficult, Harvey Norman&rsquo;s retail business in Ireland is in a disastrous state.  This is an indication that matters in this country are possibly worse than elsewhere.  There is a need for a debate on this matter because things are changing and becoming worse on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>I reiterate a call I made during last evening&rsquo;s Second Stage debate on the Stem-Cell Research (Protection of Human Embryos) Bill 2008 that an equivalent debate should take place in respect of the lack of legislation relating to <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.  As I said last night, this is putting the lives of women and children at risk and we need to do something about that immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the constant requests to the Leader for a debate on economic affairs and finance, whereas it makes no difference to me and other Dublin-based Senators that the Seanad will meet on a Friday, it is somewhat unfair to other Members who have to travel here and who may have made other arrangements.  It is an extraordinary coincidence that the Friday selected happens to coincide with the Fianna F&aacute;il annual dinner.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That has absolutely nothing to do with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I find that extraordinarily convenient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a cheap political remark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a cheap political point, it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is an important point to make on that issue.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Ross, made some important points during the week in regard to F&Aacute;S, many of which have been followed up.  I hope that debate will not be trivialised by people calling for the resignation of a Minister on the basis of her having had her hair washed.  To do so trivialises a serious debate.  It is outrageous that it should be reduced to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are serious issues to be dealt with and they will be dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is the level at which such matters should be dealt with.  </P>
        <P>The issue of recapitalisation of the banks has arisen once again as individual private equity firms seek to invest in the banks.  I again urge that the Government approach this cautiously.  The Government, however it has managed to do so, has got it right to date in the sense that it <Col N="495"/>did not recapitalise the banks a couple of weeks ago as did the US and UK.  What happened is that the money they provided simply went into a hole in the ground as banks simply used it to build up their own capitalisation and Tier 1 requirements.  We now find that while at least one Irish bank, Irish Life and Permanent, exceeds the Tier 1 asset capitalisation being sought by European banks, this appears to be making no difference.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Minister for Finance comes into the House I would like him to tell us how will we get the money from Government into small business and enterprises around the country.  What we are missing is ICC and ACC, which in times past would have made this kind of money available, which is an important point.  Another issue that arises is sub-prime lending which has a bad name as a result of what happened in the US.  It is important to remember that we have a thriving and positive sub-prime lending institution in the form of the credit unions.  Credit unions are involved in sub-prime lending to people who often cannot get funds from the main institutions and they do so in a regulated and protective manner.  It is a process through which money can flow to ordinary people in a positive way.  It is not sub-prime lending that is wrong.  Credit unions maintain their loans right the way through and do not sell them off again.  The Government should consider possible other ways of getting money into the business sector and to people who need credit other than simply handing the matter to the large banks.</P>

	<P>Before I call the next speaker, I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery the Governor of Montana, Mr. Brian Schweitzer.  On my own behalf, and on behalf of my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I extend a very warm welcome to you and wish you well during your visit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we will have a debate on the economy next week regardless of what day it will take place or the other events with which it might coincide.  It is important we are having that debate next week having called for it so often.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was struck by the following curious point in regard to the reports today about the banks.  A new group of investors has offered the Minister for Finance a solution to the problem.  Last week, another group of opportunists, investors with international connections, offered a solution to the Minister for Finance.  A picture comes to mind of the Minister for Finance sitting in his office, tapping his fingers on the desk almost waiting for people to come to him with suggestions.  Surely, it should be the Minister who makes such bold moves.  I do not agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there is not a requirement for recapitalisation of the banks.  Manifestly, there is such a requirement.  There needs to be a debate on how it should be brought about and on the controls that should be put in place by Government in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to hear from the Minister for Finance what the Government proposes to do other than waiting for others to come to them with suggestions.  This seems to be the manner in which Government is being run in regard to these serious issues.  In that vein, will the Leader arrange for the Taoiseach to come to this House and to be involved in the debate on the current position and where we are going?  The Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, made a reasonably thoughtful speech a year ago at the Indecon conference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I quoted from it last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder if he would take out that speech, dust it down and read it again to see what it is he would propose by way of addressing the palpable sense of not alone uncertainty but real fear, which is increasing by the day and almost by the hour, across the community.  Everybody is seeking a solution to the problem.  We accept the Government cannot solve every problem.  However, we are looking to it for some measure of inspiration and hope and for a plan, but we are not seeing anything of that nature.  The budget was botched and <Col N="496"/>there is a failure to face up to many of the problems that led us to where we are now.   One cannot work out one&rsquo;s future course until one is clear about how one arrived at where one is.  We must face up to rather than dwell on the fundamental mistakes of recent years.  </P>
        <P>The extraordinary, treacherous and reckless priming of the property sector happened under the watch of this Government and this must be faced up to.  Decentralisation &mdash; it appears it will be reversed in the public service reform document &mdash; was a serious mistake and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White can discuss that matter during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;a shocking proposal, one that ought never have been brought forward.  We are now seeing it being at least partly reversed in the new proposals on efficiency in the public service.  I ask that the Leader give serious consideration to inviting the Taoiseach to the House for the debate.  I remind Members that the collapse in State revenue in this country was well under way before the international banking crisis emerged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact, not an opinion.  We must face up to these facts and have a proper debate on them.  I respectfully suggest that this forum is a good place to have that debate, a somewhat more relaxed and thoughtful debate than is possible in the other House.  I ask that the Leader arrange such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome that we will have a debate on public sector reform.  I would like to request an additional debate on an issue linked to that agenda, namely, the existence of State agencies and public bodies in this country.  The  budget process has put in train a rationalisation plan for many of them and contains proposals in regard to shared secretariats for others.  Yesterday&rsquo;s document indicates that further rationalisations of a number of bodies and their purpose need to be undertaken.</P>
        <P>We need, as part of that debate, to discuss the process of public appointments and the role the Oireachtas can and should play in such a process.  It has been proposed in the past that this House should have a direct role in terms of assessing people nominated to chair many public and State bodies.  If such a reform were to come about, it would give this House more relevance and ensure there is in place a process whereby people charged with chairing such bodies must indicate, prior to taking up their appointments, their vision for the agencies they seek to operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the House is prepared to provide time for such a debate and to pursue such a role for itself, it could go a long way towards restoring some of the public confidence lost by recent revelations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will now call on the two Members who did not get an opportunity to raise their matters yesterday and indicated earlier their wish to put them to the Leader today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other speakers in asking the Leader to facilitate a debate on public service reform.  Yesterday, an announcement was made in regard to a fifth review in five years of the public service.  We are all aware of waste, duplication and inefficiencies in this regard and of bad leadership by Government.  I ask that the Leader provide time for such a debate as a matter of urgency.</P><Col N="497"/>
        <P>I would like also if the Leader could invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House.  I disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point in regard to F&Aacute;S which has been discredited, as has senior management at F&Aacute;S.  We need a debate on the role of F&Aacute;S because the good work being done on the ground in the public interest is being undermined by bad management.  Would any Member of this House travel abroad at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense and spend &euro;410 on pampering ourselves?  We would not and we need to get real.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of us do not have any hair left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss that in the debate if the Leader agrees to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time of recession it shows how arrogant and out of touch the Government has become if it believes it is chicken-feed.  It is wrong and the Leader should not defend it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Twomey&rsquo;s call for a debate on legislation to provide a regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction and in particular <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, which is long overdue.  A former Member of this House, Dr. Mary Henry, was very active in trying to get the matter placed on the Government agenda.  I call on the Leader to have that debate as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to discuss a particular issue regarding the waste of public moneys.  As we are debating reform of the public service and issues of waste in the public finance, one report slipped somewhat under the radar last week.  That was a report by the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s Committee of Public Accounts, which was highlighted in an article by Fintan O&rsquo;Toole in Tuesday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  That committee reported on an outrageous waste of public money in the health service.  As one of its key points, the report highlighted the direct subsidy that goes from the public health system to the private health insurance market.  In 2006 almost 25% of public hospital beds were occupied by private patients, but the HSE recovered just 7% of the cost of running hospitals from the insurance companies, showing a marked subsidy from the public purse for the private insurance sector.</P>
        <P>A point that stood out as scandalous and that needs to be addressed by the Minister in the House is the report&rsquo;s exposure of the State paying publicly contracted consultants private fees to treat their public patients, in some cases even in public hospitals.  I am talking about the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I did not understand that fund was designed to enable the payment of consultants working in Irish hospitals to treat patients who were already on their own public waiting lists and enabling the patients to jump the queue in that way.  Staggeringly the National Treatment Purchase Fund paid for 1,774 patients who were treated in public hospitals.  This should be a matter of major concern to all of us on both sides of this House at a time when the public purse is so straitened.  When we are all looking at ways to make savings, this is an obvious way to do so.</P>
        <P>The health service has been scandalously badly run.  We have seen dreadful things like the cancellation of the roll-out of the cervical cancer vaccination scheme, while at the same time there is this ongoing wastage which should be cured and at the very least debated in this House.  I call on the Leader to bring in the Minister for Health and Children to answer questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the call for a debate on the economy and fiscal policy.  However, I differ somewhat from Senator Alex White who seems to be very negative in his approach.  Ireland has overcome tremendous economic challenges in the past few years.  While we certainly face new difficulties, we should not lose sight of what we have achieved, including <Col N="498"/>the great increases in the State pension for older people and in child allowance, the great reduction in the tax burden, the fabulous addressing of the national debt, the 2 million people now at work and the totally unrecognisable change in our infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss those matters in the debate the Senator is seeking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Alex White should be somewhat balanced and recognise that under the Fianna F&aacute;il-led administrations great strides have been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader agrees to a debate we can discuss those matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to advise if an audit has been or will be carried out on matters that impact on job creation or sustainable employment, given the grave change in our economic circumstances.  We introduced numerous amounts of legislation and regulations in the good times.  We planned various developments, which were all done in circumstances that prevailed and at the time were in the best possible wider public interest.  Our economy is experiencing dramatic change and faces great challenges in the months ahead.  Given our present circumstances, we need to reposition ourselves and evaluate if there are mitigating issues, legislation, regulations or developments that may not be helpful to job creation or sustainable employment.  All these issues may need re-evaluation.  This warrants reappraisal and discussion with all stakeholders to ensure the required supports and no mitigation factors are in place for job creation and sustainable employment at this time. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss those matters in the debate if the Leader agrees to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply asking for a logical approach to present circumstances and what we can now accommodate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proper recapitalisation of the banks is critical to the future success of the economy, as has been stated by two other Senators this morning.  The suggestion made public last night by the Irish Association of Investment Managers that the recapitalisation of the banks should be through funds managed by their own subsidiaries smacks of a classic conflict and the Minister would need to be very cautious in this regard.  Obviously if possible we would all prefer that funds come from investments within Ireland rather than from foreign equity houses or venture capitalists &mdash; we all know how they would proceed.  No doubt the Government is weighing up how best to proceed.  A very important question arises.  How would Ms Fitzgerald, the former chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Managers, who now represents consumers&rsquo; interests, feel about it?</P>
        <P>Regarding the abuses that have been highlighted in F&Aacute;S, there is concern that similar malpractices exist in other State agencies.  A colleague was required to pay &euro;1,000 to access the information that exposed these abuses.  If there is to be transparency, which was the original purpose of the Freedom of Information Act, how can we get to a situation where that Act can serve its true purpose?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on public service reform and the banking situation.  The Taoiseach and the Government have received poor press in recent months because of the very serious change in the economy, which is a global phenomenon.  I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s publication of the public service reform report, which was launched by the Taoiseach.  He has been exceptionally consistent on the issue and has been measured in what <Col N="499"/>he has said.  He has been very fair and balanced to ensure that people who work in the public service have entitlements and rights that must be recognised.  At the same time he is determined that we get change, which most public servants who are operating well want to see happen.</P>
        <P>I welcome in particular the fact that the guarantee of a job for life in the public service will be reviewed.  I always felt that was a fundamental flaw in the system.  I welcome the fact that efficiencies in productivity and the reform programme will not be accompanied by compensation to public servants.  People who have jobs now should value them and should be prepared to be flexible.  Given time, I believe that the Taoiseach will show he merits the great confidence that we and everybody out there have in him.  The Indecon report to which Senator Alex White referred was one of the finest templates of the future economic direction of the public service.</P>
        <P>I compliment a man who has been much criticised this week, the former director general of F&Aacute;S, Mr. Rody Molloy.  He was an exceptionally good director general of that organisation.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a discussion on that issue now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The only point I want to make is that he has focused on a culture of profligacy and it is not only in F&Aacute;S but right across the public service.  That has done the State some service.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that trivialising the issue down to a few hundred dollars for one service or another is bringing the public service into disrepute.  We need to focus on the broader picture and ensure that we eradicate the waste that is happening right across the public service and inject efficiencies into the system.  It is hoped that is what the public service reform initiative will achieve for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to take up one of the points that was made by my colleagues, Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Walsh, about F&Aacute;S.  It would be good to have a debate on this issue.  My colleagues, particularly Senator Ross, have called for this for some time and I add my voice to theirs in seeking that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is a significant and legitimate role for investigative journalism.  It can often do things that the Houses of the Oireachtas have difficulty doing.  However, one needs to be very careful when one unleashes this kind of negative energy because it is extremely difficult to control it subsequently.  When it hits the lowest levels like <i>The Sun</i> newspaper or Mr. Rupert Murdoch and we have a headline &ldquo;Wash and Go&rdquo;, it is astonishing that we should be expected to count the nail clippings in a Florida hair salon while the economy is going down the drain.  We are told that a significant British investor has said that it is a catastrophe to invest in Ireland.  His radio advertisements were the catastrophe.  This hectoring, raucous, ghastly, frightfully bulldog British voice would put anybody off his product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know when we can have such a debate.  It is urgent that we should have it and I will tell the House why.  A number of errors have been spread and when mud starts flying it can stick to people who do not deserve it.  Senator Boyle behaved in a very dignified way when he was asked on radio, inaccurately, to defend a statement from the Green Party supporting Mr. Molloy.  No statement had been issued.  Senator Boyle said he could not comment on it because he did not know about it.  That is one such example.</P>
        <P>Another example of this occurred this morning when Deputy Leo Varadkar several times referred to and appeared to call for the resignation of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  I do not believe that was corrected.  Such inaccuracies are being spread all over the place.</P>
        <P>I heard Senator Ross explaining that one of the dates was incorrect.  People had asked for the resignation of the Minister, Deputy Harney, on the grounds of an incorrect date published <Col N="500"/>in a newspaper.  I have great differences with that Minister, political differences, ideological differences, but she is a very energetic Minister.  She is 100% committed.  I happen to think she is wrong, but in terms of work and productivity, nobody has done more.</P>
        <P>We know Nixon lost an election because of his appearance, and appearance can be important.  If I may lighten this debate slightly, the Government could do with being beautified and I will help to pay for it if that is necessary.</P>

	<P>We should have a debate on the specific issue of the space programme.  Other cheap shots were made about spacers, Disneyland and the like, but that is rubbish.  One of the problems with this country is that we are not at the forefront of science.  One of the initiatives Mr. Molloy was trying to progress was to push Ireland forward in that area at Cape Canaveral.  We have been involved in space research.  Experiments have been undertaken with flights into space from Cape Canaveral.  I am involved in a project with Leo Enright and Martin Keane, a businessman, to get Irish students into the International Space University.  That is where we need to get them.</P>

	<P>I will come down very much to earth.  What have the consequences of this been?  Let us honestly face them.  The consequences have been that the work of the Committee of Public Accounts has been interrupted.  Mr. Molloy will not now appear before it and he cannot now be questioned.  It is not a question of &euro;400 for nail varnish and a few hairdos, he will get from the State straight away approximately &euro;500,000 in severance pay, he will receive a pension and we will have to hire somebody else.  This is a man about whom questions have been raised, but he has had very strong support for his professionalism.  At the end of the day, this story that was stirred up by <i>The Sun</i> has cost the taxpayer a hell of a lot of money, but it is easy to get people who have lost jobs and people who failed to get placements on F&Aacute;S programmes stirred up, but it is a dangerous process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to follow Senator Norris, but I will try to do so.  I want to raise the serious issue of violence against women and domestic violence.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on that.  This issue was alluded to earlier this week and I want to continue to notify Members of the 16-day international campaign opposing violence against women.  The reason it is important is that the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre received 10,155 counselling calls in 2007, 83% of which were from women.  Trained volunteers from that organisation attended the sexual assault treatment unit with 320 victims in 2007.  Some 42% of women in Ireland &mdash; more than four in ten &mdash; have experienced some form of sexual abuse or assault and only 7% <Col N="501"/>of sexual violence reported to the rape crisis centres throughout Ireland has been committed by total strangers.  </P>
        <P>This is a pertinent issue.  It is not one that relates to a particular year or time, it has happened since time immemorial.  It is not an issue that is gender specific in that we should not expect one or other gender to raise this issue.  It is an issue that we as a House of the Oireachtas should be keen to debate and examine ways in which we can encourage people not to stand for verbal, psychology, sexual or any other form of abuse.  Sometimes people relate abuse solely to sexual abuse, but we should also debate bullying and other such activities that happen to people in every walk of life.  As I said, four in every ten women suffer sexual abuse or sexual assault.</P>
        <P>I would like to pursue the issue of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which Senator Bacik raised.  It is very important that we encourage the use of the NTPF.  It is an effective and good way of ensuring that people who need it receive treatment.  There needs to be an investigation into the situation where some consultants have very long waiting lists while others do not.  Those with the long waiting lists are sometimes the ones who create the greatest need for the NTPF.  Given that the NTPF operates separately from the Minister&rsquo;s Department, we would need the CEO of the NTPF to address us here.  Issues have arisen as a result of the actions of the NTPF to try to encourage shorter waiting times in hospitals.  By its actions it is preventing people from availing of the NTPF.  Such a debate is required.  I stand over the role of the NTPF and know from personal experience in my family that it has been very successful.  It is an important way of ensuring patients who badly need it receive treatment.  I refer to patients who might be stymied by a system that is not working properly in some cases, although it is working well in others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I return to the subject matter of the public service, about which I spoke yesterday in light of the Government&rsquo;s announcement.  I will not repeat everything I said, but yesterday&rsquo;s announcement was much ado about nothing.  Another report will be commissioned and, no matter what language is used or what thesaurus is brought out to say the same thing in a different way, this will be the fifth report in a few years.  We have not seen any ingenuity from the Government on this issue.  I repeat one point I made yesterday, namely, that the OECD report on our public service stated that we have one of the smallest, if not the smallest, public services of any country in Europe.  If the Government is going to slash and burn, we must be careful that it does not do so in the case of any front-line services.  That might have to be masked by the Government to achieve what it is setting out to achieve.  I and my party will oppose that at all costs.</P>
        <P>A number of statements in the report are of concern.  They indicate the double standards of the Government and a row back on the policy it has pursued in recent years.  There are statements to the effect that the recentralisation of services will be considered.  That is from a Government that has a failed policy on decentralisation, yet now it is aiming to recentralise services in certain parts of the country, especially Dublin.  That is a complete contradiction of its position in the past.</P>
        <P>I have three suggestions on which the Government can concentrate in the process it is undertaking until next June.  It should start with looking at the composition of State boards and the way they have been appointed.  I agree with the esteemed Deputy Leader, from the Green Party, who stated previously that this matter needs to be examined.  He is in government and should look into the matter and bring about reform.  The management of certain sectors of the public service needs to be examined, as we have seen recently.</P>
        <P>I asked the Leader at least once if not twice on the Order of Business and in various debates to have an audit carried out on the PMDS system in the public service, especially on senior <Col N="502"/>management and from the top down.  The system operates on a bottom-up basis and I am not convinced chief executives and senior management across the board are carrying it out to the degree intended.  From my evidence, it has not been working.</P>
        <P>We have seen an example of how the Government has taken a knife to freedom of information in recent weeks.  The success of my colleague, Senator Ross, in getting the information on F&Aacute;S is commendable.  One could argue that he should get his money back.  If the Government and this House had not taken a knife to the Freedom of Information Act, we would not have the excessive costs on which everybody is commenting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for an early debate, possibly next week, on the draft report that is being presented to the Joint Committee on European Affairs this morning, which is currently being discussed.  I refer to the report of the sub-committee chaired by our esteemed colleague, Senator Donohoe, on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union.  It is important that the House has an opportunity to discuss the report in detail and possibly to make a recommendation to the Taoiseach before he meets the heads of state in Brussels in December.</P>
        <P>Last week the Cathaoirleach was kind enough to allow me to raise a matter on the Adjournment of the House on the important issue of ambulance services at Roscommon County Hospital that serves County Roscommon.  Will the Leader of the House arrange for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to come to the House to give an explanation of why Roscommon County Hospital has not had 24/7 ambulance cover?</P>
        <P>I raised the matter on 20 November and on that day a lady collapsed in Roscommon town.  It took 40 minutes for an ambulance to come from Boyle, even though the hospital is within four minutes of the main street in Roscommon.  The doctor said if someone was suffering from a massive haemorrhage or there was a major accident in the Roscommon town area we could have a really worrying situation on our hands.  I am concerned at the lack of on-call ambulance cover for Roscommon town on a recent weekend between the hours of 5 p.m. and 8 a.m.  I rang Mr. Frank McClintock of the HSE this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If Sarah Palin does visit it might be appropriate that it would be when we have the debate on hand gun legislation, which I believe the Minister will put before the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>We have had an initiative from the Irish-led Mallabraca consortium to recapitalise Irish banks, which lacked credibility and does not appear to be going anywhere.  There is a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, &ldquo;New plan to recapitalise Irish banks offered to Lenihan&rdquo;, by the Irish Association of Investment Managers, which seems to have some rationale.  The real question is what is the Minister&rsquo;s view and what is his plan or strategy on the current crisis in the banking system?  He should inform this House &mdash; perhaps he will gain some insights into how he might <Col N="504"/>move forward were the matter to be addressed in this House and the Lower House.  It is one of the most important issues in the economy and the Government cannot resolve the current economic crisis until it first resolves the banking crisis.</P>
        <P>Regarding the report of the sub-committee and the information that the constitutional court in the Czech Republic has ruled that the Lisbon treaty is compatible with the constitution, all the indications are that we will have a Lisbon II referendum in this country at some future date.  That is an issue that should be the subject of debate in this House before the December European Council.</P>
        <P>Even if we have a re-run of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty there is a time delay and there is a crucial issue in regard to the European Parliament elections.  There is an opportunity at the December European Council to resolve those institutional issues that are part of the Lisbon treaty and to have a mini-intergovernmental conference side by side with the European Council in December, which would allow all member states, including Ireland, to ratify that part of the treaty and allow the European Parliament elections to take place on the basis of the Lisbon provisions.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to inform the House of the Government&rsquo;s plans in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to a debate on the economy.  I agree with Senator Regan that the important aspect is how we recapitalise.  That is the core of the discussion.  I am pleased the Minister is not coming forward with ideas.  I know he is working hard behind the scenes and he is right not to come out until he has thoroughly investigated the way forward.  We would want him to do it because this is the core aspect of the regeneration of the economy.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Ross, for years I have been calling for a debate on F&Aacute;S.  I recently asked for a debate on how it was being run in the new economic climate.  I would welcome a debate on the issue, as well as on how the relevant stakeholders link up with the unemployed.  From my knowledge of the education system, I have always considered they were not doing their work properly in this regard.  I would welcome a new vision for F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed that the media should pick on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and trivialise her appointment with a hairdresser.  When one considers her role since she first became a Minister, one realises that the call for the resignation of such a fine person is pathetic.</P>
        <P>This weekend Fianna F&aacute;il councillors are meeting the Taoiseach and Ministers because they believe there was a lack of consultation.  This concerns all of us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I only refer to it to substantiate my point, that we want the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline his role and how he handles consultation with councillors.  I would like to see a leader representative for all local authorities who would represent councillors in their role.  Recently Mayo County Council representatives <Col N="505"/>appeared before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss their development plan.  Given the downturn in the economy, the Minister has reasons for using directives to change such plans.  This issue should be discussed in the House.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senators Ormonde, O&rsquo;Toole, Norris and others.  I appeal to the Fine Gael Party not to trivialise the issue of F&Aacute;S for naked political advantage and turn a very small matter into a very large one.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the object of the exercise.  What is at issue is rampant, endemic and systemic expenditure in F&Aacute;S.  To focus on a little incident of the kind referred to would be absurd.  Fine Gael was doing very well in concentrating on the board for a long time and that is where it should continue to concentrate.  It is unfortunate that the board issued a statement last night indicating that while it was concerned, it would not say anything, apparently in deference to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since when did the board of F&Aacute;S develop a sense of deference to the Committee of Public Accounts?  I do not know.  The stance of the board is totally inadequate and the committee should have the board members appear before it to answer questions on why they allowed people in F&Aacute;S to indulge in this extraordinary expenditure.  I ask the Fine Gael Party to continue along this line if it really wants to address the issue, rather than concentrating on a matter that is peripheral.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should address the Leader, not the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question for the Leader.  Will he allow the House to address the issue of bank recapitalisation which was raised by Senators Regan and Coghlan?  I reiterate Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s point that there is a real danger associated with this form of investment.  We are asking the banks to invest in one other.  As far as I can see, we are asking for self-investment.  We are asking Bank of Ireland to invest in Bank of Ireland and AIB to invest in AIB.  We are also asking them to invest in each other.  One of the problems with the Irish banking system has always been this type of incestuous investment, whereby the banks invest in one another, thereby strengthening the cartel.  On doing so, the banks&rsquo; representatives can go to one another&rsquo;s annual general meetings and vote for one another.  The small shareholder does not get a look in.  The proposal will further this trend.  If Bank of Ireland or any of the other banks is allowed to invest in itself or another bank money that is not its own but which it manages, its position will become conflicted.  We will have a serious problem down the line and cartels galore, rather than the opposite, as desired.  I urge the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to come to the House to listen to this argument.  The proposal is very dangerous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers who spoke about the recapitalisation of the banks.  I am conscious of the fact that Bank of Ireland has a very successful bond issue.  The triple A rating granted to that issue stemmed from the fact that the Government had given the bank a guarantee.  The banks are clear that they do not require recapitalisation but the fact that there is no liquidity in the market and that they have opted for the basal rate in having reserves higher than they had before the market difficulties means that they are taking money out of the system.  This should be examined.</P><Col N="506"/>
        <P>Can the Minister of State responsible for European affairs be invited to the House, particularly given that a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty may be held in the new year?  We should consider obtaining declarations from the European Union.  Such declarations were lacking during the first campaign and, while they would not allay the fears of all the electorate, they would allay the fears of some of those who decided they could not vote in favour of the treaty.  The declarations are necessary and would make a significant difference to the campaign and people&rsquo;s attitudes.  I refer, in particular, to strongly held Irish beliefs regarding certain social issues such as abortion.  It is feared measures in respect of these issues might be imposed on us, although the European Union has consistently stated this will not occur.  The Union should make a declaration stating it will not impose such measures, including in respect of military neutrality.  It would be of significant benefit if this message were sent to the Minister of State.</P>

I saw them in the freezing cold last night.  It is a scandal and a shame that they had to protest by having their sheep on Kildare Street last night.  Will the Leader use his good offices and appeal to the Minister not to come home from Brussels without negotiating a deal, whereby the funds unused under Article 68 may be used to pay and help sheep farmers?  They have been hit through the abolition of installation aid and the early retirement scheme in the budget and must also pay the 1% levy.</P>

It is customary that the Taoiseach comes to the House when we discuss this matter because Northern Ireland is his special responsibility within Government.  That has been the practice through the years and that request was made already.  I will endeavour to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, present before his visit to Brussels to hear the views of Members of this House.  However, this will depend on my finding time, given all the legislation I have been asked to process before Christmas.</P>
        <P>The debate on finance will take place on Friday of next week.  The banking issue and all related matters can be taken in that debate.  Senator Alex White, leader of the Labour Party in the Seanad, said this morning that the public are looking for hope and inspiration.  That is the most important factor at present.  Confidence is a significant issue, no matter what level of business one practises.  If there is no confidence to face the future, expansion and progress are stifled.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the particular difficulty of the present time and I said as much on the Order of Business a few weeks ago.  In the 1970s and 1980s when we had a great downturn in the economy, small companies, family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, were struggling.  They then had the Government agency, the ICC or ACC to go to but that is not the case this time.  A struggling company may have been in business for three years, five, ten or 20 years, employing 50, 100, 200 or 300 people.  If any part of those operations is struggling now, the entrepreneur is not received in a friendly fashion by the banks.  The Government has a serious decision to make.  What will the Government do for struggling companies that have a track record in giving employment?  That is the question that faces the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  This House has a major role to play by highlighting issues and Senators can do this when they make their contributions on Friday next week.  I shall ask the Minister for Finance for a response next week or at the earliest possible opportune time.  Now may not be the right time.</P>
        <P>Many thousands of jobs are at stake.  Small and medium-sized businesses must receive some assistance, whatever transpires in the banking situation, no matter who refinances it and what the related internal issues are.  These are all fine but 40% of jobs in Ireland are in small and medium-sized businesses.  We all know this.  These are all-Irish concerns that have been kept going for generations by families who should get a gold medal for having come through the past 30 to 50 years.  I have often said this.  We have an obligation and a duty with regard to a business that has a track record of giving employment to groups of 20 or more people over the past three to seven years . Senator Ross knows this better than anybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is not listening.  Let us be honest.  When the Leader or anybody else is speaking, I do not want any Member moving around or coming up to my desk.  If they wish to send up a note, they can send up their Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a significant obligation and a duty &mdash; we being the Government and Members of both Houses &mdash; to ensure that, whatever happens in the next six months, <Col N="508"/>we help those who create employment and continue to do so.  We must assist those who would be in a position, if they were to get small allocations of funding or help of any description, to keep all present jobs going. Over the next five or six months it will be difficult to create new jobs in any country, from the biggest to the smallest.</P>
        <P>I ask influential Members and responsible members of the press who are also Members of this House to take up this challenge in their columns on Sunday, this week and next week.  They have been hugely successful in the past and they come from both sides of the House.  Responsible people, public representatives and journalists must take up the cudgels and ask the banks what they intend to do for small and medium-sized businesses.  They must ask also what the Government will do.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle, Buttimer, Walsh and Kelly expressed their views on reform of the public service.  Yesterday in Dublin Castle, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance launched the task force on the public service.  We all know the task force will set out a challenging agenda in respect of change in the public service.  It recommends an integrated package of initiatives to be implemented over the next three years, a framework that focuses on achieving and improving performances by organisations and individuals within the public service, and on creating flexibility and deployment of people, assets and other resources.  I could go on for some time.  However, we wish the task force well.  Eminent people, who have made a major contribution in their lifetime and still continue to do so, are making available their expertise and experience to assist the Government and the country at this difficult time.  We wish to give a better service.  I compliment the public service down through the years on what it has done for our country.  Public servants have made an immeasurable contribution.  The public service has been centre stage in the success of our country over the past ten or 15 years.  We want to make it more efficient and help it in every way we can.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer, Coughlan, Walsh, Norris, Ormonde and Ross all expressed their concerns about F&Aacute;S.  The special debate on that organisation will take place next Tuesday afternoon.  I have said often that, of all Ministers who come to the House, Deputy Mary Harney has been one of the most supportive over the years.  She has made an immeasurable contribution and I concur with those Members who said this morning that she has been an excellent Minister in her lifetime and a shining example.  I say this of one who started her career in the Oireachtas in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1977.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Bacik and Keaveney called for a debate on IVF.  I have no difficulty with this.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has paid for 1,774 patients in public hospitals.  I understand there is a provision whereby patients who have not been treated within six months can avail of this facility under the NTPF.  It is a breath of fresh air for those on the margins and on lower incomes who have had to wait for a long time.  Senator Twomey comes from the medical profession and is a general practitioner of excellence. Poor people should not have to wait because they have no money and the NTPF is to be commended.  I take the comments in the spirit with which they were made.  They can be pursued during the debate on finance when the Minister of Finance, Deputy Lenihan, comes to the House.  He has direct responsibility for the NTPF and its personnel.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney called for a debate on violence against women.  We should have a debate on violence against all persons.  The Senator outlined the fact that thousands of cases occur at this time of year, coming up to Christmas.  I will endeavour to have this debate take place.  If time is not available we can consider the matter at an early session after Christmas.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden outlined the difficult position in which he finds himself in his home county, Roscommon, with regard to hospital services there and 24-hour cover, which is the least any<Col N="509"/>body should expect.  I recommend that the Senator takes this as a matter on the Adjournment.  He has now placed the issue on the record of the House and he should feel free to avail of this facility.  However, to get a response and have the Minister present, placing a matter for the Adjournment, possibly next Tuesday, would better enhance what he is trying to achieve, especially given that we have a tight schedule and a large volume of legislation coming through.</P>
        <P>On the possibility of having a debate on the findings of the draft report on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union, for which Senator Donohoe has responsibility, the report should be discussed during the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  I will endeavour to have the issues debated together.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde raised matters pertaining to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the representation of councillors&rsquo; views and decisions.  As representatives of local councillors, Senators will do everything in their power to assist them in this difficult period, particularly as the Estimates process approaches.  They face a serious challenge.  I do not say this because Government parties are in control of, at most, four councils but because councillors of all political persuasions have a serious task in dealing with Estimates at this difficult time.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden raised the issue of sheep farming.  I will convey her congratulations to the Minister on the 2% levy and all matters pertaining to it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P><Col N="512"/>
       <P LI="1">In page 3, lines 20 to 23, to delete subsection (2).</P>
       <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment proposes to put a specific date on the Bill as there is a wide measure of ministerial discretion as to its commencement.  I accept the good intentions of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power.  The Government has supported the Bill and I do not propose to waste time on this or any other amendment.  I will not speak at great length on this because I have read the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  He and his staff know I worked very closely with Deputy Michael D. Higgins in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and I discussed the amendments with him.  I am, therefore, aware of the situation.  I pay tribute to him and his adviser, Mr. Humphries, for framing these amendments.  I feel very strongly about them. Deputy Higgins and me are at one on this but regarding this amendment I anticipate the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and I do not propose to call a vote on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept the points made by Senator Norris.  The amendment is not contentious but a point of principle needs to be made that the effect of the proposed amendment is for the Bill to come into operation immediately upon enactment.  However, it has long been the legislative convention for a Bill to be commenced by means of a ministerial order.  This practice has arisen for important practical reasons, such as the need to make necessary administrative and other arrangements before an Act can be properly implemented.  As a matter of policy, good practice and on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, not just in the case of this Bill but in regard to any item of legislation, Acts should be commenced by way of ministerial order in whole or, in many instances, in part.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Regarding this Bill, the Defence Forces training and operational manuals will have to be adapted to take account of the State&rsquo;s new obligations under the convention on cluster munitions.  Even though the convention has been agreed in Ireland and is expected to be ratified shortly it does not have practical effect and force.  Article 17 of the convention provides that it will enter into force only six months after the 30th instrument of ratification has been deposited.  If we were to make the Bill effective immediately we, as a country, would be in breach of it immediately.  It is important we do things in concert and ensure we are in full compliance with our obligations under the convention when the Act takes effect in Ireland.  That is a practical example of the need to commence the Act by ministerial order rather than on the date the legislation is passed or signed into law by the President.</P>
        <P>As Senator Norris knows, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce and make the Bill effective as soon as is practically possible.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to commence most parts of the Bill immediately, particularly Parts 1, 3, 4 and 5. It is also intended to commence Part 2 on cluster munitions as soon as possible.  The Government intends to ratify the convention immediately after it has been signed on behalf of Ireland in Oslo on 3 December.  We will be one of the first countries in the world to ratify it which is a clear demonstration of our commitment to early entry to bring the convention into force.</P>
        <P>The convention itself, and our obligations under it, will crystallise only when the 30th instrument of ratification is deposited.  That is why we need to have a coincidence between the commencement order under the Bill and the formal coming into force internationally of the convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I would like to tease it out more regarding the date.  The signing in Oslo is on 3 December.  That is very soon and we <Col N="513"/>will not have the Bill in force by then.  Could the Minister of State provide a timescale?  He has given the reasons for a possible delay, that we need to bring all our practices into alignment with the provisions of the Bill so we are not caught on a technicality.  If we are among the first to sign it, it would give us a certain kudos.  Will the Minister of State give us some idea of how long this process may take?  The 3 December date is next week.  A degree of urgency may be removed.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be good to have a headline and I have known that to happen with other Bills.  We have early signature motions.  Perhaps it will be done by 3 December and that may be our good news for Christmas.  If not, will it take three months or six months?  Is this a result of advice from the legal people of the Army?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We would all be delighted if it could be in force by 3 December, but that date is merely the opening date for countries who are signatories to the convention to ratify it.  There is a distinction between signing it and ratifying it.  Ratification can take place only when a country has the authority under its own constitutional and governance systems to effect ratification.  </P>
        <P>Ratification will commence on 3 December and Ireland will be one of the very first countries to ratify.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Other countries, such as Austria, are in a position to do it immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  We must go through our legislative provisions.  There is a further distinction between ratification and the convention coming into practical force and effect itself.  The provisions of the convention are clear on this, namely, that it will take place six months from the date upon which the 30th country has ratified the treaty.  There are more than 30 countries party to the convention, but the number of 30 countries has been chosen as the number sufficient by way of ratification to give practical force and effect in the international community. </P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked if I could give an estimate as to when that will happen.  If 30 countries ratified the agreement <i>en bloc</i> on 3 December the convention would come into practical force and effect internationally on 3 May 2009.  How long is a piece of string?  I cannot anticipate when the 30th country will ratify the treaty.  The coming into force and effect of the convention will happen six months after that date.  It behoves all those who are signatories to the convention to encourage all countries to ratify it as soon as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland, as the chair of the negotiations which led to the convention, has a special obligation to ensure we are advocates for other countries to ratify the convention as soon as possible.  The final part of Senator Norris&rsquo;s question, if I understood him correctly, relates to whether, when it comes into full force, it will coincide with our commencement order to make our legislation effective.  The intention is it will.  It is intended that when all countries ratify it and it becomes effective internationally, we will be in a position to commence the Act immediately, if not beforehand.  This depends on us ensuring the Army&rsquo;s and the Defence Forces&rsquo; operational and training manuals are fully in compliance with the convention so that when it comes into effect, we are fully compliant.  I am sure Senator Norris, as one of the major driving forces behind the convention, will agree with this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, even though I was beginning to get a little confused by the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, because I was thinking of the passage into force of our legislation rather than the commencement of the full convention.  However, the Minister of State has reassured <Col N="514"/>me that we stand in a good position to be able to be there when the convention comes into force and that is the crucial point.  I understand there may be areas that need to be tidied up on the advice of the Army.  I hope the Minister will issue an order immediately when these requirements are satisfied and tidied up.  I see no problem with regard to us having the legislation enforced domestically in advance of the full convention coming into effect.  I am happy with and accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, subsection (1), to delete lines 30 to 33.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a matter of excluding &ldquo;anti-handling device&rdquo;.  This is a rather Jesuitical thing to do and may expose innocent people, civilians and army personnel who should not be killed in these circumstances to the operations of an anti-personnel device.  I believe these anti-handling devices can in themselves be dangerous weapons and can affect civilians.</P>
        <P>Take, for example, where one of these devices is left lying in a field and a child comes across it.  I have known this to happen.  I remember a particularly sad case in Palestine where a family known to Ezra and me was affected.  The family had been rendered unemployed by the policy of absorbing agricultural land, destroying olive groves and building roads through them by the occupying power and had been reduced to living on the clippings of tin.</P>
        <P>One day, one of them picked up a metal object &mdash; they had been making money by collecting and selling scrap metal &mdash; and, unfortunately, either shook it or gave it a kick.  There were four young men there at the time.  One of them, an eleven year old, had his stomach blown out and died instantly.  The 17 year old boy holding the object lost both his hands.  He was taken for treatment and was in a state of shock.</P>
        <P>This was a disaster for the family.  In that society young men were expected to get married at a young age and start a family, but this boy could not because he was now soiled goods and no woman would take him.  He was not able to get a job.  We tried to get prosthetic limbs for him and to arrange for him to get special education.  However, he got a sudden asthma attack about six weeks later and died.  I believe his death was the result of delayed shock because he had not realised the seriousness of what had happened when he lost his hands.  Sometimes when something like this occurs, the person is incapable of dealing with it and the imagination closes down.  I cannot imagine the asthma attack was provoked by anything else.</P>
        <P>It is this sort of accident I want to ensure we avoid and if we can provide for that in the legislation, we should do so.  Therefore, I do not accept that anti-personnel devices should be excluded from the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="515"/>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Before dealing with the specific amendment I would like to make a general point with regard to the definitions aspect of the proposed legislation.  Section 2 provides for the interpretation of key terms as defined in the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and other relevant terms.  Many of the terms defined for the purposes of the Bill are agreed terms under both of those conventions.  Their negotiation &mdash; the exact definitions of what constitutes cluster munitions in this case and anti-personnel mines in the case of the 1997 convention &mdash; was difficult and painstaking.</P>
        <P>The exact reproduction of these terms in the domestic laws of the states that are parties to the convention is necessary in order to ensure that the obligations imposed by them are observed in a consistent manner.  This is particularly true with regard to the definition section, particularly for the definitions of cluster munitions, an explosive bomblet, and anti-personnel mines.  If different states or parties to the convention were to define these key definitions, which were the subject of intense negotiations, in their domestic laws and legislation in different ways, co-operation between the parties to the convention would become very complex and would, inevitably, frustrate the coherent implementation of the convention.  This general point is irrespective of the merits or demerits of the definitions as they ultimately appear in the convention and now before us in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The practical effect of amendments Nos. 2 and 5 would be to blur the distinction between anti-personnel mines on one hand and anti-tank mines equipped with anti-handling devices on the other.  The first is prohibited by the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, of which the Senator will be aware, while the second is not.  These amendments would have the effect of introducing an undesirable level of uncertainty concerning anti-tank mines equipped with anti-handling devices.</P>
        <P>Senators will appreciate that the purpose of the Bill is to implement both conventions.  Article 2 of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention specifically provides that mines designed to be detonated by the presence, proximity or contact of a vehicle, as opposed to a person, and that are equipped with anti-handling devices, are not considered in themselves anti-personnel mines as a result of being so equipped.</P>
        <P>The provision that Senator Norris wishes to delete is reproduced in section 2(2) of the Bill.  By applying different standards in our laws to those being adopted by other states that are party to the convention, we would risk severely complicating the international co-operation on the implementation of the convention.  The proposed amendments would, effectively, prevent our Defence Forces from participating in peacekeeping and other similar missions with almost any other country, whether it is party to the convention, because we would be implementing a different standard of prohibition than they would.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That prohibition relates not just to the use of anti-personnel mines as defined, but to assisting any other country that might use them.  If the definition differs from that agreed at the convention, other countries may use something that would be prohibited under Irish law, were I to accept the amendment, but permitted by the convention.  As the overarching intention of the convention is to provide consistency of application in the field, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am grateful to the Minister of State for his clear explanation, it has convinced me to maintain my position in this matter.  The Minister of State has repeated the argument made in the D&aacute;il by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, that this would have the effect of introducing an undesirable level of uncertainty.  I believe it would have the effect of introducing a desirable level of uncertainty and inquiry.</P><Col N="516"/>
        <P>While I am not going to win, I wish to put on record exactly what is happening.  The Bill states that Ireland is against anti-personnel mines, unless they are stuck onto an anti-tank mine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not accept that if one attaches these lousy devices to an equally lousy device, they suddenly become unlousy, so to speak.  Anti-personnel mines are intended to prevent people from defusing the mines.  I am more or less, albeit not entirely or exclusively, a pacifist, and if either I or someone close to me was subjected to brutalisation, I would rapidly shed my pacifist extremist leanings.  However, defusing mines is a highly worthy objective and I wonder how many people are killed while legitimately defusing them.  My first point is these devices are known to be nasty, evil and to have a completely negative impact.  However, it is not a good moral argument to suggest that when attached to something equally nasty, they suddenly become cleansed and immune, especially as someone might wish to render ineffective the anti-tank mine.</P>
        <P>I will move on to the argument that this could cause a problem in respect of the legislation&rsquo;s passage by other countries because of the difficult diplomatic negotiations.  I again put on record my admiration for our diplomats who negotiated this convention.  Although it was complex, took a long time and so on, both Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I always held the view that one could initiate legislation and pass it domestically in anticipation of the signature of an international convention.  Such legislation could act as a model or standard and our diplomats then could negotiate from that high position.  This has been done before.</P>
        <P>I am aware this is difficult and a certain amount of wrangling took place in the Lower House between Deputy Higgins and the Minister about the relative parishes of diplomacy and politics.  It became quite confusing because at one point, the Minister appeared to argue there was no difference and they were part of the same circuit, while at other times he appeared to suggest they differed radically.  My point is that my political position, which is distinct from the highly professional work done by our diplomats, is that it would have been worthwhile had Ireland passed a law that did all these things.  I believe most Irish people would agree with banning anti-personnel mines completely.</P>
        <P>My second point in this regard is that I do not accept that variations in Irish law from the universal model will call into question the ratification of the treaty because at least two countries have passed different legislation domestically.  I accept it may cause some diplomatic difficulties and that this is a risk.  However, I do not accept the rest.  Perhaps this highlights the distinction between the respective roles of politicians and diplomats.  While questions might be raised about my role, effectiveness or relevance as a politician, no one would select me as a diplomat anywhere.  It is a question of horses for courses and I understand there is a difference between politics and diplomacy.  On those occasions when I am asked to go abroad by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I believe the principal reason to be that I am completely undiplomatic.  I can say the kind of things I did to Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, thereby allowing the Minister to apologise diplomatically behind my back and to claim that Norris does not represent the Government.  However, the Government was bloody glad I said what I did and the same was true in respect of Velayati and Rasfanjani.</P>

	<P>Our door is always open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not get the job.  In any case, these nasty devices should be banned.  They do not become less nasty because they are applied to other nasty devices.  Furthermore, while passing a better or more humane law in Ireland might cause some complications, I do not believe that, legally, it would necessarily invalidate our ratification of the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept where the Senator is coming from in respect of his well-known views on pacifism and morality.  It is hard to argue against the points he made.  He stated these devices are lousy, nasty and evil and all weapons that have the capability of killing or maiming people are lousy and nasty.  However, one must remember that this Bill deals with the specific subject of cluster munitions, which typically are weapons dropped from the sky and do indiscriminate damage, usually to civilians.  One must focus on what is being dealt with in the Bill under discussion.  Were one to carry the logic of the Senator&rsquo;s argument to its ultimate conclusion, this Bill should outlaw nuclear and chemical bombs.  While I agree with and share the Senator&rsquo;s pacifist views on both those issues, the question is, first, whether it is relevant to the matter under discussion and, second, whether it might frustrate the implementation of what has been a unique diplomatic agreement between nations.  I believe it would do so for a number of reasons.</P>
        <P>First, the Senator made the point that his amendment would introduce a desirable level of uncertainty.  I consider this to be highly undesirable because universal application is the purpose of such conventions.  The Senator is a champion of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  If the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was applied inconsistently, some countries would have completely different interpretations of what constitute the right to life or the right not to be tortured.  There must be a consistency of definition about all international conventions and the word, &ldquo;convention&rdquo; is used because it is a matter of agreement between the parties.  While the Senator makes the point he does not accept it will cause problems with the ratification of the treaty, it will.  We did not follow the path taken by countries such as Belgium and Austria, which legislated in advance of the conference, because there was no agreed definition.  As was their right, they adopted unilateral positions.  Were we to do so, we would have pre-empted the outcome of the convention.  Like Austria and Belgium, we might also have found ourselves unable to ratify the treaty because of its inconsistency with domestic law.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris does not accept that the provision will cause problems with ratification, but it has already caused problems in two countries.  They cannot ratify the treaty, but the main difficulty lies in the problems caused to their operation of the convention on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>If we introduce an obligation on citizens and Defence Forces working abroad, no matter how noble or worthy that obligation is, they would be placed in an invidious position if it differs from the obligations of other countries, albeit obligations to which we <Col N="518"/>agreed at the convention.  Under the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, citizens could be committing criminal acts by virtue of taking part in international operations.  Operationally rather than diplomatically, to which the Senator referred, the amendment would cause difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  I am glad and unsurprised that we are in sympathy about the horrors of war and its associated revolting machinery.  I will not labour the point, but I imagine that Belgium and Austria will be accommodated.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s diplomatic advisers might be able to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I will watch this space because I would hazard a small bet that Belgium and Austria will be in the lists, however it will be done.  This is a side matter.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of principle, I see no difficulty in an individual country exceeding the parameters of an international convention.  The difficulty lies in not meeting them.  There is no difficulty of principle or law in a domestic jurisdiction having a higher standard.</P>
        <P>I will not force the matter of interoperability, since it will be considered in the next series of amendments.  Like the majority of those who lobbied in this regard, I have strong feelings about the issue.  For the most part, governments were not lobbying.  We were unusual in that we put the full force of our diplomatic strength behind the treaty and Ministers were committed to it, which I salute.  In many instances, NGOs and people inspired by the anti-landmine campaign of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, were against the idea of interoperability.  While I will address the point in the following amendments, they believed that we should not co-operate with and abet people who continue to use the weapons that we are trying to outlaw.  I welcome the Bill, but it is only a partial cluster bomb ban.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s good intentions and his practical view of the situation.  Unless provoked, I do not propose to spend much time on this amendment.  I would prefer to move ahead with my colleagues and the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I empathise with much of Senator Norris&rsquo;s statements.  The Austrian and Belgian situations are interesting.  Were we to adopt a similar resolution, would we delay our ratification of the convention?  Neither Senator Norris nor anyone else would want or suggest that, since it makes sense that people apply the same standards in legislation.  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Senator Norris&rsquo;s direct question and while he and I disagree, it is my understanding that Austria and Belgium will be unable to ratify the treaty next week because their legislation is inconsistent with it and must be amended.  </P>

	<P>The Senator and I have different approaches.  He is adopting a principled stand to the issue and, in principle, it is difficult to argue against the adoption of the highest standards in the world, but it is very difficult to argue for it when, a few short months ago at an international diplomatic conference held in this city, we agreed to adopt a consistent approach with dozens of other countries.  While we would love to have all lethal weapons completely banned in principle, we are trying to implement an agreed convention.</P><Col N="519"/>

	<P>Just about.  Without discussing interoperability, the real issue is the operation of the convention on the ground.  Were we to accept the amendments, that operation would be difficult at best, impossible at worst, and would prevent Ireland from participating in operations.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 21 to 33.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are getting into the real meat of the Bill, namely, the definition of cluster munitions.  The House will be told that there can be no variations on the treaty and so on.  As I stated, the Bill is welcome, but it bans only some cluster munitions.  I do not accept that anything under ten explosive submunitions is not a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;.  Using this definition, the Bill exempts such devices.  Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) states that a cluster munition does not include:</P>
        <P LI="1">A munition that, in order to avoid indiscriminate area effects and the risks posed by unexploded submunitions, has all of the following characteristics:</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) each munition contains fewer than 10 explosive submunitions;</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) each explosive submunition weighs more than 4 kilograms;</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) each explosive submunition is designed to detect and engage a single target object;</P>
        <P LI="2">(iv) each explosive submunition is equipped with an electronic self-destruction mechanism;</P>
        <P LI="2">(v) each explosive submunition is equipped with an electronic self-deactivating feature;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Munitions of this nature do not avoid indiscriminate area effects, they merely reduce them.  I am aware that some of these bombs contain an extremely high number of particle bomblets and that the area they can cover can be extremely wide.  I forget the exact size of that area that can be affected by an exploding cluster munition but it may be equivalent to two or more football fields or may even be as large as one square mile.  The area affected will be limited by the provision to which I refer.  However, the dangers involved will not be removed completely.</P>
        <P>The idea that fewer than ten explosives do not constitute a cluster is incorrect.  Let us separate the words &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; and &ldquo;munition&rdquo;.  What does the term &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; mean?  It means a group of items, usually related, gathered closely together.  One example would be a bunch of bananas.  It is frequently the case that there are fewer than ten bananas in a bunch.  However, they would still constitute a cluster.  One could also have a cluster of roses which might contain four, five or six but certainly, even on a floribunda, fewer than ten stems.  In the context of language, this is still a cluster.  I welcome the fact that the size of a cluster is being reduced.  However, we are not avoiding some of the issues relating to something being identified as a cluster.</P>
        <P>With regard to subparagraph (ii), 4 kilograms represents a hell of an amount of material.  Anyone like me who does a modest amount of cooking will inform the Minister of State of <Col N="520"/>that.  A 4-kilogram explosive can do a huge amount of damage.  If one were faced with nine such explosives, one would be in trouble.  We are not talking about flour, pepper and salt, we are discussing explosives that have a fairly high-yield potential.</P>
        <P>Section 2(1) also refers to each explosive submunition being designed to detect and engage a single target object.  Such submunitions may be designed in this way but that does not mean they will be successful in seeking out single targets.  We know that to be the case.  We listened to those morons, Bush and Rumsfeld, referring to smart bombs during the initial assault on Iraq.  Certain television pictures appeared to show that these devices were successful in seeking out their targets.  In reality, however, they landed and exploded all over the place.  Those who make these munitions have not designed one which can avoid causing damage to humans.</P>
        <P>It is stated in the Bill that each explosive submunition will be equipped with an electronic self-deactivating feature.  That is fine but, despite previous assurances to the contrary, we know that such features do not actually work.</P>
        <P>This section of the Bill appears to be defective.  I know the Minister of State will agree with me in respect of this matter and will state that he would love to oblige me but cannot do so.  Despite all the work invested in the conference at Croke Park and this legislation, we are discussing what amounts to only a partial ban on cluster munitions.  In addition, the definition is incorrect, defies language and represents a scientific position which is unlikely to be attained.</P>
        <P>These munitions remain bloody dangerous, nasty things.  Children will continue to pick them up, which is one of the really evil aspects relating to them.  Many of the submunitions contained in so-called cluster munitions can appear similar to mini-Coke cans or sweet tins.  The specific intention behind them is to create terror.  Thank God those in the United States appear to be returning to their senses.  However, I laugh when I hear the phrase &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;, particularly when one considers that the Americans were manufacturing and dropping weapons of this nature, which have no proven military application.</P>
        <P>If one is concerned with that which is principally military in its application, then there is no place for these munitions, even at this level.  What we are actually saying is that anti-personnel mines are really nasty but that landmines are not so nasty.  In my opinion, the latter are a great deal more nasty.  We are also stating that we oppose cluster bombs but that we will allow the use of small devices.  I am against the whole damn lot of them.</P>

Senator Norris encapsulated the matter when he stated that this is a partial rather than a full ban.

	<P>That is why it comes down to defining what does or does not constitute a cluster bomb.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Norris for tabling the amendment.  However, I must state that the definition of what constitutes a cluster munition was one of the most difficult issues to be resolved during the negotiations that took place in Croke Park.  The guiding principle behind those negotiations was to reach agreement on a prohibition on all cluster munitions that harm people and to outlaw all such munitions that have been used in the field or in theatres of war in the past.  During the negotiations it was agreed that certain types of submunition-based systems would not be prohibited.</P>
        <P>Some of the partner countries with which we work have these weapons.  That is the reality within which we must operate.  These weapons include systems that disperse items such as flares, chaff and smoke.  It was also agreed at the negotiations that any systems which meet all of the criteria set down in the definition section &mdash; the provision Senator Norris now wishes to delete &mdash; would not be prohibited.  All delegations accepted that the cumulative effect of these various criteria is to significantly reduce the humanitarian hazard that might result from the use of a weapon that meets such criteria.  The definition of a cluster munition as set out in the Bill is a precise reproduction of the definition agreed in those negotiations.</P>
        <P>On the points made in regard to amendment No. 2 to section 2, the definition is a comprehensive one that meets the objectives of prohibiting all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  The convention prohibits all types of cluster munitions ever used in armed conflict.  Furthermore, following proposals made by the Irish delegation in Croke Park, the convention also prohibits explosive bomblets specifically designed to be dispersed or released from dispensers affixed to aircraft.  This is an extremely important provision which closes potential loopholes created by new technologies. Senator Norris spoke of smart or dumb bombs and made his argument from the perspective that there is no such thing as a smart or dumb bomb and that all bombs should be illegal and unlawful anywhere in the world.  However, the convention will be effective and consistent in the manner in which it deals with the type of indiscriminate humanitarian effects caused by cluster bombs in many countries in recent decades.</P>
        <P>The effect of the amendment tabled by Senator Norris would be to broaden the definition to include munitions that are not regarded as cluster munitions <i>per se</i> for the purposes of the convention and which are not prohibited by it.  I stated in regard to the proposed amendments concerning the definition of anti-personnel mines, which is a separate but related issue, that if we apply different standards in our own laws to those being adopted by other States that are party to the convention, regardless of how desirable or noble they are, we will risk severely complicating international co-operation in the implementation of the convention, in particular <Col N="522"/>in the context of international peacekeeping roles in which Ireland has played a major role for many years.  In a worst case scenario, it would make impossible our role in this regard.  The convention sets out the standards which were agreed by all states involved in the negotiations.  Again, if each state &mdash; this principle must be reiterated on every amendment &mdash; adopted different standards in their domestic laws, there would be in place a multiplicity of standards worldwide that would effectively render null and void all the good work done at the convention.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I salute the Irish delegation involved in the negotiations at Croke Park in securing acceptance of the additional provision in regard to what may be dropped from aircraft.  I recall the event; it was a good day.  </P>
        <P>Perhaps, the Minister of State will give us some further information &mdash; I completely understand if he does not have this information to hand &mdash; in regard to what precisely is meant by chaff?  I have no difficulty whatever with chaff which is dropped in aluminium flakes to deflect radar detection.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of fleshettes, tiny particles dropped from aircraft, by the Israelis and others had a damaging effect on people.  The Minister of State is saying chaff is made up only of material to prevent radar detection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s word and I feel reassured on that point.  </P>
        <P>In regard to the use of the phrase &ldquo;unacceptable level of harm&rdquo;, I do not believe there is any level of harm or damage that is acceptable.  I welcome the fact that the level of acceptability is dropping.  I recall a Tory Minister who when dealing with Northern Ireland got into terrible trouble for saying that we had achieved an acceptable level of violence.  The people revolted saying there is no acceptable level of violence.  There may be a level of violence with which we must put up, but it is not acceptable.  I do not believe there is any level of mutilation of human beings that is acceptable.  We must be careful about the language we use. There must be another formula that does not indicate this type of mutilation is acceptable, because it is not.  It is completely unacceptable.  I know the Minister of State and his officials will agree with me in that regard.</P>
        <P>A problem I have with theology is that certain elements of it have colonised and redefined language in a manner which divorces it from common usage, which is dangerous.  This is one of the reasons the Church is losing ground.  I do not believe we should do this in politics if at all possible, in particular when dealing with this type of material.  There is no acceptable level of injury or damage.  As Gertrude Stein said, a rose is a rose is a rose.  A cluster is a cluster is a cluster.  As the Minister said, what is provided for in the Bill is a partial ban on cluster munitions.  We continue to permit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his explanation.  It is obvious the definition came about as a result of painstaking negotiations.  Fine Gael would prefer a ban on all cluster munitions.  However, to seek to change matters at this stage would result in our applying different standards to other countries thus delaying ratification of the convention.  For these reasons, we will go along with the Minister&rsquo;s explanation.  I am not entirely happy to do so but, given that it has taken a long time to come up with this definition, I reluctantly agree to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything Senator Norris said.  He used the phrase &ldquo;acceptable level of violence&rdquo;.  I agree there is no such thing as an acceptable level of violence.  </P>
        <P>I can see from where the Minister of State is coming on this in that different countries cannot have different standards in their definitions and that we must go with global thinking on this.  However, it is sloppy language, which we must accept if we are to make progress in regard to the abolition of cluster bombs.  This section is weak.  While I have no wish to hold up what is being done here today, that is my view.  If this means we move a step further in obtaining a ban on cluster munitions, I will go along with it.  Perhaps we should keep the matter on the agenda for future reference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not pretend that the definition of what constitutes a cluster munition as a weapon was an easy part of the negotiations; it was not.  It was the most intractable part of the negotiations.  Ultimately, in seeking to outlaw cluster munitions one must work with some form of words which include and exclude certain items.  If one accepts that the convention does not seek to outlaw all weapons, one must then find a way of defining what is excluded.  If Senators believe that is an unsatisfactory definition, I invite them to suggest another methodology to outlaw the use of these horrible weapons with which we all disagree.</P>
            <P>That is the first point.  There must be some methodology to agree a definition.  The exclusionary method is the method agreed having taken the advice of some world-renowned experts in these areas.  It comes down to very technical issues such as the weight of bombs, the area across which they disperse, the height from which they are dropped etc.  It is necessary to have a starting point.  The starting point was to identify what is excluded.  The very detailed definition of what is excluded means everything else is included in the ban of cluster munitions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would respectfully disagree with Members.  It is a complete ban of every cluster munition that has ever been made.  That is not to say some advanced technical weapons are not banned.  However, it makes the point that every cluster munition that has ever been used is banned.  To that extent it is not a partial ban.  I again make the point that all definitions pose difficulties.  We are dealing with imprecise language here.  We are dealing with issues of life and death, emotions and principles, which is the point of view from which Senator Norris is coming.  We need to work with people who have been championing this cause for many years.  One of those groups is the Cluster Munition Coalition, which has been working in this area for many years.  It is the main umbrella group for all the NGOs involved in the area and is the body that has worked closely with the Government since the inception of the Oslo process in February 2007.  That group has stated it is comfortable with the definition.  It stated:</P><Col N="524"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P LI="1">The definition makes certain clarifications for weapons that have submunitions but are not considered cluster munitions, such as weapons with submunitions designed for smoke, flare, and electronic counter-measures.  Also falling outside the definition are weapons that have submunitions but that do not cause the indiscriminate area effects or UXO [unexploded ordnance] risks of cluster munitions.  Such munitions must meet each of a series of five minimum technical characteristics set out in the treaty.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is its articulation of why it is happy &mdash; to the extent that one can ever be happy &mdash; that this meets its minimum standards.  Maximum standards are completely different.  The reality is that in war and in conflict, some weapons are used one way or another.  This convention seeks to outlaw a particular type of weapon, cluster munitions.  We need to have a definition of what constitutes and what does not constitute a cluster munition.  The best way to do that is to exclude different types of weapons.  For better or worse that is a definition that met with broad agreement.  It required long and difficult negotiations informed by the best international technical military advice available.  It found agreement by very many countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the good intentions and practice of the Ministers involved and their advisers.  The view of the House clearly is that these are unacceptable weapons.  Most people, including those on the Government side, would accept that although they have been defined as being beyond the scope of cluster munitions, to any ordinary person they clearly are cluster munitions and they have at least some of the abhorrent effects specific to cluster munitions.  I do not accept that if my amendment were accepted all weapons would be gone.  I would be delighted if that were the case to be quite honest but it is impractical.  The convention deals specifically with cluster weapons and we are narrowing down the restrictions on cluster weapons.  I can feel that the Minister of State does not like these things as they are.</P>
        <P>They are still cluster bombs.  Let us suppose there was a smart element technologically in it and one of the nine actually struck home and hit the target.  If it were aimed at a specific target only one would be necessary.  Nine would not be needed.  Let us suppose one of the nine hits a bridge or a tank and does its job, what happens to the other eight?  This is the very problem of cluster bombs and is why people like myself and those on the Government side are so against them.  There is a reduplication of effect after the initial target may have been hit.  It can also happen that a child may pick them up.  I really insist on the point that these are still cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>In terms of the language, there is no question or doubt.  I did not bother to go out and look it up in my definition.  I gave the Minister of State a definition.  As I used to be a teacher of English at third level, I have a fair idea what words mean &mdash; that used to be my job.  I can assure the Minister of State that if he gets the Oxford English Dictionary, Chambers Encyclopaedia or any such reference books, he will find a definition of cluster that will include these.  I can assure him they will be cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>I will not press this matter to a vote, but I will probably press the last one to a vote.  To show good will and to encourage the efforts of the Minister of State I will not push him on this matter.  However, I would like him to indicate that the efforts are not finished and that this battle has not been finally won.  I accept we have had a splendid success on which I congratulate people.  Let us push on and let us not leave it here.  Let us drag the other bleeders with us.  I noted that Deputy Higgins quoted Talleyrand on this.  Again it is the difference between politics and diplomacy.  I feel we could have set a higher target.  In the previous convention to ban <Col N="525"/>landmines, former President Clinton&rsquo;s crowd got in and lobbied very hard for a weakening of the definitions.  However, we stood up against them and we prevailed.</P>
        <P>I would hope that in the light of the work that has been done, we can get a commitment to continue to pursue the matter to a point where this kind of munition is outlawed and where the use of anti-personnel mines attached to anti-tank mines is also outlawed.  It is the same principle.  I do not like the idea of what these courageous people must do.  We saw it frequently in the North and all over the world including in Iraq.  I do not agree with the invasion of Iraq.  The people who try to neutralise bombs are extraordinarily courageous.  I would not do it.  I would run like hell in the opposite direction if I thought there was the smallest possibility of being hit by any of these things.  I cannot comprehend the courage of people who professionally will attempt to disarm these unpleasant objects.  I have no time for the argument that claims an anti-personnel device is acceptable if it is attached to an anti-tank bomb.  It is all part of the same thing.</P>
        <P>I will not push a vote on this matter.  However, I would like the Minister of State to give a commitment to pursue this in the direction that the majority of Irish people would like it to go.  I believe pretty much everybody in the House would support the Minister of State in doing so.</P>

This is a very important starting block for us.  I agree with Senator Norris that we should not just leave it at that.

	<P>I do not believe anyone would disagree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s command of the English language, which is widely respected throughout the House.  Major difficulties arose in terms of definition and the use of language in this regard and while it offends someone who comes from a universally pacifist role, the methodology used must, by definition, offend someone who holds the view that no munitions or weapons are acceptable under any circumstances.  However, I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point of view.  We can agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not only the view held by someone from that position.  One can come from a less extreme position and still find this unacceptable.  Senators Cummins and Ormonde have indicated their difficulties and I do not believe either of them are absolutist in a pacifist sense and neither am I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that, but in terms of all international treaties and conventions, we must bring countries with us, so to speak.  Ideally, the standard would be to ban various weapons, but it comes back to the matter of what does or does not constitute a cluster munition.</P>
        <P>I accept and agree with all Members that this is a starting point and that at all international fora we will encourage all members who are not signatories to this agreement to sign, adopt and implement the convention.  Ireland, as a country which chaired the negotiations, will be a strong advocate for that.  I assure Members that at international fora the definition will be something that will be only accepted as a starting point.  If it can be improved on in years to come, that is something to which we would aspire.</P><Col N="526"/>
        <P>A point was made about what would be acceptable or unacceptable levels of violence.  I accept that on any terms of principle or morality, there can be no such thing as an acceptable level of violence.  Throughout the Troubles when I was a young student I argued passionately that there could not be at a political level any political theology that accepted any acceptable level of violence in Northern Ireland.  The ultimate negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement and the implementation of it have vindicated the political position that this was not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The term here is not meant in respect of indiscriminate attacks.  What the country sought to do in the negotiations was to ban cluster munitions whose use could be directed at specific military objectives in accordance with the general rules of humanitarian law.  That is what we are trying to do in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I accept the points made by all Members.  They will be used to inform our position on the ratification of the convention and our advocacy role in ensuring all countries ratify it quickly to allow it come into operation, and to ensure countries that are not signatories become signatories in future.  Ireland has a possibility of playing a lead role in this area.</P>

I feel very strongly about this issue and my colleagues on all sides of the House, including on the Government side, also feel strongly about it, but I am not sure that a vote at this point would be helpful.

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, subsection (1), line 36, after &ldquo;<i>Schedule 1</i>&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, but Article 21(3) of the said Convention may not be relied on by the State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a critical amendment.  I can anticipate the answers I will get, which would not be difficult since I read the debate and also heard the Minister of State speak on Second Stage.  It is abhorrent that, having condemned cluster munitions and having put on the record the appalling consequences of them, we would still support and give succour to those who continue to use these barbarous weapons.  We will be tainted and implicated in it if we permit our Defence Forces to participate in military operations of this kind.  It is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>Notice should be clearly served to those other groups.  That would be a good way of encouraging them to come in under the umbrella of the convention, namely, if we said we would not co-operate with them if they use these weapons.  That is a position I hold very firmly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator will be aware, this amendment was also considered in detail in conjunction with amendment No. 7, which is closely related.  The cumulative effect of this amendment and amendment No. 7 is, effectively, to prevent the participation of Irish Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations with countries that may not be parties to the con<Col N="527"/>vention on cluster munitions.  These amendments will affect the provisions of the Bill concerning interoperability, which is dealt with in Article 21 of the convention and in section 7 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>As was pointed out in the D&aacute;il during the course of the Second Stage debate, Article 21 was an even more difficult issue to resolve than the definition section of the Bill in terms of the negotiations that took place in Croke Park, and agreement on it was reached literally only at the last minute of those negotiations.  Given the importance which all Members of the Chamber have attached over the years to Ireland&rsquo;s continued involvement in international peacekeeping operations, it would be useful at this stage if I were to go into some detail, with the indulgence of the House, on Article 21 of the convention on cluster munitions and on the provisions of section 7 of the Bill which will implement it.</P>
        <P>Provision is made in Article 21 of the convention for state parties to engage in military co-operation and operations with states that are not party to the convention and that might engage in activities which are prohibited to a state party.  This provision takes account of the fact that, at least initially, not all states will be party to the convention.  Some of these may continue to retain cluster munitions.  This was a particular concern for members of NATO because the United States had been quite clear in its opposition to the Oslo process.  Members will be aware of that opposition over the years.</P>
        <P>When considering Article 21, it is important to note that each state party has a clear international obligation to encourage states that are not party to the convention to become parties to it, and where it engages in military co-operation or operations with these states, to notify them of its own obligations under the convention, promote the norms established by the convention and make its best efforts to discourage them from using cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>Article 21.4 specifically does not authorise a state party to develop, produce or otherwise acquire cluster munitions, to itself stockpile or transfer cluster munitions, to itself use cluster munitions, or to expressly request the use of cluster munitions in cases where the choice of munitions used is within its exclusive control.</P>
        <P>We believe that the convention&rsquo;s prohibition on cluster munitions will in time become established as a new norm of international humanitarian law in the same way as Ireland&rsquo;s position on other areas of international human rights and international human law, on which we took a lead role over many years, has become the norm in recent years.  One could cite many instances in that regard.  We believe this will happen when states begin to feel obliged to behave in accordance with it regardless of whether they are parties to it.  It has happened already very successfully in the case of the anti-personnel mine ban convention, even though a number of states that observe its norms are not party to it.  We intend to work internationally with our partners to ensure the convention on cluster munitions will have a similar effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 21 of the convention is implemented by section 7 of the Bill.  Subsection (4) of that section provides for particular circumstances that may arise in the participation of members of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping missions with states that are not parties to the convention.  As I said on Second Stage and today, we expect the likelihood of our participation in such a mission to be very low.</P>
        <P>Section 7(4) provides that, on such a mission, a member of the Permanent Defence Force shall not be guilty of the offence of assisting, inducing or encouraging the commission of any of the offences created by section 6(1), that is, to use, develop, acquire, produce, retain or transfer to any person a cluster munition or an explosive bomblet.  However, if he or she does <Col N="528"/>any of those things himself or herself, that is, uses, develops, produces etc., he or she would be guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>Subsection 7(4) is intended to address exceptional and very unlikely circumstances, such as where an Irish contingent of a UN-mandated peacekeeping force finds itself under attack and needs to call in fire support, either from the air or from land-based artillery to relieve it.  It may happen that fire support is provided by the forces of another state in the mission that is not a party to the convention and it is conceivable that it would be delivered without the knowledge of the Irish contingent in the form of cluster munitions.  The Bill provides that in such a scenario no member of the Defence Forces could be prosecuted for inducing or encouraging the use of cluster munitions contrary to section 6(2).  I am sure Members will agree that is something that in conscience the Oireachtas could not but insert in legislation to bring the convention into effect.  Everything possible will be done to avoid such a scenario occurring.</P>
        <P>Our preference in considering future contributions to peacekeeping missions would naturally be to join states that are parties to the convention and in those circumstances the question of interoperability with states not party to it would not arise.  However, were we to find ourselves as members of a peacekeeping mission that included the armed forces of a state that is not party to the convention, every effort would be made in the elaboration of codes of conduct, rules of engagement, caveats and similar agreements prepared for the mission to ensure that there is no prospect of cluster munitions playing any role.</P>
        <P>It is highly unlikely therefore that section 7(4) will ever apply but I think all Members of the House will agree on the importance of ensuring that no member of the Defence Forces should ever face prosecution for simply carrying out his or her duty as a member of a peacekeeping mission.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 specifically raises the issue of Defence Forces training.  Section 7(l)(<i>a</i>) permits acquisition, possession, use, retention or transfer of a cluster munition or explosive bomblet by the Defence Forces, where authorised by the Minister for Defence under section 7(2), for the purposes of developing or training in techniques for the detection, clearance and destruction of cluster munitions or explosive bomblets, or for the development of counter-measures against them.  I am sure Senators will agree that this sort of training is essential for members of the Defence Forces participating in peacekeeping missions, such as the recent mission in south Lebanon where upwards of 1 million unexploded cluster munitions had to be cleared before people were able to return to their homes and farms.  Members will recall that the Irish Defence Forces played an honourable role in that area.</P>
        <P>Section 7(3) makes it clear that the numbers of cluster munitions that can be acquired and used for those purposes are no more than is absolutely necessary, as required by Article 3, paragraph 6 of the convention.  For the reasons set out, it is not possible to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>Ideally, I agree with Senator Norris but we are not living in an ideal world in this regard.  In the light of our international peacekeeping operations it would be impossible to implement the amendment for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State.  I would not like the Defence Forces to participate in the activation of cluster munitions but I understand where we are coming from in that regard.  This is the beginning of a long campaign to try to bring all countries together.  We are starting from a good position and I will go along with the Minister on this one.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In an ideal world and with all countries singing from the same hymn sheet the amendment would be acceptable.  The Minister of State referred to the prospect of Irish troops coming under fire.  For example, were Irish troops currently in Chad under attack and in need of help from another country that is not signed up to the convention, nobody here would say that we could choose who we wanted to defend our troops.  That is the nub of the matter.  As much as I would dislike a country to use cluster munitions, I would not care who helped our troops in a situation like that.  For that reason mainly, I will go along with what the Minister stated.  I understand the principled stand Senator Norris is taking but in a situation like that I could not go along with it.</P>

That does not preclude a rescue mission.  There is a great difference between somebody coming to one&rsquo;s rescue and being involved in a military operation.  For God&rsquo;s sake, even I can see that and I am not a military person.  That is not an excuse.  Senator Cummins, who is a most accommodating, decent and highly intelligent man, swallowed that, but I am sure that on reflection he will not accept it.</P>
        <P>All Members of the House are determined to push for an outright ban on cluster munitions.  I hope there will be further tidying up exercises because I understand section 30 of the Defence Act 1954 permits the Minister for Defence to lay landmines so there may be a bit of tidying up to do there.  I am pressing the amendment because it is not acceptable that we accommodate those people.</P>
        <P>I would not have gone near the United States with a 40 ft. barge pole.  The regime that, thank God, is in its dying days in Washington is deeply criminal.  It flouted every possible international, domestic, federal and human rights law.  I would not have touched it and I am damn glad we were not involved in military operations to a greater extent with the United States.  Thank God we did not get into Iraq.  Can one imagine what that would have been like?  I am pressing the amendment.</P>

	<P>Many speakers used the expression &ldquo;an ideal world&rdquo;.  One only wishes we lived in one, but we do not.  In the situations in which we are involved, especially on peacekeeping missions, that is far removed from the ideal world.  We are not dealing with normal situations here but what we are doing by passing the legislation today, by subscribing to the convention and by playing a leadership role in chairing the convention means that we are taking a leadership role throughout the world.  We are a small country that has a distinguished record throughout the world.  We are recognised throughout the world in this area of foreign policy as having been one of the real leaders for many decades.</P>
        <P>This is our niche in which we have taken a leadership role.  We chaired the negotiations.  Would it not be very unusual if we were to champion the Oslo process and chair the negotiations using all the diplomatic skills for which we are renowned globally to achieve consensus on the narrow issue of cluster munitions and then to adopt a position on foot of which we would not be allowed to have a peacekeeping role in areas in which we have had such a role for many decades?  The people would not subscribe to this view.</P>
        <P>In in ideal world there would never have been cluster munitions.  In the unlikely scenario that Irish troops will be under fire in a real conflict with their backs against the wall, they will not have a chance to choose who will save their lives.  If we were not to adopt a leadership <Col N="530"/>role, we would be abdicating our responsibility and giving in.  We would be emboldening countries not party to the convention.  History and our peacekeeping missions have shown that when we take leadership roles, we bring other countries with us.  They ultimately accept what we do as the norm.  Many such examples can be cited.  If we were to withdraw from the process at this stage having been so intrinsically involved, we would be in very difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>This debate involves a question of principle versus practicality.  We are trying to steer a middle course and have played an honourable role.  We should not abdicate our responsibility in this regard.  That is why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 6 creates certain criminal offences in respect of cluster munitions and explosive bomblets in accordance with the obligations the State will assume under the convention.  Section 9 creates similar offences regarding anti-personnel mines.  Both provisions extend the jurisdiction of the State regarding these offences beyond the territory of the State to acts committed on board Irish-registered ships or aircraft or by members of the Defence Forces.  This is in accordance with established principles of international law.</P>
        <P>The Senator&rsquo;s proposed amendments would further extend the jurisdiction of the State to cover cases in which the perpetrator of an act is an Irish citizen.  My advice is that, as a matter of legal policy, Ireland has only ever extended criminal jurisdiction in such a manner on a very limited basis.  This is primarily because of the very large number of Irish citizens around the world, many of whom are dual nationals.  Accordingly, the State has been very conservative in exercising jurisdiction on this basis and has only done so where there has been very broad international consensus on the character of the activity concerned, for example, murder, manslaughter and certain sexual offences involving children.  In this case it would clearly be very problematic to extend the State&rsquo;s criminal jurisdiction to acts that are lawful if committed in another state and in respect of which the perpetrator of the act is a citizen of that state.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s proposed amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue.  While the matter I raise does not come within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, he will find it as interesting as other Members.  Although the case brought to my attention recently is specific, similar circumstances apply in many other cases.</P>
        <P>The person concerned paid a small number of social insurance contributions when he was aged 16 or 17 years in the 1950s.  However, having made 24 contributions in 1958 and a further five contributions in 1959, he moved to England either on economic grounds or to gain new experiences.  He worked in England until 1980 when he returned home because his wife had been left a farm.  At the time, farmers could not make voluntary contributions and, as a result, he was prevented from making social insurance contributions, even if he had wished to do so.  In other cases, people who return from abroad do not earn enough to make contributions.</P>
      
        <P>In 1994, the person in question started to make contributions again.  However, as he had made a small number of contributions in the 1950s, his entitlement to an old age pension is calculated based on an average over the 50 years covered by contributions, as opposed to the 14 years since he had returned to Ireland.  It should be noted that it is possible to buy contributions.  The person&rsquo;s employer took an honourable approach by ensuring the contributions <Col N="533"/>were made at the time.  Not every employer would do be so honest but it was this that resulted in the person being denied a full entitlement to a pension.  Had he paid ten years of stamps he would have been entitled to a full pension.  The fact that he had been working seems to have militated against his being entitled to a full pension.  In the post-Good Friday Agreement era I believe we should be addressing the realities of the 1950s and 1960s in terms of the consequences in old age of actions taken in their youth by persons such as this.  I wonder whether, instead of having a <i>pro rata</i> recognition system, we might have full recognition for UK contributions.  This man had a strong work ethic, and his cross-frontier contributions reflect this from his early teens right through to retirement age.  It seems wrong that having had this work ethic in harsh times he now finds himself penalised when he reaches old age.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I was trying to ascertain how many people might be in the same situation.  I know there are two related but different issues here.  Take the marriage ban, for instance.  Females worked for a while, then the marriage bar was introduced and they were not allowed to work.  Then, post-1974, they were able to work again.  Such women, facing into retirement, are now faced with the same issue.  Probably a large cohort of people are involved.  Separating the two issues again and taking the example of those who went abroad and continued to work, I wonder whether, given European legislation and the mutual recognition norms, we are prepared to review this category of citizen.  Obviously, I would love to see the marriage bar people catered for as well.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>We should highlight for today&rsquo;s youth the realities of the contributions scheme given the current economic climate, which reflects in some respects the realities prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s as people again start talking about going away.  We have to inform them that if they are making contributions here and they go away, they will have to be careful.  As long as they keep their entire working career in Ireland they will be all right.  If not, they must be careful.  There are a number of angles to what I am asking.  Can we highlight the realities for the youth so they are aware of the consequences of the averaging system that exists for contributory pensions?  We have dealt with anomalies in the system before and I hope it is possible to examine the numbers in tandem with the costs involved, as well as examining the option of a cross-frontier approach to mutual recognition of working contributions over a lifetime.</P>
        <P>Again, it seems unfair that where a person may be short a few contributions, he or she may buy them up while in many instances, having made a few contributions in the late 1950s, a person can be precluded from getting a proper pension for the years he or she paid in.  The anomaly underlines the fact that such people, while trying to do things in a straight and honest fashion, are not being rewarded for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully take on board the main points of the Adjournment motion and certainly will convey back to the Department the Senator&rsquo;s requests for information.</P>
        <P>To qualify for the maximum rate of the State contributory pension, a person must start paying social insurance at least ten years before pension age, make a minimum of 260 contributions at an appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions, paid or credited, on the social insurance record over his or her working life.  Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as ten contributions.  The objective of these conditions is to ensure those qualifying for pensions have made an adequate and ongoing commitment to social insurance in Ireland.</P>
        <P>It should also be remembered that people with a long working history in the UK or other countries more than likely will be in receipt of a pension from that country.  In the UK, requirements for the full social insurance pension are being eased from 2010.  Apart from the standard <Col N="534"/>qualifying conditions, a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a pension can also be assessed under a number of arrangements which are in place to cater for those with social insurance contributions at different rates, with contributions from other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has reciprocal social security agreements and with pre-1953 contributions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The manner in which social insurance contributions from other EU countries are to be used in assessing eligibility for a pension is laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.  The same general principles are applied in the reciprocal agreements Ireland has with a number of other countries.  Under these regulations contributions made in another EU country are added to Irish contributions and a notional rate calculated as if all the contributions were made in this country.  A formula is then applied to this result which is designed to ensure the actual Irish pension a person qualifies for reflects the level of Irish social insurance contributions contained in their overall insurance record.  In all, about 22,000 pensions are paid on this basis.</P>
        <P>The pre-1953 pension is a special measure designed to provide a pension to people who would not otherwise qualify for any payment.  These pensions require payment of just 260 contributions, one of which must have been made before 1953.  Payment is made at half the full standard rate.  The scheme has been of particular benefit to people who emigrated in the 1950s.  I know that Senator Cecelia Keaveney has championed this issue for a long period.</P>
        <P>Those with no entitlement to a contributory pension or whose entitlement is much reduced may have their position assessed under the means-tested non-contributory State pension.  At present more than 14,000 people receive this payment in addition to a British retirement pension.</P>
        <P>The average contributions test is a key qualifying condition at present but it is accepted that it can give rise to an anomalous situation in that people with the same level of overall contributions may well qualify for very different rates of payment.  Accordingly, the test can have a serious impact on pension entitlements, especially where a person has a significant gap in his or her overall record.  This applies not only to people who may have emigrated and returned later to Ireland, but it can, for instance, also impact on people who may have been out of the workforce for a long period.  The issue is discussed at length in the Green Paper on pensions which was published in October last year, and a number of possible reforms are put forward for consideration.</P>
        <P>In deciding on what is a reasonable contribution for a pension, we must remember that the contributory State pension is a very valuable benefit.  It is important, therefore, that we ensure those who qualify for the payment have contributed to the fullest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The Government has indicated it will finalise its response to the pensions Green Paper by the end of the year and publish a framework for future policy on all aspects of pension policy.  A review of the qualifying conditions for State contributory pensions will be an important element of such a framework.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State and the Department for the response.  I know the answer will lie in the response to the Green Paper on pensions.  To underline the words used by the Minister of State, the pension should reflect the level of Irish social contributions.  To put this in context, I asked the Department of Social and Family Affairs in Sligo what the man would be entitled to had he not made the contributions in 1958.  I was told it would be 98% of a contributory pension.  Because he made a few contributions when he was 15 or 16, he will now be entitled to the equivalent of less than 50% so it is a significant issue. <Col N="535"/> I am glad to have been given such a comprehensive reply and I hope the statement I have made on the Adjournment can be taken into account in the response to the Green Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking on the need for the Minister for Finance the reassess the decision to cut tax relief on dental treatment from the higher to the standard rate of tax.  The Minister of State will be aware what happened in the budget when tax relief was cut by about 50%.  There is always a temptation for people to see dentists as earning a great deal of money.   In some situations and in certain sectors they do not, however.  They have had a pretty tough time, and I raised the issue of dentists only two weeks ago in respect of the refusal of the Health Service Executive to negotiate a contract with them.  Now they find themselves in a situation where there is a 50% cut in tax relief for certain dental treatments.  In the event, they say it will be very difficult for them to operate in areas such as orthodontics and periodontics, which are specialist areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tax relief on dental treatment was always given at the higher rate and for a very good reason, namely, to encourage people to look after their health.  This was effective.  The danger now is that the reduction of the relief to the standard rate may result in a person who spent &euro;5,000 on a normal course of orthodontic treatment for one of his or her children receiving only &euro;1,000 instead of &euro;2,000, as was the case before the budget.</P>
        <P>This situation is bad for the patient, the dentist and the economy, and I do not believe that the revenue raised from this will justify the reduction.   There will be a problem with health.  Those who must pay large amounts of money for very expensive treatments will simply not have it.  This will have an adverse effect not only on health but also on employment in the industry.  It is difficult to estimate the numbers employed who will be affected by this, but estimates show that approximately 9,000 are employed in the oral health industry.</P>
        <P>If less is spent &mdash; I include spending on laboratories &mdash; there will be fewer people employed and more people on the dole, seeking work or emigrating.  That is not a social effect we would welcome.  It has been very easy to make sweeping cuts in the budget which look good in accountancy terms but they do not look so good when they come into effect.  They also have some political kudos because it is easy to pick soft targets.  Dentists are a soft target as people regard them as earning a large amount of money, but that is not the case in some specialist areas.  We must be more sophisticated about the manner in which we address problems such as this.  People must make proper returns but this measure is a false economy to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Another effect, which I addressed recently, is the possibility of dental tourism, of which the Minister of State may be aware.  It is an extraordinarily profitable business for people in Newry and Belfast.  I returned from Belfast on the train recently and met four people I knew who had travelled to Northern Ireland for dental treatment because it was much cheaper.  This measure will send people to Poland and Northern Ireland, which is an additional loss to the Exchequer and is something we must tackle.  The differential is significant.  It can be five times more expensive to have treatment here than in Northern Ireland.  Those with time on their hands, such as older people, will travel across the Border for that and they will bring their children and grandchildren with them.</P>
        <P>Dentists have met the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Health Service Executive on this and other matters, and they have said they will settle for a cap rather than a full reversal of the decision.  They are not being militant; they understand the political and economic consequences of this problem.  They believe a cap on the amount that could be claimed would be helpful and would encourage people to have necessary treatment.  They also stated that the State offers grants of &euro;120 million to doctors but nothing to dentists <Col N="536"/>or their patients, and that they are the only health care professionals who received no support for including those over 70 in 2001.</P>
        <P>People will be less inclined to go to the dentist or to bring their children for treatment.  It may be a good idea for the Minister of State to look at the issue again and consider that it would be good for the economy and health to reverse it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
        <P>As Senator Ross is aware, the Finance Bill provides for changes to health expenses relief announced in the budget, which will be granted at the standard rate from 1 January 2009.  There is an exception for nursing home expenses which will continue to be allowed at the marginal rate.  Nursing home expenses are exempt from this measure to allow time for the new nursing homes support scheme to be put into operation before any changes are contemplated in relief for nursing homes.  This initiative on health expenses relief will yield &euro;120 million in 2010 and &euro;150 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>The changes provided for in the Finance Bill follow from the changes made in the Finance Act 2007, that is, the removal of the <i>de minimis</i> threshold of &euro;125 for a single individual and &euro;250 for a married couple.  The Finance Act 2007 also provided for the removal of the requirement that there be a defined relationship between the taxpayer and the person who is the subject of the tax claim.</P>
        <P>Standard rating health relief expenses will make the tax system fairer and more equitable for all taxpayers.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the fairness of the tax system and this measure is being introduced in line with that commitment.  The standardising of health expenses relief brings it into line with other reliefs such as those for rent, trade union subscriptions, medical insurance, third level fees and service charges.  The standard rating of health expenses relief will result in better value for money for the Exchequer and will ensure that the relief will benefit the broadest range of taxpayers in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to justify reliefs for one sector of society simply because they earn more than another sector.  Health expenses relief is an expensive relief that has quadrupled in the past four years.  It has risen in cost from &euro;100 million in 2004 to &euro;400 million in 2008. It is difficult to see how we can afford such a generous relief in these challenging economic times.  There can be no doubt that the savings accrued from standard rating health expenses relief of &euro;150 million in a full year will raise much needed revenue.</P>
        <P>The Minister received a number of submissions from the dental profession setting out its concerns in this area.  I will confine my remarks to the tax issues raised.  The dental profession has sought the extension of the relief to routine dental treatments and has based the argument for this on a comparison with the relief available for routine visits to a doctor.  However, routine dental treatment has never qualified for tax relief and dentists are not in competition with doctors.  The cost of such a concession is estimated to be very high.  In the current fiscal situation such a concession is out of the question.</P>
        <P>Routine dental treatment for the purposes of the relief include scaling, extraction and filling of teeth and the provision and repair of artificial teeth and dentures.  Routine dental treatment has been excluded from health expenses relief since the relief&rsquo;s inception in 1967.  I am sure Senator Ross is aware that routine dental treatment is provided through Health Service Executive clinics and by private dentists on the HSE panel to persons who meet the relevant PRSI <Col N="537"/>requirements.  The service is now available free of charge to all medical card holders over 16 years of age.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross also raised the issue of dental tourism, which has been an issue as long as I can remember.  The cost of dental treatment in neighbouring countries has historically been lower than in Ireland.  A significant difference in price is required for customers to travel to Northern Ireland for dental treatment and significant savings on costs would also be required for a customer to travel to mainland Europe for dental treatment.  Nevertheless, I understand that this happens.  It must be understood that there is a need for Irish dentists to be competitive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also like to deal with requests from some dentists to have health expenses relief restricted to treatment undertaken in Ireland.  The position is that tax relief is available for expenses incurred for treatment abroad.  The reason for this is that not to do so would result in an infringement of the EC treaty.  A claim could be made that not to extend the relief for expenses incurred for treatment obtained abroad could result in state aid claims or claims that such a policy places a restriction on the free movement of capital.</P>
        <P>Some dentists have raised the status of dentists under the Competition Act 2002.  This matter is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on behalf of the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
        <P>Taking account of all the issues I have outlined, particularly with regard to equity and fairness, I am sure the Senator will appreciate that the Minister for Finance is not in a position to reverse the measure announced in the budget or provide the concession on routine dental expenses as requested by the representations of the dental industry.</P>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s response was predictable.  I am doubtful about his figures for 2009 and 2010.  The proof will only come when we see the yield.  The figures quoted were &euro;120 million in 2010 and &euro;150 million in a full year.  If those figures turn out to be wildly exaggerated, which I suspect they will because of the effect of the change, will the Minister of State put it to the Minister for Finance that the changes should be revised?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The matter I raise in this debate is the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the financial crisis that is being experienced in my home county by Donegal County Council, which has led to the announcement by union representatives, which has been confirmed, that 238 employees of the council are to be made redundant in the forthcoming months.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with this, I request the Minister to outline an issue I raised in the Seanad a few weeks ago, namely, the levy that was introduced in this year&rsquo;s budget on all non-principal places of residence.  Has the &euro;200 to be collected from properties subject to that levy already been included in the allocation made to the council in this year&rsquo;s local government fund?</P>
        <P>The reason I ask these questions is the Minister may not be aware of the decision taken by Donegal County Council and confirmed to the members on Monday this week.  Some 71 fixed-term employees of the council have been notified that their contracts will not be renewed as of 31 December.  The council has indicated to another 49 employees that their contracts will not be renewed at the end of March and 118 further employees on fixed-term contracts have been informed that it is unlikely their contracts will be renewed when they expire.  That is a <Col N="538"/>total of 238 employees who will potentially not be working with the council over the next couple of months.</P>
        <P>This will have serious effects.  There is a direct effect on the individuals concerned who are losing their council jobs.  We are deeply concerned by this.  The redundancies also have an overall effect in Donegal.  Last night I had the opportunity to talk about the unemployment problems in the county and about the fact that we are losing employment at a rate of 100 jobs per week.  That is far in excess of what is happening in other counties.</P>
        <P>Those job losses will also have a serious effect on the services provided by Donegal County Council.  I am not sure if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is aware of the implications of this.  The loss of 238 staff from the local authority will have major implications of which a Green Party Minister should be aware.  For example, my information is that the jobs of a number of the litter wardens who operate in Donegal County Council will no longer exist.  There will be nobody doing that type of work.  All five sections of the council will be seriously affected.  Some sections will be limited to skeleton staff and, no doubt, there will be serious implications for the service that can be provided.</P>
        <P>With regard to the &euro;200 levy on holiday homes, rental accommodation and non-principal places of residence, I raised this issue a number of weeks ago and was told by the Minister with direct responsibility for it that the likelihood was that there would be an equalisation process and it would be unfair for the local authority to retain the funds.  I disagree with that.  It is wrong and it robs Donegal County Council of much needed funding.</P>
        <P>Let us look, for example, at the three categories to which the levy would apply, holiday homes, rental properties and vacant properties.  In the case of holiday homes, Donegal County Council has the highest number of holiday homes &mdash; nearly a quarter of all holiday homes &mdash; in the State.  With regard to rental properties, we have the sixth largest number of rental properties in the State and the fourth largest number of vacant houses.  The total number of premises subject to the levy in Donegal would bring in a total sum of approximately &euro;4.6 million annually.</P>
        <P>The notion of putting this sum into a central fund and distributing it evenly or via some equality measure to all other councils is wrong because it does not take on board the fact that Donegal County Council does not have the rates base other counties have, particularly those with cities or large urban areas, or those located on the east coast that have seen the benefits of the Celtic tiger over the past decade.  It also does not take into consideration the financial situation in Donegal County Council.</P>
        <P>As bad as the equalisation process would be, the indication from the county manager to the council meeting last Monday was that he understands from the Department that the levy that was to be collected and distributed to the council is already included in the local government fund.  If that is the case, this will further deepen the financial crisis within Donegal County Council.  I seek clarification on both of those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to this adjournment motion on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>General purpose grants from the local government fund are structured to bring about equalisation, over time so that each authority will have sufficient resources, either from central grants or from its local income base, to provide an acceptable level of day-to-day services to its customers.  For the purposes of allocations, a range of factors is taken into account, including each local authority&rsquo;s expenditure on, and income from, each service; the overall amount of <Col N="539"/>funding available for distribution; and the need to provide each local authority with a reasonable allocation towards achieving an acceptable level of services for its customers.</P>
        <P>Donegal County Council&rsquo;s general purpose grant allocation for 2009 is &euro;41,475,164.  General purpose grants to Donegal County Council have increased by 218% since 1997, which the House will agree is a significant increase.  All local authorities have been informed that they should prepare their estimates for 2009 on the basis of the general purpose grants already notified to them.  These allocations take account of projected income from the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences.</P>
        <P>It is for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to locally identified needs.  I am satisfied that the level of funding provided through general purpose grants makes a significant contribution towards enabling all local authorities to provide a reasonable level of services to the public.</P>
        <P>In budget 2009, the Minister for Finance announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce a charge of &euro;200 on all non-principal private residences with the exception of properties as yet unsold.  Liability for the charge will fall on the owners of the properties concerned and a revenue yield of &euro;40 million is estimated for next year.</P>
        <P>When Senator Doherty raised the issue of the charge on non-principal private residences in this House recently, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran, made the point that the revenue base of local authorities is relatively narrow.  This is the reason, together with the wider economic difficulties Ireland faces, the Government decided to introduce a &euro;200 annual charge on all non-principal private residences effective from next year.</P>
        <P>Legislation to give effect to the charge is being prepared in the Minister&rsquo;s Department at present.  This will spell out the detailed manner in which the charge will operate, including the deployment of the revenue accruing from it.</P>
        <P>While all local authorities have been made aware of overall Government policy on payroll control, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, the staffing requirement in each local authority area is a matter for the relevant manager, who is required to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  However, what is happening is crazy.  The Minister of State has confirmed the &euro;200 charge has been already incorporated into the funding given to Donegal County Council.  This means the nominal 6% reduction in this year&rsquo;s allocation to Donegal County Council is closer to being a reduction of 12% or<?oasys _jy ?>13%.  As the Minister of State pointed out, &euro;4.6 million could be accrued by Donegal County Council under this charge.  This is not an extension of Donegal County Council&rsquo;s rates base but simply is a way to bring more money into central government and to dish it out.  This levy has in no way supported any local authority.  I believe it was an abuse to announce in the budget that a measure was being introduced to assist local authorities when, on the one hand, the Government gave them money through this charge, while on the other, it removed it from them.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Senator should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should ask the Minister to clarify what he considers to be relevant provisions.  What does he consider an acceptable minimal level of <Col N="540"/>services to be provided to local authorities?  Does he believe it acceptable that no refuse collectors or litter wardens exist in wide areas of County Donegal or that there are not enough planners or staff to process housing claims for disability benefits?</P>
        <P>I cannot believe this is the decision that has been taken regarding the council.  The Government cannot wash its hands of the fact that 238 people will be made redundant because of the cutbacks inflicted on this local authority.</P>
