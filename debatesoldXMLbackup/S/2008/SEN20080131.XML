	<P>I have notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to provide an update on the progress made by the national 2012 Olympic task force in attracting potential Olympic teams to use Ireland as a training base prior to the London games.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to remove the existing cap on community employment schemes to ensure that all participants on the scheme can remain until reaching retirement age.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the situation regarding the timetable for the design and construction of the new St. Angela&rsquo;s secondary school in Cork city.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline her intentions regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Pollock report commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and published in 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, John Paul Phelan and Jerry Buttimer and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on climate change and energy security, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with spokespersons having 15 minutes, all Senators having ten minutes, on which Senators may share time with agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for closing comments and to respond to questions from spokespersons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday Senators from across the political divide raised a concern at the judgment on the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family and applied behavioural analysis, ABA, education.  There were urgent calls for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House so that we could have a debate on this matter.  What progress has the Leader made in ensuring that we have discussion as soon as possible?  I note the Minister commented on it yesterday, while the Minister of State said that he would defer to her on the issue.  It would be helpful if the Leader could tell us if he has made any progress.</P>
        <P>There has been a continuing drip feed of information on the Taoiseach and I noted the fairly empty Government benches last night during the debate on the Mahon tribunal.  When does the Leader expect legislation on this matter to come before the House?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach yesterday opened the Office for Older People and the Office for Disability and Mental Health.  We clearly welcome the focus on these two areas, but we need an action plan from both Ministers of State in the areas and we need to know what resources they will get.  We could usefully pursue that issue here in the Senate with both Ministers of State.  We do not want more bureaucracy, red tape, quangos and more appointments, but we want to see action on the ground.  Given the focus this House has placed on mental health issues, last week&rsquo;s report by the Irish Psychiatric Association, The lie of the land, should be of great concern to us all.  It makes for very disturbing reading as it states that the resources from the land banks from psychiatric hospitals do not appear to have been put into the mental health services.  Last year saw a reduction in the budget for mental health services.  We now have a new Office for Disability and Mental Health, but there has been a reduction in the budget for the area.</P>
        <P>We have great concerns about the land banks which are being given for co-located hospitals.  At the same time, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has questioned co-location in Cork.  I wonder if this is the beginning of the end of the co-location plan.  It appears as if it is full of contradictions and will not enhance public health services, but lead to a deterioration.  I would like the Leader to ask both <Col N="575"/>Ministers of State to come before the House so we can find out about the resources and the action plans.  This is the second anniversary of A Vision for Change and it is not being implemented.  It is an area of great concern to this House and we should be pursuing it in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to remind <?oasys _dc18- ?>the Leader that when we raised the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in<?oasys _dc0- ?> judgment yesterday we were not seeking a debate on what the judges were doing or seeking to interfere with what might happen in the Supreme Court.  It is a very simple request.  We believe the <?oasys _dc18- ?>State should pick up the bill for the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in<?oasys _dc0- ?> family.  That is really the only issue we can debate because the Leader is right in saying it would be inappropriate to discuss the court case while it is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The question of the reception abroad of RTE broadcasts was raised in the House yesterday, and it is an issue that I have touched on many times in the House.  I have a file, two feet high, built up over the past 15 years relating to people looking for short and long wave as well as satellite reception and arguing that RTE is the only national radio station in Europe which is encrypted on satellite, etc.  I appreciate the reasons behind Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s point yesterday, but I do not agree with his solution.  I believe the solution is not and does not need to be to maintain medium wave, which is not a very good reception.  Long wave is clearer, carries all the stations the Leader mentioned as well as religious services on Sunday mornings and all the sports at other times of the day when they are not available on FM.  Long wave is also clear.  It can be obtained on the car radio, from Edinburgh to Brussels.  It is a much clearer reception.</P>
        <P>Rather than focusing on RTE maintaining the medium wave service, the Government in its support for emigrant groups in the UK, should provide a long wave radio service to them from Ireland.  It would mean they could get a clearer reception, the cost would be small and this is something we could do.  We might also examine the possibilities of broadband radio, which is now available for less than &euro;100 and is easier to use than an ordinary radio.  It means they could listen to Radio Kerry, Clare FM or any of the local stations around Ireland, just at the press of a button.  The issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was very important and he is right, perhaps, in saying people might not be able to change over to any new arrangement.  We should support emigrant communities in making better radio reception available rather than trying to maintain the current system.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the IFA and the Minister for Agriculture and Food on an issue that many Senators have raised over recent years, namely, Brazilian beef.  It is a major victory for Irish agriculture and I congratulate the lobbying powers of <Col N="576"/>the IFA.  This is a classic example of lobbying groups doing something which is good for the country as well as for themselves.  It must be recognised that the Minister has supported them all the way and I said as much when she was in this House some months back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the issue of the recent disturbances in Kenya.  I was in Kenya on the day of the elections and witnessed at first hand the queues forming at many polling stations as citizens sought to exercise their democratic right to vote.  Naturally, I was disturbed and saddened afterwards to see the consequential riots and disturbances.  As many Senators will know, Kenya was, up to these disturbances, one of the most peaceful, stable and vibrant countries in east Africa.  Many Irish aid agencies base themselves in Kenya and target their operations from there into Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania as well as within Kenya itself.  I am concerned about the potential impact this is having on our aid agencies.  Will the Leader ask the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid to come to the Seanad and, perhaps, make a statement on the current state of affairs and how it is affecting the Irish aid programme, including our aid agencies based in Kenya?</P>
        <P>I see this morning that the head of the African Union is concerned about the potential outbreak of ethnic violence and genocide in Kenya.  Will the Leader impress on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the need for the European Union to bring as much pressure to bear as possible, to try to resolve the situation in Kenya and east Africa?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking a debate in the House in reaction to the Thatcherite tactics of the Health Service Executive in its negotiations with the pharmacists.  If the HSE has its way many pharmacies in rural Ireland will be forced to closed.  The Thatcherite tactics by the HSE have been exposed by the issuing of an interim contract on 9 January despite the express statement by the Government and the Minister for Health and Children to the effect that the dispute between the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union should be resolved by an independent body.  The issuing of these contracts flies in the face of this Government&rsquo;s and Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s belief in social partnership and I seek a debate on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a Cabinet sub-committee decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that there are just three Government Bills on the Order Paper.  One is on Committee Stage, one is on Report Stage <Col N="577"/>and I believe it is intended that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not move the other one.  Enlarging on the point made by Senator Fizgerald, could the Seanad hear from the Leader, perhaps, what Bills are to be dealt with this session in the House?  This will be a relatively short session and perhaps the Leader might let the House know what is intended for sitting times up to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and Easter week.</P>
        <P>Co-located hospitals have been mentioned as well as the proposed use of hospital land and alterations thereto.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works in the previous Administration, former Deputy Tom Parlon, came up with a plan for a State inventory of surplus State properties, having reviewed all the Departments and their respective agencies.  Will the Leader say whether such an inventory exists?  Was it every completed?  We never heard that it was.</P>
        <P>On the matter raised by Senator Daly, I do not know precisely the detail he has in mind, but I would like to support him.  I am mindful in particular of the smaller pharmacies in provincial towns, those on the sides of streets that we should like to hold on to rather than have them abolished in deference to larger retail centres and so on.  I want more detail of what the Government has in mind in this regard.  Picking up on what the Senator said, the situation at the moment is a shambles.  Perhaps the Leader might comment on that too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the issue of RTE&rsquo;s intention to cease its medium wave service on RTE Radio 1.  The point I made was that it will affect in particular older members of the Irish community in Britain.  I appreciate the comments made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the issue that has now arisen.  I know he is an optimist but he knows full well that a big box of long wave radios will not be sent over to Britain to solve the problem and the logistics of trying to achieve that are somewhat far-fetched.  Ultimately, this issue will be quietly put to bed and a whole generation &mdash; the older generation in Britain &mdash; will be ignored in this regard.</P>
        <P>Many Senators travel to Britain regularly and come in contact with the Irish community there.  If one visits the homes, as I have done, one finds a little bit of Ireland there.  If such emigrants are accustomed to receiving RTE Radio 1 in a particular manner, they will not avail of the new technological changes.  I am talking about the older members of that community.  I know well that after 1 March, we shall be hearing how these people have suffered and that their lifeline has been cut off.  That is a pity and whatever money is involved in maintaining this service, I believe, is well owed to the Irish community in Britain.  I do not believe we shall be remembered kindly in years to come if we do not take into consideration now the emotional and sentimental impact of this initiative.</P><Col N="578"/>
        <P>The person who communicated to me from Britain on this issue had done a considerable amount of research.  He is a columnist in a newspaper, and is not just writing as one person.  He has been surveying this issue extensively throughout Britain.  I know him and he is genuine.  The manner in which he approached this issue on behalf of Irish people in Britain who are affected is genuine, sincere and is an appeal from the heart.  It has come to the right place when it has come to Parliament.  It has come to the Seanad and I hope that in the debate promised by the Leader for next week we will have an opportunity to discuss it further.  I have a great deal more material which I cannot put forward on the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader organise a debate on regional development?  This is in the context of the proposed Cork to Swansea ferry link which Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and I raised yesterday.  I am disappointed to read in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today that it is 95% certain a consortium will not run the ferry next year.  It seems neither the Members of this House on the Government side nor the Cabinet believe life exists beyond the M50.  I am disappointed no member of the Green Party is present in the House because we still do not have a commitment that incentives for the Cork docklands will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>On Monday night at a public meeting on co-location, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, stated that while on one level a proposed site for co-location is unsustainable he was in favour of it.  It is important to the people of Bishopstown and Wilton who will have a co-located hospital foisted upon them that we have this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to support the request of my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, for a debate on the pharmaceutical issue.  Like him, in recent days I was contacted by quite a number of pharmacists in the mid-west region.  Many are proprietors of small shops and are far from the large multinationals such as Boots who are able to take on board some of the HSE proposals.  Many of them are concerned they will not be able to keep staff employed or to keep their doors open.  A certain amount of disinformation or confusion has come from the HSE.  I am indebted to my colleague, Senator Geraldine Feeney, who advised me the Joint Committee on Health and Children hopes to bring both sides before it.  This would be ideal.  Let us have talks across the table without hiding behind propaganda.  In supporting Senator Daly, I ask the Leader to advance this matter in his own way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On 19 February 2003, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, introduced the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 to the House. <Col N="579"/> It took more than a year for it to reach Committee Stage, which it did on 7 April 2004, by which time 150 amendments had been tabled, more than 90 of which were placed on the Order Paper by our former colleague Dr. Mary Henry.  Not a single amendment was accepted.</P>
        <P>This chimes in with what the leader of Fine Gael in the Seanad, Senator Fitzgerald, stated on mental health issues.  Recently, substantial professional interest in this area indicated frustration, particularly with regard to the Central Mental Hospital, where persons who have recovered or who have reached advanced age are appropriate to be released back into the community but cannot be released because of the failure to accept legislative amendments with regard to simple legal machinery permitting the release of these people.  In light of this failure on the part of legislation to address the real issues confronting certain people and the management of these hospitals, will the Leader establish whether the Government proposes to introduce amendments of this type into legislation dealing with insanity in the criminal law?</P>
        <P>We have increasingly draconian legislation aimed at deporting people with the minimum of legal fuss or capacity for appeal.  A number of issues have been raised, including the case of Great Agbonlahor, an autistic child returned to Nigeria, and a young woman with no visible means of support or surviving family members who was returned to the streets of Lagos.</P>
        <P>We are blandly assured these people will be all right and that conditions are fine.  However, it is never followed up.  Previously, I asked for information with which the Leader stated he would come back to me but so far he has not been able to do so.  I again ask the Leader to inquire whether any follow up takes place through our embassy in Nigeria and if not why not.  We should demand it.  If we are fobbed off with stories that when these people are returned to their country of origin nothing will happen to them, they will be able to survive and they are perfectly well, let us know that this is in fact the case.  I do not believe for a minute that it is.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Daly.  I understood the dispute between the pharmacists and the HSE was ventilated at considerable length in this House during the previous session.  I also understood a measure of agreement had been reached and that both sides agreed the way forward was independent arbitration.  It seems the HSE has made an attempt to create facts on the ground in advance of independent arbitration.  It is not appropriate that prior to independent arbitration getting underway the HSE should pre-empt it by coercing pharmacists into an advance agreement.</P>

	<P>I join with my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the Brazilian beef issue.  I also congratulate the IFA. <Col N="580"/> As a lobby group, it did tremendous detective work in bringing this to light.  This is an opportune time to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House to discuss what was contained in a recent announcement on extra benefits for the sheep sector which is experiencing a difficult time and to discuss REPS 4 in detail.  It would be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
        <P>I also support my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, and other Senators in calling for the Leader to facilitate a debate on the pharmacists&rsquo; issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add to the observations on the ban on Brazilian beef.  I worked for the Irish Farmers Association and represented their interests in Brussels during the 1970s.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the effectiveness of the IFA as a professional lobbying body.  The work done by the IFA and other farming organisations in highlighting the difference in the treatment of farmers and beef producers in countries such as Brazil and in the European Union has been vindicated and the decision of the European Commission is very welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislative programme for the spring was circulated to us this week.  Our leader, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, made the point that we had little legislation in the previous session.  It is an issue which also arises in the D&aacute;il.  The current legislative programme is very modest.  Given the work we did in the previous session, does any real prospect exist of us getting through it or of the Government fulfilling this programme?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government is distracted and after a short time in office it has lost its way.  I understand why it is distracted.  We saw it yesterday with new revelations about the Taoiseach.  We also find that when any of his stories, whether with regard to his connection to the Phoenix Park casino issue, his contacts with the tax authorities or his dig-out stories in the Mahon tribunal, are put under close scrutiny they do not bear up and the Taoiseach has been found out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not allow anybody to go down this road with regard to the Mahon tribunal.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate it is frowned upon by some people to make such remarks about the Taoiseach, given his achievements.  Senator Eoghan Harris has strong views about this matter, particularly in the context of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As an eminent legal figure, Senator Regan will be aware that matters before the courts are <i>sub judice</i>.  I do not want the House to be brought into disrepute by becoming involved in matters before the courts and would prefer if Senators steered clear of such issues.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="581"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not raising any matters that are in the courts, although a matter related to a prosecution in the courts which a fellow Senator raised yesterday was entirely out of order.  I am not speaking about courts but about an issue concerning the Taoiseach.  Yesterday, I corrected a matter concerning the presentation by the Taoiseach of his unique address to the United States Congress.  I pointed out that the only Taoisigh to have addressed the joint Houses of Congress were the Fine Gael leaders, Liam Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald and John Bruton.  When we talk about the peace process we write out of the script all of those who contributed from all parties, whether Garret FitzGerald, John Bruton or Albert Reynolds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>That has never been the case.  We never heard the term &ldquo;decommissioning&rdquo; until John Bruton became Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wrong to appropriate the credit for the peace process to one man and use it as vindication for the Taoiseach and an excuse for not upholding the rule of law.  We should address this issue at a future date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with Senator Norris&rsquo;s remarks on the pharmacists&rsquo; dispute.  It should go to arbitration immediately and an outcome should not be pre-empted.</P>
        <P>The recent decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw a major charge in the case against Mr. Eddie Halvey was somewhat contentious.  The DPP stated that he cannot give details about the process by which he arrives at decisions or precise details of a case because it would result in individuals being judged by public opinion and finding themselves in difficulty.  This is a reasonable position for him to adopt and one I support.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, I propose that in contentious cases such as the Halvey case which do not occur often but enter public discourse, a commission of three eminent legal persons should sit in arbitration and approve the DPP&rsquo;s position.  As this would require legislation, I ask the Leader to convey my proposal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Senators should not read into my remarks either implicit or explicit criticism of the DPP who is above reproach and a person of integrity.  The issue is one of achieving transparency, due process and the filtering of cases, especially those of a contentious nature.  The establishment of a commission would assist the judicial process and support the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I commend it to the Leader for consideration by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>While the life of a young girl in County Cork is being crushed out of her by a spinal deformity, the Health Service Executive indicates it is appropriate that she wait until 2010 before it will consider providing the <Col N="582"/>treatment she needs.  Fortunately, someone else has a greater sense of morality than the HSE.  Case law indicates that the HSE would lose a case brought before the European Court of Justice and would be required to pay for the girl&rsquo;s treatment.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to explain the reason the HSE finds it acceptable to allow a young child to die slowly as a result of the weight of her body while it refuses to give her treatment.  The Minister should also state whether it is appropriate that the State should not pay for the necessary treatment.  This is one of the most immoral decisions I have heard in a long time.</P>
        <P>Senators on the Government side should note that a Cabinet sub-committee consisting of the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and Minister for Health and Children decided to reduce the costs of medication in the health system.  The HSE is trying to implement this decision in the pharmacy sector.  For this reason, rather than referring to the role of the HSE, it would be more appropriate for those Senators to raise the matter with the Ministers in question.</P>

	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Twomey on the pharmacy dispute.  I also join my colleague, Senator Buttimer, in calling for a debate on regional development.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader contact the Minister for Education and Science regarding the ongoing debacle arising from the possibility of establishing a university for the south-east region?  Before Christmas, the Government appointed Dr. Jim Port, a British gentleman with many years experience in education, to report on the third level facilities available in the south-east region and the current operations of Waterford Institute of Technology.  I understand Dr. Port&rsquo;s report was presented to the Government before Christmas.  Despite having been contacted by the institute of technology, the regional authority and various local bodies in the south east, the Minister has refused to publish the document.  Two schools of thought have arisen as a result.  The majority of local people believe the reason the Minister has not published the report is that it makes positive recommendations which would compel her to make a positive decision and grant university status to the Waterford Institute of Technology.  Regardless of its contents, it is essential the report is published.  Will the Leader bring as much pressure as possible to bear on the Minister to ensure the report is published as soon as possible?</P>
        <P>I refer to a recent three-part series broadcast on RTE on the State Pathologist, Professor Marie Cassidy.  It will be recalled that during my previous term as a Senator, I expressed strong support for Professor Cassidy and requested that additional funding be made available to improve <Col N="583"/>the facilities in south Dublin from which she and her predecessor have operated because they leave a great deal to be desired.</P>
        <P>I am unhappy, however, about the disclosure of certain details in the series.  I had time to watch the first of the three programmes.  Anyone with an interest in pathology or the way our criminal system operates would be interested in the series.  Some of the detailed information broadcast about recent sensitive cases, including the discovery of bodies, was highly inappropriate.  These cases concern people&rsquo;s children or brothers or sisters.  Professor Cassidy made a serious error of judgment in some of the comments she made.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to correct an impression Senator Regan may have inadvertently left, namely, that the Taoiseach is less than generous in paying tribute to fellow Taoisigh.  The Taoiseach, in his Westminster address, was most careful to pay tribute to John Bruton&rsquo;s work for peace.  I was glad to note his comments in this regard.  It is not true to state the Taoiseach is cavalier or indifferent.  Everyone knows he was personally and politically delighted when John Bruton was appointed European Union Ambassador to the United States and he endorsed the appointment at every level, both privately and publicly.</P>

	<P>I raise with the Leader the issue of the primary care unit in Athlone.  Before Christmas I asked about the lack of progress on the primary care unit in Athlone since the designs were first drawn up in 1999.  The property has been purchased and nothing is happening.  I am disappointed that I have got no response from the Leader and that nothing seems to be happening.  I appreciate it was Christmas and that, perhaps, it was difficult for him.  I urge the Leader to ascertain the position from the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>My second point concerns the ambulance service, which has threatened to take strike action.  In Athlone on a Wednesday there is one ambulance covering the whole area.  I ask that the Minister for Health and Children come into the House yet again and give us honest answers on what we are to do when somebody becomes ill in the Athlone area and the ambulance has gone to Mullingar or to Portiuncula Hospital.  This has happened.  I also ask that she clarify the contracting out of the transporting of patients and the escorting of psychiatric patients, as the system has been changed.  We need clear answers from the Minister on all of these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was hoping to have some clarification from the Leader on my request for two debates that I made prior to Christmas.  One was for a debate on the roll-out of the national disability strategy and how we are meeting the needs of people with a disability in such a <Col N="584"/>way as to enable them to take their rightful place as equal members of society.  There are still a number of legislative issues to be addressed as at present there is no recognition afforded of their capacity to give consent to various issues and to make choices about various aspects of their own lives, such as where and with whom they live and who should receive the money they receive as part of the disability allowance.  A significant sum of money has been allocated in this year&rsquo;s budget for people with disabilities.  It is important that Members have the opportunity to hear where that money will be spent and are given an assurance that it will all be spent in the area of disability. </P>
        <P>This brings me to the second request for a debate on the issue of mental health and the implementation of A Vision for Change.  It is apparent that the moneys allocated in the budget for 2007 were not spent in the areas for which they were allocated.  This area is in great need of funds.  The implementation of A Vision for Change has still not progressed, despite the fact that the Health Service Executive said it hoped to have a draft implementation plan by the end of December.  It is not acceptable that four years on we are still talking about draft plans for implementation.  I should appreciate if the Leader would indicate when we may have two those very important debates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Senators have commented on the nature of the legislative programme for this session.  One of the most prominent Bills concerns the proposal to set up the Dublin transport authority, the objective of which is to implement Transport 21 within Dublin and the Dublin region.  Will the Leader facilitate a debate on Transport 21 and its implementation?  Two issues merit debate.  The first is the degree of change that is taking place in Transport 21.  For example, the new plan proposes to put heavy rail rather than LUAS on the Broadstone line.  This will seriously threaten the ability of the Grangegorman Institute of Technology to get planning permission for its new master plan and is the kind of policy change that should be debated here.</P>
        <P>The second issue is one that was raised at the Joint Committee on Transport yesterday.  The leaders of the local authorities within the Dublin area raised the prospect of congestion charging, a proposal not contained in Transport 21.  It is the role of elected politicians and our leaders, such as the Minister for Transport, to raise such issues and have them debated in the House rather than leave it to executive managers in local authorities, who have no choice but to deal with the mess arising from the implementation of contradictory plans and for which they must carry the can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I was encouraged here yesterday to see the consensus across the House on the severity of the legal costs being imposed on the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family from <Col N="585"/>Wicklow who sought an entitlement for an appropriate education for their autistic son in the High Court.  The proposal by Senator Ross to seek an immediate debate was a positive one, given that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, was coming to the House in the afternoon.  However, I was disappointed when I saw how the Green Party voted on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make the point that when we speak for something, it is important we follow it with our vote.  The &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family may be made bankrupt by the courts.  </P>
        <P>It is clear from the <i>Irish Independent</i> that we are wasting in excess of &euro;35 million on renting prefabs.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House to address this serious issue in the context of our growing population.  An extra 13,000 children are coming into our primary schools this year.  These prefabs were rented, not bought out.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s forward plans in terms of permanent building structures for our growing population?  I would appreciate it if the Leader would respond as soon as possible as this debate was sought prior to Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, Regan, Donohoe and Healy Eames expressed their concern about the decision of the High Court on the case brought before it by the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole suggested that the State should pick up the bill.  I will endeavour to see how I can facilitate the request of Members to have this matter discussed in the House without infringing in any way on the separation of the courts and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I will address the issue of impending legislation at the end of the Order of Business.  On the other matters raised by Senator Fitzgereald and on matters concerning education, I am pleased to inform Members that the Minister for Education and Science will come to the House in three weeks&rsquo; time when there will be a special debate on the broad issue of autism.  A significant number of young couples find themselves in very difficult positions and to say they are traumatised is an understatement. When one visits these young couples in their homes one realises they receive no assistance in some cases.  There are 12 or 14 excellent centres where the service is being provided.</P>
        <P>Keith Duffy, who is a champion of this cause, is a great example of what can be done.  Early intervention has got to be the order of the day in <Col N="586"/>respect of providing the service.  I understand the Minister is looking at this matter sympathetically and I expect an announcement soon.  We have a date placed on the Minister&rsquo;s diary for three weeks&rsquo; time, which is the earliest possible date that could have been arranged for a debate of this nature.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked about RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s proposal to cease broadcasting on medium wave.  Having listened to the Senators speak on this matter perhaps RT&Eacute; will start an advertising campaign on its medium wave bandwidth and even defer its decision for a couple of months to facilitate those who wish to make an application, such as the Catholic Church and the Gaelic Athletic Association in the UK, and all those other organisations that help the senior citizens and those unfortunate people who had to leave our shores in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  I know hundreds and perhaps thousands of these people as I used to be over there on tour five times a year for two weeks at a time.  They would go to all my functions on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  It was heartbreaking to see them there on a Friday evening with a smile on their faces.  The greatest gift I could give them was to bring over the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> with the <i>Midland Topic</i>.  All these things kept them in touch with home and were very important.  The expression this morning by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that it is part of the furniture in their kitchens, bed-sittingrooms or bedrooms to have RTE available was correct as it keeps them in touch with their homeland.</P>
        <P>RTE has a responsibility in this regard.  The chief executive, Mr. Cathal Goan, is one of the greatest Irish men living in our country at this time.  He knows exactly the plight of the emigrant, having been such a wonderfully successful director general of TG4 when it was getting off the ground.  In the interests of everything good done in Ireland over the years, I ask that he would rally to the call and begin an advertising campaign to ascertain through the GAA and the churches how many thousands of people will need to have their radios replaced.  It is a simple request.</P>
        <P>RTE will save quite a lot of money from this change because it is expensive to broadcast on medium wave, which I presume is the only reason the service is being removed.  As long as the services on a Sunday morning and all the various other Irish events that can be received in the UK, can be received on another wavelength, we in the Oireachtas would be happy.  We are very unhappy at present, however, because people are being left to feel no one really cares.  I want it to go out from Seanad &Eacute;ireann that this House does care and is seriously concerned.  We await a response from the director general of RTE on how it will address the situation.  We will work hand in hand with the national broadcaster to find how we can facilitate the requests made in the House yesterday and today.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Carty and Regan congratulated the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and <Col N="587"/>Food and the IFA on bringing to a successful conclusion the Brazilian beef issue.  I will request that the Minister would come to the House to debate agriculture.  As Leader from 1997 to 2002, when I called an agriculture debate and put it on the cl&aacute;r, it was always an all-day debate.  I look forward to having a meaningful review of the entire agriculture portfolio, particularly the successful conclusion of the Brazilian beef issue, on which the IFA and the Minister have worked hand in hand.  I will ensure this takes place at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan raised serious issues with regard to the Kenyan elections and I will pass on his views to the Minister.  With regard to the proposed changes to payments to pharmacies, Senators Daly, Coghlan, O&rsquo;Sullivan, Norris and Carty expressed their support for pharmacists, especially those in rural areas and smaller towns, and those family pharmacists who have given such tremendous service to families for generations.  We care about this issue.  When our concerns were raised previously, particularly at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting where more than 80% of members expressed their serious concerns, the Health Service Executive extended the scheme, through the intervention of the Minister and others, as I understand it.  I have no difficulty asking the Minister to come to the House to update us on the serious request made of me today.</P>
        <P>Senators John Paul Phelan and Buttimer called for a debate on regional development and co-location.  I have no difficulty in allowing time for this to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris highlighted the issue of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister.  I will have inquiries made into the issue he raised concerning the Nigerian situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan raised the old chestnut of bashing the Taoiseach in various ways while making his concerns available to the House one more time.  All fair-minded people will accept there has been no more successful Taoiseach in our lifetime or in the past seven years than Bertie Ahern.</P>

Senator Twomey called for the Minister to come to the House to explain the issue of the treatment of a child.  I have no difficulty in having the Minister come to the House to debate the up-to-date position on matters pertaining to the health portfolio, in particular the unfortunate case of the patient in Cork highlighted by the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan called for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House.  As I said, the Minister will be in the House in three weeks so the Senator will be able to raise his points at that time.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden raised the issues of a primary care unit and an ambulance service for Athlone.  We now have access numbers for all of the HSE senior executives in every region who can be contacted.  We also have the Adjournment on which these matters can be raised, in addition to Private Members&rsquo; business when parties can decide on prioritising the urgency of various matters raised by Senators.  Information on most of these issues can be ascertained through those channels.  Unfortunately, I am not a Minister so those are the ways in which we try to obtain information.  I will try to give the Senator all the help I can but she has the same channel for finding the information as I do.</P>
        <P>I have given Senator Corrigan my word that we will debate the two issues she has raised.  I am endeavouring to find time in the Ministers&rsquo; diaries for such matters.  Senator Donohoe called for a debate on Transport 21, which would be timely, and I will have no difficulty in arranging time for such a debate.  Senator Healy Eames expressed her concerns about educational matters, which can be debated when the Minister attends this House in three weeks&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>I wish to update the House on the Government&rsquo;s proposals for Bills that are expected to be published during this session: Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism &mdash; Irish Sports Council (Amendment) Bill; Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources &mdash; Broadcasting Bill and Electricity Regulation (EirGrid) <Col N="591"/>(Amendment) Bill; Department of Education and Science &mdash; Student Support Bill; Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; Chemicals Regulation and Enforcement Bill and Employment Law Compliance Bill; Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &mdash; Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Confirmation of Orders) Bill and Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill; Department of Finance &mdash; Finance Bill and Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill; Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill (Reform Treaty); Department of Health and Children &mdash; Adoption Bill and Health (Long-term Residential Care Services) Bill; Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; Legal Services Ombudsman Bill and Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill; Department of Social and Family Affairs &mdash; Social Welfare and Pensions Bill; Department of Transport &mdash; Dublin Transport Authority Bill.</P>

    <Title>Climate Change and Energy Security: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to make a further statement on recent developments on the climate change issue, which are of crucial significance for this country.  The Taoiseach was right last week when he said that the proposed changes present a huge challenge for Irish society and our economy.  As the Taoiseach also said, these developments present us with an opportunity to address the necessary changes to create employment, cut back on our fossil fuel bill and protect the environment.</P>
        <P>This is a complex subject which has been made more complex by last week&rsquo;s announcement from the European Commission.  We are dealing with a series of policy measures that work in a variety of different markets, often with target figures that make it difficult to assess the precise implications of what is happening.  To begin with, I will try to explain some of the issues and implications as I see them.  A year ago the European Commission came out with what it called the 20-20-20 target.  In effect, it meant that the European Union would act coherently to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2020.</P>
        <P>The policy also seeks to increase our energy efficiency by 20% in the same timeframe, as well as developing 20% of our energy resources from renewable power supply systems.  Some people <Col N="592"/>have criticised that target as being too simplistic.  Economists may ask how one can set such a simple target which does not reflect the complexities of the real world.  It is a good target, however, because it covers essential developments such as climate change and the key responses to it in renewables and energy efficiency.  These 20% targets have been set not as precise limits but as targets that we can then exceed.</P>
        <P>As Members of the House will be aware, these strategic targets were approved by heads of government at the European Council in March last year.  The Taoiseach and other EU heads of government signed up not only to that 20% reduction but also to a further 10% reduction if we can achieve international agreement &mdash; which I believe we must and will achieve &mdash; as part of the United Nations process that has led from Kyoto to Bali last November and through to Copenhagen, where we hope there will be an agreement in 2009.  Therefore the European Union is committed not just to that 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but also, subject to international agreement, a further 10% reduction.</P>
        <P>The proposals launched last week set out the mechanisms, suggested by the Union, by which each country has to achieve the target.  They recognise that in order to reach the 20% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions we must get a 14% reduction from where we were in 2005.  By that year we had already achieved a 6% reduction but we need to achieve a further 14%  to reach the 20% target.  The EU is also proposing that the further 14% reduction would come from two sectors in the European economy.  The first sector comprises large-scale emitters such as big power generators, steel companies and car manufacturers.  They are in what is known as the emissions trading system whereby they have an allocation to emit any carbon.  If they exceed that they must pay for it.  The bulk of the 14% reduction will come from that heavy industrial sector, which will see a 20% reduction in the period 2005-2020.</P>
        <P>The non-emissions trading sector, including small businesses, individual residences, transport and agriculture, will have to provide a 10% cut in the 15-year period from 2005 to 2020. Relatively, the agriculture, transport and small business sectors of the economy will take on a smaller share of the reductions that must be made.</P>
        <P>The European Union also has a proposal to share the reductions in the non-heavy industrial sector.  It proposes a fair and effective system which is close to what we could have expected within our national climate change strategy regarding the dividing of resources.  Under the proposal, countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, the economies of which have not developed similarly to ours or those of other wealthier countries, can further increase their emissions by 20%.  Member states with a large GDP which have undergone significant economic <Col N="593"/>development and which have that ability to do so, will make significant reductions.  For example, Ireland, Denmark and Luxembourg will reduce emissions by 20% in sectors such as agriculture, transport and energy rather than in heavy industrial sectors.  These broad targets have been set and frame the various responses to deliver them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union&rsquo;s other significant announcement last week related to how member states would meet the targets.  The proposed changes concern three main areas, the first of which is the rules and regulations of the emissions trading system for large industrial polluters.  By and large, the proposed changes are positive.  To date, the system of trading has been based on existing power supply companies or cement factories, for example, having an allocation based on their historical emissions and a right to emit carbon.  Many argue that is inefficient and unfair and a much preferable system would be to auction that right.  Companies will have to bid for the right to manage this.  Rather than each national government issuing the allocations, whether they are auctioned, the Union suggests it should be done on a centralised European basis.  The intention is to use the auction system on a stepped up basis in order that it can be gradually introduced.  There is a question about whether it should apply to industries which might leave the Union were it applied for other markets, resulting in their products having to be imported.  This is known as carbon leakage and it would mean no reduction in carbon, as the industry would only be transferred to another market.  The Commission is seeking to be flexible about this and by 2010 or 2011 hopes to introduce a more flexible system to prevent carbon leakage.  The movement towards an auction-based ETS to be introduced gradually is a positive and progressive development.</P>
        <P>A more significant development concerns renewable energy.  The Commission has outlined in more detail how the 20% renewable energy target will be met by 2020 as part of the overall 2020 package.  This is complex because it involves many years and figures but the Commission states Ireland is almost halfway there and a further 11% increase in renewable energy supplies is needed to meet the 2020 target.  On a rational and fair basis, the Commission will set different percentage targets for each member state in order that the European Union as a whole meets its overall reduction target.  In our case, 16% of our energy supply must come from renewable sources by 2020.  That is in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy in this area but we will not stop when we achieve that target.  People might ask why Ireland which has significant renewable resources through wind and wave power has only been set a target of 16% and not a higher target.  Currently, 5% of our energy supply comes from renewable sources and, in 13 years, Ireland is expected to treble its renewable energy power supply.  Energy is used primary in three areas, with one third devoted to power generation which tends to receive all the <Col N="594"/>attention, one third to heating which is not discussed as much because it is not evident to the public and one third to transport.  There is huge potential in the electricity area.  A recent major all-Ireland study stated we could achieve more than 40% of our renewable energy target by 2020, which would be ahead of the curve in international terms.  We could be a world leader in this regard.  However, it is more difficult in the other two areas.</P>
        <P>With regard to heating, the issues are developing the infrastructure quickly and the supply system and raw materials available.  How can our land be used most effectively to provide a wood fired heating supply or waste heating resources?  A significant increase is needed in this area to meet the target.  Likewise, we have a particular difficulty in the transport sector because our transport use is increasing rapidly every year and the development of bio-fuels will not be easy.  Bio-fuels is a difficult environmental issue in the context of developing alternative bio-fuels while protecting the environment and using resources effectively.</P>
        <P>One of the significant developments in the Commission&rsquo;s announcement last week, which is positive, is that for a bio-fuel to qualify as a contributor to the overall target, it will have to demonstrate it is not produced in an unsustainable manner in order that, for example, a rainforest is not being chopped down, or a natural habitat is being destroyed or wetlands or existing forestry which act as a carbon sink are not being used to produce the energy.  Key environmental controls will be put in place to ensure bio-fuels that come from those sources cannot be used, which is very positive.  The Commission has also stated bio-fuels will have to lead to at least a 35% reduction in carbon emissions compared with petrol or diesel.  There is a great deal of evidence to show certain bio-fuels may not result in a significant carbon reduction and the same amount of energy may used in their the production as they produce.  The European Union and the Commission held hard fought discussions about what the percentage reduction should be.  Some argue that it should have been higher but that is what the Commission has agreed regarding the level the market should ensure.</P>
        <P>The third response to the overall targets set out by the Commission relates to carbon capture and storage.  This technology is not available commercially and is still at research stage.  It relates to taking the carbon emitted by a coal fired plant or a peat or gas plant and storing it during power generation underground rather than releasing it into the atmosphere.  This is a difficult technical and economic issue.  It will be difficult commercially to generate power effectively using this technology.  There are also various environmental and safety issues about how to store the carbon emissions.  The European Union committed &euro;20 billion to develop 12 demonstration projects by 2015 to ascertain how the technology might work. <Col N="595"/> If it can be cracked on an economic basis, there is huge potential for significant reductions and to generate electricity from another diverse source which increases our security of supply.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response to the European Union&rsquo;s proposal has been positive in its communications.  We have reiterated that the Government is committed to the 20% reduction target, to which it signed up at the Council of Ministers last June, and the 30% reduction target if there is international agreement.  The Taoiseach and the Government have explicitly reaffirmed Ireland&rsquo;s interest in meeting such targets within the Union.  It was correct for us to question the testing and to provide an assessment to make sure the system devised was fair, effective and efficient.  Every other country has done so in examining its responses.</P>
        <P>I believe every country has expressed agreement with the overall target while raising concerns over certain aspects.  The UK may be different from us in saying it has difficulties with regard to renewables because, while that country&rsquo;s renewables target of 15% is similar to ours, it will be much harder to achieve in countries with a smaller landmass, larger population and fewer natural resources than Ireland.  Other countries will raise different concerns but given that the European Union has committed to this in such a vociferous manner in Bali and elsewhere we will see agreement on the measures and, if there is an international agreement, we will seek to go further with a 30% reduction.</P>
        <P>The mechanism will be tested and scrutinised.  The Commissioner for Energy, Mr. Piebalgs, stated this week there would be flexibility between countries in respect of the renewables target but that we cannot shift the overall target to which we have committed.  Thus, if any country seeks changes, another country will have to agree to take more.  Such an agreement will be difficult to achieve, so we have to assume the system will be introduced as proposed.  In my opinion, the Commission has taken a balanced approach.  It is right that certain technical details should be teased out, such as our high population growth rate relative to other European countries and the relationship between GNP and GDP, without questioning the overall direction and intent of the Union.</P>
        <P>Those who are scared of the climate change process have in the past cast doubts on the science, claiming for example on the basis of Internet research that sunspots are to blame.  That argument is not heard as much now because it simply is not tenable.</P>

	<P>It is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Increasingly, the response focuses on the cost factor and the economic consequences.  I acknowledge there will be cost implications.  The EU has estimated that the <Col N="596"/>proposed measures could cost up to &euro;90 billion.  However, from an energy policy viewpoint the cost of not making these changes is huge.  Leaving aside the environmental aspect, the over-reliance by the EU on fossil fuels is the key economic motive for introducing the measures.  Based on the price of oil at $60 per barrel, the savings from the changes in terms of cost reductions in our fossil fuel bills are estimated at &euro;50 billion.  If oil costs $100 per barrel, we are looking at savings of &euro;90 billion.  In other words, the measures are cost neutral.  The savings in fuel alone pay for the other costs of developing renewable alternatives.  Therefore, those who seem obsessed at the cost to the Irish Government are missing the bigger picture of the geological reality that global oil production has reached the point where it will decrease rather than increase annually.  With 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy consisting of imported fossil fuels, we are particularly exposed.  We have the potential to cut our dependence by taking on the agenda of developing renewables and saving energy.</P>
        <P>Energy efficiency has not received much attention even though it is the third and most important of the 2020 targets.  The Government is due to publish an energy efficiency action plan this spring which will represent the start of a comprehensive and dedicated focus on energy efficiency in the public sector, where we want to achieve a one third reduction in energy use through efficiency gains, and the wider economy, where we want to achieve a 20% reduction.  We have already engaged in the process by changing building regulations.  A 40% improvement has been made to building regulations and we have committed to a 60% reduction within a short timeframe and will then move towards the objective of constructing all buildings to required housing standards within the timeframe of the EU project.</P>
        <P>We have led the way in Europe on light bulb regulations.  Many people have criticised the proposed changes but we have to take bold steps.  When we told the European Union about our plans, it responded that we were right and that it should review its own level of ambition in that area.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the publication today of the Finance Bill, which will include measures on tax breaks for businesses that invest in energy efficient equipment.  This represents a crucial way of helping companies to make economies, reduce fossil fuel bills and cut emissions.  The change we made to the motor tax system is a crucial first step in transport, which presents the biggest difficulties.  While reductions are already being made in agriculture and power generation, they are being lost by the increases in the transport sector.  The changes to motor taxation will affect the price of vehicles that are high in energy use but they are a crucial first step in a journey we will have to make in this area.</P><Col N="597"/>
        <P>We have to reduce our emissions from the current 70 million tonnes to 63 million tonnes by the end of the Kyoto period in 2012.  The new binding target, if it is agreed next year in Europe, will require further cuts to 56 million tonnes and if an international agreement is reached from Copenhagen we will be aiming for a target of 48 million tonnes.  To make these reductions, we will have to go beyond what anyone has yet contemplated.  We have no choice other than to start preparing and, rather than be dragged kicking and screaming into the process, we should embrace it as an opportunity to create jobs, become a technology leader and cut our fossil fuel bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has established a Cabinet subcommittee and an Oireachtas joint committee on climate change and energy security, recognising this is a long-term project and sending the message that regardless of the results of the next election, an investment decision on energy efficiency will bring returns in the next ten to 20 years.  These committees will have a crucial role in terms of exploring the options and opportunities of the new energy future.  The Government has also established a technical analysis group which will bring the best brains in the State system together to report to the Cabinet subcommittee on technical and economic modelling for each sector.  That analysis will feed into Government decision making on the project, which the Taoiseach correctly noted will present a significant challenge.  It will have to be at the centre of every aspect of our economic, social and environmental thinking.</P>
        <P>I welcome today&rsquo;s debate as part of the first stage in getting to grips with this complex emissions trading system.  It is not easy to comprehend the various targets and their different base years but a debate which allows us to develop a better understanding is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and appreciate the way he has engaged with the House and the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the issue.  Such an engagement is important in terms of reaching consensus.</P>
        <P>A high level of awareness now exists on the issue.  Our recent weather patterns have persuaded most people of the indisputable evidence on climate change.  The science is no longer in doubt and, with the exception of the columnist, Mr. Kevin Myers, there is now virtual unanimity on the issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A few days ago, the European Commission published highly ambitious and controversial climate change and renewable energy policies.  It has put forward a set of legislative proposals that are designed to cut aggregate EU emissions by 20% by 2020.  In effect, it is proposed to remove 600 million tonnes to 900 million tonnes of carbon emissions.  While Ireland must create 16% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, the com<Col N="598"/>parable figure is 3.1% at present.  Such targets are ambitious but the Commission was correct to set the bar high.  While Ireland should embrace them and make a serious attempt to reach them, I also agree with the Minister that we must negotiate, consider their implementation from our perspective and enter discussions with the Commission.  Naturally each member state will so do and different interests will arise.  However, we should accept the targets and make an ambitious effort to achieve them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report by Sir Nicholas Stern on the economics of climate change should be borne in mind.  It stated the cost of inaction would be equivalent to the cost to the world economy of the great depression of the 1930s, that is, as much as 10% of gross domestic product, GDP.  The cost of action over the period in question, however, is estimated to be approximately 1% of GDP.</P>
        <P>As for renewable energy, we must continue to encourage the development of wind energy in the form of wind farms.  Priority must be given to ensuring such wind farms will gain access to the grid.  In addition, it is important that the energy they create flows into the national grid.</P>
        <P>It is also important to consider the question of domestic wind turbines, which has been raised in the House by the Leas-Chathaoirleach a number of times.  I understand that one difficulty associated with domestic wind turbines is that their initial costs only can be recouped in the long term.  Given the long-term nature of our targets and ambitions, however, the Minister should closely consider the encouragement of domestic wind turbines and the degree to which, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach has often requested, grant aid or incentivisation could be employed to make them more widely used.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response to this issue with interest because I am unsure of the costing involved.  However, I understand it may take 15 years before viability is achieved or returns are generated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although wave energy research already is in place, it must be continued and accelerated with a greater degree of investment to achieve an effective return.  This form of energy may have great potential from a domestic perspective.  As for bio-fuels, it is important to preserve a balance and avoid doing anything that would increase the price of food excessively.  Therein lies a difficulty as one should not tolerate increases in direct consumer food prices or the linked issue of animal feed, etc. that arise from an over-reliance on bio-fuels.  Moreover, the Minister made the point earlier that complete consensus does not yet exist on whether bio-fuels always save on emissions and this issue must be examined.</P>
        <P>I believe a reconstruction of the railway system constitutes an opportunity that has not been grasped properly in Ireland.  The Minister referred previously to the important point that carbon emissions from our cars, lorries and transport system as a whole are highly significant contributors to Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions <Col N="599"/>levels.  Transport is at the centre of our difficulties and tackling this sector will be central to efforts to reduce our emissions and reach the target reductions of 20% by 2020.  In that context, the Government must consider the return of the railways.  At a minimum, a White Paper on the reintroduction of the railway system should be produced as it requires serious analysis.  I believe the physical presence of railways would encourage their use.</P>
        <P>While I will not digress, I recall the construction of a swimming pool in my home locality.  When seeking funding for the pool, I argued that although the population base was not very large, individuals would swim more frequently and cultural changes would increase use, etc.  Thankfully, this has proven to be the case.  The same principle applies to railways.  The presence of a railway would generate greatly increased usage of it and we can save on emissions in this manner.</P>
        <P>The use of railways would result also in the emergence of a culture of public transport usage and a consequential reduction in car usage.  We must try to encourage car sharing.  A culture has arisen in which no one any longer contemplates drinking and then driving home.  This now is an accepted norm.  Similarly, Members should encourage the development of a culture in which people share cars while going to work or use public transport.  A critical factor, however, is that public transport infrastructure must be in place first.  It is regrettable that this issue was not included in the Minister&rsquo;s statement because I believe it to be critical.  The renewal and recreation of Ireland&rsquo;s railway system will be highly important.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has stated that fossil fuel consumption must be reduced by as much as 200 million tonnes to 300 million tonnes per year.  Clearly this is important given the present price of oil and the question of energy security.  The increase in wind energy development, the exploration and development of wave energy, the creation of and experimentation with new energy forms, the introduction of railways and so on should be considered in the context of tackling climate change, which in itself would be a worthy objective.  They also should be considered as ways to ensure the security of our energy supply in future and to reduce our dependence on oil and other fossil fuels.  This will be important given the existing and projected cost of oil.</P>
        <P>The conservation of energy also is of major importance.  While we must create sources of renewable or alternative energy, the conservation of existing energy is of great importance.  In that context, I support the initiatives in the area of motor taxation.  However, the issue of insulation of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock also is critical.  Much of the housing stock that was built some time ago is in need of insulation.  This is true of both local authority and private houses and the Minister should examine this issue.  The Government has <Col N="600"/>failed to date to grapple with the issue by producing a national grants scheme to provide insulation.  Much can be done in this regard to conserve energy and energy conservation must constitute a twin strand of our strategy.  Further development of renewable energy resources should be encouraged through a combination of methods.  The conservation of energy, in so far as it is possible, should run parallel with the expansion of the development of renewable energy.  The insulation of houses is critical in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Martin Brady is present and will be very aware that water-powered flax and corn mills were once in operation in the Cavan-Monaghan region.  The mills harnessed the power of rivers.  A gentleman took me around to look at the many extant mills in the Monaghan area.  Water power could again be harnessed for the creation of electricity at local level and should be considered.  We must think outside the box.  If a resource exists in nature and is cheap and practical, why not use it?  In the same vein, we should consider wind turbines, insulation and every possible option.  To reach the ambitious targets we have set without dislocating national industries, it is critical that we consider the alternatives.  Renewable energy development will lead to job creation, particularly in high-tech industry, and to new economic opportunities.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge that awareness of climate change is heightening, it is important that we continue to generate awareness.  In addition to the actions we take, we must run an education and awareness programme, especially in respect of cars.  A cultural sea change is required.  Perhaps we all have contributed to generating the perception that one needs to drive vehicles the size of a Land Rover.  Doing so is perfectly understandable if one is engaged in agriculture or construction, for example, but it is incomprehensible why other individuals need such machines just to go to the local shop.  It defies analysis and is quite sad.  An education campaign should be launched and the reintroduction of a good public transport system would assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>We have lost the run of ourselves in this area.  Our dependence on cars should not be half as great as it is and there is no need for the large cars, jeeps and Land Rovers that we possess.  Our parents and grandparents progressed very well in society without having half of what we have.  While I am not being flat-earthist about the matter or advocating going back in time, I believe some of the trappings of modernity could well be cast aside.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I was quite interested to hear the Minister say people now accept global warming is an issue and that there is no debate about it.  However, I have heard that certain governments are theorising that the concept of global warming is being advocated so their countries will be prevented from developing.  I am not an expert on the matter but see enough to realise global warming is occurring and that it can only be ignored at our peril.  This has been brought home to me recently.</P>
        <P>The issue of global warming looms over every aspect of my political life at present.  While I was a Deputy, I was involved with a sub-committee of British-Irish Interparliamentary Body that took on the issues of energy generation and sustainable development.  The committee visited a farm owned by Mr. Gilliland on the outskirts of Derry, which farm I pass three times a week if not more frequently.  He has been growing willow for a considerable period and his farm is one of the main sources of the product.  The willow is fertilised with human effluent, which can either be injected into the soil or used in compost form.  The willow absorbs it and emits much friendlier gases into the atmosphere than would otherwise be emitted.  Within two to four years of being planted, the willow is harvested and converted into wood shavings or pellets and therefore its cultivation presents a win-win situation.</P>
        <P>In my area, dealing with sewage presents a considerable problem.  It is similar to the issue that arises in respect of chicken waste in Cavan.  People can complain that Big Brother Europe will very soon rap us on the knuckles if we do not deal with such issues.  I do not agree with being told what to do but believe that, where it is proper and when we should have acted faster, the European Union is correct to force us to be called to account.  Willow does not present the solution for processing all human waste but is an alternative to some of the more expensive options being used to deal with relatively small amounts of waste.</P>
        <P>The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body also visited wind farms just outside Donegal town.  Turbines are fascinating to see from afar but they are much more fascinating when studied closely.  This allows one to appreciate their scale and understand a little about how they generate energy.</P>
        <P>The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is only one body with which I have been involved with a view to addressing environmental matters.  This day last week I was at the plenary session of the Council of Europe which was addressing a sub-committee on sustainable development report on global warming and ecological disasters.  I joined the sub-committee in December.  The report was one of two discussed during the <Col N="602"/>plenary session.  The second concerned the destruction of the polar regions.  Most of us who do not have first-hand expertise in environmental issues gain a more thorough understanding when we see polar bears unable to climb up on the icecap because it is melting as quickly as they try to do so.</P>
        <P>The sub-committee&rsquo;s report on global warming and ecological disasters is available on the Council of Europe&rsquo;s website.  It offers far more information than I have time to extrapolate.  As a member of the sub-committee, I took part in a fascinating meeting in Paris where we had discussions with a delegation from China.  It is easier to point the finger at China for the problems it is causing and will cause in the future than to accept that, despite these difficulties, that country is making significant effort in some areas.  One of the Chinese delegates told us that some 500 billion hectares of forest have been planted in China.  Five members from five different countries asked the delegate&rsquo;s interpreter to confirm that figure.  The French member observed that the area forested represented a multiple of the size of France.</P>
        <P>It was startling to see that figure again in the report we produced.  Our recommendation No. 18 noted that the loss of natural forest around the world represents a threat to biodiversity and does more to increase the greenhouse effect each year than the transport sector.  I do not wish to contradict the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who observed that the transport sector is the greatest threat in terms of global warming.  However, I ask Members to note that the loss of natural forestry, according to our report, does more to increase the greenhouse effect on a yearly basis.</P>
        <P>There was a time when much of this State was forested.  Significant deforestation has occurred, however, to make way, in many cases, for housing development.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Wallace, to encourage forestry.  Some people are happy to be surrounded by trees while others feel inhibited by that.  It is important that we encourage the development of forestry in the context of climate change.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that we, as more developed nations, are often satisfied to wave the finger at developing states and put all the emphasis on what they must do, at the expense of accepting that we too have a vital role to play in arresting climate change.  We are often blind to our own faults as we concentrate vigorously on the shortcomings of others.  It is undoubtedly the case that various large developing countries face great challenges.  However, the already developed nations were central to creating the problems we all now face.  We must not abdicate our responsibility to ensure the resolution or minimisation of damage into the future.</P>
        <P>Debate about climate change is beginning to take place among ordinary citizens.  Where two or <Col N="603"/>three are gathered, the issue tends to arise at a level not seen before.  If we are blunt about it, those who professed concerns about the environment were very much a small minority at one point.  One need go back less than a decade to recall that people interested in the environment were categorised in a certain way.  Such categorisation is no longer relevant because the level of debate and interest has increased so much.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to observe the evolving debate on the potentially negative effects of bio-fuels, with the suggestion that not all corn ethanol or rapeseed biodiesel is necessarily produced in an environmentally friendly manner.  It seemed at one point that the future of farming would involve a diversification into everything bio.  This appeared to offer a great solution for anybody struggling in agriculture.  Unfortunately, no sooner does the solution emerge than the problems associated with that solution arise.</P>
        <P>It is important that we protect our food supply.  Nobody should become involved in the production of something merely because it is trendy or attracts significant supports.  We must avoid a situation where there is a rush to the energy sector at the complete expense of the food industry.  In that context, I welcome the EU ban on Brazilian beef.  Apart form other considerations, one wonders what its carbon footprint, or hoofprint, is by the time it gets to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The latest craze in adventure sports is quad biking.  A more environmentally friendly alternative may be available via our rivers and coasts.  The EU&rsquo;s quotas have made it less attractive for people to make their living on the water.  In my local community school, students in transition year are encouraged to take up a module on the marine.  The school management is aware that the children of former fishermen are unlikely to make their living on the sea and that their parents&rsquo; maritime skills may therefore be lost.  A community endeavour to establish a rowing club means that the local boat-building plant, McDonald&rsquo;s, has begun to produce rowing boats.  The River Foyle punts are back in the water.  &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; both broadcast reports on this recently.</P>
        <P>Quad biking is about the thrill of fast driving.  There is as much fun, albeit involving far more water, to be had with rowing and canoeing.  Water sports should be encouraged as an environmentally friendly sporting endeavour.  They have been neglected thus far because of confusion as to the respective remits of the Department of Transport and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, with each contending they are a matter for the other Department.  The development of marine recreation has fallen between the two stools and this must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland led the way in introducing the plastic bag levy.  At the plenary session of the Council of Europe last week, delegates from many countries asked us how we managed to introduce the plastic <Col N="604"/>bag tax, the smoking ban and now the stipulations regarding long-life light bulbs.  These are regarded as great initiatives in other jurisdictions.  That it was little Ireland which showed the way is significant from their perspective.  The levy consumers must pay to ensure washing machines, radios, televisions and so on are recycled by the shop is also important.  We should share our experience with others just as we look to other jurisdictions to see how matters operate there.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the apparent lapse of the scheme operated by some garages whereby older cars were scrapped and their owners given a cash payment.  That scheme should be reintroduced.  A great conversation point is the new environmental provision regarding vehicle taxation.  Many of those in the Visitors Gallery today may not yet have a car but they will be interested to know that, from now on, consumers will have to be far more environmentally aware when purchasing motor vehicles.  Likewise, the energy rating for houses will ensure that developers must be careful to build houses that are more environmentally friendly.</P>
        <P>We must examine the potential for the development of wind, wave and solar power.  Attempts are currently being made to lay a gas pipeline from Russia into Europe.  However, some of the countries involved in burying chemical weapons after the Second World War will not reveal the locations of those weapons.  Therefore, laying a gas pipeline may threaten the stability of several countries.  If we believe that natural gas is a better option than other fuels, then we should be imploring Britain, America and Germany to come clean on where those munitions are buried.</P>
        <P>We must make new public buildings eco-friendly.  We must use as many environmentally friendly options as we can, because we are supposed to be leading the way.  We cannot point our finger at other countries, because we must look at ourselves.  As parliamentarians, we cannot look to other people and tell them what to do.  We must act.  Minister Timmerman said last week that what we say at the Council of Europe, we must say in our own countries.  To paraphrase an American saying, &ldquo;Do not ask what your world can do for you, but what you can do for your world&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have much respect for the Senator, but when I hear her praise the Chinese for anything I want to spend at least 40 minutes explaining why we should ignore them, no matter how many trees they are planting.  Ireland and the rest of western Europe is sending shiploads of waste to China every day.  There are cities in China of which we have never heard, such as the city of Dongyang, where that waste is being burned.  We are asphyxiating, suffocating and killing ordinary Chinese people against their will, and the Chinese Government does not allow <Col N="605"/>people to give information about it on the Internet.</P>
        <P>Channel 4 recently broadcast a programme on the huge dam being built by the Chinese Government on the Yangtze River, the Three Gorges Dam.  People were literally shoved out of their houses and told if they did not move, they would be flooded.  I will use every opportunity I can this year, during the celebration of the Olympic Games, to point out the repressive Government that exists in China.  The western world should be ashamed of what is being done there.  One new coal station is being opened every six days in China.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the advisers to bring some of the points I am making to the attention of the Minister.  I believe there is an agenda running on the EirGrid issue.  The Minister of State comes from the west of Ireland.  A famous writer from the west of Ireland, John Healy, published a book entitled Nobody Cried Stop.  I believe we are walking head first into major difficulties with electricity and electricity security.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are three aspects to electricity in the country.  Everybody has been talking about electricity generation since we set up the facility at Ardnacrusha near the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency in 1929.  The national grid brings electricity from there to local transformers around the country.  The electricity network brings it from the transformers into houses.  According to the programme for Government, we are now about to package up the national grid into one neat company and run it separately from the rest.  That is the biggest mistake.  Of all the people who could come in here, nobody knows more about packaging parts of a public utility than the Minister of State.  He even had to walk away from his party Whip on a similar issue on one occasion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The only parts of the whole system that we need to examine are the grid and the network.  It does not matter where the generation comes from.  Once we put down international interconnectors, we can buy and sell the stuff from Europe.  The most powerful electricity company in Europe is probably Electricit&eacute; de France.  That company has built the two main power lines connecting eastern Europe with France.  It is buying and selling electricity every day of the weak.  It is also the greatest generator of electricity given that 80% of French electricity is based on nuclear power.  Electricit&eacute; de France is also buying up every single utility company that comes on the market in the UK or anywhere in Europe.  It is growing every day and its strength is based on the following simple fact.  It is a vertically integrated utility company.  It runs everything, from generation to grid to network.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When debating the issue of Internet access ten years ago, I said that I did not believe that any private company would ever be interested in bringing a copper wire to Belmullet.  Time has shown that to be true.  I believe this is exactly the same.  I want to give an example of where I have <Col N="606"/>seen this working, although I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, does not accept my point.  I do not for one moment query his commitment on these issues and I welcome the boldness of the initiatives he has taken, especially the initiatives on light bulbs and so on.  It is not a Minister&rsquo;s job to worry about the problems of implementation.  Donagh O&rsquo;Malley taught us 40 years ago that a Minister says what he wants and lets the officials deliver.  The biggest mistake a Minister can make is to share the problems of the officials.  Officials are there to deal with the problems and Ministers are there to have the policy implemented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A grid is being set up which is now being packaged.  I want to put on the record that I believe the national grid will be privatised in five years&rsquo; time.  Therefore, we might own the generation capacity and the network which brings it to Mrs. Murphy&rsquo;s door, but we will not own the national grid which brings it as far as the local network.  This happened before in New Zealand, a country with exactly the same population as Ireland, with the same rural background and the same history as a former British colony.  The Government there broke up the utility company into several different companies and it broke up the network.  As soon as the grid was sold off in New Zealand, there were immediate problems.  Who was going to pay to connect the grid to the network?  The first place in which they encountered difficulty was in Wellington, the capital city, which was left without power for three full weeks while the company which owned the grid held the Government to ransom to pay for the connection from the grid to the local network.  That is already happening in this country.  Private providers charge exorbitant rates at peak usage times to the Government in order to provide the surplus we need.  A few years ago we had to buy in portable generators and that is what happened.</P>
        <P>I believe we are doing now with EirGrid what we did with airports and with Aer Lingus.  We are packaging it all up.  We have seen that this has gone wrong everywhere.  It happened in the UK when water provision was sold off.  The Government realised it then had to spend &euro;1 billion on pipes.  It happened again in the UK when the railways were sold and investment in tracks was forgotten.  It is the same here now as we are selling off the national grid.  The national grid needs about &euro;2 billion in investment.  Either the Government pays the money and it will be a prosperous company later sold off to the greedy private sector, or the Government could do what it did with Aer Lingus.  It could state that it has not got the &euro;2 billion to invest in the company, will blame Europe for not being able to invest in it and state that it must get the private sector in to do it.  I believe that will happen.  While I do not believe that is on the agenda of the current Government, and certainly not on the agenda of the Green Party, it will happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to keep a vertically integrated utility where the State owns the generation capacity, the <Col N="607"/>national grid and the network.  If we do not control all three, we are dead.  If we want to sell off one of those, the generation capacity is the least important.  We might have a lot of trouble convincing people of that, but it is the reality.<?oasys _jy ?>We had to reopen the turf burning station in<?oasys _jy ?>Cahirciveen two years ago and another station near Belmullet, simply in order to raise capacity.  We could not cope without it.  This is what will happen if we do not own it anymore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is happening with Electricit&eacute; de France?  It is investigating nuclear fusion.  It has also won the global pitching initiative.  It is the only concern investigating nuclear fusion.  There has been no debate in this country.  The Minister is quite right in saying that we need a debate on nuclear energy.  I am opposed to nuclear based electricity, but there should be a debate on it.  In such a debate the distinction must be made between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission.  Nuclear fusion has certain attractions and at least is controllable.  It has between one tenth and half of the risks associated with nuclear energy, but it is not happening.  The other issue, in terms of energy security, is the amount being spent on research.  In the UK at present major research is taking place into hydrogen based power, but that is not happening here.  Our brains can match those of any nation state in the world.  This is a knowledge society and that is what is needed to move on this.</P>
        <P>To have energy security we need to have storage capacity.  How do we store electricity?  If we create 100% electricity at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning when people are getting up and it is needed at six in the evening when people are cooking, how do we get the balance right, and where do we hold the electricity?  The only place I know where it is done at the moment is at Turlough Hill, where we pump it up and let it come down.  However, we can only store a tiny percentage of what we need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have put this question previously to the Department and was told the interconnector would do it.  In other words, it is sold into the grid.  The grid we are selling it back to is in the UK, which has precisely the same type of peaks and troughs as Ireland.  That is not the answer, but there are ways for storing electricity, although I am not an expert in this area.  If we take hydrogen based electricity, the substance in most supply on this earth is water, H<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>O, hydrogen and oxygen.  One of the difficulties is that it is not effective and efficient to remove hydrogen from water and then use it for power.  It takes almost as much energy to subtract the hydrogen as one will get from burning it.  That is precisely why it appears an extraordinarily good way to have storage.  If we use our spare capacity to extract hydrogen from water and then use this for power when it is needed, it is the cleanest energy on earth.  The waste produced by the burning or usage of hydrogen is clean drinkable potable water.  There <Col N="608"/>is no better way of approaching it and we should do it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister suggested recently that perhaps the energy might be stored in batteries.  Battery technology is nowhere near as efficient.  I told him at the time that a battery the size of Mount Leinster would be needed to look after Dublin alone.  It cannot be done.  There are enormous issues here on which there has been no debate and we do not know where we are going.  Within a couple of years, not only will the grid be sold off &mdash; although that is not intended at the moment &mdash; it will probably be owned by Electricit&eacute; de France, or whatever.  This means that in five or six years time the switch will be in Paris to control our lights, electricity and energy.  I have nothing against the French, but in terms of energy security, that is precisely where we are going.  Energy security is not just about creating sufficient power and holding enough of it on the island or within the State, but about controlling it and using it precisely as we need it.  That is the difficulty we face and there is no sign of a solution to the problem.</P>
        <P>Fair play to the Green Party, which has pushed the Government via VRT and in the new Finance Bill today, apparently, into giving tax breaks for energy efficient projects.  In simple terms, however, what Ireland is doing with waste is in breach of European regulations.  Waste is supposed to be disposed of as closely as possible to the point at which it has been created.  We are disposing of enormous amounts of waste in China.  That cannot be right.  It is not right.  I do not know whether any colleague here has ever tried to track a piece of waste.  I tried to do it two years ago, and again last year, to see where it gets to from the doorstep, into various distribution channels, and how it is checked as regards where it ends up.  The figures are all over the place.  If they were to be audited, half the people involved would be sacked because it is not possible to track them.  They are mixed and matched in three or four different places among various companies throughout Ireland.  They are then sent for redistribution to another place.  Nobody knows what percentage finishes up in China.</P>
        <P>Another issue raised by the two previous speakers was the question of chicken waste and human waste.  Both of these produce methane, which is between 20 and 25 times more damaging than carbon.  In other words, a tonne of methane equates to 25 tonnes of carbon.  The great thing about methane, however, is that it is a power source.  Effectively, we should put a tent over every landfill and chicken farm in Ireland.  That would save the atmosphere from emissions and also harness a power source.  These are issues we need to look at with some degree of enthusiasm and energy.  The way we are moving at the moment, in creating a separate company, EirGrid, in the midst of an electricity utility is inexplicable.  I do not know why we are doing this.  I have asked questions and got all types of answers to the effect that &ldquo;we must ensure they <Col N="609"/>buy from the right people&rdquo;.  We do that all over the place.  People are forced to buy, either by proper tender or by regulation etc.  I see nothing wrong with the ESB continuing to own the grid system and running it properly in its own interest.  Neither will I condone Europe taking the blame for this, by the way.  All I suggest may be done well within the parameters laid down by Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have just touched on some of the issues I wanted to raise.  On a final point, over the past 18 to 20 years we have made the ESB leaner and leaner.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tony <?oasys _dc18- ?>Killeen, will have seen that as regards Moneypoint<?oasys _dc0- ?> in his constituency.  From having had about 14,000 employees, the ESB now has approximately 7,000 on its payroll.  We have closed between 13 and 15 power stations and made the company a superb example of national industry.  This was achieved on the basis that it would be a vertically integrated national utility.  I want us to maintain and control that and be in charge of our future and security.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is opportune to have this debate so soon after the Seanad addressed the issue.  In the interim there have been several important international events that require comment to put in context the international debate on climate change.  The first was the United Nations conference in Bali, which excited a good deal of media attention, not all favourable.  The Irish contribution to that was quite forthright and positive, in a conference that ultimately generated more hope than success.  Even that is removed from what, today, we must accept as the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, which has turned out to be an exercise of running to just stand still.  Much of that was because the governments of certain nation states operated to ignore and frustrate the will of the rest of the international community, as regards identifying the scale of the problem of climate change and then refusing to make a proportional contribution towards alleviating its consequences.  The chief government involved was that of the United States, a country with 5% of the world&rsquo;s population, 5% of the earth&rsquo;s landmass, which consumes 25% of all energy resources.  That may alter because of political changes occurring in the United States in an election year, but at least Bali brought about some type of admission from the American delegation.  It means that we will be adhering to a roadmap that, hopefully, will allow for decisions in Copenhagen about a more successful replacement for Kyoto.  That is the best we can hope for in the immediate international political climate.</P>
        <P>The United States was not operating on its own, however.  A number of countries, while not being as belligerent as America in denying climate change, nonetheless were on a par in ensuring that international action did not occur.  It is interesting to see what has happened in many of those countries.  Australia was the US&rsquo;s largest ally in much of this debate.  It has now had a <Col N="610"/>change of government, where the policy has been altered.  There is now a Labour Government in Australia, which has gained office through the help of a significant increase in the Green Party vote there.  The Green Party presence in the Australian Senate is now two and a half times what it was.  Countries such as Japan have finally committed to targets, as the European Commission has suggested for 2020.</P>
        <P>We are coming to the end of the process and internationally, the Administration in power in the United States is becoming isolated.  It is also fair to state the debate within the United States has challenged the orthodoxy of the US Government&rsquo;s position.  At state and municipal levels action is being taken on climate change policies in defiance of the policy advocated by the US Government.  I am optimistic that when a change of administration occurs, even if another Republican president takes office, the process will continue and increase in speed.</P>
        <P>The second international change which occurred in the interim is that the European Commission has made proposals on how the European Union collectively, and individual European Union member states can address the idea of carbon reductions in the period up to 2020.  This was the focus of the Minister&rsquo;s speech today.  Within the EU, Ireland was treated very generously under the Kyoto Protocol.  We were allocated a 13% increase above 1990 levels, which we have exceeded by almost twice the amount.  In view of this and the economic wealth we attained we will now be asked by the European Commission to initiate large cuts in carbon usage.  This will have an economic effect.  Fortunately, it seems to be in line with the commitment which exists in the programme for Government that a 3% cut will be achieved on average in the lifetime of the Government.  It is hoped succeeding Governments will continue this.</P>
        <P>In previous debates in this Chamber we recognised that this should be not a Government versus Opposition issue but one on which all political parties sing from the same hymn sheet.  We will have a period of adjustment prior to achieving this stage of political maturity.  This Government, which has Green Party participation, has only been in office since June of last year.  Several small-scale initiatives have been put in place with regard to tackling the overall problems in this area.  However, the reaction these small and modest measures have provoked has not reflected well on the nature of politics or the practice of opposition as usual politics.</P>
        <P>This is the case in particular with regard to the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with CFL and LED lighting by 1 January 2009.  This proposal was made in the first instance to allow a lead-in period to establish whether it could be done directly and whether problems had to be overcome in terms of consumers and the industry.  However, the reaction we saw in certain political circles involved spurious arguments about the <Col N="611"/>health and safety aspects of goods which were already checked and approved for use in households.</P>
        <P>Other arguments about losing heat through the replacement of incandescent light bulbs take the nature of the debate we need to have into the realm of the surreal.  It does not reflect well on the people making these arguments, and they will face political consequences.  I hope now that they have been made the debate can move on to another context.  The arguments heard in political circles have been reported in certain media organs.</P>
        <P>The interpretation of particular reports or the publication of reports themselves have not been helpful in allowing us to understand the scale of the problem we must face.  In its most recent quarterly economic commentary, the ESRI had as an addendum a small report on the possible economic effects of climate change and the policies put in place.  It was a dishonest document because its basic thrust was what the cost would be if only one particular action were taken.  We saw it repeated on the front pages of certain newspapers, which printed that if we put all the cost onto an electricity bill it would cost households &euro;440.  No one is making the argument that we should only do one thing.  Government policy is a mixum-gatherum of a range of policy approaches.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated in his speech, these involve defining whether energy use is necessary in all circumstances and seeing where it can be made more efficient.  It involves examining whether the buildings we operate can be brought up to speed to achieve maximum efficiency and not only with regard to the production of energy and its ultimate use.  It also involves an entire series of measures to reduce dependence on fossil fuel energy by promoting renewable energy sources.</P>
        <P>During recent months, a number of measures have been introduced which reflect all of these policy areas, including incentives, carrots and small sticks.  Part of this process will see the publication today of a Finance Bill, the second part of a budget package which will contain additional measures.  These will show not only the impact of the Green Party in Government but also the need for many of these incentives to be put in place as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The other aspect of media coverage I wish to discuss is with regard to one media organ.  I am slow to refer to it because as a publication it is very much a comic and should not be referred to as a national newspaper.  It is the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>.  Recently, it published the story about &euro;440 being added to the cost of an electricity bill.  The same newspaper is not averse to taking on the fashionable aspects of environmentalism.  Two days after publishing that front-page story, a banner was on the front page advertising a give-away.  Normally, such giveaways involve a film DVD or a music <Col N="612"/>CD.  However, on this occasion readers of the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i> were offered two free CFL light bulbs, which the newspaper had regularly castigated during the previous month as being unsafe, unsound and a contributor to the ruination of humanity.</P>
        <P>It is important that not only this debate but the ongoing debate we have in the country is properly informed.  Mischievousness and politics for the sake of politics is not the order of the day.  It is too important an issue to be debated in this manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House, fresh from providing the Taoiseach with a dig-out from his recent trials and tribulations.</P>
        <P>A number of people in the country probably still believe that climate change is one of these passing fads.  The rest of us know the earth is not flat and that the impact of climate change is upon us.  Summers are getting hotter and the past decade has seen some extremely hot summers.  The summer of 2003 was reputed to be the hottest summer in 500 years during which 13,000 people died in France.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am particularly concerned about our coasts, along which one quarter of our population lives and a major amount of infrastructure is located.  With the impact of climate change we can expect to see increased sea levels and I am concerned about the coastal erosion which will be a consequence of this.  I live on the Louth-Meath coast which is referred to as the &ldquo;gold coast&rdquo;.  I regularly receive phone calls from people who are concerned about the impact of the latest sea storm on the coast.  I wrote to several Ministers about this and it is clear that we do not have a strategy to deal with coastal erosion or rising sea levels.  Bearing in mind many of our major towns and cities, such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick, are either on the coast or close to the coast, it is about time the Government put in place a strategy for dealing with rising sea levels and coastal erosion.  I add my voice to those of the Senators who called for greater reliance on renewable energy sources.  While I do not propose to regurgitate the arguments in favour of renewable energy, I note that a recent study showed that by 2020, Ireland could produce 42% of its energy requirements by investing in these energies.  We must invest in new technologies such as wave, tidal and hydroelectric energies and generate the maximum possible proportion of electricity needs through renewable sources.  With investment, Ireland could become a flagship for Europe in this area.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>It is in the national interest that we wake up to the impact of climate change on energy and food security.  Many Senators will recall the fuel shortages caused by the oil crises in the early 1970s as queues of motorists lined up outside filling stations to obtain petrol.  I refer those who do not remember those times to the electricity cuts <Col N="613"/>being imposed in South Africa as a result of the failure of the authorities to act when economists predicted a decade ago that economic and population growth would necessitate the construction of new power stations.  As a result, the country is experiencing energy shortages which are impacting on the economy and the health of the nation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must be clear about the link between energy and food security.  Much of our food production relies on fossil fuels.  Whether through tractors harvesting crops or in terms of the electricity required in the production and delivery stages, energy security is vital for food production.  If Senators cast their minds back to the early 1990s, they will recall the impact on Cuba of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, one of the country&rsquo;s main suppliers of fuel.  Overnight, the USSR switched off its energy supplies to the island with disastrous consequences for the economy, including food production.  Without the spirit of solidarity and community in Cuba, the consequences could have been much worse.  Within a few years of the Soviet decision, 1 million small family allotments in the Havana region and many parts of school playgrounds were being used for the production of vegetables.  As a result the Cuban people overcame the problem and, thankfully, tremendous hardship did not ensue.</P>
        <P>What would we do if energy insecurity impacted on our food production?  Senators may have heard the president of the Irish Farmers Association, Padraig Walshe, state on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today that food security is a growing issue.  Given that we have reached peak oil production, it is vital that the Government implements a strategy for dealing with energy and food security.</P>
        <P>Climate change clearly is upon us and, where possible, the Government must take immediate steps to mitigate its impact.  It must implement a strategy for the protection of our coast, focus on renewable energy supplies and design a strategy to ensure the security of our energy and food supplies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Minister for my absence during his contribution.  I heard the IFA president&rsquo;s remarks on radio this morning.  The problem of food security, to which he referred, gives pause for thought.  As Senators will agree, energy security and climate change are the major political issues of our times.  Having attended the negotiations on climate change in Bali, I have come to realise that climate change is a cross-sectoral issue.  I study how it is being addressed in an international context and appreciate the breadth of its scope.</P>
        <P>I was glad to see such a strong Irish contingent from the non-governmental and governmental sector travel to the Bali conference to listen, learn from, partake in and inform the debate because climate change is a considerable challenge. <Col N="614"/> Through the conference I have come to appreciate the international context within which these issues are being addressed.  We must learn from international developments.  Ireland and many other parts of the world are only beginning to wake up to the critical importance of climate change.</P>
        <P>We must climate proof all policies, particularly in local government and planning.  I heard it argued that the decision by Dublin City Council to institute a high-rise policy would destroy the city.  The question we must ask is whether the approach to development in Dublin in recent years was appropriate.  It has created an urban core surrounded by a greater metropolitan area which adds significantly to our transport emissions.  The development of areas such as Clondalkin, Lucan and many towns on the periphery of the city extending into counties Kildare, Louth and Meath has created an urban sprawl.</P>
        <P>While everybody wants to live in a house with a front and back garden, forward planning dictates that we reconsider the low-rise approach to development in all our cities and urban areas.  Given the figures on CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for Ireland, specifically the increase of 160% in emissions in the transport sector since 1990, and the trajectory remains upwards, it is clear that reversing current trends presents a major challenge.  Rather than tinkering at the edges and focusing on bio-fuels, vehicle registration tax and other issues, important as they are, we must concentrate on fundamental questions.  Development must not take place in a manner which forces people to use cars to travel to work.  We need a complete change in attitude in this respect.</P>
        <P>The substantial decrease in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions required of us will demand changes in our lifestyles and it will be difficult for people to come to terms with the changes required.  Cities in other countries have already taken action.  Given that few residents of cities such as Paris and London have cars, why should people living in Dublin have cars?  It may be understandable to have a car given the sprawl around the city, the absence of a good, integrated transport system and the flexibility offered by a car but why on earth do households have two or even three vehicles?  This trend is utter madness and it is not sustainable, as is clear when one tries to park outside one&rsquo;s home or in the city centre.</P>
        <P>Parking is restricted in Sandycove where I live on the periphery of Dublin.  While residents objected at the time the restrictions were introduced, this policy is an example of proper planning.  We must regulate the way people use their cars.  With the support of the local authority, a new car rental scheme has been introduced in the council area of Islington in London.  As there is no parking space for people who own private cars the council has responded to the problem where cars are needed to move people or furniture. <Col N="615"/> Given the way we live it is not plausible to have a no-car city.  The council has responded to the need by supplementing car rental.  It is a good scheme that is worth looking at.  I am not sure if the Minister is familiar with it.  The cost is not prohibitive.  One can pick up and return the car easily.  It is all about stopping people feeling they need to own a car.  That is what we need to do.  How many of us have cars that often sit idle for ten days at a time or are used infrequently?  We need to think about such issues and such responses.</P>
        <P>I am adamant that public transport does not need to be delivered by the public transport bodies.  We need to have an open attitude to licensing.  It is all about the use of buses and bringing additional services to the public.  One hears all too often that it is Dublin Bus that should get the buses.  I do not necessarily agree with that sentiment.  We need to licence people to provide services.  Some private operators provide a terrific service to the airport.  Every time one is out and about on the roads one sees it.   Recently I saw the Swords Express which takes people very quickly from Swords to Dublin.  It is wonderful to see all these private operators and I would like to see more of them.  We do not need to be dependent on one company.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security heard an excellent contribution from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and, in particular, on the agriculture sector.  It is a big problem and one we have not touched.  We heard of research that is being done, and we are going to find out more about it, into grasses and encouraging farmers to move from cattle into the growing of grasses that will reduce emissions in the agriculture sector where rates of emission are at an alarming level.  It is the one area where Ireland can make a huge impact fairly quickly.</P>
        <P>Farmers are reluctant, as are most people, to change practices in the absence of security and knowing this will be maintained.  Apparently the rural environment protection, REP, scheme has been reviewed but it has not taken account of climate change.  As the Minister will have heard at a meeting we attended during the week about hedgerows and such issues, it strikes me that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has not been central to our planning and thinking about how we can, in an inclusive and joined-up way, tackle climate change and reduce our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>  emissions.  I would like to see that being brought in.</P>
        <P>If the REP scheme has been reviewed and climate change has not been part of its criteria we need to open it again if that is possible because everything needs to be climate change proofed if we are serious about the issue.  In regard to our target of 3%, we are proceeding in the right way <Col N="616"/>and I am confident the Minister will bring us along the path easily.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an interesting debate.  The whole concept of climate change and the broader debate on energy security has taken off over the past 12 months to two years.  Virtually every citizen in the country has some knowledge of the climate change issue and everybody expresses great concern and hope that the Government at domestic level and internationally and the UN and other groups can make progress.  However, that is easier said than done.  From an international perspective, if one looks at what is happening in the US with the presidential election campaign, which is very engaging, climate change or energy security is not high on the agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is right on top.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect to the Minister that is not the case if one looks at the recent primary elections and studies the post voting reasons as to why people voted for particular candidates.  I wish they had indicated that environment issues were higher up on the agenda.  As they have not done so I can only go on the data that is available.  I concede that in the Australian election some weeks ago it did appear that the offer of the Australian Labor Party to make progress in environmental issues did make a difference.  I welcome that.</P>
        <P>If one looks at great world problems such as poverty and, indeed, peace and war and nuclear deterrents over the years, there has always been great commitments of the apple pie and motherhood variety but the progress afterwards has not been as much as we would expect.  A great deal of pressure will need to be applied by governments such as the Irish Government to ensure the international community can respond.  We have to be realistic and acknowledge that in the broader sense our efforts domestically will be a drop in the ocean but we must still try to do the best we can.  The problem is global, it is international and the solution will have to come from there.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s initiative on what is being done locally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney said earlier that today&rsquo;s solution suddenly becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s problem.  We were all enthusiastic some time ago in regard to the issue of bio-fuel, yet when one looks at the other side of that equation one sees the threat caused to world food supplies by a sudden overnight conversion of food crops to energy.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred Irish agriculture from a broader perspective.  A fact we have to be deeply concerned about is that during the past five years <Col N="617"/>the world has consumed significantly more food than it has produced.  It is not rocket science to know that equation cannot continue.  There will not be a sudden move away from meat protein and meat production to an entirely vegetarian diet.  The issue of food security, whether we like it, has to be part of the solution.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis in world food production at present and there is no point in denying it.  That causes its own problem when trying to deal with climate change and energy security.  There is no point in having a perfect environment and a perfect world in which people can live if we cannot produce enough food to feed the world&rsquo;s population.  There will always be the question of balance.</P>
        <P>At home we have to look to the local authorities to become part of the solution.  I am not sure how many local authorities have energy departments and energy officers.  We have a fine energy office in Cork County Council, particularly in north Cork, with a dedicated energy department.  Many people seeking planning permission go into the energy office and assess the various energy saving schemes and devices and can purchase them through the county council.  That is helpful.  It should be mandatory that every local authority would have an energy department or an energy officer who would liaise with people at an industrial and domestic level and help make the small changes that can help make the big difference.</P>
        <P>The light bulb issue has been mentioned by a few speakers.  It is a budget initiative and a good one in many ways.  I am advised by some of my colleagues, including Senator John Paul Phelan who does not have the opportunity to speak, that from the point of view of certain uses of lighting the Minister&rsquo;s proposals would not save energy but may well be negative in its impact.  In rooms where lights are lit infrequently, such as bathroom and toilet, the low energy bulbs, apparently, are not helpful and would use more energy than the normal bulb.  All of these things have positives and negatives that we will have to examine.  I look forward to the publication of the Finance Bill this afternoon to see if it provides for further incentives.  We have made very disappointing progress with regard to wave power, wind farms and so on.  Much greater tax reliefs and incentives will be necessary.</P>
        <P>This debate must continue in the House and elsewhere.  We must be realistic because while what we in Ireland can do is not huge in the global scheme, we must make a start.  I wish the Minister well and hope we progress this very important issue as best we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  In my contribution, I want to focus on the role of carbon tax and outline a personal view on its use in Ireland.  I am strongly of <Col N="618"/>the view that if one wishes to intervene on an issue such as this, there are two different ways to do it.  One is through direct involvement in the different sectors that will be affected and the other is through assessing what we can do with regard to taxation.  If we are as serious as we claim about tackling this issue, we will have to find some way to introduce a carbon tax to deal with the behaviour of individuals in regard to it.  From my preparation for this contribution, I know a number of other countries in Europe, such as Sweden, Norway and Finland, already have introduced a carbon tax.  They have done this in such a way that it does not undermine their competitiveness but makes a difference to their carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>To move on to the question of what kind of carbon tax we might have in Ireland and how it would work, the greatest arguments against a carbon tax are that it will undermine the competitiveness of the economy and increase the tax burden on individuals, which for many reasons we are reluctant to consider.  The point in the terms of reference of the proposed tax commission is important in this regard, namely, that any carbon tax must be revenue neutral.  If we are looking to introduce such a tax, we should also ascertain what change we can make to employer&rsquo;s PRSI to offset any impact on business competitiveness, and to VAT to offset the effect of such a tax on citizens, particularly low income earners.</P>
        <P>The only way we will influence the behaviour of individuals is if we engage at the price at which these different forms of energy are available.  If particular fossil fuels are priced low in comparison with the alternatives, people will use more of them while they remain cheap.  As this use continues, carbon emissions will increase, creating more difficulty with regard to climate change.  Carbon taxing will play a role in ensuring we introduce a solution to the issues we face that not only will work but will be permanent and will have an impact on the individual behaviour of our citizens.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by considering the role of politics in all this.  We must do two things.  First, we must provide certainty and clarity in terms of how businesses, organisations and individuals plan their behaviour.  If we are telling them what the taxation system will be like in the future and that it will include a degree of carbon taxing, this will allow businesses and individuals to change their behaviour in the way needed.  Second, if politics is about anything, it is about having a duty of care and ensuring we leave what we have and what we are responsible for in a better condition than when we inherited it.  As such, I believe a measure must be introduced to price carbon in a way that ensures people adjust their behaviour, but this must be done in a way that does not increase the tax burden or undermine our business competitiveness.  Revenue raised from <Col N="619"/>carbon taxing should go towards reductions in VAT and employer&rsquo;s PRSI, which is the way we should move forward on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to conclude this very useful debate.  At a debate some days ago I made the point that there had hardly been a frost all year, but my wife pointed out that night that it was freezing.  Looking out the windows of the House during this debate, I saw a few flakes of snow falling, so one must be careful when speaking on this issue.</P>
        <P>I want to return to one other point I made in that recent debate, namely, that we as a country have performed well when we responded to strategic threats or problems.  When we achieve political consensus around the direction we want to take, we work well. I cited the example of the 1950s when we moved from being a closed economy to an open economy.  A person e-mailed me later to agree with that point and to state we made a similar strategic change in the late 1980s when we moved from being a basket-case economy to the Celtic tiger economy.  The person made the point that while this was true, the circumstances were different from today because there was a clear social and economic catastrophe which compelled us to action in each instance.  Climate change is a difficult issue because while the consequences are potentially much more catastrophic, they are not with us today.  It is snowing today while we are talking about climate change.</P>
        <P>As Senator Donohoe noted, how we represent the public good and respond to the threat before that threat is widely known are crucial questions.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley pointed out that this will affect the policy decisions we must make in the next year to two years because of European Union proposals which I cited earlier.  Those policy decisions will primarily be around the issues of energy use, food production, transport, planning and the taxation measures to which Senator Donohoe referred.</P>
        <P>Although there are myriad different areas where the Government is taking action, I will refer first to the area of electricity generation, in particular with regard to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s concerns on the possibility of the privatisation of the transmission grid, an issue we raised in committee today.  I do not know of any party in the Houses which is in favour of the privatisation of the transmission grid and do not believe any individual Senator or Deputy is in favour.  If so, I would love to hear them say it.  In fact, not a single economic commentator I know is calling for this.  I do not see it as an issue because no-one is considering privatising transmission assets.</P>
        <P>The grid is a difficult and sensitive issue in certain parts of the country.  To achieve our renew<Col N="620"/>able electricity targets and bring in low carbon technology, we will need to develop a grid that supplies and supports this, which will be difficult and will require us to see the benefits down the line when there will be different consequences.</P>
        <P>Members referred to food security and the agricultural implications.  There is a connection between food security and energy security.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, informed me recently of the fascinating statistic that it takes 10 calories of energy to produce 1 calorie of food.  Our food is dependent on the availability of cheap oil for fertilisers, pesticides and the transport systems engaged in production.  Reducing our use of oil is as important for our food industry as for our climate change interests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Transport is also a key issue.  I echo Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s comments and ask whether what we are doing is working and whether even it is attractive to us.  To my mind, it is not.  There is the potential for a much better system using different planning and following a different model.  This requires change but it will not be easy because some will say they do not like the change required.  It is a question of whether as politicians we have the ability to show a lead to our people by providing that change.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Donohoe on his comments on the area of taxation, which is one aspect of the issue, although not the only one, as noted by Senator Boyle.  I listened with interest to Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s arguments, as a Fine Gael Senator, about the possibility of the introduction of a carbon tax.  These issues will be centre-stage during the next year.  We have a year within which to translate the proposals &mdash; for a general 20% European target, which is a 16% target here, to reduce climate change emissions &mdash; into real change in each of the crucial areas of transport, agriculture, planning and energy generation.  It will not be easy to do so but it is in our interests to take on the proposals in a bold and ambitious manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment to highlight the opportunities presented to Ireland by the 2012 Olympic Games in London, which is only a short distance away.  There is a major potential to be <Col N="621"/>derived from the Olympics in that various teams will wish to train in a climate similar to that of London prior to the games, particularly in the 18 months leading up to 2012.  The London Olympics will be held from 27 July to 12 August 2012, with the subsequent Paralympic Games being held there from 29 August to 9 September 2012.  That is just over 1,640 days hence.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the work being done by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in this respect through the task force established by the previous Minister, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, a more urgent approach is required in working with local authorities to earmark suitable facilities.  My local authority in Donegal has taken the initiative to compile a comprehensive list of all such facilities available in the county.  In conjunction with the local sports partnership, the council is promoting Donegal venues internationally via national Olympic committees and Paralympic committees.  There are approximately 400 such committees worldwide and it is important for us to approach them with a view to attracting Olympic teams here.  It might be difficult to attract major teams such as those from the United States but Ireland has the potential to attract teams from developing nations.</P>
        <P>What efforts are being made in this respect by the task force?  When can we expect the findings of the task force and its recommendations to be made available?  Is the task force looking at one or two centres of population, or is it open to suggestions from all parts of the country?  Would it be in the interests of the task force to work with local authorities and, if so, what kind of assistance will be provided by the Department to local authorities who wish to bid for teams to stay in their own regions prior to the 2012 Olympics?</P>
        <P>A major sporting, cultural and economic dividend could be gained from such initiatives.  We may have to raise facilities up to a certain standard but the investment aimed at attracting Olympic teams here would provide long-term benefits both nationally and for local communities also.  We should grasp this opportunity with both hands.</P>
        <P>Having spoken to the Irish Olympic team manager, Patsy McGonagle, who will be leading the Irish charge in Beijing this year, it is critically important to make such bids and liaise with national Olympic bodies as quickly as possible, otherwise the opportunity may be lost.  I urge the Minister of State to raise this matter with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan.  An excellent task force has been established but it is important for us to be aware of where it is going and when we can expect to see some results.</P>

I am grateful for the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the work being carried out by the London 2012 Olympics task force.</P>
        <P>The choice of London as host for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games is probably the closest Ireland will ever come to hosting those games.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Our similar climate, proximity and good transport links, common language and strong business and tourism links with the UK present many opportunities for Ireland to benefit from the London games.  Sport has the capacity to unite and excite the whole country like nothing else and the Olympics remain the biggest sporting event of them all.  London 2012 is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the people of Ireland to experience the Olympics up close.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism established the London 2012 Olympics task force in August 2006 to ensure that Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic games in London.  The task force includes experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and is supported by staff within the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The group was asked to examine all possible opportunities, identify the priority areas of interest and map out a strategy to ensure that Ireland will benefit from its proximity to London in 2012.</P>
        <P>One of the first pieces of work that the task force carried out was an audit of high quality sports facilities suitable to attract international athletes to train in the years leading up to the London 2012 Olympic Games.  In parallel with this audit and better to inform the future work of the task force, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism appointed Indecon International Economic Consultants to carry out an economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  This evaluation has now been completed and the task force is considering the findings and recommendations. It is important that any expenditure on facilities will be aimed not only at attracting teams but primarily at ensuring a lasting legacy for Irish athletes and communities.</P>
        <P>I understand that the task force will shortly be submitting recommendations to my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, on the work that it has carried out and the Minister looks forward to receiving the report in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Contrary to what he said at the outset, perhaps there is hope that in future Ireland could host the Olympics.  A few years ago, one of my own party colleagues raised this issue when he was lord mayor of Dublin.  We should never say &ldquo;Never&rdquo; as regards such matters.  </P>
        <P>Turning to my Adjournment matter, I seek the removal of the existing three-year cap on community employment schemes.  I expect that in his response the Minister of State will outline the existing situation whereby people can extend that period to six years if they are over a particular age limit.  However, there is a strong case to be made for the complete removal of the cap.  Senators are involved in various community activities and will be familiar with the role of community employment schemes in providing important services.  Many local voluntary organisations would not be able to function properly were it not for the efforts of people working on community employment schemes.  The schemes provide a level of self-esteem and self-confidence for participants who might otherwise be unemployed.  A small amount of money is involved in running these schemes over and above what would be spent by the Government on social welfare payments to such people if they were not participating in the schemes.</P>
        <P>Numerous studies and surveys have highlighted that people over the age of 50 have more difficulty gaining employment.  If their skills range is not wide, this difficulty can be exacerbated.  For example, a man aged 63 years in my locality has served six years on a community employment scheme and he has been asked to leave, which is ridiculous.  He will reach retirement age in two years and he has provided a valuable service in the local community.  It would cost the Government virtually nothing to retain him on the scheme but he has been told he must leave.</P>
        <P>The current system is too rigid.  The Government is all about encouraging people to become more involved in their local communities and voluntary organisations but many of these organisations would not function properly without the effort, help and support of CE schemes.  That may not have been the original intention behind them but they play a vital role and it is important that the Government and the Minister of State should acknowledge this reality.  The prospect of future employment for people aged over 55 years who are on these schemes is limited.  A compelling case can be made for the abolition of the current cap.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The F&Aacute;S community employment, CE, scheme is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-<Col N="624"/>term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  Community employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and assisting them to enhance both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The CE programme was restructured in 1999 to limit participation by new participants to three years with effect from April 2000.  This change was introduced to encourage unemployed persons to progress to training or education and employment options where possible.  This three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period.  In general, approximately 20% of participants, including persons aged under 55, have benefited from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, to cater for older workers, the three-year CE cap was revised to allow those aged 55 and over to avail of a six-year period on CE based on participation since 3 April 2000.  This was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.  In July 2006 my Department published its sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005, one of the key highlights of which is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the plan.  To provide additional training to assist progression to employment for people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from three to four years, and for people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit has also been raised by one year from six to seven years.  The upper age limit for CE participants is 65 years.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S continues to develop the content of the CE programme.  The new approach involves the introduction of an &ldquo;Individual Learner Planning Process&rdquo; which focuses on meeting the learning needs of participants.  The individual learner plan provides for the planning, organising and recording of the work experience, training and development each participant receives while working on CE.  It also includes further training and development for supervisors, a new application process and quality assurance procedures.</P>
        <P>Under this individualised approach, F&Aacute;S has proposed four new FETAC awards relevant to both CE and job initiative, JI, learners including a certificate in personal and social employment skills &mdash; level 3; a certificate in vocational employment skills &mdash; level 3; a certificate of applied employment skills &mdash; level 4; and a certificate in specific employment skills &mdash; level 5.  These new awards will facilitate all the planned <Col N="625"/>learning completed on CE or JI by each participant being rolled up into the achievement of a FETAC award.  This will provide added value to the learner and will support their progression on to further training or employment.</P>
        <P>Funding for CE in 2007 was provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on F&Aacute;S schemes.  More than 22,000 people are employed on CE schemes nationally.  In delivering these places, F&Aacute;S operates flexibly in the management of this allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  This provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional F&Aacute;S offices and local sponsor and community organisations, and issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.</P>
        <P>It should be remembered, however, that where participants remain on CE, they preclude someone else from benefiting from the programme.  F&Aacute;S makes every effort to ensure differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  F&Aacute;S also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.  I am advised by the organisation that it is currently unaware of CE projects that cannot fill vacancies owing to the six-year cap for those aged over 55 years.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed people while, at the same time, providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the scheme under constant review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response and the details he outlined regarding the FETAC awards are clear but the six-year cap is arbitrary.  The cap could be two or ten years.  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s comment about F&Aacute;S being unaware of CE schemes that cannot fill vacancies owing to the cap.  I am concerned about this issue not from the point of view of F&Aacute;S but from the point of view of someone aged 61 or 62 years.  For the sake of the &euro;20 per week it costs the State to retain people on the CE scheme, they should be retained.  Given reviews are ongoing, people aged over 55 years, in particular, should be considered.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I refer to the provision of a new campus for St. Angela&rsquo;s secondary school, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hill, Cork.  Political promises were made and meetings with officials of the Department of <Col N="626"/>Education and Science held but action by the Department is required.  I hope the Minister of State will provide clarity on progress on this issue in his reply.  It is extraordinary that in the dying days of the Celtic tiger era schools in Cork city require urgent development.</P>
        <P>Parents, young girls, teachers and the board of management are exasperated by the lack of movement and progress on the development of the campus.  How has the Government allowed schools to operate when they are in dire need of repair, and this despite our economic prosperity and growth?  The students, board of management, teachers and parents have lobbied extensively for the provision of a new school campus.  The basics of a specialist room, physical education hall, purpose-built science laboratory, home economics room, school canteen and a proper assembly hall are lacking at present, as are facilities for drama, art and music.  Provision must also be made for disabled students.  It behoves us as public representatives to come up with a meaningful response to this Adjournment matter, so I ask the Minister of State to give a positive reply.</P>

        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As evidence of our commitment, national development plan, NDP, funding of &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools over the coming years.  The Senator will agree this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.</P>
        <P>St. Angela&rsquo;s school is an all girls post-primary school with a current enrolment of 524 pupils.  Enrolments at the school have remained stable over the past five years.  An extension and refurbishment project proposed for the school is at the early stages of architectural planning.  The Department of Education and Science requested the project&rsquo;s design team to complete a schedule of accommodation based on 500 pupils, giving consideration to utilising the existing school building and site only or utilising the existing <Col N="627"/>school building and site and the St. Angela&rsquo;s Convent building and grounds.  The design team quantity surveyor was requested to update the estimated costs for the proposed project taking into account decanting costs and the implications of the potential options.</P>
        <P>It is understood following consideration by the design team that to provide accommodation for a 500-pupil school the convent building and gardens will be required.  The existing school site is restricted.  At a recent meeting with the Department, the trustees confirmed that the Ursuline Order is willing to sell the convent building and gardens to the Department and is prepared to <Col N="628"/>cede the current school building and site.  The trustees&rsquo; offer is being considered by the Department.</P>
        <P>Progression of this project is predicated on the acquisition of the convent building and gardens and the extension and refurbishment of the existing buildings, which will include the need to decant the existing cohort of students.  The proposed building project for St. Angela&rsquo;s will be considered for progression in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
