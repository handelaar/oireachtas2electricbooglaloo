	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to act immediately and publicly to restore the good name of an Irish citizen (details supplied) and to ensure that all relevant documentation is made available to him at once.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Dominic Hannigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify his intentions in relation to the renegotiation of trade agreements with the ACP countries, and if he will make a statement on the Government&rsquo;s future policy in relation to economic partnership agreements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on the status of plans for Liberty House in inner city Dublin and to confirm plans for the quick delivery of the project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to decide a way forward for the introduction of arts therapies to special schools, given the proven benefits noted in Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in Buncrana from its one year of music therapy for their special needs students, now threatened with withdrawal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Norris, Hannigan and Donohoe and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on older people; and No. 2, motion re Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  It is proposed that No. 1 will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn not later than 1 p.m.  Spokes<Col N="320"/>persons may speak for eight minutes and all other Senators for six minutes.  Senators may share time by leave of the House; No. 2 will be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, but not earlier than 1 p.m., and will conclude at 2 p.m. if not previously concluded.  Spokespersons may speak for seven minutes and all other Senators for five minutes.  Senators may share time by agreement of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had some lively debates on the Lisbon treaty but these have taken place generally on the Order of Business.  They have been quite limited, and Senator Norris and others have felt rather frustrated that they did not have time to discuss particular aspects of the treaty.  Since we are effectively in renegotiation with our partners in Europe on the Lisbon treaty, all the issues raised in the public debate are still relevant and significant.  For this House to remain relevant, it should continue to examine the issues that have arisen.  Each week on our agenda we should select one aspect of the debate on the treaty, such as the primacy of EU law, neutrality or taxation, and tease out in a calmer atmosphere the implications of the treaty.  It appears we will have to revisit these issues and to do so calmly in this House would be very beneficial.  We should not have to do this in a rush at some future date if there is to be a Lisbon 2 referendum.  In many ways, we are subcontracting this work to the Forum on Europe, but this House can play a part in continuing the discussions on these issues.  In addition, on some occasion the MEPs should be invited to the House for such a debate.</P>
        <P>A recent report by the National Consumer Agency found a 30% difference in supermarket prices between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  These do not appear to be justified by overhead costs or other differences between North and South.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The lack of competition among supermarkets in this country is also highlighted by the fact that the prices of 22 grocery items at Tesco and Dunnes Stores were found to be identical.  Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 specifically declares agreements or concerted practices between undertakings to be illegal.  The response of Government, which was to suggest that people should shop around to get better value in supermarkets, is inadequate.  I ask the Leader to address this question to the Minister.  The Competition Authority should be asked to investigate these price issues.  It is of fundamental importance in controlling prices and inflation in this country that we do not have this type of cheating of consumers.  The reality is that this is a criminal offence under the Competition Act.  The Competition Authority should investigate whether there is profiteering by supermarkets in the Republic of Ireland and what measures should be adopted to deal with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the European Environment Agency covering Ireland&rsquo;s progress in meeting its Kyoto carbon emission targets has been published.  The reality is that the relevant Ministers, Deputy John Gormley and Deputy Eamon Ryan, have indicated that they have taken measures on motor tax and vehicle registration tax, etc.  Our climate change strategy provides for a 3% reduction each year but, on the basis of current policies, those targets are not being and will not be achieved.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must outline what steps are being taken to realistically enable Ireland to meet these targets.  The progress made has been unsatisfactory and to say that the Ministers are only in power for one year is not an acceptable response.  I ask that the Leader to address that question to the two Ministers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a morning when men must feel inadequate at working 39 minutes less per day than their female colleagues, at least Senator Regan has shown flexibility and the ability to multitask, something to which we all aspire.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of insurance premia, which tags on to the issue of prices; it is an issue on which the Leader has taken a particular interest and done substantial work.  Members will know that I am the vice chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which has now been rebranded as the Injuries Board.  It is saving the State a significant amount of money every year, perhaps close to &euro;100 million.  It has also meant a significant increase in the profits of the insurance industry and insurance companies.  For that reason, the idea of listening to some insurance companies purporting to put forward the case for increasing premia is unacceptable.  A a time when the economy is on a downturn and there is increasing pressure on business, the cost of insurance is a significant factor.</P>
        <P>To respond to a point made by Senator Regan, this is something on which we in these Houses can keep a sharp eye and ensure that the cost of insurance premia go down rather up.  I strongly believe there is still an opportunity to reduce premia and that the insurance companies will still be the most profitable insurance companies in Europe.  I ask for a debate on the insurance industry that would cover examination of the impact of the cost of insurance premia across personal, motor and business insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the ongoing fallout from last week&rsquo;s vote, it is clear there is a crisis in the country.  We all wish the Taoiseach well in his deliberations abroad in the next few days.  Such deliberations are taking place at a time when we need them most because people are very concerned about consumer confidence and about the way the economy is going.  This is not only due to potential job losses and job insecurity but there is also a perception that people are being exploited by retailers and suppliers.  Articles in today&rsquo;s newspapers indicate that a survey revealed that the price of food in the North is 30% cheaper than that in the South, yet the major retailers are trying to hoodwink us by telling us this is not the case.  In today&rsquo;s edition of one of our biggest selling daily newspapers, one supermarket advertises 600 special offers in its store, another advises 1,750 long-term price cuts have been introduced in the past year and another major retailer has two-page advertisements of half-price products.  Who are they trying to kid?  Everybody knows it is cheaper to go to the North and buy food there.  One can even buy newspapers at a lower price there.  Something needs to be done about that.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of the diesel prices has been raised previously.  We all know that fuel prices have increased and we all recognise the reasons for that.  However, it is baffling as to why price of diesel has risen by so much.  It is not clear that there is not some unscrupulous behaviour by some major suppliers to try to benefit from the environmental move towards low-emission cars.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the reports published in the past 24 hours was by the communications regulator.  It once again shows that the Irish mobile phone user pays the highest average revenue per customer in Europe.  Something needs to be done about that.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the major suppliers to be tackled on this issue and asked to justify their price increases and the reason prices need to be so high.  It is not clear that there is not some price matching taking place or, worse still, perhaps even cosy cartels in operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose a slight amendment to the Order of Business, &ldquo;That leave be granted to introduce No. 13 prior to the taking of No. 1.&rdquo;   I ask the Leader to respond to that proposal.</P><Col N="322"/>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of a conference held in Portlaoise last week by a financial consultancy aimed at those who participate in sports clubs, particularly in urban areas.  The focus of the conference was to encourage people involved in the GAA, soccer and rugby clubs to relocate their facilities in the middle of urban areas to suburban and locations well removed from the centre of towns and cities.  The holding of this conference is a disturbing development.  The House should debate this strategy as it not only will have an environmental impact in terms of people involved in sport, but young people in particular will have to travel longer distances to play sports when recreation and amenity areas and sports grounds are the lungs of our towns and cities.  If people are promoting this concept of which clubs are, unfortunately in growing numbers, starting to avail in order to look after their own long-term welfare, there is a responsibility on all of us to say this is a bad development.  Appropriate supports need to be put in place for the sports clubs and disincentives introduced to discourage them from following this strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>They need supports too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Supports are what it is all about.  </P>
        <P>In response to Senator Regan&rsquo;s point and the question of attaining the climate change targets, he is right in what he said.  The programme for Government refers to a 3% decrease on average in that regard.  My opinion is that for the first half of the life of this Government we will be running to stand still and that perhaps we will not achieve any of the 3% target decrease.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That amounts to buying time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>

	<P>It is the luxury of Opposition that it can criticise the Government for unattained targets while at the same time promoting policies that are diametrically opposed to those targets ever being achieved.  If we are to achieve our climate change targets, which we must because if we do not, there will be an economic as well as an environmental price to pay, it requires responsible Opposition.  I would like to see that on the other side of this House especially in the years to come.</P>

	<P>And the Senator is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I aspire to be there.  We will have leadership when we get there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise a number of issues that are of great importance.  I have raised this issue on two occasions since the Easter recess.  We need an urgent debate on the economy and especially, as Senator Regan said, on how consumers in this country have been ripped off.  Irrespective of whether the Leader agrees, rip-off Ireland is alive and well.  This morning&rsquo;s survey shows that people in the South are paying 30% more than their counterparts in the North for the same goods.  It is simply not good enough.  Ordinary citizens are struggling to pay grocery bills and some are forced to make difficult choices about which products they can afford to purchase.  They deserve leadership from the Government.  They also deserve better treatment from the large retail outlets, among which there is no competition.  Is a cosy cartel in operation?  I support Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s call for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, intends to transfer responsibility for youth affairs from his Department to the Office of the Minister for Children, under the remit of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  Will the Leader ask the Minister not to sign the ministerial order until he meets with the various stakeholders and until we have had an opportunity to discuss the issue in this House?  Youth work and youth affairs are two separate issues.  The retention of the role of the Department of Education and Science, or even a cross-departmental model, is the way to go.  I call for an urgent debate on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s call for a rolling debate on Ireland&rsquo;s role within the European Union.  I refer in particular to the EU directive on turbary rights, which emerged as an issue during the election campaign.  This was introduced ten years ago and a derogation was put in place, but circumstances have changed.  Oil prices continue to increase but there is no suggestion that the Arabs should be told to cease extracting oil from their oil fields.  Turf can be extracted economically.  People are upset that their rights to extract turf, which go back for centuries, cannot be utilised because of the EU.  Nothing is set in stone and all policies can be reviewed.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>Commissioners should be invited to partake in debates in this House on issues relevant to their remits.  There is no point in the Minister attending if he or she can only operate on the basis of assurances from Commissioners in policy areas such as defence.  I am confident the EU has woken up to Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and would respond favourably to a request by the Leader for Commissioners to attend the House to go through the areas of policy which caused serious concern to members of the electorate as they made their decisions on 12 June last.  I agree fully with Senator Regan in this regard and I ask him and the other leaders to work together to avail of the tremendous opportunity we have to become the first Houses of Parliament in Europe to host regular visits from Commissioners.  The President of the European Parliament has already come here.  Commissioners should be invited to attend debates on those specific policy areas which we identify as the main cause of concern for voters in the referendum campaign.</P>
        <P>I thought Senator Regan might have taken the opportunity on the Order of Business to comment on yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings at the Mahon tribunal.  It was wonderful to hear evidence which exonerated the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to allow Senator Regan time to reply.  That would be far more entertaining.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden remarked that the European Union has woken up to Ireland.  It is about time.  Confirmation of the Senator&rsquo;s remarks comes with the encouraging and authoritative report in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> under the headline &ldquo;Tax harmonisation on ice after Irish poll&rdquo;.  The crux of the piece is that the French Presidency, in a direct response to the referendum result, has already postponed the issue of tax harmonisation.  This is in itself a great achievement by the people of Ireland as a consequence of their decision to reject the Lisbon treaty.  It will be difficult for the Government to champion that achievement in Brussels today because it was not in favour of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  However, there is undoubtedly cause and effect at play here.  If the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote has achieved that, we are already going places.  We have achieved something of vital national interest in response to that &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and we are getting respect in Europe.</P>
        <P>It is too early for the Taoiseach to push hard on this but there is undoubtedly an opportunity to capitalise on that response.  The French Finance Minister has said tax harmonisation is not completely off the agenda but that France will no longer push it.  Last week she said it was top of the agenda.  It is important that we do not simply accept its postponement.  That is only a start.  We must recognise that we are punching hard as a consequence of our rejection of the treaty, that we are being taken seriously and that we are achieving something.  We may ultimately achieve the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s vital national interest.  That interest cannot be protected by the veto, but I will not go into that.</P>
        <P>I ask that we respond to this by way of a resolution, agreed by Members on all sides, urging that the issue of tax harmonisation be not merely postponed but buried via the next referendum which we undoubtedly will have.  The news today is encouraging because it shows that our rejection of the Lisbon treaty has already achieved recognition in a solid way from the French Presidency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Members referred to various aspects of the Lisbon treaty.  I do not wish to get into that but I refer to the issue raised by Senator Leyden, which is the ban <Col N="325"/>on turf-cutting.  This is of particular concern in rural areas, including in my own area.  Against a background of ever-rising oil prices, it is difficult to explain to ordinary people in rural areas that they cannot cut turf.  It begs the question: &ldquo;For peat&rsquo;s sake, why not?&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Glynn should ask his Green Party colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Turf-cutting is part of the rural Irish psyche and tradition.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity on alternative energy sources.  Such a debate would be timely.  I cannot understand why diesel prices have increased to such an extent, with one pump in the midlands charging &euro;1.45 per litre.  This represents an astronomical annual price increase.  Something is wrong.  Many good suggestions could come forward from a debate on alternative energy sources.  There is no doubt the situation that obtains in regard to the cost of food, oil and other consumer goods is driven by greed.  This House would make a major contribution to the issue by having an early debate.</P>
        <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business as proposed by Senator Boyle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Regan&rsquo;s important and worthwhile proposal for a rolling debate on the implications of our rejection of the Lisbon treaty has received support from Members on all sides of the House.  Senator Ross drew our attention to the article in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>.  The French have just realised that, as many of us knew, tax harmonisation was never a runner.  It is good to see the French acknowledge that publicly, and I thank the Senator for bringing it to our attention.</P>
        <P>I am delighted Senator Regan raised the issue of grocery prices.  It is disgraceful that prices are 30% more expensive in the Republic than in the North, as has been proved by the survey carried out by the National Consumer Agency.  All the agency could say about the issue was that the price differentials are inexplicable.  Of course they are.  As I said yesterday, however, the agency is something of a toothless wonder.  What is it going to do about it?  Senator Regan is probably correct in calling for the Competition Authority to get involved.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Leader probably would agree that the abolition of the groceries order was a disastrous error.  The committee of the last Parliament that was chaired by the Leader and of which I was a member unanimously recommended against its abolition.  The only price it reduced was the price of booze.  Senator Hannigan is probably accurate with regard to cosy cartels.  Price matching is taking place.  We have allowed the large players to corner the market and that is limiting choice.  Look at what it has done to prices.  I strongly agree that the House should call for the Competition Authority to examine this issue.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was right when he spoke to the T&aacute;naiste about calling in the National Consumer Agency, but I doubt it will achieve anything.  The Competition Authority is needed to seriously examine the situation.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments about the insurance industry.  We have a vested interest in keeping insurance premia down.  Much valuable work was done on this issue by the committee I mentioned earlier and we do not wish to throw it away or lose it.  That is another matter on which we must be watchful.</P>

	<P>Could the Leader obtain a brief on developments in primary care in the community from the Health Service Executive, especially with regard to primary care teams?  I am anxious to know what supports and incentives are in place to encourage such developments.  I understand that many professionals are participating in discussions on how the primary care teams can work together and develop but that there are difficulties regarding the details of the cost of the development and whether we are expecting the professionals not alone to provide their professional services and supports but also to come up with the money for ensuring these developments proceed.  A huge amount of discussion is taking place but I understand there is no clarity about the financial package for such developments.  I hope the Leader can obtain details about this.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of housing and the homeless on numerous occasions in the House.  I am especially concerned about recent media reports regarding bed availability and the concerns of some of the service providers about funding.  My understanding is that there are many beds and plenty of money in the system but there are service shortfalls due to pressure points and bottlenecks in the system that must be dealt with.  These are not necessarily concerned with the substantive issue of homelessness and providing a bed or a roof for a person living on the street but with dealing with vulnerable people such as those with intellectual disabilities, addiction problems and so forth.  There are many issues involved.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on housing, homelessness and the issues I mentioned?  We need to talk to the people providing the services on the street and participating in the outreach programmes.  They have their finger on the pulse and know what is required.  We can discuss the issue in the House but we need to bring those people in.  I listened with interest to Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments about reforming the procedures of the House.  Perhaps the Leader will come back to Members in the future with an updated report on Seanad reform.  I concur with the view, however, particularly with regard to a discussion on homelessness, that we must bring in the service providers who can give us an accurate account of the issues we must address to resolve the problems.</P>

	<P>I am glad Senator Boyle raised the issue of constructive opposition on climate change.  I agree it is important and the Senator and I have exchanged correspondence regarding my Climate Protection Bill which is currently before the House.  It is No. 9 on the Order Paper.  The Second Stage debate is due to be resumed and I look forward to engaging with the Senator on how we can move forward on that constructively with the overall goal of reducing emissions.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned a study that is widely reported in the newspapers and on the front page of today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It was conducted by the ESRI and the Equality Authority and confirms something of which we all are aware, namely, gender inequality in the division of labour.  It shows that women routinely work an average of 39 minutes more per day than men.  One striking finding is that women are working far more in unpaid work, caring and in child care.  I have previously sought a debate on the issue of the division of labour and, indeed, on the representation of women in public life, which feeds into that.  This is a vital matter.</P>
        <P>I am not saying men are inadequate, although Senator O&rsquo;Toole suggested that men might feel inadequate.  Clearly, they are not used to multi-tasking in the same way women are.  It is a subject close to my heart as I am currently multi-tasking with two very young children.  This is an important matter on which the Seanad could lead the way, particularly by debating the recommendations of the study.  The recommendations suggest that the answer to trying to change the culture where women continue to do more unpaid work than men while they are <Col N="327"/>entering the paid workforce in larger numbers is to introduce paid paternity leave.  The Seanad could lead the way by starting the debate on, and calling for, paid paternity leave.  This is something I have called for on many occasions.  It is important that we debate it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In doing that we could examine the structures in the Seanad and consider making them more family friendly.  Yesterday, in answer to a question from Senator Doherty, the Leader said the Seanad would sit in the second week in July.  I have no problem with that and most Senators, certainly on the Opposition benches, would like the Seanad to sit more often throughout the year and do more in terms of legislative activity.  However, it is difficult for Members, particularly for those with young children, to make arrangements when we do not know schedules in advance.  All Members, regardless of whether they have children, would welcome an advance notification of the timetable.</P>
        <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Oireachtas cr&egrave;che, which has facilitated my attendance today.  Providing a cr&egrave;che in the Oireachtas is an important and good initiative but we still must make arrangements in advance as the cr&egrave;che must know when we need to use it.  All Members have other plans and arrangements to make so they need to know in advance, in so far as that is possible, what the Seanad timetable will be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This afternoon we will discuss a motion concerning the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which was passed following the Omagh bombing atrocity ten years ago.  It contains strong measures to deal with terrorism.  It is a travesty, however, that although we are, quite correctly, dealing with that matter on the one hand, and I will support the motion, we are failing to deal with the biggest atrocity in the history of the Troubles, which was the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I have raised this matter many times in the House this year.  A report was produced by the Oireachtas joint committee, on which all parties in both Houses are represented, which clearly called for the endorsement by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad of its recommendations and findings.  The families of those who lost loved ones and who were seriously injured in the atrocities in Dublin and Monaghan are still waiting for closure and waiting for the Government to assist in bringing that closure.  I call on the Leader and the leaders of the other parties, as I have done before, to bring an agreed motion before the House to endorse those reports and set in train the recommendations made by that body.  </P>
        <P>Next January we will commemorate the 90th anniversary of the sitting of the first D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919.  I do not believe we are deserving successors to the vision, tradition and the sacrifices that generation made if we fail to uphold our own sovereignty in an area where collusion from British forces, known certainly by the Northern Ireland Office and in all probability at the highest levels of Government in Westminster, allowed this to happen and that we are not seeking some form of redress and truth for the people who were bereaved.  I feel strongly about that and I appeal to the leaders of all parties to assist in progressing the common sense recommendations made by that committee some years ago.  In doing that, this House can give a lead to the D&aacute;il to follow suit.</P>
        <P>I support the calls for a debate on price inflation and the insurance industry where there is a plethora of areas we need to look at.  In his capacity as Chairman of the former Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Leader and his fellow committee members did commendable work in making impactive recommendations on the insurance industry but the benefit has not flowed to the consumer.  There is still a strong perception, which is probably a reality, that the insurance industry is profiteering, as are many other industries, to a far greater degree than happens elsewhere.  This area, including the issue of legal fees, needs to be addressed and action must be taken.  It is a pity if we wait for a recession to make corrections in those areas.  Let us take the initiative and encourage that to happen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle referred to what he called the luxury of being in Opposition.  It is clear there is a duty in being in Government which requires two things, namely, a recognition of when something is going wrong and that the Government takes responsibility upon itself to act in dealing with the issue.  In fairness, at times there is occasionally a late recognition of when something needs action but what is continually missing is the Government taking responsibility to do something about it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What always happens is that the responsibility is either handed over to another organisation or a new organisation is created to take responsibility for it.  I raise this issue because it is now apparent that the Dublin Transport Authority, an organisation that is responsible for so many matters we raise regularly in this House,will have two features missing from it.  The first is that no politician will play a leadership role in determining what that organisation is doing and, second, that organisation will not be subjected to parliamentary questions.  We are now in a situation where health issue are the responsibility of the HSE, transport issues will be the responsibility of the DTA while the issues many Senators have raised today on the cost of living will be the responsibility of the National Consumer Agency.  </P>
        <P>Given the focus of this Government in handing over responsibility for these matters to other organisations that we cannot question, led by a Taoiseach who said he believed in the primacy of politics, where is that primacy when the power politicians have is continually eroded?  At the end of its term of Government, I ask the Leader what exactly it will be responsible for?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a continuing series of debates on the Lisbon treaty and the aftermath of the referendum.  A certain response is being extracted now and I would like, in particular, to examine the military details.  One of the reasons I am glad the treaty is stalled is that it means the European Defence Agency is not statutorily incorporated into the European Union.  I do not want it to be and I think we need a real examination of the armaments industry.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I call for a debate on No. 31, which concerns the situation in Zimbabwe.  While it was placed on the Order Paper by Senator Callely, I signed it as well as the amendment.  It is time we looked at that issue.  I ask the Leader to look at the motion and its amendment and, perhaps, compile a composite motion that could be supported by all parties.  The amendment was signed by the Fine Gael Party, myself and Senator Bacik.  I say this because we are moving into an election situation in which more than 100 people have been killed and more than 200 have been seriously injured, some maimed for life.</P>
        <P>Inflation in Zimbabwe is 1.6 million per cent.  It is in the realms of complete nonsense.  The sterling rate to the Zimbabwean dollar is 8 billion to the pound.  This is cloud cuckoo-land.  Meanwhile the head of the airforce is in charge of operations terrorising people to vote for Mr. Mugabe and a formula is handed out.  Going into the polling stations, people are expected to ask for help from the ZANU-PF officials because they want to vote for Robert Mugabe.  If they do not say that, they are in danger of being beaten up or murdered.  It is time the international community made its presence felt.  The behaviour of South Africa has been pathetic.  President Mbeki has been a disgrace and shows no concern for his fellow Africans.  I raised this matter with Kader Asmal when he was here.  Simply in solidarity with the suffering people of Zimbabwe it would be very useful if we had an agreed motion.  I ask the Leader to consider that.</P>

	<P>I support the comments made by Senator Donohoe.  The DTA is a new body coming into force.  Public representation will be badly needed in that regard.  How are we to get the message across in each of the four counties between Dublin City Council and the three other councils unless our public representatives represent us on that board?  </P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister must take into consideration the responsibility that each council will have in that regard.  There is no better way to have accountability than through the people who were elected to that council.  Senator Donohoe has made a very important point.  I do not want another HSE created here on a transport system.  It is our responsibility, as public representatives, to ensure public representatives are accountable on all boards created from here on in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe we must review what is going on in the HSE.  It is disturbing for me, as a public representative, to hear different stories, one worse than another, every day.  A one-day sitting of the House would serve us well when we could look at all the faults within the HSE.  Before anything else happens, the Minister who is looking at the new Dublin transport authority should consider how we can have representation on that board and how it will be accountable.</P>

	<P>I concur with the sentiments of Senator Boyle, or rather Senator Donohoe.  Senator Boyle is on my mind.  While I like him on a personal basis, I am fed up with being patronised by him on the Order of Business every day.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like if Senator Boyle would practise a little bit of what he preaches in terms of his speech on responsible opposition and deal with responsible government.  We saw a few examples of that this morning when a number of Fianna F&aacute;il speakers mentioned turbary rights &mdash; I agree with them and support them fully in what they said &mdash; but yet we know that the Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has a very different stance on that issue.  Senator Butler has been consistent in raising the Health Service Executive and Senator Donohoe mentioned in his comments about how we have continuously handed over powers to new agencies and new bodies, yet when the Labour Party tabled a constructive motion on reviewing the HSE the Government voted it down.  The motion was not even particularly controversial.  It is pathetic that we have to come in here and be criticised for not being constructive.  I urge the Government to be honest with people and to be constructive.</P>
        <P>With a view to that I seek a constructive debate on housing and the funding of local authorities in terms of their housing output.  I have been seeking such a debate for four months.  I accept we are in constricted financial times currently but perhaps the Government can be constructive in telling people the situation on the ground and that there are significant cutbacks in house building.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also seek a constructive debate on the schools building programme.  The Government made a number of announcements in advance of the previous general election and it was recently discovered that although 26 primary schools around the country went out to tender for new school buildings they seem to have disappeared completely off the list and off the radar.  No information is being given to boards of management as to when the new school buildings might commence.  I would like to see constructive government in that regard.</P><Col N="330"/>
        <P>I join with other speakers in calling for a debate on pricing.  A wholly unsatisfactory debate took place recently with the National Consumer Agency in the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The response we were given by the agency is that people should shop around.  That is an insufficient response and it is not acceptable.  I agree with points made by previous speakers.  Senator Hannigan referred to telephone tariffs and a number of speakers in recent days, including me, raised the issue of fuel prices, which beggars belief.  The cost of fuel is a significant factor in supermarket prices but, as previous speakers mentioned this morning, how is it that in the North of Ireland where fuel is more expensive, the cost of supermarket goods is 30% cheaper across a range of products than they are on this part of the island.  That does not make any sense.  I urge the Leader to arrange debates on housing, the schools building programme with the new Minister for Education and Science, and most important of all, a discussion on prices, before we leave for the summer, especially given that we have an extra week&rsquo;s debate.  We cannot afford to leave the House for the summer recess without having a debate on that important subject.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Bacik.  As a member of the Opposition it is very difficult to make arrangements if one does not have a clear timetable.  Unlike Senator Bacik I do not have children but such information is important to ensure that one can attend all the relevant debates.  It would be more appropriate if the Leader could possibly give timetables in advance or if the staff in the Seanad office could make that facility available to Members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to the fishing industry in this country, which is currently experiencing major difficulties.  The global cost of fuel is impinging negatively on the industry and it is affecting fishing fleets on the west coast, the east coast and the south coast of the country.  I applaud the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, on the discussions they held in Athlone last weekend, which were constructive and were welcomed by the fishing federation and the industry.  While the outcome of the discussions was positive the Government has no control over the matter, which has been discussed by the European Union and in the Commission.  It appears the EU will provide some mechanism to member states to allow them to approve additional moneys for vessels and fishing fleets in Ireland to subsidise the high cost of fuel.  I very much welcome that initiative.  We should address the matter in this House prior to the summer recess.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the House for a debate prior to the summer recess to give us all an opportunity to discuss the matter with him and to commend him for the work he has done to date on the issue, which is a crisis situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two weeks ago I raised the blockades in French ports of crab and lobster being exported from Ireland.  There has been some lifting of that blockade in France, but only some, as blockades are still in place.  That is another issue that we can perhaps discuss when we have that debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the confirmation that prices are 30% higher here than in Northern Ireland in the same supermarket chains.  It is very serious that it is 30% dearer to shop in a Dunnes or a Tesco in the Republic than it is in Northern Ireland.  The advantage of the strong euro has not been passed on to consumers in the South and that is also very serious.  Hard-pressed consumers are voting with their feet and travelling to the North to shop.  I am very conscious of that coming from County Cavan.  There is a constant stream of shoppers travelling across the Border to Northern Ireland from counties Cavan, Louth, Monaghan and Donegal.  I appeal to the Leader to take up this urgent matter.</P><Col N="331"/>
        <P>As Senator Regan pointed out, section 4 of the Competition Act declares price fixing by cartels to be illegal and criminalises it under section 6.  If necessary, we must invoke that legislation.  The role of the Competition Authority must be examined also.  All pricing authorities in the country must be brought to bear on this extremely serious issue.  It is especially serious for small shopkeepers and people who are trying to make a living in the Border counties that the people who are usually their customers are streaming to Northern Ireland to do their shopping.  Something needs to be done about it.  I call on the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>ESB bills have increased by 30% and fuel has risen by 60% in recent years.  When all the increases are combined it is evident that inflation is rampant.  Controlling inflation is the key to economic management and for that reason we need to have a serious debate on the issue, not just an aspirational debate but one in which we would find out specifically what can be done by the Competition Authority and the relevant Minister.  I appeal for such a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>I welcome the extension of the session by a week.  It is important that debate takes place on important issues.  I congratulate the Leader on that.  It is equally important that we have a discussion on carbon emissions, and the fact that we are 12.5%, or one-eighth, over our target.  We are not reaching our Kyoto Agreement targets, which in the first instance were generous to Ireland.  We are making marginal progress.  An audit is required to ascertain the position and what practical steps are necessary for us to take.  I call on the Leader to have a focused, practical, solution-driven debate.  In the face of both rampant inflation and the carbon emissions, we have done the aspirational bit.  We have made the speeches and set out the stalls.  We now need action, results, specific targets and a programme of activities.  I appeal to the Leader, who may be a future Minister, to call in the relevant Minister and get results here.  I am sure after my last remarks he will.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle has proposed and Senator Glynn has seconded the proposal that leave be granted for No. 13 to be taken before No. 1.  I have no difficulty with this and I agree to the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Regan, Ross, Coghlan and Norris expressed their views on the Lisbon treaty.  I will take on board the proposals made this morning, especially given the research published yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicating that 40% of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; did not understand what they were being asked to vote on.  This is very serious and we have a duty as legislators to correct the areas in which the electorate had serious concerns.  As I said yesterday the people are to be congratulated on a 53% turnout, which is very high for a referendum.  It was not a landslide rejection because a 4% swing would have won the vote for the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  However, we must take the positives as Senator Ross has said this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the Seanad playing a central role in coming months in making the concerns of the electorate known to the authorities in Europe.  I will endeavour to have European Commissioners come here to address the various areas in which the electorate have concerns.  I would like to start with the taxation matter with the agreement of the Government.  As Senators are aware, the Leader of the House can only carry out the requests made of me by agreement of the Government.  Some positive proposals have been made this morning and I want to ascertain whether we can put the Seanad centre stage bearing in mind the importance of the issues that the electorate still want addressed.  I get a feeling that the electorate wants to be part of Europe and play a central role as we have always done.  We have been very good Europeans.  Ireland through all its Presidencies under various Taoisigh who have led the country has excelled.  Those Presidencies allowed Ireland to show Europe how efficient, organised, <Col N="332"/>determined and appreciative we are, and how seriously we have treasured the membership of the European Union during our 35 years of membership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Hannigan, Buttimer, Coghlan, Walsh, John Paul Phelan and O&rsquo;Reilly all expressed their serious concern over the price differences in major stores of up to 30% between the North and the South as has been highlighted today.  The National Consumer Agency has a direct role in this regard and representatives of the agency have appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment in recent weeks.  It is regrettable that this committee is meeting at a time when we are taking the Order of Business.  I only attended the very early part of the meeting.  I have some serious concerns.  As Senator Coghlan and others pointed out, the committee made its presence felt at the time of the review of the groceries order.  It might be time to review the committee&rsquo;s report.  Senator Coghlan and I, who are members of the committee, might discuss the matter with the committee Chairman to establish what progress can be made to assist the Government in this regard.</P>
        <P>The review of the groceries order was a major undertaking as we were carrying out the trawl of the insurance industry at the same time.  During that review representatives of the multiples stated that they were purchasing for the North of Ireland under the umbrella of a market of 60 million, the UK.  Part of the differential was explained because the goods were coming in under the UK territory.  At the time they pointed out that wage costs were much higher, as is still the case.  The South of Ireland is a high cost location with higher wages than in the UK.  We need to review all these areas.  Perhaps under the scope of Seanad reform it could happen that the committee chairpersons would be answerable to the Seanad in this area.  We could then make our presence felt both as members of committees and take it a stage further still.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s suggestion regarding section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 is worthwhile.  It should be seriously considered by the Minister and the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan, Boyle, Bacik, O&rsquo;Reilly and others were very interested in our carbon emissions and matters pertaining to our environment and climate change.  I can agree to have this matter debated.  One Senator remarked that the Government might not be doing enough.  As Senators know we now have a carbon budget each year, which is starting to address the challenge.  However, the economy and the global downturn will naturally affect the timeframe.  Experienced Senators and those with vision for the future who may wish to go on to play a more central role in Government will agree.  We need to set our priorities when things are bad and the downturn is there.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole called for a debate to review the progress we are making in insurance costs, particularly regarding the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, of which he is vice chairman.  I have asked the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Penrose, to allow me to get the insurance inquiry restarted during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il and Seanad.  He has agreed and this will start early next year.  I can now inform the House and the insurance industry that the data for 2007-08 will be used to measure the performance of the industry in reducing its prices.  Its costs have been reduced as a result of the four Acts introduced in the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not understand why insurance premiums should be rising.  They should be reduced by another 20% or 25% as a result of the legislation that came about following suggestions from the industry to ensure that Ireland is a safer place in which to live and travel.  In particular, the areas of private and commercial motor insurance and employers&rsquo; and public liability have been tightened up by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act and the Civil Liability and Courts Act, and the introduction of penalty points and random breath testing.  All these major initiat<Col N="333"/>ives came from the Government to ensure that the industry would be a much stronger position and that premiums would be reduced substantially.  All fair-minded people would agree that premiums have been reduced by 30% to 40% in most cases.  The industry should note that the watchdog, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will be in being during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The Chairman has agreed that we will begin again our trawl of the industry every year for the next four years of the lifetime of this Government, as we did during the 29th D&aacute;il and the 22nd Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle informed the House of the conference that took place in Portlaoise and the challenge of keeping the locations of sporting areas centre stage in communities.  Every Member of the House would agree with his sentiments and we will bear that in mind and see what we can do to highlight this to the Minister during debates or when legislation comes to the House.  Some are trying to encourage GAA and other sporting clubs, particularly soccer and rugby, to move to the outskirts of towns.  Not everybody has transport to bring people a mile or a mile and half outside towns with inclement weather.  We all encourage young people to get involved and participate in sport.  I fully agree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s sentiments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer again called for a debate on the economy, but, as the House knows, I have given a commitment that we will have a full and wide-ranging debate on the economy before the summer recess.  I have committed to at least a half-day of debate on this.  We look forward to that.  We have a new, young and dynamic Minister of State with special responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I will pass Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s views to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and he will give the Senator&rsquo;s proposal serious consideration.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden and Glynn expressed strong views on turbary rights, especially in areas of the Midlands, where we all live and which we represent.  Senator Glynn correctly said the opportunity of turf cutting ties in with the high price of oil and alternative energy.  We are coming to the end of a ten-year agreement with the farming organisations.  Because the price of oil has gone through the roof, it should be extended by at least ten years.  I call on all concerned here for common sense to prevail.  Everyone is entitled to this.  We have our industry in Bord na M&oacute;na, which has been an outstanding success.  It was established by a father figure, Dr. Todd Andrews, in 1946 and has stood good to the people of Ireland to today, especially to give meaningful employment in areas such as Rochfortbridge and C&uacute;l na M&oacute;na, areas which we all know and in which we grew up.</P>
        <P>As I said, with the cost of oil gone through the roof it is common sense that a decision would be taken quickly on this.  In the election two Fine Gael councillors came out strongly and said they would vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because their people were so hard-pressed.  It was very difficult to say otherwise.  I have no difficulty passing to the Minister the strong views expressed in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called on me to supply a brief on primary care from the Health Service Executive and information on how primary care teams will be funded.  I will make that request of the HSE and the Minister.  As a former Minister of State, Senator Callely has much expertise and experience in this area and I will do everything I can to get the figures he requested.  The Senator and others called for a debate on housing and homelessness.  I have no difficulty with this taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on multi-purpose labour and other labour issues.  She also made a request regarding the workings of Parliament.  I take my instructions from the Government, which gets agreement of the Whips in both Houses if possible.  It is not possible to do as she asks.  We can tell colleagues the weeks we will sit but regarding the matters to be debated <Col N="334"/>and Bills forthcoming, there are many areas in which our destiny is not in our hands.  As always, I will let Senators know which weeks we will sit during autumn and winter, but it is not possible to specify the hours and matters to be discussed.  However, we will endeavour to assist all Seanad Members to the best of our ability.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh highlighted his serious concerns about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and called for us to bring an all-party motion on it to the House.  All Senators want to find out the truth of what happened in this terrible atrocity.  I will bring this to the Leaders&rsquo; meeting next Tuesday before the Order of Business and see how we can progress this proposal.  Senator Walsh also pointed out the 90th anniversary of the sitting of the first D&aacute;il is coming up on 21 January 2009.</P>
        <P>Senators Donohoe, Buttimer and John Paul Phelan spoke about the Dublin transport authority, DTA, and the Minister&rsquo;s handing over of power.  As every Member of this House is a member of one committee or another, we all know those authorities have to appear before the committees and are directly answerable, live on television, to the responses and queries of the Oireachtas Members.  It is about getting value for money and getting the job done efficiently.  While I share some of the views the Senators expressed, we had the Minister in the House to discuss the DTA and these views were strongly expressed, particularly regarding public representatives being members of the new authority, which I fully support.  It is untrue such bodies are not accountable.  They are answerable to Oireachtas committees, the same as the National Roads Authority, NRA.</P>
        <P>Down the years Members were very frustrated with the NRA, but now that it has been established for almost 15 years, it is an outstanding success.  The work taking place across the entire country is incredible.  It is on budget and in some cases ahead of time.  It takes a long time to achieve the fine-tuning we would all like to see.  The same is happening with the HSE and will happen in the teething stages of all these other authorities being established.  The professionals and experts dealing with their own professions are bound to bear fruit.  Politicians want to see value for money and are great people for establishing and seeking funding for the various projects.  However, we then have to hand them over to the professionals who have the expertise to get the job done.  We all hope the Health Service Executive will become a success like the NRA.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised No. 24, motion 31 on Zimbabwe.  We had an all-party motion before the House when we agreed our strong views on what is happening in Zimbabwe.  We cannot condone anything that is happening there.  The all-party motion has been agreed already by everybody in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler requested a review of the HSE and I have already covered this.  I can have this take place but I do not envisage it happening before the summer recess unless we do it in some other way because there is so much legislation arising for Members&rsquo; consideration as well as the half-day debate on the economy.  I envisage we will sit during the second week in July, will recess into committee work for the last two weeks in July and will take the usual holidays for the month of August.  We will return with a very heavy schedule beginning with the committees during the first three weeks in September.  Then, as we all know, the Houses return in the last week in September.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan called for a debate on housing.  I have no difficulty in this taking place but if the Senator wants it to take place before the summer recess, I ask him to speak to the leader and deputy leader of his group to ascertain whether they will take it in Private Members&rsquo; time.  If not, I give an undertaking that we will take it after the summer recess.  On <Col N="335"/>the school building programme, I will inquire from the Minister about the matters the Senator has highlighted this morning.  I will come back to the Senator directly in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill called for a debate on the fishing industry.  I have given an undertaking that this will take place before the summer recess.  The serious challenge facing this industry is of the most urgent nature.  In Athlone over the weekend we heard of the horror stories and difficult plight that industry is facing.  It should be one of our greatest industries.</P>
        <P>I wish our new Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and his Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, well.  They spent nine arduous hours discussing this with the representatives of the industry in Athlone over the weekend.  I know they are doing all they can with the EU to get whatever initiatives are necessary and to find out what can be done to assist the plight of those involved in this industry.  I wish them well.  I will have statements on this issue in the House before the summer recess.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leat, a Chathaoirligh, agus le gach Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom labhairt sa Teach mar gheall ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; a bhaineann le daoine n&iacute;os sine.  T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute;isteacht leis na cainteoir&iacute; ar gach taobh.  T&oacute;gfaidh m&eacute; na point&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la faoi deara.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators for giving me this opportunity to make a statement on the subject of older people.  It is very appropriate to address this important issue, given the potential to bring about change following the establishment of the Office for Older People earlier this year.  This move, which was brought into force at the end of January, highlights once more the commitment of the Government to older people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years there has been a growing realisation of the enormous contribution made by older citizens through all walks of life in both the public and the private arenas.  If we look across the Atlantic to the example of the septuagenarian senator, John McCain, we see that age need be no barrier to ambition and achievement.  Closer to home, the actor David Kelly, the author Jennifer Johnston, the painter Louis le Brocquy and the historian RB McDowell, <Col N="336"/>are just a few who force us to rethink the supposed limits and boundaries of age.  I think also of Paddy Burke of Littleton, Thurles, age 79, who was recently awarded a recognised award for being a cheesemaker, and also Maura Armstrong from Upperchurch, Thurles, again from my constituency, who at the age of 83 completed the women&rsquo;s mini-marathon a couple of weeks ago here in Dublin.  They are an inspiration to us all.  Older people are living longer, healthier lives and those lives can be filled with purpose and meaning.</P>
        <P>In comparison with some European countries, Ireland has a relatively young population.  The latest statistics tell us that 11% of people living in Ireland are aged 65 years or over.  It has been estimated, however, that this figure will rise to 20% by 2036 and to 29% by 2056.  This presents Ireland with both great challenges and great opportunities in the future.  It is to be regretted that, all too often, the debate and statistics surrounding older people relate to talk of &ldquo;problems&rdquo; or &ldquo;burdens&rdquo;.  While issues such as care or illness are genuine concerns that must be properly addressed, I am happy to use any occasion to stress the wide-ranging possibilities and potential of older people.</P>
        <P>For that reason, I am pleased that one of the key functions of my office is to develop a strategy for positive ageing.  My goal is to develop a meaningful and innovative strategy that will result in real improvements in the lives of older people.  The strategy will involve, for example, the development of operational plans by Departments, clearly setting out objectives relating to older people and joined-up thinking on initiatives serving this community.  Other areas for consideration include ongoing mechanisms to monitor progress and identify challenges.</P>
        <P>The new strategy will be developed on a cross-departmental basis.  To ensure this happens, I also have responsibilities in the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I am also a member of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion which ensures there is an integrated, coherent approach to issues relating to older people at Government level.  This approach is key to delivering the Government&rsquo;s vision of improved integration of services, and thereby further supporting older people into the future.</P>
        <P>My office also will continue to develop health policy and will oversee and monitor the delivery of health and personal social services for older people and the running of the long-stay charges scheme.  It will, in short, be the focal point for the development of a more comprehensive policy in regard to older people.  The remit of the office also will be extended to impact positively on issues in regard to employment rights and opportunities, promote gender equality for older people, and work closely with agencies providing services to older people in rural communities.  The resources of my office, which is staffed by officials from the Department of Health and Children, will be strengthened by the addition of staff of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  These new staff will add significantly to the research and overall capacity of my office.</P>
        <P>I stress that the voluntary sector in general, and older people in particular, will of course also make a positive and essential contribution to the development of policy in this area.  This will be primarily through the establishment of a new national advisory council on older people.  One of the main functions of this new council will be to advise me, as Minister of State, on all aspects of the lives of older people.  The council also will suggest ways of better co-ordination and delivery of services for this sector of society.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the office, the interdepartmental network and the advisory council will bring a greater coherence to policy making for older people.  These significant new measures will allow for a much greater degree of cross-cutting and will develop further the partnership <Col N="337"/>approach that has featured so strongly in the planning and development of services for older people in recent years.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the Office for Older People is only the most recent manifestation of the Government&rsquo;s long-running commitment to improving the welfare of older people.  The Government and the social partners have adopted a life cycle perspective in the current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, placing the person as the centrepiece of social policy development.  The vision for older people, as reinforced in Towards 2016, is to provide the support, where necessary, to enable older people to maintain their health and well-being as well as to live active and full lives in an independent way in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  There are specific initiatives for older people in the partnership agreement, such as pensions and income supports, housing and accommodation, community and residential health care, mobility, and promoting education and employment opportunities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The high level objectives of these initiatives, individually and in combination, are intended to make a real and significant improvement in the quality of the lives of older people.  To underpin the objectives in Towards 2016, older people have been highlighted in the social inclusion priority of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  A sum of &euro;9.7 million will be invested under the older people programme, with &euro;4.7 million allocated to the living at home sub-programme and &euro;5 million to be provided for the residential care sub-programme.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government is firmly committed to using the national development plan as a vehicle to translate policy into reality over period of the plan.  Our objective of continued development of community based services for older persons is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding invested in the system in recent years.  In the past three years, this Government has funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people to ensure they receive as much care as possible in their own homes, that high standards are set and enforced in all residential care settings and that the cost of residential care is always affordable and never an anxiety.  In 2006 and 2007, just over &euro;400 million was provided to enhance service development across the sector, of which &euro;190 million was for community based services over these two years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While considerable attention understandably has been paid to the number of older people in long-term residential care, it is important to note that only 4.6% of older people are in this situation.  More than 95% are at home in their own communities, which is where they want to be.  A key stone of the Government&rsquo;s policy for older people is supporting them in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  To cater for the needs of this majority, the Government has invested heavily in this area, resulting in significant service improvements in community supports in recent years.  Home help, which is the backbone of community-based services, includes the provision of a range of essential services that make all the difference to the quality of life of each individual.  In 2007, nearly 12 million home help hours were provided, benefitting an estimated 53,000 people.  In the past three years, more than &euro;50 million has been allocated to expand home help services across the country.  Where it is not feasible for people to remain at home, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed in Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>For those in need of greater community-based support, the Government has introduced, on a pilot basis in 2005 and a national basis since 2006, the concept of home care packages.  These packages are designed to reduce pressures on acute hospitals and long-term residential care systems by supporting older people to continue to live in their own communities.  Home care packages are therefore an mechanism over and above existing mainstream community services and are designed to enhance rather than replace existing home support services.</P><Col N="338"/>
        <P>In 2007 the HSE provided more than 4,000 home care packages, assisting in the region of 11,500 clients at a total investment of &euro;110 million.  An interdepartmental group comprising representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs and the HSE is currently preparing for an evaluation of this home care package initiative.  The evaluation, which will be undertaken later this year by independent consultants, will examine the current provision of services in this key area and make recommendations for improvements in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>For many people, whether carers or those who are being cared for, the availability of day and respite care is extremely important.  More than &euro;12 million has been made available for this area in the past two years.  In 2006, an additional &euro;9 million was provided for a wide range of new and increasing services, including improved therapy services for specific needs at local level.  A further &euro;3.5 million provided in the following year for an additional 1,100 day places per week.  The total projected day care provision this year is over 21,000 places.</P>
        <P>A fundamental feature of the myriad of services delivered throughout Ireland is the partnership approach involving the State and the voluntary sector.  Voluntary groups make invaluable contributions to the well-being of all sectors of society, including the provision of services and expertise at local level in conjunction with State agencies.  I acknowledge the tremendous work being done by these groups in the area of older persons.</P>
        <P>Additional supports are available through community intervention teams, which assist in preventing avoidable hospital admissions and facilitate early discharge.  These teams were developed in 2006 and, while not exclusively available to older people, the majority of those availing of them are aged over 65.  The teams operate in addition to existing mainstream community services on a seven day per week basis and provide fast tracked non-medical care or support for an interim period while mainstream services are being arranged for a patient but are not immediately available.  This service provides an immediate response for patients who are identified by a GP as requiring new or enhanced supports and offers a link between community services and patients who are discharged from accident and emergency departments but require community supports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2002 report, Protecting Our Future, made a number of recommendations regarding the principles, policies and procedures to be followed and the infrastructure required to address elder abuse.  This is a complex issue and is difficult to define precisely.  Abuse may take financial, psychological, physical or sexual forms or it may arise due to inadequacy of care.  Irrespective of the form in which it presents, it is simply unacceptable.  Significant progress has been made on the health service-related recommendations.  A HSE national steering committee is now in place, along with regional steering committees for each of the four HSE regions, dedicated elder abuse officers in three of the regions and the appointment of 27 of the 32 senior case workers.  My office has commissioned the National Council on Ageing and Older People to undertake a review of Protecting Our Future and this will inform us of future action.  The potential abuse of our older people, including financial abuse, concerns us all and it is an area that I intend to pursue vigorously until the best possible measures are in place to protect vulnerable older people.</P>
        <P>The report on the national advisory committee on palliative care was published in 2001 and subsequently adopted as Government policy.  In 2005, the National Council for Specialist Palliative Care was established by the Government.  A baseline study launched in 2006 revealed regional variances in the provision of hospice and specialist palliative care services.  Under the programme for Government, we have committed to removing these regional disparities in the <Col N="339"/>provision and funding of care and to ensuring that the needs of those who require palliative care are met.  Current spending on palliative care is approximately &euro;75 million.</P>
        <P>While helping people to live in their own homes for as long as possible, the Government is also committed to supporting access to nursing home care for those who need it.  This commitment is reflected in the new fair deal scheme, which will put in place a single transparent system of support towards the cost of nursing home care.  For the first time, there will be a uniform system of financial support for individuals in public and private nursing home beds.  The scheme will involve a co-payment arrangement between the individual and the State.  At the time of receipt of care the individual will contribute 80% of his or her net income towards the cost of care.  In addition, a capped contribution based on the individual&rsquo;s asset wealth will be payable.  This part of the payment, however, may be deferred until the settlement of the person&rsquo;s estate.  These new arrangements are designed to remove the real financial hardships experienced by many individuals and their families who under the old system of nursing home subvention had to sell or re-mortgage their homes to pay for the cost of care.  By contrast, the new fair deal will make long-term residential care affordable, accessible and anxiety free for those who need it.  The Bill providing for the scheme is at an advanced stage and is currently being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, hopes to publish the Bill at the earliest opportunity following its clearance by the Attorney General and the Government&rsquo;s approval.  The Minister has let it be known that the subsequent presentation and passage of the legislation through the Houses will be a priority because we all wish to make the benefits of the scheme available to older people.  In advance of the fair deal, a number of key improvements were made to the nursing home subvention scheme, including an increase in the basic rate to &euro;300 per week.  Budget 2007 provided &euro;85 million to support these improvements, further underlining the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting those in need of nursing home care.</P>
        <P>Senators will appreciate that the fair deal arrangements will depend on a number of success factors, including an increase in the number of long-stay beds.  For that reason, the Health Service Executive estimates that it will deliver 860 additional public beds in the period from 2007 to 2009.  This process is at present well under way and HSE will devote a significant proportion of its capital resources over the coming years to an expansion of long-term residential capacity and upgrading existing facilities across the country.</P>
        <P>The development of a national carers&rsquo; strategy is a key commitment of the programme for Government and the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, in recognition of the important role played by carers in society.  A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach has begun to develop a strategy.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides the secretariat to the working group, which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Enterprise, F&Aacute;S and the Health Service Executive.  The working group has met on four occasions to date, in February March, April and earlier this month.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Issues of concern to carers cut across many Departments and agencies and consultation is, therefore, a key element in developing the strategy.  The working group has used a three-strand approach involving consultations with the social partners, organisations representing carers, people with disabilities and older people, consultations with Departments and agencies not represented on the working group and written submissions from the public.  These consultations will continue during the development of the strategy.  Some 100 submissions from individuals and 48 from organisations were received in response to the public advertisement earlier this year and will also inform the strategy, which it is intended to publish later in the year.</P><Col N="340"/>
        <P>In keeping with its commitment to help older people continue to live in their communities, the Government is conscious of the need to provide accessible and appropriate shelter for the disadvantaged and vulnerable.  Sheltered housing is one of the most significant developments in the fostering of continued independent living among frail or vulnerable older people.</P>
        <P>When I was appointed in June of last year, I undertook, in the company of staff from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to visit a number of housing projects that have been extremely successful in providing sheltered accommodation for older people.  These projects ensure that independence and quality of life are to the fore but there is also an assurance that a good, wholesome meal will be provided in the middle of the day and that residents&rsquo; homes will be secure at night.  The fine projects to which I refer are located in Mayo, my constituency in Tipperary, Cork and elsewhere.  We will continue to support and expand on these projects in the future.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the report of the interdepartmental working group on long-term care of the elderly, the Government decided on a number of actions to be progressed.  Among these is a commitment to establish a cross-departmental team to develop and oversee policy in respect of sheltered housing for older people and to agree, as a matter of priority, local structures and protocols for integrated management and delivery of housing and related care services.  This team, which was established in July 2007, is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and involves the input of the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the office for social inclusion, local authorities and representatives from my office.  During the current year, the team will develop a policy framework in respect of sheltered housing for older people.  This framework will be also reflected in the new national positive ageing strategy to be developed by my office. Through this group, I look forward to the development of innovative housing solutions which will further enhance the quality of life of older people.</P>
        <P>As previously stated, demographic changes in the coming decades will lead to the ageing of the population.  A range of options will, therefore, be required to meet the housing and accommodation needs of older people.  In this context, the new adaptation grants to assist older people and those with disabilities or mobility issues, which were introduced on 1 November 2007 and which are being administered by local authorities, are essential in ensuring older people can remain in their homes for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>The housing adaptation grant for people with disabilities and the mobility aids grant scheme provide grant assistance to adapt accommodation to meet the needs of those with disabilities.  Many of these individuals are older people with age-related mobility problems.  As part of the new suite of initiatives, an additional scheme &mdash; the housing aid for older people scheme &mdash; provides targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.  This scheme will provide grant aid of up to &euro;10,500 to cover works such as structural repairs, replacement of windows and doors, rewiring, drylining, installation of central heating, water and sanitary services, cleaning and painting.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the latter scheme will also facilitate the implementation of a Government decision, taken in February 2006, to the effect that a more integrated service could be achieved by transferring the special housing aid for the elderly scheme from the HSE to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which already had responsibility for the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes.  The transfer of the scheme poses significant challenges for local authorities in the context of both workload and resources.  In recognition of this, and in order to ensure satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues, it was agreed between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the HSE <Col N="341"/>that the special housing aid for the elderly scheme will continue to be operated and administered by the executive until such time as all issues arising from the transfer are satisfactorily addressed.  It was also agreed that the appropriate resources and arrangements will be put in place to ensure that local authorities will be in a position to accept the scheme on transfer.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is engaged with the HSE to conclude this process as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The special housing aid for the elderly scheme is extremely effective in addressing the housing needs of older people.  The flexibility and integrity of the scheme must be maintained under the new regime.  In that context, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in conjunction with the HSE and the housing authorities, is developing specific mechanisms to ensure the needs of the more vulnerable members of our older community, such as those suffering from illiteracy, social exclusion and isolation, are adequately addressed following the cessation of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme.</P>
        <P>Senators will appreciate that many things are changing for older people and that this is a very exciting time for them.  I am pleased to be a part of this changing environment and I look forward to working with all stakeholders to initiate real change in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is very important.  It is vital that we place on record and reaffirm our commitment to the welfare of older people and our recognition of their enormous contribution to society.  We can be proud of older people and we should be grateful to them for what they have passed on to us.  Older people helped to create the Celtic tiger.  It is not their fault that the latter has some large thorns in its paws and is limping along at present.</P>
        <P>Older people showed remarkable wisdom and foresight in the context of how they prioritised education.  These individuals supported the State education system by paying their taxes and by highlighting the importance of education to their families.  People who did not have the privilege of a lengthy education identified the value thereof and passed it on to their children.  They also provided their children with great educational opportunities while enduring great hardship and poverty and making major sacrifices.  Theirs was an enormous contribution and it was the key factor in the creation of the society in which we live and the economic success we have achieved.  The fact that we can refer to upskilling people, diversification, etc., is due to the contribution made by older people in the past.  We should salute those to whom I refer.</P>
        <P>Old people are vulnerable to the extent that when they are the victims of abuse or wrongdoing, the knowledge relating to what they endured dies with them.  The tragic, horrific and almost indescribable institutional abuse of young people that occurred over many years was brought to light because those who were victims of this abuse lived to tell their tales.  Older people often do not live long enough to recount their experiences.</P>
        <P>We should pay tribute to those in the voluntary sector who have helped older people for many years.  I refer here to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations.  Positive Age is a major and successful group operating in County Cavan and it is doing great work.  I ask that the Minister of State examine the &ldquo;morning call&rdquo; system that Positive Age has put in place in respect of older people.  The latter can register with the organisation and specific people will be charged with contacting them by telephone each morning.  Those in the voluntary sector have done great work for older people.  In many instances they have taken up the slack in the absence of an adequate State response to the needs of older people.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently published a report which states that the position in respect of the abuse of the elderly is stark and frightening.  It indicated 1,500 were now under investigation by the State, with 96% of the cases being abuse by family members.  This is reprehensible and requires following up, along with the highest form of vigilance.  I ask the Minister of State in her response <Col N="342"/>later to give the House an assurance on that score that the investigations will be speedy, rigorous and uncompromising, no matter what they must delve into.  The abuse of older people is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>With regard to our nursing homes, I put on record that it is my experience in visiting local nursing homes that in 98% of instances the care is excellent, compassionate and holistic.  It is wonderful.  We all know about Leas Cross and other instances where abuses occurred.  I am happy to say there is a high level of inspections in my own Health Service Executive area, as I was told this at a briefing session with Members.  Will the Minister of State indicate that nationally there is a high level of unannounced and constant inspections?  I am disappointed reference was not made to that issue so it is important the Minister of State should respond specifically on it.</P>
        <P>In the context of nursing homes, I noted the Minister of State made reference to the fair deal plan.  I endorse her comments but it is disturbing that as a result of the difficulties in bringing forward the legislation, there is now a limbo meaning a number of people are neither in one place nor another.  This causes immense hardship in particular cases.  In my clinic work at local level I have come across a number of affected cases.</P>
        <P>The cost of electricity is to rise by 30% and fuel has risen over 60% in recent years.  The fuel allowance must be increased as it is not sufficient for it to cover only half the year.  The cost of living for a person living alone is 80% of the cost for a couple, simply because the person living alone requires the same amount of fuel and electricity.  We must increase the living alone allowance along with amount and term of the fuel allowance.  I hope to get a positive response in that regard.</P>
        <P>There has not been enough use of the home help scheme and the home care assistance scheme.  There is much isolation in rural Ireland and a visiting dimension should be added.  The home help scheme is very cost-effective, as it is cheap in providing money to people doing the home help.  Those people recycle the money into the economy so the net cost is quite low.  Many older and isolated people could do with a visiting service from neighbours in a home help capacity.  This is quite apart from help in lifting people or making cups of tea, although that is also required.  People need people to visit and have a chat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has become depersonalised and the local rural postman, for example, is not the same.  As a result the health service should be expanded.  I commend to the Minister of State the practical suggestion that a voluntary organisation which could show evidence its members were visiting older people as part of its remit would get a special supporting grant.  There should be a positive response to a voluntary organisation that could indicate it organises a certain amount of visits to older people in the year and show evidence of it.  Programmes of home help, which may include visiting, must be expanded.</P>
        <P>We need responses on issues such as the fuel allowance and the living alone allowance and we need an expansion of the home help service.  We need commitment to the parts of the voluntary sector which show evidence of working with the old.  I welcome the Minister of State and look forward to her response.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, and congratulate her on her reappointment as a Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  I listened to her speech and it is an excellent idea that she would integrate into her office the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is a tremendous resource and probably the best organisation for older people.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>We spoke about elder abuse and there was a day last week which marked how important it is to get on top of the issue.  From my information, it appears most of this abuse occurs in the home, coming from family members, rather than those in institutions.  For those non-family people looking after older people, it is more difficult to deal with family members abusing older people.  There is a major issue in that and I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in dealing with it.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Harney, has not been able to deliver the fair deal legislation.  This was promised at the beginning of this year and I told people in the last few months of 2007 that it would come about.  I was very supportive of it.  It is very disappointing that six months later it still has not happened.  That is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s problem.</P>
        <P>I will make a few points on the position of older people.  I welcome all the ladies in the Visitors Gallery.  Last Friday I attended a conference in UCD to mark Elder Abuse Day 2008.  The president of UCD, Dr. Hugh Brady, in opening the conference stated that we are witness to the greatest democratic shift in human history.  The average person in the world today can expect to live 20 years longer than his or her average counterpart during the first half of the previous century.  All of us in this room can expect to live 20 years longer than people in the previous century.  It is a fantastic feeling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>In some developed countries today, the proportion of older people is already one in four.  During the first half of the 21st century, this proportion is expected to reach one in two.  The president of UCD is a doctor as well as president of a university, and he stated that as a medic and health professional, he believed it important to state that as a success story.  On the other hand, it poses major challenges for us.</P>
        <P>In parallel with increased life expectancy, the fertility rate has declined rapidly.  This is leading to what Dr. Brady referred to as an age quake.  I do not know if anybody else in the room has heard the term before as I have not.  This age quake has never before been seen in history but is one of the greatest medical, social and economic challenges of the 21st century.  It arises from all of us in this era living 20 years longer than people in the previous century and younger people of child-producing age not having children, leading to a decrease in fertility rates.  I would bet nobody in the Chamber has heard of the term before, although I thought it was a wonderfully profound term.</P>
        <P>As a policy-driven Senator, during 2005 and 2006 I held public meetings to discuss the issue of ageing and ageism.  I researched many reports and documents on the issue and published a policy document in 2006 entitled A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism.  I made 28 recommendations based on public meetings I had in this city and throughout the country at which I listened to what older people had to say and what they wanted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All the 28 recommendations were important but I will deal specifically with the first two today which concern compulsory retirement at 65 in the public and private sectors.  The Minister of State will remember I raised the issue many times at parliamentary party meetings in front of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I asked him why he could not do what a former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, did in bringing about free travel for pensioners.  I told him he should allow people to stay on at work if they so wish.  I got this included in the joint programme for Government.  The Government has committed itself to giving people a choice in the age at which they retire.</P>
        <P>The age limit of 65 was introduced when life expectancy was closer to that age but people are now healthier and live longer.  People approaching 65 who work in the public and private sectors are only approaching their peak.  The Minister of State referred to John McCain who <Col N="344"/>may be the next President of the United States and he will be 72 in January.  I am addicted to American television and I have never heard reference to his age.  I believe attitudes to older people in Ireland are 40 years behind those in the United States.</P>
        <P>In the public and private sectors many thousands of people are forced to retire at 65, despite not wanting to do so.  They want a choice in when and how they retire and they may wish to retire gradually.  A person who joined the public sector after 2004 need not retire at 65 so the human rights of those who joined the public sector prior to that year are being denied.</P>
        <P>I wish to put the Minister of State on red alert that when I return in the autumn I will drive this issue in the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  I want the Government to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government, which was launched after the new Government was formed, to give people a choice in their retirement and allow them to stop working when they wish.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen will be interested to know that at my public meetings I found it heartbreaking to listen to people approaching retirement in two or three years who did not want to stop working.  Many women at those meetings said this was the second time they had experienced this type of discrimination because until 1973 they had to retire from the public sector on getting married.  The women at my public meetings said they were being discriminated against twice because they will have to retire again at 65, as they did when they got married.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are denying people&rsquo;s human rights by not allowing them to work after 65 years of age.  Why can TDs and Senators keep their jobs after 65 years of age?  Two laws need to be changed.</P>

	<P>There are two pieces of legislation, one for the public sector and one for the private sector.  However, the people who make the legislation do not have to retire at 65 years of age.  Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae is 76 so we should get on with this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments, which were interesting as always.  Some politicians must retire well before 65 due to the whims of the public and as a first-time Senator I hope I am not subject to that law.  I also welcome Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments on the marriage bar and I agree with her that a terrible injustice was done.  It is terrible to think people will experience discrimination twice by being forced to retire when they would have liked to continue working.</P>
        <P>We are making these comments against the background of this morning&rsquo;s report about the disparity in the work contributions of men and women.  I heard that women work on average between 30 and 40 minutes more per day and this amounts to a month more work per annum.  As I have said before, when we discuss the interaction of home life and work life the key determining issue is the choice of the individuals involved.  People have different aspirations in life and I am wary of a one-size-fits-all approach or a gender war approach that would insist men and women have the same experiences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding work in the home, it is up to families to decide who will be the primary care giver and who will be the primary breadwinner.  Anecdotal and statistical evidence suggests many women want flexibility in the workplace to allow them the option of working part-time, in addition to, in many cases, taking a preferred greater share of home duties.  Men need to be <Col N="345"/>educated about this and the area is a work in progress but things are better than they used to be in terms of the participation of men in home life.</P>
        <P>We can draw a parallel between how people of working age balance home life and work life and the issue of retirement.  There are demographic reasons the formal age of retirement may be pushed outwards but we must aspire to empower people in their individual decisions.  Some people will want to continue working well after the age of 65 and politicians are frequently among that group, but there are also people who look forward to retirement.  These people may have made a huge contribution to society and seek to retire for health or other reasons.  It is important that we do not saddle an older generation with duties deriving from society&rsquo;s economic imperatives.  We must always have regard for the contributions people have made over many years to the well-being of society in terms of raising families, the transmission of positive values and the economic development of the country.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and listened with interest to what she said.  There is a great danger in society that we might view the growing number of older persons as a demographic time bomb.  I may need to re-examine the statements of Dr. Brady of University College Dublin on an &ldquo;age quake&rdquo;.  I join Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill and the Irish Gerontological Society in warning against an apocalyptic approach to demographics that presents the growth in the number of older persons in society as a problem.  We must move from thinking in terms of a demographic time bomb to thinking in terms of a demographic dividend that allows for the huge contribution older people made in the past, are making and will make in the future.  They contribute not only to the fabric of life but also to the economy.</P>
        <P>As a symbolic example of what I speak of, two concerts were held in Dublin last weekend, by Leonard Cohen and Neil Diamond, and over 100,000 people attended.  I was at the Neil Diamond concert, as was a retired Taoiseach who got a big cheer when the camera panned on to him.  This is an example of older people being very active in society to the huge cultural benefit of us all.  Many older people actively enjoyed and participated in those concerts and I do not mean that in a patronising sense but merely as an example of the great importance of the participation of older people in society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very interested in the views of the Irish Gerontological Society because in a recent response to the Green Paper on pensions it expressed concern that the ten-year framework social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, failed to give as strong a prominence to intergenerational ties and solidarity as the United Nations did.  The Green Paper on pensions refers to intergenerational fairness and equity but that is in the narrow context of raising the pension age and offers a limited, one-way perspective.  There would need to be a two-way perspective on intergenerational solidarity.  The report of the National Economic and Social Council comments on solidarity, I note, but not specifically in an intergenerational context.  It is in that context that the Irish Gerontological Society goes on to critique apocalyptic demography, as well as the misapplication of the concept of dependency and oversimplified classifications of older people as dependent, rather in the way that children are classified as such.  It describes this as a vexing tendency.  It goes on to note the many hidden ways in which older people contribute to the economy, particularly the fact that private transfers &mdash; including education funding and bequests, among a range of others &mdash; substantially offset public funds that are directed towards older people.  It mentions the fact, rightly, that older people contribute to their own care financially over and above their entitlements and talks about the number of older people who are actively involved as care givers.  It is therefore important that in all our debates about practical economic issues &mdash; there is nothing more practical and economic than a debate on pensions &mdash; that we pursue a vision of society that prioritises intergenerational solidarity and an awareness and respect for the cultural and practical contribution being made <Col N="346"/>by older people in society, as opposed to focusing on older people as being in various states of dependency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many older people who have particular needs.  I would like to mention to the Minister of State, who might have a word with her colleagues in Government, an amendment I tabled to the Broadcasting Bill on Committee State with regard to the establishment of a heritage television channel.  The focus in Towards 2016 is on life cycle.  If we are to have provision for niche but worthwhile areas such as an Irish film channel or a Houses of the Oireachtas channel, why should we not have a television channel that would focus on the life cycle or life span and particularly on the needs of older persons?  I will continue to advocate this.  I suggested that such a channel would provide programming that at the moment we have only in spots.  It should be possible to have one channel which, throughout the day, would show documentaries and programmes drawing on our considerable archival material or showcasing Irish tradition and culture.  It would have programmes focused on the interests, needs and tastes of older people.  I would be careful of confining it to older people because such a channel would  be also of interest to the Irish abroad, tourists and others interested in heritage and culture.  I am aware of the fact that there are more than 25,000 people in nursing homes.  I have experience of visiting nursing homes and I wondered why those living there must watch &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>I salute our older people, who have made an important contribution to Ireland during their working lives and their retirement.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to the House.  She is making a major difference to older people.  The appointment of a Minister of State for older persons to deal with legislation and with problems that arise for older people demonstrates the importance of older people to the Government.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>We must allow older people to stay at home for as long as possible.  This is the most important role we as a Government can play in ensuring that people are able to enjoy the surroundings they are used to and in which they are happy.  This is where the important role of the carer comes into play.  Carers play a major role in this regard.  We have not yet understood the importance of carers.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the role of the carer and how economical it is.</P>
        <P>In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown we have a number of fine establishments for the elderly, including Leopardstown Park Hospital.  We should be proud of the work we have done in this regard.  All Governments over the years have done much to promote better standards for the elderly.  I am sure the Minister of State during her term in office will be responsible for further improvements in this regard.  Many voluntary organisations provide extra services, which is the key to the future.  No government in the world would be able to provide total funding for the elderly.  Senator Mullen put his finger on it when he stated that elderly people have a major ability to deliver services when they retire.  Retirement should not be forced.  That is important.</P>
        <P>We must end ageism, which is a state of mind for some people.  Most people of retirement age have much experience, which we tend to ignore, and they are not given the chance to develop in their later lives.  The right to work and decent entitlements are also important.  Facilities such as public seating are very important in our towns and cities.  Older people need to rest from time to time.  Choice in housing, which was mentioned by the Minister of State, is important.  We must make sure when providing housing for the elderly that it is in good, mixed developments where young children, younger people and older people can mix.  Older people also need equal health care and the right to be angry, if necessary.  Taxation and benefits should be integrated in order that aged people do not have to spend their time begging for a whole range of funding to cover specific needs.  That is one of the basic rights.</P>
        <P>Large sums are spent on care homes for people who would have been able to live pleasantly near their families.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen used the words &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; and &ldquo;choice&rdquo; in his contribution.  People must have choices.  In terms of an official retirement age of 65, the word &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; should be abolished from the vocabulary.  Members of society do not talk about retirement in that sense today.  There is a major disconnect between the official retirement age and society at large in terms of the vast experience of people.  If people are healthy, strong and want to stay on in their jobs and make a further contribution, they should not be denied that option.  However, I acknowledge that there are many vulnerable people.  The Government has acknowledged that and given a commitment to provide for these people in terms of the budgetary allocation for home care packages, the increased provision in the home help service, provision for palliative care and access to nursing homes.  I welcome the fair deal concept.  I hope it is introduced as it would help to change the perception in regard to nursing homes being affordable, accessible and those who are vulnerable would have less anxiety about their health care. </P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two prongs to the Minister of State&rsquo;s work in this area, to which I know she is very committed.  Those who are healthy and able should be allowed to stay on in their jobs, while those who are vulnerable and unhealthy must have access to all the help we can give them.  The decision to retire or to remain in the workplace should be left to the individual concerned and we should revisit the issue of the compulsory retirement age.  There is a disconnect between that notion and the society&rsquo;s view of it.  There are anti-wrinkle creams and new approaches to life and I do not see why we should not accept that is the way life is now.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, we have a Celtic tiger economy.  Compared to the older generation, who as young people went to work at the age of 14, 15 or 16 years, young people today have a longer adolescence period, so to speak, in that they do not begin work proper until the age of 25, 26 or 27.  Many people, therefore, do not take up permanent work until they are 30 and they are supposed to retire at 60 or 65.  That is a crazy system and it cannot work given the approach to life today.  We must have an open approach to retirement.  If one is healthy, well and able to do one&rsquo;s job, one should be allowed to continue in work.  People will know when they are slowing down.</P>

        <P>I will chair the annual conference of the Institute of Public Health Nurses that will be held in Croke Park tomorrow.  The issue of the elderly and many of the concerns raised in this debate will form part of the discussion at the conference.  I would have liked the Minister of State to attend but I appreciate she cannot be everywhere.  I will inform her of the discussion that takes place there.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work she has done and wish her well in her work.  There is much more to be done in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have been present for most of the debate which has been very worthwhile.  </P>
        <P>I wish to raise a number of points, most of which have been touched on by previous speakers.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Ormonde in regard to the retirement age. There is an urgent need for the Government to examine the stereotypes and rules that have surrounded retirement for many years.  In general, people nowadays enjoy much better health, both physically and mentally, for much longer than was the case for people in the past.  Many people today would warmly welcome the opportunity of being able to remain in employment after the traditional retirement age.  I would welcome a change in that respect.  I would also welcome a broad-ranging discussion, particularly on this important issue, with those groups who represent elderly people.</P>
        <P>I also want to raise the issue of transport.  The Minister of State represents a rural constituency, as do I.  One of the main obstacles facing people of all ages, but particularly older people &mdash; many of whom might not have transport of their own &mdash; is the lack of sufficient transport facilities.  Strides have been made in the provision of services.  In some of the larger towns, groups have been set up to provide a transport service from the outlying regions to the centre once or twice a week, but that level of service is not sufficient.  I would welcome a significant improvement in that regard in the very near future.  I am thinking in particular of the provision of feeder buses to main transport routes.  A number of national primary routes pass through my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny on which there are scheduled bus services. However, for people who live in villages a few miles from those routes, the transport service available to them is virtually non-existent.  If we are serious about tackling the problems older people face, we need to address this issue because one of the main problems they face is isolation, particularly in rural, but also in urban, areas.  The is a physical gap between where people live and where they wish to go to obtain services.  I would welcome a significant improvement in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise the issue of the fair deal plan, which was also raised by Senator Mary White.  She said she was disappointed that it seems to have been shelved.  I echo her comments.  In 2006, a commitment was given by the Minister for Health and Children that this plan would come into play.  We were told last year it would be introduced within a matter of months, but we are half way through 2008 and it seems to have dropped off the radar.  As I stated on the Order of Business this morning, the economy is not as strong as it has been for the past 15 years.  Those people who are now retired stayed in this country and kept the economy ticking over when we had very little.  We owe them a debt of gratitude.  The least we owe them is a fair deal &mdash; a self-explanatory phrase in the title of that scheme &mdash; in their twilight years.</P>
        <P>I believe this is an appropriate forum in which to raise the following matter.  When difficulties arose in regard to the charging of residents in nursing homes a number of years ago, the nursing homes refund scheme was established.  Many residents in public nursing homes were refunded.  However, I have been presented with a case which I believe is representative of 3,000 other cases across the country.  I refer to the case of elderly relatives who moved to live in private nursing homes merely because there was no public nursing home option available in the area <Col N="350"/>in which they lived.  The majority if not all of those people do not fall under the remit of the refund scheme.  That is a disgrace.  The case with which I am familiar is that of a family who did not have great resources.  The elderly woman in question, who has since deceased, moved into a private nursing home.  Her family scraped for years, in the absence of a public facility, to pay for this private accommodation.  Now they are told they do not qualify for a refund.  It is a disgrace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June, 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">The resolution before the House seeks approval for the continuance in operation of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation after 30 June next.  This legislation was enacted in the aftermath of the atrocity in Omagh, the tenth anniversary of which is fast approaching.  This was a dreadful act which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others.  The attack at Omagh was designed for no other purpose than to undermine the fledgling peace process.  It failed completely in that aim.  Ten years later, we can reflect on the great strides that have been made in normalising politics in Northern Ireland, the successful partnership in the devolved Executive and an ever closer North-South relationship.</P>
        <P>The circumstances which surrounded the enactment of the 1998 Act were exceptional.  It was thought prudent, therefore, that the continued necessity for certain sections should be reviewed at intervals by the Oireachtas.  It falls to this House and to the D&aacute;il to decide whether the present circumstances justify their continued operation.  Unfortunately, I must contend that the circumstances are not such as to allow us to dispense with these measures.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To support the consideration by the Seanad of the necessity for the renewal of the relevant sections of the Act, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is required to lay a report on their operation before both Houses prior to the resolution being moved.  This report, which was laid before the House on 13 June 2008, covers the period since the last such report was prepared in April 2007.  The clear lesson to be drawn from the report is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act have been of significant value to the Garda in tackling the threat from terrorism.  The inevitable conclusion is that they should remain in operation for a further 12 months.  The Garda authorities consider that the Act continues to be a vital legislative tool in the continuing fight against terrorism.</P>
        <P>Although progress has been made within Northern Ireland and the Provisional IRA is committed to following the political path, there remains a real and ongoing threat from a variety of dissident republican groups.  We should not be complacent or presume the success of the peace process has somehow removed this threat.  There have been several attempts recently to kill members of the PSNI, including two shootings of off-duty officers in November last year and a car bomb attack in Tyrone last month.  Last weekend, several PSNI officers had a lucky escape when a landmine, placed by the Continuity IRA, failed to explode fully.</P>
        <P>It is not surprising, therefore, that the 18th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, published on 1 May 2008, makes clear that the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA, the group styling itself &ldquo;&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and the INLA all remain committed to violent <Col N="351"/>paramilitary action in pursuit of their ends.  These groups continue to seek to acquire and manufacture weapons, to plant explosive devices and to target members of the security forces.</P>
        <P>Lest we should assume these groups are involved in some noble cause for Irish freedom, let us not forget the terrible acts they have perpetrated, including Omagh, which gave rise to the necessity for this legislation.  Let us not forget either the clear evidence, as recorded by the Independent Monitoring Commission, of the ongoing involvement of these organisations in other serious criminal activities, including extortion, drug dealing and brothel keeping.  These criminal activities are carried out as much for personal gain and to support particular individual lifestyles.  There is also speculation that the terrorist expertise of these groups has been sought in some cases by organised criminal gangs.  I am assured the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue actively to counter such attempts.</P>
        <P>These anti-democratic groups remain active and determined in their opposition to peace and the rule of law.  The importance of these legislative provisions in thwarting their activities should not be underestimated.  However, the response to the threat posed by terrorism, or any form of crime, should be proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.  Part of this relates to the necessity to ensure continued respect for fundamental human rights.  In enforcing the law, the Garda must be conscious of this requirement.  The functions of the Garda, as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, include the protection of life and property and the vindication of the human rights of each individual.  In recognition of this, the Act also provides that a newly appointed member must make a declaration to discharge his or her duties with regard to human rights.  The agreed programme for Government contains a commitment to place a renewed emphasis within the Garda on the importance of upholding human rights standards.  Comprehensive and ongoing training and education for garda&iacute; incorporates elements related to human rights.  The force is more than capable of meeting the highest standards of human rights protection in the prevention and detection of terrorist and criminal acts.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, a report on the operation of the relevant sections since April 2007 has been laid before the House.  The report shows that section 2 was used on 80 occasions.  This section provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, an accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question, the court may draw such inferences as appear proper.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure; there must be some other evidence which points towards his or her guilt.</P>
        <P>Section 3 was used on 12 occasions.  This section provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, an accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.</P>
        <P>Section 4 was used on 13 occasions.  This section amends section 3 of the Offences against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  Specifically, &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; can include matters such as &ldquo;movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused&rdquo;.  This change simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 5 was used on 34 occasions.  This provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in certain circumstances in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The effect is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged, but did not do so.  That is a fair assumption on the <Col N="352"/>court&rsquo;s part.  As with section 2, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
        <P>Section 7 was used on 16 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.  Section 8 was used on 14 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  Section 9 was used on 127 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 10 was used on 12 occasions.  This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court.  In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his behalf.  In the reporting period in question, an extension was applied for in 12 cases; two were granted, charges resulted and convictions resulted in the two cases.</P>
        <P>Section 11 was used on 32 occasions.  This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge.  This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can be authorised only in circumstances where the judge is satisfied on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about that person&rsquo;s suspected participation in the offence.  Section 14 is, in effect, a procedural section which makes the offences created under sections 6 to 9 and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  The sum total of the uses of sections 6 to 9 and 12 was 157.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to those sections of the 1998 Act that were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 6, 12 and 17.  Section 6 creates the offence of directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939.  Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</P>
        <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property.  Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence under that Act, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence.  The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.  Although these sections were not used in the period under report, I am sure the House will agree that their continued availability is essential to an effective response to the threat from terrorist groups.</P><Col N="353"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the basis of the information set out in the report, it is clear that the 1998 Act continues to be an important element of the Garda response to the threat still posed by dangerous terrorist groups in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The ongoing threat presented by terrorist groups, particularly the dissident republican groups is clear.  Accordingly, I have to conclude that the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act should remain in operation for a further year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State has made the case for the resolution to extend the provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act.  The Government has at times downplayed the threat of terrorist activities.  The most notable example was the case of Paul Quinn, when the former Taoiseach stated, as did Sinn F&eacute;in, that this was a criminal matter and that the unfortunate Mr. Quinn was involved in certain acts of criminality.  He entirely downplayed the involvement of a terrorist organisation in the killing of this man.  However, the reports of the Garda and the PSNI clearly show the involvement of members or former members of the Provisional IRA in that atrocity.  It took some time for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to confirm the continued existence and structures of the IRA in operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will probably find more support on this side of the Seanad than on the Government side for this resolution.  Senator Walsh appeared to downplay the importance of this legislation this morning and suggested that we should be discussing other matters that occurred some years ago.  The Minister of State has my full support on this matter.  He has effectively laid out the case and the facts speak for themselves.  Let us consider a few examples.</P>
        <P>There was an incident in Bray in October 2002 and recently there was an appeal against convictions in that case.  The court heard at that time that the garda&iacute; had recovered a large quantity of Sinn F&eacute;in posters, including posters for the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy, Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, from a car in which they also found a stun gun, a CS gas cannister, a blue flashing light and a beacon.  They also found two pickaxe handles, a lump hammer, three portable radios, cable ties, balaclavas and a fake Garda jacket in the car.  Two of the men were dressed in fake Garda uniforms.</P>
        <P>The European police agency, Europol, report on the terrorist situation and trends in the EU in 2008 clearly shows there is a significant increase in activity by the Irish National Liberation Army.  Garda sources have indicated that this organisation has become embroiled in a number of violent disputes with criminal gangs in a battle over the control of drug dealing.  It is suspected of selling pipe bombs and military grenades to criminal gangs.  The report also adds that based on capability and intent, the threat from the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA is estimated to vary between moderate and substantial.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of incidents.  There was the recent incident where an off-duty police officer was injured by a booby trap car bomb in County Tyrone.  The PSNI Chief Constable has warned that dissident republicans remain a significant threat.  The Continuity IRA carried out a landmine attack near Roslea, County Fermanagh.  In February this year a Strabane man, Andrew Burns, was murdered and his body was found with gunshot wounds near a church in Doneyloop, County Donegal.  There was an alleged Real IRA plot to buy arms in eastern Europe.  The Real IRA shot an off-duty Catholic PSNI officer in his car on Bishop Street in Londonderry in November 2007.  There were other incidents.</P>
        <P>The case is made.  The continuing structures of the Provisional IRA and these other terrorist organisations, North and South, are still active.  It is self-evident that the legislation needs to be continued.  I hope Senator Walsh will agree with me on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House and wish him well in his new responsibilities since the change of Administration.  He has distinguished himself to date and I have no doubt will continue to do so.</P><Col N="354"/>
        <P>This legislation has been before the House for the past seven or eight years.  To some extent, it is a pity it is deemed necessary.  I accept that the justifiable outrage in regard to the terrible atrocity that was Omagh, where so many innocent people, children and adults, were savagely put to death, brought about the amendments to the Offences against the State Act.  The legislation raises issues which those involved in the criminal justice system are concerned to safeguard against to ensure there are no miscarriages of justice.  It is, therefore, appropriate that it be brought before the House on an annual basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have said in the past, it is my wish that we will reach a stage, in the not too distant future, when the Minister will be able to come to the House and say that in the opinion of the Government and the security authorities there is no longer a need to extend the provisions of the Act.  Of course, it is not just the dissident republican groups, even though the emphasis is on them.  They were involved in the terrible atrocity that was Omagh but there is also the threat, which is somewhat new, from international terrorism.  Some appalling atrocities have been committed in this decade which have made us all aware of the need to ensure the security forces and the legislative framework are in place to contest and meet the challenge in the interests of our people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While reference has not been made to it, I understand that some time ago there were a number of people in this State who were involved in the al-Qaeda terrorist group.  If the Minister of State is of a mind &mdash; he has stated he is &mdash; that there is a need to continue in force the provisions of the Offences against the State Act I am happy to support that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the comment from Senator Regan, I would have thought I made myself clear on the Order of Business this morning.  Omagh is an atrocity that all right-thinking people would condemn, so also are the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and many other atrocities during the Troubles.  The Dublin-Monaghan bombings, which involved the single biggest loss of life during that period, is a matter that has engaged me over many years.  An Oireachtas joint committee comprising Members from all parties examined the inquiries by the independent Mr. Justice Barron and heard various witnesses who came before it in regard to those atrocities.  Certain recommendations were made which have not been acted upon.  That does not reflect well on the Houses and that is the reason I called this morning for action to be taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was no doubt in the minds of any of the members of the committee &mdash; people may have had different views at the outset of those inquiries &mdash;  and there was common acceptance that collusion took place at a fairly widespread level in regard to many of the atrocities that occurred in Northern Ireland and in the Republic at that time and that there was definitely strong collusion involved in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  The view was that this went beyond the security forces and that it had to involve the Northern Ireland Office, which would have been working under the direct supervision and control of the security committee in Westminster.  There are people at senior level in the then Administration who were at least aware of what was going on and took no action to prevent it.  That is probably putting the most benign complexion on it.  It is particularly insidious when the State involves itself in atrocities of this nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would say to Senator Regan that his dismissive comment that this happened so many years ago as if it should be forgotten does a disservice to the families of those victims who have tried over the last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Those comments do a disservice to the families who have tried might and main to find some closure on this matter.  That has not, in effect, been forthcoming.  We have a duty, as elected representatives, if we are to follow in the footsteps of those who founded the State, to be as strong in our desire to preserve our sovereignty as they were and to find some closure for those families.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has gone through the various sections of the Bill which are part of the debate and has clearly defined the number of occasions on which they were used.  I and others have argued in previous debates on this issue that some of those provisions should have been used as a measure to combat the serious criminal activity in the State, such as murders, drugs and the gang culture which has evolved around the drug trade.</P>
        <P>I very much welcomed the introduction of a number of these measures into the criminal justice system in the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  There are others that have not been incorporated.  I urge the Minister and the Department to look at those if we consider and deem they are important measures to combat terrorism and the threat of terrorism and to act as a deterrent.  The corollary of that would be that they can be used in the same way against those who get involved in very serious criminal activity.  I am happy to state I support the continuation of these provisions.  My comments on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings in no way take from my revulsion at the Omagh bombing.  All such terrorism needs to be condemned and dealt with.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I declare my interest in this matter as I have represented people before the Special Criminal Court and have, therefore, worked with the provisions that are at issue in this motion.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to put on the record, as I think all of us have done, our condemnation of the dreadful atrocity that took place at Omagh and which, as the Minister of State has said, was the motivation behind the passing of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  All of us will remember only too well the appalling carnage that took place that day in Omagh and we would all condemn it equally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would, however, like to register my own observations and reservations about the continuing in force of provisions of the Offences against the State Acts and, in particular, about the continued existence of the Special Criminal Court.  Clearly the provisions at issue in this motion relate to the investigation and trial generally of scheduled offences, the trial of which will take place before that court.  As we are aware, in many respects, the provisions allow departure from general rules and procedures that apply in the conduct of criminal investigations and criminal trials before the other criminal courts.  In particular, serious encroachments on the right to silence are envisaged in the provisions at issue.  They have been subject to a great deal <Col N="356"/>of criticism not just from academics but also from practitioners and at international level.  I wish to put on record some of those criticisms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the 1970s Mary Robinson, who was previously a Senator in this House, produced a pamphlet about the operation of the Special Criminal Court on which she had done a good deal of research.  She expressed serious reservations about the use of a non-jury court to try particular offences.  Much more recently the report of the expert committee to examine the Offences against the State Acts again expressed reservations about aspects of the legislation.  There was strong dissent on the continued existence of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>I referred to international criticism.  In the Kavanagh case an international body criticised the referral of non-scheduled offences to the court by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There was a criticism of that power of referral.  Clearly, there has been a move in recent years to use the Special Criminal Court to try non-scheduled offences.  All of us would share great concern at the rise of so-called organised crime and the incidence of seriously violent crimes.  We would also all agree that more should be done for the victims of such crime.  I have done research on that area and have called for different ways of dealing with and providing support to victims that would greatly improve their experience of the criminal justice process.</P>
        <P>There are other ways of dealing with organised crime than to dispense with jury trial and to use the sort of procedures that are envisaged under the offences against the State legislation.  With less extreme variations we could apply the ordinary criminal justice code to organised crime in the way we have seen in the United States in the trials of organised crime, racketeering etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should have a debate on the matter.  The main point is that the motion should not go through on the nod.  We should not be in the business of simply rubber-stamping the continued existence of the provisions for a further 12 months without serious consideration in particular of the provisions that have not been used.  The Minister of State indicated that sections 6, 12 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act were not used in the period April 2007 to April 2008.  If the provisions are not being used we must query why we are asked to continue their existence for another year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for sharing her time with me.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
        <P>It is ten years since the legislation was first enacted.  We can all remember where we were when the horrors of that day in Omagh unfolded.  It was particularly horrible because at that time we were very hopeful that the situation in the North could be resolved.  People were concerned about whether we could make a breakthrough and achieve peace but ten years on the situation has improved dramatically.  As a result, legislation such as this has become less necessary.</P>
        <P>While my party will not oppose the passing of the legislation today we will put down a marker for future years such that any special measures contained in the legislation have to be justified and cannot just be passed on the nod, so to speak.  Given the improving political situation we would expect less requirement for these measures.  I ask the mandarins in the Department to consider whether it will be necessary to renew all of the clauses next year.  On this occasion we will be supportive of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to speak for long as I just want to comment on the unfortunate situation that requires the legislation to be in place.  We would much rather that the situation had moved on far more significantly than is the case.  I echo the feeling expressed by Members in both Houses that we look forward to the day when we do not need <Col N="357"/>this type of legislation.  It would be remiss of me not to make a contribution on the basis that three of my constituents were involved in the Omagh bombing and two of their Spanish friends were also killed.  That event has touched our community very deeply and we empathise and sympathise with the families of the more than 3,000 other people who died in the Troubles.</P>
        <P>We want to move on with peace.  We do not want terrorist activity in the form of fuel laundering, drug dealing or anything else that is disguised as something other than what it is.  I would like to see an end to all criminal activity with a terrorism background.  We all have a role to play in ensuring there is no place for criminals to hide.  I strongly advocate that people continue to come forward to the police, North and South, with any information they have on current or past events.</P>
        <P>In the course of a debate the question was asked about whether the Omagh bombing or the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were more important.  All such death is wrong.  All those events were beyond tragic and anyone who has information on them should come forward, even at this stage.</P>
        <P>I trust this legislation will not be needed in the very near future.  I know the consequences of the actions in my area and I want to see the better Ireland heralded by the Good Friday Agreement for which people voted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>As with other speakers there is regret at the necessity for legislation of this type because its existence presumes a victory on the part of those who engage in terrorism and seek to use it as a political weapon.  The Government has chosen to renew the legislation annually since the original passage of the Act.  There is consensus in the House that this should be the case.  A wider debate needs to take place on the circumstances that would obviate the need for the future existence of the legislation.  It is clear that the terrorist threat that has existed in this jurisdiction is reduced although it continues to be potent.  We should have a wider debate on why we should have the legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that in the neighbouring jurisdiction there is a debate on legislation to deal with international terrorism and its effect on civil liberties.  It is ironic that the focus of the debate there is on periods of detention and methods of using evidence that are far more draconian than those included in the Act.  While we have suffered greatly at the hands of terrorism, we should be grateful that in terms of its limits on civil liberty the legislation is far less draconian than it could be.  The very mechanism that allows it to be introduced annually on the basis of a report to Government and a Government decision on whether it should be continued is a safeguard that we do not find in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State indicate in his response whether the Government is considering the scenarios that might develop when we no longer need an Offences against the State Act?  I fear that the bogey of terrorism we have experienced on this island over a 40-year period and that exists internationally through other threats is a convenient excuse for those who want to have the strictest possible laws and who want to feel good about themselves by so doing rather than dealing with the nature of the problems.  I refer, for example, to why terrorism exists in the first place and how it can be diminished in society.  The fear is that if we continue to have such legislation there will be a rolling justification for some type of terrorism activity and for some people involved in terrorism to justify the continued existence of the legislation.  Those of us who believe in a safe, democratic society founded on civil liberties yearn for the day when legislation of this type is removed from the Statute Book.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for their support for the motion, especially Senator Regan of Fine Gael.  Earlier this week I attended a conference attended by the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna <Col N="358"/>Murphy, and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, Sir Hugh Orde.  It is clear from those discussions that the threat posed by dissident republican groups is very serious.  The threats are very real for many of the officers from both the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who attended the conference.  It is particularly true for PSNI officers who continue to be targeted by these dissident republican groups.</P>
        <P>On that occasion I made it very clear, as did the Deputy First Minister for the North, Martin McGuinness &mdash; some may find that ironic &mdash; that no quarter would be given to these dissident republicans in their continued efforts to destabilise the peace that is now well established on the island.  They will be ruthlessly pursued and hunted down.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and PSNI have an extraordinarily high level of co-operation on this matter.  It is fair to say that the level of co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI has never been higher.  It would be a terrible mistake on our part to relinquish these powers in the belief that we were living in an idealised world as a result of the peace process that unfolded from the first IRA ceasefire in 1994.  Some very dangerous individuals are involved in the dissident organisations.  They are concentrated in particular parts of the Border area and we need to be very vigilant in continuing to be able to address the threat they pose.  I instanced the number of attacks that have been conducted to date.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik stated that some of the powers have not been used.  I would emphasise they have not been used during this particular one-year review of the legislation.  However, they have been used in previous successful prosecutions.  Notably section 6 was used in previous years to secure the prosecution and conviction of Michael McKevitt, the undoubted leader of one of those terrorist organisations.  It would be somewhat presumptuous to assume we should relinquish the section 6 power which specifies an offence of directing the activities of an organisation.  It would be rather foolish to relinquish that section on civil liberties grounds at the urging of Senator Bacik on the basis that it has not been used in the past year.  The only time it was used, it was used very effectively against one of the biggest figures in the dissident republican movement.  It is not a time for complacency.</P>
        <P>While we have this domestic threat on the island, there has been a very significant presence, especially prior to 11 September 2001, of significant individuals, one of whom was a neighbour of mine, living literally down the road from where I live in Dublin, who were intimately involved in the logistical support for the operations on 11 September 2001.  Considering the international threat posed by al-Qaeda and others, unfortunately the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na still needs these special powers.  Like Senator Bacik I would love to see the value of basic civil liberties being optimised in a world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which was free of terrorist threat.  However, we do not live in such a world, even on the island of Ireland.  It is very important that these powers be renewed for another year.  As Senator Bacik pointed out it is important to have a debate on these matters on an annual basis.  Some of the sections have not been used, including section 17 as she mentioned.  There simply has not been an occasion to use that provision which specifies forfeiture.  However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has other legal powers if it wishes to pursue a route of forfeiture of assets that may be used in the commission of these kinds of offences.  I thank Members for their support.  I listened closely to what Senator Bacik said as a lawyer involved in the human rights area.  However, I emphasise that we live in a real world and not in the arid, academic world of human rights law.</P>

        <P>Senator Regan made a very serious point about Paul Quinn&rsquo;s murder.  That is the subject of proceedings at the moment.  The Independent Monitoring Commission&rsquo;s report indicated strongly that while individuals from the Provisional IRA were involved in that heinous attack, they were not in any way acting in an official capacity representing the IRA on that occasion.  That is the clear message.  We take great sustenance from the fact that the Provisional IRA has been stood down.  All the intelligence reports indicate to the Government and to other governments that the organisation is now in a real sense redundant and not in existence in operational terms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter of great significance.  What I refer to is a systematic violation of the human and constitutional rights of an Irish citizen in which, regrettably, through cowardice, protection of their own sectional interests or sheer incompetence various agencies of this State, including the Garda fraud squad and the Minister&rsquo;s Department, can be clearly shown to have colluded.  I have a considerable volume of documentary evidence.  I have taken a good deal of time to examine this material and will present to the House an outline picture of the facts as they are contained therein.  This will of necessity be sketchy due to the limited time at my disposal but all the supporting documentation is in my possession and I will be happy to make it available to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the centre of these events is my correspondent whom I shall describe according to the convention of these debates as &ldquo;M&rdquo;.  With a terrier-like investigative mind M has been very successful in business.  Between 1980 and 1990 he developed and expanded the Small Firms Association very effectively.  Among his objectives was the establishment of proper, honourable and decent standards in government, semi-State business and banks.  His work between 1990 and 1992, which demonstrated that the major Irish banks had systematically over charged their customers, was highly unpopular, as one can imagine, in those commercial circles.  We now know that M was correct in his analysis and what he exposed was but the tip of the iceberg.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1992 he helped to establish ISME.  During the start-up period M agreed to operate without an agreed salary.  As is often the case in enterprises such as this, during the initial period there was a certain amount of <i>ad hoc</i> activity and improvisation, although nothing illegal or fraudulent.  However these circumstances were to provide fertile ground when personality differences emerged between my correspondent, M, and a member of the board of directors, whom I shall denominate as &ldquo;H&rdquo;.  Over the ensuing years H launched seven charges of fraud against M, the first and most trivial being that he had fraudulently charged a business suit to expenses.  This <Col N="360"/>was investigated and dismissed.  The second was much more serious, an allegation of fraud involving &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The auditor to the company was a firm called Doody Crowley.  It had been instructed by the company to provide for a &euro;20,000 bonus in the 1996 accounts.  On 30 June 1998 M was requested to resign and offered a &euro;100,000 inducement to go.  He refused. The national council of ISME established a committee to examine the charges against M.  On 8 October 1998 it reported that there was no fraud by M.  In November 1998 the board of directors resigned except for three members including one I shall denominate as DC, whose evidence I have before me.  It states that he chaired the ISME meeting in April 1997 during which the board was informed of and approved the payment of the 1996 bonus of &euro;20,000 to M.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the auditor, Doody Crowley, refused to falsify the accounts by removing the agreement to the &euro;20,000 bonus, it was fired and a new auditor was appointed, which was not informed that the books had already been audited.  DC believed that he was removed from the board of ISME on 4 March 1999 because he was opposed to the removal of M on false charges and it was known that he would have opposed the alteration of the accounts.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>These actions are all of a very nasty nature and worthy of a criminal investigation.  M was framed and in the framing process the accounts were fraudulently altered.  However, this is but the trailer to the big event.  This State has been the happy recipient of significant amounts of European Union funding.  In the late 1990s ISME was involved in just such a fund.  It was fairly commonplace for an organisation such as ISME to put in invoices to European funding agencies in advance, receive the money and pay out as work was completed.  This was regarded as poor practice and open to fraud.  In 1997 the European Commission introduced a &ldquo;sound efficient management&rdquo; programme which insisted upon best practice audit procedures to prevent the kind of crude budgeting that was standard practice up until then in Ireland.  In other words, incurring expenditures could not be projected forward and had to be actually incurred.</P>
      
        <P>In October 1997, member states agreed to automatic penalties if they were found to have breached those terms.  On 14 November 1997, member states agreed the new Regulation 2064/97 to require them to confirm that as of 30 June 1998 they were observing this procedure.  This required them to confirm that eligible invoices were checked against bank statements to ensure that invoices were paid before EU funds were allocated.  This regulation contained the possibility that it would apply retrospectively to 1994.</P>
        <P>There were obvious difficulties in this mission and the Department of Finance gave Arthur Andersen a brief to review the situation.  It replied with a devastating criticism of Irish procedures asserting that, first, compliance with EU regulation was vaguely assumed, second, EU expenditures had been signed blind, third, Department of Finance officials had failed to meet EU audit officials on preplanned audit visits, fourth, overlapping, that is, double charging, was possibly widespread as there was no way of knowing that overlapping had not happened and, fifth, compliance with EU regulations was ineffective and haphazard.</P>
        <P>In response to these criticisms, the Department of Finance acted by instructing all spending Departments to confirm compliance with the aforementioned EU regulation in order to avoid financial penalties.  This confirmation was nonsense, especially when applied retrospectively.  None of the spending Departments had confirmed compliance, as was obligatory, by January 1999 and as a result the Department of Finance failed to confirm to the European Commission that it was observing the regulations on 30 June 1998 as required.</P>
        <P>In May 2000, in an effort to fudge statements, the Department of Finance wrote to all Departments finessing the word &ldquo;observed&rdquo; so that, in effect, the regulation merely had to be <Col N="361"/>circulated to comply.  In 2000, the European Commission undertook a systems audit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and in April 2001 reported that that Department had systematically maladministered EU funds.  The total funds involved in Ireland amounted to &euro;9 billion.</P>
        <P>Acting on this, Mr. Grey, deputy head DG Budget in the European Commission, insisted Ireland must confirm compliance with the regulation retrospective to 1994 or face the automatic penalty set in place under the SEM programme.  If compliance was not forthcoming the likely penalty was in excess of &euro;400 million.  The result was panic.  Departments retained consultants to assist in fudging audit trails back to 1994.  In fact, retrospective legislation is repugnant to the Irish Constitution but on 18 June 2002 a Government decision was secured ratifying the retrospection and in any case Brussels indicated that these kinds of directives superseded the Irish Constitution.</P>
        <P>Ireland was not alone.  In January 2001, the British Minister, Alan Johnson, complained about the impugned Regulation 2064/97 and put on the record of the House of Commons that the retrospective aspects of this directive had been rescinded on 10 October 2000.  However, this did not prevent the EU from insisting that Ireland confirm retrospective compliance or face the penalty.  All this is essential background to the third and most damaging accusation that M was involved in fraud involving European Union funds and their draw down.  ISME did in fact draw down three invoices but M was not involved in the draw down or expenditure of the funds.  This did not prevent his rival on the board making allegations of criminal fraud to the fraud squad.</P>
        <P>Having been implicated, M went on many occasions to the offices of the fraud squad in Harcourt Square to attempt to clear his name.  He mortgaged his house in order to help him restore his reputation as he was left with virtually no income at the time.  He suffered a stress-related stroke which put him out of action for some time.  Members of the fraud squad harangued him, made misleading statements to him and denied being in possession of knowledge which it subsequently turned out they did have.  All this is documented in detail and is available to the Minister.  Questions were asked in the other House by Deputies Quinn, Hogan, Cuffe and Deenihan.  These questions were met with stalling replies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2004, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, in reply to a question from Deputy Quinn, stated that her Department &ldquo;was not aware of the basis on which the organisation that made the allegations formed the view that a possible fraud had taken place&rdquo;.  This is despite the fact that ISME had complained to the fraud squad and written to the Department complaining about the unpaid invoices and offering repayment.</P>
        <P>On 29 January 1999 and on 26 April 1999 the Department in a statement to garda&iacute; dealt specifically with the matter of the unpaid invoices.  Not only that, but it was in possession of an interdepartmental memo which was circulated as a result of an inquiry and which stated clearly that not only was there no fraud but there was no irregularity.  The only reason this memo was suppressed and not made available to M as a result of his inquiries must have been to avoid the embarrassment and the possible imposition of a multimillion euro fine by the EU.  I have a copy of that memo in my hand.</P>
        <P>Concern for the welfare of the economy and taxpayers&rsquo; money may be admirable but it must be done within the law.  The constitutional requirement that the State should guarantee and vindicate the good name of the citizen has been very seriously violated in this matter.  I require an explanation, as well as a full and public apology and compensation on behalf of the applicant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Acting Chairman and the House for the delay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want, at the outset of my response to Senator Norris, to make it clear to the House that my Department did not make any allegations against the individual involved and never sought to question his good name.  These matters have been the subject of a number of parliamentary questions in the Dail and the position of my Department has been fully explained, most recently in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 690 of 30 January 2008.  In that reply, the then Minister reconfirmed that neither he nor the Department had any issue or concern to pursue with the individual, who had been so advised in writing.</P>
        <P>In order to help understand the concerns of the individual, I am happy to outline briefly the background to the case to the House.  In June 1996, my Department approved grant assistance of 104,000 ECUs or about IR&pound;83,000 under the EU-funded small business operational programme for a project proposed by the organisation concerned.  In accordance with the normal procedures for the relevant measure, an initial grant of 50% of the total approved was made at that time, while a further grant of 30% was issued in September 1997, following the submission of a progress report on the project by the organisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 29 January 1999, the organisation wrote to the Department advising it that it appeared to the organisation that it had received an over payment from the Department in respect of expenses amounting to IR&pound;16,500 on foot of which a grant had been paid at the rate of 75%.  At a meeting with the Department on 5 March 1999 to discuss this matter, the Department was advised by the organisation that it had decided to alert the Garda fraud squad to suspected irregularities in regard to the claims submitted to the Department for funding for the project arising from the organisation&rsquo;s concerns about invoices in the amount of IR&pound;16,500 received from a supplier of services to it.</P>
        <P>The Department was advised that the organisation&rsquo;s auditors had also been informed about the matter and that the Department would be kept informed about developments.  At that stage, the Department suspended any further payments in respect of this project pending the conclusion of the investigations into the matter.  The Department subsequently co-operated fully with the fraud squad.</P>
        <P>On 23 June 2000, the organisation wrote to the Department and confirmed that an extensive investigation by its auditors had found no evidence of fraud and that, following a fraud squad investigation, a file had been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who had decided there were no grounds for action.  The organisation indicated that it had accepted the results of these investigations and, accordingly, the invoices which had been the subject of the investigations were paid by the organisation on 23 June 2000.</P>
        <P>Since 1999 there have been very extensive contacts, both direct and indirect, between the Department and the individual concerned.  These contacts have included the following: 24 freedom of information requests; copious correspondence; a number of meetings between the individual and various officers of the Department; ministerial representations from others on behalf of the individual; and numerous parliamentary questions about his situation.  It is estimated that over the course of the past nine years the individual has submitted in excess of 100 e-mails, letters, phone calls and so on in regard to this matter to a wide variety of officers throughout the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the various freedom of information requests, the Department has endeavoured to assist him both within the constraints of the Act and outside the Act.  He has been granted access to all relevant records that are held in the Department concerning the issue.  In addition, he has met a number of officials in the Department on different occasions, who have given him an opportunity to view all relevant files that relate to his various freedom of infor<Col N="363"/>mation requests.  Despite this, he wrote to the Information Commissioner in 2004 in regard to the Department&rsquo;s handling of his various freedom of information requests.  While not part of her binding decision of 7 March 2007, the Information Commissioner in her reply commended the Department for the way in which it had co-operated with her office during the review, including examining pre-commencement records where no right of access had been established and providing access to records outside of freedom of information legislation.</P>
        <P>Following an approach on behalf of the individual in 2004, the then Secretary General issued a letter that closely followed a draft submitted by the individual concerned, which he wanted the Department to issue.  The Department considered this draft very carefully and the then Secretary General responded on 18 October 2004.  This letter was a final attempt to satisfy the individual and made it clear that the Department had no issue with him.  I take this opportunity to read into the record of the House the text of this reply by the then Secretary General, without naming the individual or the organisation involved:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department acknowledges your sustained written and mobile communication, particularly since August 2003.  You contend that the relevant Department files demonstrate that there was never any basis for the allegation which led to the deployment of the Garda fraud squad in 1999.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department has now read all the files identified by you and confirms that there was never any evidence available to the Department to support any suggestion of &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; in respect of grants paid by the Department or collusion against the Department.  In this regard, the Department also recalls that an extensive investigation by [title of organisation deleted] auditors found no evidence of fraud while the Director of Public Prosecutions decided, on the basis of the file submitted by the Fraud Squad, that there were no grounds for action.  The Department was happy to accept the findings of these investigations.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department also wishes to confirm that it was not involved in substantiating the charge or in the subsequent calling in of the Fraud Squad and is happy to reject any suggestions to the contrary that may have been made in this regard.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department has, over a period of some 20 years, dealt with you in a variety of capacities.  The contacts were always of the highest probity.  The Department never had any evidence to suggest the contrary.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department believes that it has addressed the issues raised by you to the fullest extent possible and that the exchanges between us should now be considered closed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Despite this explanation, the Department&rsquo;s conclusion that the matter should be considered closed and the reconfirmation of the Department&rsquo;s position by the current Secretary General in May 2005, the individual continued to pursue the matter.  In the interim, the Department has devoted further resources in responding on the issue, <i>inter alia</i>, in the context of a further freedom of information request and parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il.  The House will appreciate that the Department has made a considerable effort to provide the individual with access to all relevant documents in regard to his position and to address the issues raised by him.</P>
        <P>For the avoidance of doubt, I again affirm that I am satisfied neither the T&aacute;naiste nor the Department has any issue or concern to pursue with the individual who has previously been advised to this effect in writing.  If it is helpful, I am happy to restate that the Department has over a period of some 20 years dealt with the individual in a variety of capacities.  The contacts were always of the highest probity.  The Department never had any evidence to suggest the contrary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am horrified by the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  If he thinks this matter is closed, he has another think coming because it most certainly is not.  Much of the material in his reply is simply untrue.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he Department has endeavoured to assist him both within the constraints of the Act and outside the Act.  He has been granted access to all relevant records.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is not true.  It is a lie.  In 2005, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, asked a series of questions and was given an answer on the matter.  Subsequently, an important memo, which I put on the record, was withheld from the person concerned.  That memo would have allowed him to clear his name.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department has colluded in the framing of an Irish citizen, has continued to violate his rights and has produced a lot of waffle to cover up the fact that it got itself into a serious situation.  If it had vindicated his human rights, it might have exposed itself to a significant fine.  That is what the matter is all about.  It is completely untrue to claim that the Department assisted in every way.  It withheld documents, prevented him from clearing his name and then washed its hands with this waffly statement.  I hope the person concerned, who is sitting in the Visitors Gallery, will be able to use what has been said today to raise a storm about this issue because it is not satisfactory that any Irish citizen should be subject to this kind of behaviour.</P>
        <P>Given the extraordinary and explosive nature of this story, I originally found it difficult to believe.  I confirmed it with Deputy Quinn who said that a catastrophic violation of an Irish citizen&rsquo;s human rights had taken place.  However, the Minister of State&rsquo;s pathetic answer has not advanced the matter whatsoever.  I do not mean that personally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for giving his time to discuss this issue.  Economic partnership agreements are the trade agreements put in place between the European Union and the 76 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which are jointly known as the ACP countries.  One in eight of the world&rsquo;s population lives in these countries, yet they have only 2% of the world&rsquo;s income.  The aims of the economic partnership agreements are to promote poverty reduction, sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the world economy.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we put the mechanisms in place and ensure they work properly if we are to achieve equality across people, nations and continents.  It is not clear, however, that the current regime will allow these goals to be achieved.  The EU intends signing a number of new agreements at the earliest opportunity and it wants the initial draft agreements already signed by 35 countries to be formalised by the end of July.  However, many people take the view that changes are needed to these draft documents before they are ready to be signed off.  Will the Minister of State support changes to the documents to make them more effective and to ensure the purposes of the trade agreements are achieved?</P>
        <P>The changes are needed for various reasons.  Concerns have been expressed about the matter as it currently stands.  For example, the draft agreements do not pass standard development tests.  It is questionable whether they integrate economies regionally.  The heads of a number of African states are concerned about this and want a review of the draft documents in front of the African Union before they are signed off in full.  It is also uncertain that the agreements <Col N="365"/>will help to develop new industries in ACP countries.  Concerns have been expressed that not enough is being done to promote economic diversification.</P>
        <P>The question also arises as to whether the agreements will provide full access to European markets.  As the EU&rsquo;s exacting standards go further than international requirements, African imports of cereals and dried fruit containing aflatoxins, which cause liver cancer, have reduced by 50%.  Statistics demonstrate, however, that only one life has been saved by this.  It must be asked, therefore, whether these exacting standards are causing more deaths from poverty and hunger than they are saving lives on this continent.</P>
        <P>The consensus is that the agreements will not deliver sufficient infrastructure in ACP countries.  I had dinner with the Niger Minister for Finance in advance of December&rsquo;s summit in Lisbon between EU and African leaders.  He expressed concern about the amount of funding being invested in infrastructure in his country.  One way of promoting equality and reducing poverty is to ensure countries have adequate infrastructure but more work needs to be done in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are some of the concerns being expressed in regard to the draft economic partnership agreements.  We all want to see them benefit the developing world.  Public opinion across Europe wants to make it easier for the Third World to develop, so we have to ensure the agreements do not adversely affect ACP countries.  Will the Minister of State agree to push for an independent impact assessment of the draft agreements and for the EU to adopt unilateral preference schemes so that a country does not suffer if it does not sign up to an agreement?  Will he restate firmly the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring we meet our target of 0.7% of gross domestic product in aid to the developing world?</P>

        <P>Increased trade is central to sustained economic growth in developing countries.  Trade, not just aid, is needed if the poorer countries are to escape from abject poverty.  Economic partnership agreements, EPAs, are a new type of multilateral agreement which seek to combine both trade and wider development issues in a unified framework.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members may be aware that EPA negotiations between the EU, represented by the European Commission, and six regional groupings of African Caribbean Pacific, ACP, countries began in September 2002.  The mandate for their negotiation came from the legally binding Cotonou Agreement.  The objective of economic and trade co-operation under this agreement is to foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy.  In this context, the EPA negotiations sought to achieve World Trade Organisation-compatible agreements by the expiry date of that organisation&rsquo;s waiver on 31 December last.  Following protracted and difficult negotiations, only one of the original regional groupings &mdash; the Caribbean group &mdash; agreed a full EPA with the European Commission.  Some 20 other ACP countries initialled interim agreements in smaller sub-groups or individually.  A positive aspect is that this meant that trade disruption was avoided.  The agreements provide full duty and quota-free market access on the EU side and a flexible and asymmetric liberalisation schedule on the ACP side.</P>
        <P>During the negotiation process, Ireland consistently maintained that EPA negotiations should result in agreements that are supportive of ACP countries&rsquo; development needs and their poverty reduction efforts.  That will continue to be our position.</P><Col N="366"/>
        <P>There is no doubt that EPAs which have been agreed offer opportunities for ACP countries.  Years of EU trade preferences did little to improve the economic development of such countries.  EPAs will put an end to ACP dependence on preferences, waivers and exclusions from the multilateral system.  This dependence helped lock these countries into basic commodity trade for more than 30 years.  In addition to duty and quota-free access, EPAs put in place simplified rules of origin.  These were specifically negotiated to support the development of ACP industries that import materials to make goods for onward export to Europe.  This is particularly beneficial in key sectors such as textiles, fisheries and agriculture.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the interim agreements will act as building blocks to full regional EPAs.  Regional integration allows efficiency gains through enlarged markets and increased competitiveness.  In recent years, most ACP regional organisations have proposed trade integration and customs unions.  Increased EU market access and support for regional integration through the EPAs is intended to bring about real trade growth and broad-based economic development in the ACP countries.</P>
        <P>In April the African Union Conference of Ministers of Trade and Finance adopted the Addis Ababa declaration on EPA negotiations.  This declaration reiterates that African EPA groups remain committed to conclude full development-oriented EPAs.  However, it also highlighted certain contentious issues in the interim EPA agreements.  The Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Peter Power, had this declaration in mind when he spoke on EPAs at the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27 May last.  The Minister of State underlined Ireland&rsquo;s position and stressed the need to acknowledge the concerns of our ACP partners and to be flexible in addressing them.  He was pleased that the Council acknowledged the existence of problematic issues.  The Council called on the European Commission to use all possible flexibility to take account of different needs and levels of development of the ACP countries and regions.</P>
        <P>Ireland recognises that if ACP countries are to take full advantage of the trading opportunities afforded by EPAs, greater and more effective trade-related assistance should be made available to them.  The EU has already pledged to increase collective Commission and member state expenditure in this area to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2010.  A large share of this increased expenditure will be devoted to the needs of ACP states.  Ireland emphasised at all stages in the negotiations that this expenditure is not dependent on the signature of EPAs.  Regional integration and EPAs entail adjustments and reforms in ACP economies and policies.  Ireland wants to play its part and is committed to increasing its funding for aid for trade initiatives in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development is continuing to monitor closely the ongoing EPA negotiations.  We want EPA agreements to be fair and balanced.  To this end, Ireland is supporting a partnership approach between the European Commission and ACP countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I am particularly glad that he is present because he has direct responsibility for the matter in question and I look forward to his reply.  I am sure the history of the Liberty House project and the relationship among the people who live there, Dublin City Council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be acknowledged in that reply.</P><Col N="367"/>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to briefly outline the history of the project and my understanding of the facts and explain why it is so important that a resolution be found and the project delivered.  Liberty House is a housing project located in a prominent and central part of my constituency.  The residents who live there and nearby have worked closely with Dublin City Council for many years to draw up a plan and a proposal they can all support.  As a city councillor, I was aware of and involved with many other regeneration and housing projects.  It was frequently the case that local communities wished to focus on particular matters but that the city council could not always deliver in respect of them.</P>
        <P>Since I became involved with the Liberty House project, I have been struck by the degree of consent and agreement that exists between the community and Dublin City Council in respect of the correct course to take.  When they approached the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government some years ago to obtain funding and to have the project greenlighted, support was not forthcoming.  The residents and, to a degree, Dublin City Council are now in limbo regarding the status of the project and the question of when people&rsquo;s housing needs will be met.</P>
        <P>I sought to raise this matter for two reasons.  As I have become involved with this issue in my community, what has struck me so much is how reasonable the involved residents are.  They articulate with such passion the frustration they have and the urgency of their position.  They have also said that if they can act to resolve the issue, they will.  I met with these people only this week, when they spoke of the number of actions they would like to take in order to bring the issue to resolution.</P>
        <P>Another facet that makes such an impression on me in raising this issue is the support and commitment from the city council in making this happen.  The constituency I represent has a number of housing projects that are currently in a state of emergency, as the Minister of State already knows.  All of them receive support and leadership from the city council but what is missing and what we are now appealing for is for the Department to help us understand where this project stands.  We urge the Minister of State to do everything possible to give a green light to the project and allow it to proceed so the reasonable and entirely understandable frustration of local residents in the community can be recognised and tackled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to underscore this in the environment we are in at the present economic uncertainty.  In the neighbourhood I represent there are many projects currently under pressure and I am concerned this project will not gain the prominence and focus it deserves.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister of State is here personally.  I ask him to update me on the view of the project from his Department and what he can do to deliver a green light to it and make it happen.  If there are outstanding issues, I ask that his Department set up a meeting with residents, the city council and local representatives so we can give this important and crucial project the resolution and success it needs.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this motion and giving me the opportunity to set out the position on this project.</P>
        <P>The remedial works programme for Liberty House, Railway Street, Dublin 1, is being dealt with by Dublin City Council on a phased basis.  Liberty House was built in the late 1930s and originally consisted of 181 flats.  The first proposals for its redevelopment were received over ten years ago.  The windows in the flats had already been renewed in 1994 under the window replacement programme.</P>
        <P>The first remedial phase involving blocks A, B and C was completed a number of years ago at a cost of &euro;11.4 million.  This involved general upgrading of the complex, internally and externally, the amalgamation of some units, works to internal and external walls, flooring, re-<Col N="368"/>roofing, general works to stairs and circulation areas, the provision of fire doors to create stair lobbies, chimney repairs, facade treatment, together with site development and landscaping works.  This first phase of works provided 86 refurbished units.</P>
        <P>The present proposal is for the redevelopment of blocks D, E and F and was received in March 2007.  It entails the demolition of the three blocks comprising a total of 150 units.  The cost of the proposal is estimated at &euro;17 million, excluding site costs, at an estimated cost of almost &euro;390,000 per unit.  The initial proposal includes the provision of 44 replacement units in respect of blocks D and E.  At present there are no proposals for replacement units for block F.  The proposed development, along with the existing refurbished flats in blocks A, B and C, would result in a total of 130 social units on this site.</P>
        <P>Whereas my Department accepts there is a need further to revitalise the area and also notes the extensive consultation that has taken place with the residents, a number of issues in connection with the proposal have been raised with Dublin City Council and these must be addressed before the proposal can be further progressed.</P>
        <P>Specifically, my Department has raised concerns about the high concentration of social units in the project as a whole and its impact on tenure mix, and also the relatively high unit cost for the works.  In addition proposals in respect of block F have not been included in the current Dublin city submission.  In my Department&rsquo;s view, the council should take a holistic approach to the total project and include block F in its proposals so that the cost implications for the entire development can be fully considered.</P>
        <P>My Department wrote to the local authority on 4 December 2007 expressing these concerns and highlighting the need for a clear development strategy for the remaining blocks.  My Department is now awaiting a response from the authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which has been very helpful in illuminating an important point in the issue.  Dublin City Council and the local residents currently believe they require a response from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s response clearly indicates the Department is awaiting response from the other parties.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State facilitate, through his offices, a meeting with the relevant officials and people on this issue so we can clarify the matter, allow the project move forward and have these points resolved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the point made by the Senator.  In order to provide all possible information, I will give more information on the letter sent to Dublin City Council on the submission from it to my Department, which might be helpful.  If contact on that level is insufficient, I have no problem with some direct link with Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>I should emphasise that we wrote to the council in December 2007.  Our position at this time is that we await a response in that regard.  If it gave a response, or if the response was that it had a difficulty in addressing the issues we raised, perhaps we could progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response. I fully accept the bona fides and intent of the Department.  I hope that as a result of the contribution we will find some way to move this forward to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>
