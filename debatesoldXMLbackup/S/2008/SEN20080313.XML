	<P>I have received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion of the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to publish a complete list of all school projects in the building programme together with indicative times for completion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Alan Kelly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline if the Government is fully committed to providing funding for and operating the CT scanner that is idle in Nenagh General Hospital for almost a year and to provide an indicative date for the commencement of its use.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify if she is aware of the current threat to the future of domiciliary birth services and if she will outline her vision in the future development of these services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide a progress report on the implementation of the mental health strategy A Vision of Change.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Doherty, Kelly and de B&uacute;rca as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senator Corrigan may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion to amend the orders of reference <Col N="1966"/>of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children; No. 2, Finance Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 3 early signature motion on the Finance Bill 2008.  It is proposed that No. 1 be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2  to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 3 to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 2.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We had discussions on the violence on our streets here in recent weeks, particularly the horrific case in Drimnagh where two young Polish men lost their lives.  The situation has reached a new low today when we hear of gangs grooming children as young as ten years of age to hide weapons and carry drugs.  It reinforces the need for a debate here and for serious co-ordinated Government action to tackle this problem.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform need to work together on this issue.  I am concerned there is not a sufficient level of co-operation among the Departments to deal with it and that there is not a format in place to ensure we get the best out of the services, by the providers of those services working together, to reclaim communities and public spaces.</P>
        <P>On the continuum of crime, a man interviewed on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, to be broadcast this evening, describes himself as an ordinary criminal, whatever that means.  I saw a garda being interviewed who said there is no such thing.  This man has had to make a settlement with the CAB and has had a chequered criminal history.</P>
        <P>We need to examine what role we in the Seanad can play.  We need a Cabinet subcommittee on this issue. We have one on social inclusion but we need one on enhancing communities and for it to involve co-operation among the Departments, given that the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are involved.  There is a perception that nobody is co-ordinating the services and showing leadership for communities.  This problem is being experienced in all communities and not only in those in one postal code.</P>
        <P>We need leadership on this issue at a national level and at a local level.  Only last night I attended a meeting at which people said they could not use their local park.  Other communities throughout the country have had similar experiences. The latest revelation is that a garda superintendent said a boy &mdash; a 15 year old &mdash; was told his head would be blown off if he did not do what he was told.  It is disturbing that under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, only 24 out of 170 people involved in gangland killings have been brought to justice. <Col N="1967"/> This is a serious matter.  We ought to find a mechanism to address it in this House by the input of a number of Ministers in a cross-departmental response.  This is important.</P>
        <P>The suggestion by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, during an interview on radio this morning that penalty points should be doubled for this bank holiday weekend is bizarre.  It may well be a good suggestion but the key issue that should be addressed is one concerning the Government appointed advisory group in regard the drink-driving blood alcohol level.  It seems there is disagreement in Fianna F&aacute;il about this but the advisory group has recommended to the Road Safety Authority and to the Government that action should be taken.  Perhaps the Leader might inform the House as to the current position on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent months, 13 Members have, on different occasions, raised issues to do with the schools building programme and related matters.  I note that Senator Doherty will raise this matter on the Adjournment today.  Some of those who have spoken on this issue were Government Members, including Senators Cannon and &Oacute; Domhnaill.  Members on this side of the House have described similar problems in schools throughout the State.  The responses we receive to these queries are exactly the same in all cases, being merely a restatement of what the school authorities already know.  The entire process is a model of procrastination.  It seems a structure has been established to prevent us obtaining information on where schools stand on the priority list.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>This issue should be dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I call for a value for money audit not of the money being spent but of the process that schools must go through in dealing with the Department when they seek an extension, additional classroom or new school.  What is going on would not be tolerated in any other structure in the public or private sector.  My office has kept a record of our dealings with the Department on these matters.  On several occasions, we rang the school buildings section of the Department only to be told we must address our inquiry to the Minister&rsquo;s office.  When we do so, however, we are told we should be speaking to the buildings section.  When we tell the official in the Minister&rsquo;s office that the buildings office has directed us there, our call is redirected to the person in the buildings section to whom we spoke ten minutes earlier.  This is the repeated pattern of our attempts to obtain information.</P>
        <P>School authorities are informed of their entitlements and put on a list, but the list changes without any information being conveyed to the schools in question.  Attempts to obtain information represent an appalling waste of time and effort.  Ordinary people in communities are being <Col N="1968"/>given the run-around by the Department, as are Members on all sides of the House.  The priority list must provide a clear indication of where schools stand and allow them to see when their position changes.  Moreover, reasons must be given when one school is gazumped by another.</P>
        <P>I do not want the Minister to come to the House only to deliver a long, confusing speech that leaves us less informed than we were before.  This issue must be dealt with at a higher level.  I do not issue an idle threat in signalling my intention to follow through on this.  I will write to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts if I do not receive a response on this.  There must be a quality audit of procedures in the buildings section of the Department of Education and Science.  The current situation is simply not good enough.</P>
        <P>Some seven or eight years ago, when the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, was being reformed, I met various farming groups, including a group of farmers from County Wexford who were considering the possibility of building wind turbines as a type of add-on value to their farming activities.  They had already selected suitable locations for the construction of these turbines.  I was amazed to discover this morning that a group of ten of those farmers are, almost a decade later and with the full approval of their local community, still seeking approval to build a medium-scale wind site.  This makes no sense.  Moreover, it is not good enough that they are being offered only 5 cent per unit of electricity generated.  I call for a debate on this issue to discover the reasons for the  delay in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the coming St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and Easter period, Dublin Airport can expect its highest level of traffic so far this year.  More than 300,000 passengers are expected to pass through the airport in this period.  This is good news for the airport and a welcome boost to its profits.  However, I was concerned to learn earlier this week that the Commission for Aviation Regulation has sanctioned a 50% increase in the usage cost of check-in desks at the airport.  Ryanair has already said this will lead to additional charges for passengers.  We are told in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that the chief executive officer of Aer Lingus, Mr. Dermot Mannion, intends to fight the increased charge which, he contends, means that Aer Lingus effectively will be paying twice for the same service.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport to contact the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation, Mr. Cathal Guiomard, to explain his actions?  Why has a 50% increase in the cost of the usage of check-in desks been sanctioned?  We read every day in the newspapers of the expectation that tax revenues will fall.  It is vital, therefore, that we protect and enhance our tourist industry.  Price increases such as this could price Ireland out of the market.</P>
        <P>Before Christmas, I called for a review of quarrying legislation.  I note this week that Meath <Col N="1969"/>County Council has successfully served an injunction on a quarry at Bellewstown which is purported to be operating illegally.  Illegal quarrying operations are going on throughout the State.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House for a debate with a view to reviewing the legislation on quarrying?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is brain injury awareness week.  Yesterday, Oireachtas Members had the advantage of a briefing from Br&iacute;, the Acquired Brain Injury Advocacy Association, which highlighted that this condition, whether brought on by trauma or following a stroke, is very much the poor relation in terms of both the health service and additional supports.  It would be useful to have a debate on the preponderance of acquired brain injury and how those affected are treated.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on the schools building programme, particularly in regard to its cost effectiveness.  The lack of information affects everybody in public life and in the communities in question.  Decisions are made on a piecemeal basis.  Announcements, if they are made, refer only to the next step in the programme, which is often a nine-step programme, and never provide a full timetable for the completion of any school programme.  Temporary measures are in place in too many schools throughout the State.  Prefabricated classrooms are no longer purchased but are leased at a cost of &euro;25,000 per year.  I am aware of two schools in Cork that have been obliged to avail of these leasing arrangements for ten years, involving a cost to the State of more than &euro;500,000 which could have been used to build a new school in the interim.  It is in our interests to ensure there is a more open process and that the cost implications of the current system are more rigorously applied.  If the Minister is prepared to accede to our request for a debate, it would be a valuable use of our time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the means by which the Oireachtas can take action to enhance community life.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has not come to the House since the Seanad convened last summer.  The Government has lost its authority on the matter of quality of life for citizens.  Murder is commonplace and has begun to be accepted as simply a part of everyday life.  The Government came into power almost 11 years ago promising zero tolerance but that principle has been abandoned.  In particular, there has been no enhancement of the role of the Garda.</P>
        <P>Who is in charge of transport policy in this State?  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, has proposed a doubling of penalty points on bank holiday weekends.  This proposal has been transferred to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, who is in Australia, for consideration.  That is no <Col N="1970"/>way to govern.  Bank holiday weekends are characterised by road accidents and fatalities.  Unfortunately, we can be sure we will read in the newspapers next week of deaths on the roads this weekend.  I remind the Leader of the three principles of engineering, education and enforcement.  The Government has not taken sufficient action on the latter.</P>
        <P>I agree with the remarks of Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Boyle on the schools building programme.  There is no transparency in the delivery of this programme.  This is frustrating for us as public representatives but one can only imagine the frustration of a school principal in dealing with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a full debate on the breakdown of law and order and how alcohol abuse is damaging the fabric of society.  I ask the Leader to consider a different format for this debate given that this is a cross-departmental issue.  I propose a whole-day debate, bringing in the Ministers for Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should all consult with residents associations in our local communities and any other organisation that may be able to help us devise a way of working together on this issue.  There must be a bottom up approach; we cannot do it from the top down simply by talking about it in this Chamber.  We must work together to improve the quality of life for citizens.  The way of life we took for granted as we grew up seems to have faded from the horizon.  I would welcome a debate on that whole issue.  I ask the Leader to provide for as lengthy a debate as is needed.  If it takes two days, that will be fine.  Representatives of all the relevant Departments should be invited to the House to discuss this matter at length.</P>
        <P>It is right that the Lisbon reform treaty is being raised in this House every day.  We are entering into a broader debate on how this reform will take place.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to discuss matters like foreign investment policy and neutrality.  The Schengen Agreement on common travel facilities, which was raised by Senator Quinn during yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the Passports Bill 2007, also needs to be examined.  We were told yesterday that the agreement does not arise under the Passports Bill.  Is it within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  It needs to be discussed in the context of a debate on the security of international borders and the need to stop human trafficking.  Does our Schengen policy need to be reviewed and tightened?  I would love a discussion on this matter.  Perhaps the Leader will consider organising a debate.  Perhaps we can raise it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs when we are discussing the Lisbon treaty.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1971"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Leader to arrange a debate on the availability of adolescent psychiatric beds.  I am concerned about the escalation in the suicide rate, particularly among young men.  The lack of availability of such beds in all parts of the country is contributing to that unfortunate increase in no small way.  Suicide is often an under-reported phenomenon in this country.  The waiting list for adolescent psychiatric care in Dublin is quite long because just 12 beds are available.  It is timely that we should have a debate on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the amount of criticism public bodies get in this country, I am sure the Leader, on behalf of the House, will be keen to record his appreciation of the manner in which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment discharged its public duty yesterday.  Despite having to operate in the middle of a media firestorm, it held its nerve and advised the Minister to retain the poetry of Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh on the leaving certificate syllabus.  The council&rsquo;s consideration of all the issues involved, which lasted less than two hours, took place in a calm atmosphere.  We should not under-estimate the amount of courage it took to reach this decision, which marks another important step in the maturing of our society, in such a calm manner.  It may seem like a small decision, but it was actually quite a big one.  I spoke to a person who was at the meeting, who told me that their heart was lifted by the calm and steady way in which the matter was considered.  I am particularly glad to pay tribute to the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, which is often criticised, on its willingness to ensure that the teachers and pupils of Ireland can be trusted to debate and discuss all the issues involved.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>There are very few moments of this nature in Irish history.  It is very easy to join a consensus, add to the media firestorm and support those who wish to stone Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh.  The founder of Christianity would not have been found in such a mob.  Media mobs are easy to assemble.  They have been assembled for all sorts of people in Irish society, from the Taoiseach down.  It is difficult to keep one&rsquo;s head and separate out the issues in the middle of a media firestorm.  I reckon the little decision taken yesterday was as important, in its own way, as the meeting of Lemass and O&rsquo;Neill, at one level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was as important as the decision to open Croke Park or any other decision that took moral courage.  I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to those who make the decision, which we should salute.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Harris has said.  While I may return to the issue at some future stage, I do not propose to discuss it further at this juncture.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the appeal made by Archbishop Dermot Clifford to the GAA, as this country&rsquo;s principal amateur sporting organisation, to consider the possibility of removing drinks advertising from their sporting events.  The archbishop has raised an important matter in the context of a body that has a positive effect on the lives of many young men and women in this country.  In light of the damage caused by alcohol, the advertising of alcohol products should be banned outright.  Each of the three voiceovers I have done in my lifetime has caused difficulties.  I have turned down a number of opportunities to make a substantial amount of money by lending my voice and my name to the promotion of drink to young people.  I will not ever do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Good man.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The archbishop also made a good point when he argued that the scheduling of young people&rsquo;s matches is sometimes regrettable.  Young people are dropped off at the church gates and carted off to play games, missing mass in the process, and brought back when such activities are over.  As an old fogey, I think one develops one&rsquo;s habits at a young age.  Going to church is habit-forming.  I am glad that I formed such a habit early in my life.  While I do not claim to be a good person, I think going to church is a good habit of mine.</P>
        <P>The status of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal has been raised again today.  I look forward to the debate in this House on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.  The front page of today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> reports that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has directly criticised the comfortable words of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the other House, when he appeared to suggest that the office supports the Irish system.  We need to examine carefully the legislation I have mentioned.  It is not, given that the UNHCR has made 76 recommendations on it, the perfect instrument the Minister suggests.</P>
        <P>I join colleagues in condemning the drastic and tragic use by appalling criminals of armed ten year olds as pawns in the vicious game they are playing.  A 13 year old boy was involved in a serious shooting incident in Limerick.  Given that the House is currently considering the Passports Bill 2007, perhaps it would be appropriate to provide for the putting of a mark in the passports of those who involve children in the use of arms.  I am sure that proposal needs to be examined in the context of civil rights, etc.  The use of a passport mark would draw the attention of officials in other countries to the presence of these dangerous people.</P><Col N="1973"/>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks about schools.  It would be very good if we had a debate on this issue.  Like Members on all sides of the House, I have received appeals from people who feel their schools are not being dealt with in an appropriate manner or with the proper degree of speed.  A distraught woman in Dublin 24 e-mailed me yesterday to tell me that children in her local school are being taught in rat-infested prefabricated cabins.  Teachers in the school have to negotiate their way through the playground in such circumstances.  While I assured the woman in question that I would try to raise the matter in this House, I told her I was not sure what I could do.  I pointed out that it was a matter for the local council and her local representatives in the D&aacute;il.  I said that Senators could play a role as part of a major debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>I hate to disagree with Senator Fitzgerald, who is an excellent leader of the Fine Gael group in the House.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s comments on the Lisbon treaty.  I ask the Leader of the House to devote a certain amount of time for a discussion between now and the referendum date.  I appreciate that the Joint <Col N="1974"/>Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, will undertake a tour of our major cities and towns to explain the reform treaty.  The Forum on Europe is also involved in a similar process.  The President of the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. Padraig Walshe, is attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food today to update members on the activities of the EU External Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, during the negotiations on the world trade agreement.  His main point is that the commissioner is selling the futures of the farmers of this country.  I ask the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to invite the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, and the Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson, to come to this House to explain their activities during the current round of talks.  This House should go through each item in the Lisbon reform treaty, as Senator Ormonde has suggested.</P>
    
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We could have a debate on agriculture, and the human rights issues that are part of the treaty.  We would be doing a great service because the Lisbon reform treaty is the most important issue to face this country in this century.  The people of Ireland, on the edge of Europe, have the final say in a decision that affects 500 million people.  I hope the Cathaoirleach, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Leader will work during the Easter recess to formulate a rolling debate on every facet of the treaty, with Ministers and, if possible, Commissioners, coming here, not to influence the vote, but to explain each aspect of this complex treaty.  We could play an important role in dealing with these issues.  When we have this lovely Chamber at our disposal we should use it to the best of our ability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>We spoke at length yesterday about Ministers travelling abroad, especially to America.  Will the Leader ask his ministerial colleagues and Senators who are travelling to highlight the issue of the undocumented Irish in America?  The Taoiseach should highlight the seriousness of their situation when he addresses Congress.</P>
        <P>In the <i>Irish Echo</i> in America, Mr. Niall O&rsquo;Dowd for the Irish lobby for immigration reform, cited examples of people living in the shadows who are afraid even to go to hospital.  One man, a labourer who was undocumented in America for nine years, died of pneumonia last week because he was unable to go to hospital.  Young women are unable to renew their drivers&rsquo; licences and consequently cannot drive their children to school.  These are our people and we should not forget about them.  There are thousands of them in America.  This affects all our communities because they are afraid to come home for funerals and to see their families.  We should use the opportunity of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festival to highlight the undocumented people in America.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been in the House to debate the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill and is determined to produce legislation that reflects best international practice in the area.  The Bill integrates our <i>ad hoc </i>refugee and immigration legislation, which is a worthwhile exercise.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, while praising aspects of the Bill, has suggested that there are areas in which it falls short of best practice.  As monitors of legislation we should be aware of this.  One of its main recommendations is that the legislation does not fully observe the non-refoulement principle, based on Article 33 of the 1951 refugee convention which states that a person should not be sent to a country where his or her life or freedom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I was not allowed to discuss the Schengen travel area yesterday in the debate on the Passports Bill because that was not the correct forum, but we should debate it.  We need to re-examine our relationship with the Schengen area, which comprises 24 countries, because we have attached ourselves to only one.  While that may have been the correct thing to do in 1990, since then the British have imposed a photograph ID control between our two islands.  People from the North of Ireland will require photograph identification before travelling to Britain.  We attached to Britain because the land border between here and Northern Ireland will probably cease to exist.  It is not acceptable for us not to reconsider a decision made in 1990 and have an opportunity to travel around the 24 countries in Europe because freedom to travel is one of the elements of the Treaty of Rome.  This is separate from the debate on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>It may not be part of our job in Europe to propose a fixed Easter but I recently became aware that in 1975 Pope Paul VI argued for this.  The churches in Europe would accept that we celebrate Easter on the second Sunday of April because in 30 AD the first Easter took place on 9 April.  I am now an expert in this matter.  We have, however, always linked it to the Passover, which is linked to the phases of the moon.  All the European countries connected to the Western <Col N="1976"/>Church would accept that Easter should take place on the second Sunday in April if we agreed to it.  This would have many benefits, including for tourism, energy and education.  I do not know how we would go about doing this but it has a European element and our Minister of State with responsibility for Europe should consider the opportunity of raising it at European level where it would be seriously considered.  This year Easter falls on 23 March and in three years&rsquo; time it will fall on 24 April.  That is a 35 day gap.  Having it on a fixed date would have all sorts of benefits.</P>

	<P>Yesterday I spoke to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who was disillusioned and discouraged.  He was a very idealistic gentleman as most members of the force are.  They see their role as serving the community and ensuring security for all of us but there is a feeling among them that because of a few bad apples &mdash; which are found in every walk of society &mdash; the whole force has been tarred with the same brush.  They see themselves as being denigrated and ridiculed at times.  We have one of the finest police forces in the world whose members stand between us and chaos and anarchy.  We expect them to take on the gangs who are trying to terrorise the whole country.  These men and women regularly put their lives on the line, sometimes with terrible consequences for themselves and their families.  It is important for us to speak up for the force from time to time.</P>
        <P>I got the feeling speaking to this young man yesterday that they need a voice because confidence within the force is not as strong as it should be.  We should not take them for granted.  I have heard of people who want to opt out of the force when they are young.  If that happens we will be giving in to the criminals and not ensuring we will have a contented society in the future.  We should avail of every opportunity to stand up for one of the finest police forces in the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs to come to the House.  The House had an excellent debate last night on the Labour Party Bill on agency workers.  A number of speakers from across the House were in favour of the spirit of the Bill.  It was a pity they could not walk through the lobbies in support of it.  The debate raised many issues to do with labour affairs which the House needs to debate further.  It is not just to do with agency workers and the vulnerable people in society.  There is a discourse on the treatment of workers which is worrying.  I note that four newspapers, all with similar titles and one of which is based in my county, dismissed their staff.  They gave the staff 24 hours&rsquo; notice and then they <Col N="1977"/>locked the doors and closed the premises.  The staff are still waiting to receive their pay and their redundancy money.  This is no way to treat workers.  Despite what we say about them, journalists in general are not highly paid.  The majority do not earn large amounts of money and the ones in the case I highlighted were treated in a disgraceful manner.</P>
        <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  No. 19, motion 35 on the Order Paper is a Labour Party motion on the undocumented Irish in the United States.  I propose that this be discussed after the Order of Business and without debate if possible.  I respect the views of Senator McFadden which I support wholeheartedly.  I spoke to a number of people in America in the past 24 hours and they were delighted when I told them I was proposing this motion.  Members on the other side of the House have supported a motion on this matter in the past and this motion is the same as that passed in the other House.  I told the people I was speaking to last night that the House has a very honourable Leader and that I was sure he and his party and the Government would fully support this motion.<b> </b>I hope the Leader will accept this motion in the spirit in which it is given and in the run-up to St. Patrick&rsquo;s day so that the undocumented Irish in America would be given the full support of this House and that this motion would be passed without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I join my colleague, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, in his expressions of praise, respect and admiration for the tremendous police force we have in this country.  I support wholeheartedly what he said.  We are fortunate to have such a committed police force, especially as it is headed and led by Commissioner Fachtna Murphy.  The majority of the people would support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the important humanitarian mission in Chad.  The House discussed the matter in November 2007.  I am aware there have been some renewed rebel attacks and political problems affecting the internal situation.  I ask that the House be advised of the delays in the humanitarian mission, the impact of such delay on Irish troops and the revised time schedule for the commencement of the humanitarian mission.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another issue of public interest.  I refer to a recent television documentary on RTE.  My good friend and colleague, Senator <Col N="1978"/>Terry Leyden, has done some excellent work with regard to the registration of wills.  The documentary focused attention on the area of litigation and inheritance laws.  It raised a number of serious issues and grave concerns relating to inheritance, wills, probate, the role of the Attorney General, the role of the legal profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator asking for a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the role of executors and of witnesses.  I draw to the attention of the House and put on the record the public interest in the area of family disputes over estates and beneficiaries.  Could the Leader arrange for the relevant Minister to brief the House on matters relating to such litigation and inheritance laws?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader inquire from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when legislation will be introduced on the regulation of the legal profession in light of the many, recent and well-publicised activities of some solicitors?  There should be an independent regulatory authority to deal with the legal profession rather than an ombudsman as the Minister suggests.  The system of self-regulation should be a thing of the past.  Will the Leader inquire why there has been a delay in introducing this legislation and when we are likely to see it before the House?</P>
        <P>On the question of penalty points, I agree with our leader&rsquo;s view that it is a bizarre suggestion to have double penalty points on weekends.  It is a ludicrous suggestion and with all due respect to the Leader of the House, it was as bizarre as his suggestion that we should drive on the other side of the road.  If these are the types of proposals this Government is suggesting to deal with the carnage on the roads, it does not bode well for the future.</P>

	<P>Yes.  I am looking for a debate on the matter.  The subject of crime has been referred to as well as the number of murders in this country.  It is essential the proper resources are provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat this crime.  I have been informed by some garda&iacute; that the resources are not available and that overtime has been reduced at weekends when dealing with Operation Anvil and other work.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an tSeanad&oacute;ir Nicky McFadden mar gheall ar na daoine &oacute;n tir seo at&aacute; i Nua Eabhrac, Boston agus cathracha eile sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe agus nach bhfuil cead acu a bheith ann.</P>
        <P>I support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s views.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a particular interest in this matter.  I recently made representations to him about a citizen from my town, a young girl who is undocumented and who was incarcerated for four weeks in a women&rsquo;s prison before being deported.  This is unacceptable behaviour and the Minister has referred it to the American authorities.  I agree with the sentiments and the content of the motion put forward by members of the Labour Party and I think the House should speak with one voice and support the Minister and the Taoiseach in their strenuous efforts.  They have both raised the matter with President Bush on previous visits to the United States.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise another issue, albeit with some reluctance.  Given the week that is in it and the affinity which many Members have with the goings-on in Cheltenham, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate at an early stage on the addiction of gambling and its consequences.  In the ten years I have been in this House, we have had many debates on alcohol and drug addiction but we need to focus specifically on the effects of gambling.  It is a widespread habit and there has been a significant increase in the number of betting shops in all towns.  Betting is also available on-line and there are one-arm bandit machines and other machines in betting shops.  One of the bookmakers recently reported profits of &euro;63 million, an increase of 50%, which is phenomenal, even in a growing economy.</P>
        <P>Underpinning some of those profits are harrowing personal accounts for individuals and their families.  Apparently, it is one of the largest contributory factors in suicide in Ireland, therefore, it is an issue on which we should focus.  There may well be an argument for planning advertising in regard to it.  I ask the Leader whether he could, at an early opportunity, have a debate on this most important topic.</P>

	<P>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire I want to mention the issue regarding the state of school buildings raised again today by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I am glad that it has been selected as a matter for the Adjournment this week.  It is appalling that parents, pupils and teachers have been left in a situation where they do not know when their schools will be refurbished or updated.  There is a question now of political interference in the process.  When this Minister took office, she overturned a practice already in place, where school building lists were produced.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned two days ago, some schools have to repeatedly phone the Department of Education and Science to seek updates on what stage their projects are at only to get standard answers. </P><Col N="1980"/>
        <P>When the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was in Ballinamore, County Leitrim recently, she attacked the parents&rsquo; committee for contacting the Department of Education and Science on a daily basis.  It is appalling that any Minister might leave the parents in that situation, but to attack citizens for trying to do what is best for their children is terrible and is probably an example of the state of education in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Alan Kelly&rsquo;s proposal for a discussion on the undocumented Irish.  I proposed on Tuesday, and three times before that, a joint party motion on this issue.  I understand that the Leas-Chathaoirleach has ruled the motion out of order, but there is nothing to prevent the Leader from taking the same text and passing a motion in the House without debate.

	<P>On a separate issue, I want to call for a debate on sexual offences against women.  There has been an enormous number of murders involving women victims, violence against women in the home etc., and this area seems to be slipping on the political agenda.  During the week we had a debate on human trafficking when the issue of prostitution arose and whether the users of such sexual services should be criminalised within this jurisdiction.  I note with interest that the Governor of New York State, Eliot Spitzer, has resigned on that very issue &mdash; and that in the District of Columbia it is a felony to use prostitution services.  This should be brought into that whole debate, and the Minister has said he would look at it in that context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Ireland we require structures with regard to domestic violence.  The domestic violence unit is used in Ireland to trap pimps and prostitutes but it should be employed where it is needed.  If we <Col N="1982"/>had structures in respect of domestic violence and proper agencies either at local authority level or within the HSE to deal with this, we could contain the problem, which is being exacerbated by increased alcohol consumption in the home, another issue that might be brought into the debate.</P>
        <P>I have noted with dismay this morning the application by Cork Institute of Technology for university status, as is its right.  However, there is a special need for a university in the south east.  If all the other institutes of technology are going to demand university status that will not help the very special case being made by the south east.

I have no difficulty in inviting the Minister to the House for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>Senators noted the Government Chief Whip&rsquo;s call this morning on young people in particular, but on everyone who uses the roads, to take particular care on bank holiday weekends.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be very vigilant over the Easter holiday period, especially its dedicated traffic corps which this year will reach its full complement of 1,200 personnel.   The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the former Minister, Michael McDowell, in the previous Government certainly can claim much credit for increasing the complement of the corps from 575 four years ago to 1,200 today.</P>
        <P>I join the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, in calling for everyone to take good care on the roads over the two upcoming bank holiday weekends.  We are told best practice regarding road safety is evident in New South Wales.  If there is a good idea being <Col N="1984"/>implemented in that part of Australia, why not try it here on a pilot basis?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister of State on coming up with the idea of doubling the penalty points for road traffic offences over the bank holiday weekend.  I call on the Road Safety Authority to consider taking it on board.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is to meet the police in New South Wales on his visit to Australia with a view to clarifying the nuts and bolts of the idea.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle, Buttimer, Norris and Doherty asked for the Minister for Education and Science to be invited to the House to debate the issue of returning to the priority list system in respect of the schools building programme.  As has been pointed out by Senator Doherty, the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, put this system in place when he was Minister for Education and Science.  The system worked very well.  I understand there is great demand on the east coast in particular because the population is increasing rapidly in that region.  I am sure the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, will come to the House to debate this.  I welcome the allocations made earlier this year.  I welcome the fact that 2,000 of the 4,000 teachers referred to in the programme for Government have been put in place.</P>
        <P>Considerable investment is being made and we therefore should consider supporting in every way we can the boards of management, principals, Oireachtas Members and other public representatives with a view to feeding information to and making life easier for the community members who volunteer their time to support education in their parishes.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on wind turbines, especially those with the full approval of their communities.  I will be in touch with the office of the Minister with a view to updating the Senator on the position on planning applications.  There seems to be no good reason planning permission should not be granted for developing this very environmentally friendly means of energy generation.  As an island country, Ireland has a great advantage in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan pointed out the various increases in charges sanctioned by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  I will pass on his strong views to the Minister for Transport.  The Senator also sought to establish the up-to-date position on quarrying and quarrying legislation.  Most reputable people who operate quarries have spent a great deal of money updating them according to the requirements of the Department.  I certainly would not have any difficulty with allowing time for such a discussion.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle called for a debate on the brain awareness week campaign.  I made a commitment in this regard and have no difficulty in allowing for such a debate.</P><Col N="1985"/>
        <P>Senators Ormonde and Leyden called for the House to prioritise the debate on the pending Lisbon treaty referendum.  As I informed the House last week, the President of the European Parliament will be present in the House at 10.30 a.m. on 8 April, after the Easter recess.  I intend to have a debate on the treaty that afternoon and evening in the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche.</P>
        <P>As the Members probably know, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, pertaining to the Lisbon treaty, will be before the House for consideration, possibly two weeks after we return from the Easter recess.  In the month of April alone, therefore, we will be considering the Bill and hearing from the President of the European Parliament.  If Senators have any good ideas in this regard, the Leader is always prepared to consider them and to make discussion possible in the House such that the public will be informed fully regarding the decision they must make.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast called for a debate on psychiatric beds for adolescents.  She made an urgent request in this regard on two or three occasions and I have no difficulty with having a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris and Norris referred to the courageous decision of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to retain the poetry of Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh on the leaving certificate syllabus, thus acknowledging the talent of this renowned poet.  I support the views of the Senators in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to alcohol abuse and advertising.  Everyone is in agreement with the sentiments of the Senator, particularly in respect of advertising billboards.  We had the same challenge with smoking.  I am not an expert in this area because, as everyone knows, I do not drink, but I believe there should be no bars in schools.  One is in school to learn and use one&rsquo;s brain.</P>

All Ministers for Foreign Affairs, including the current one, <Col N="1986"/>Deputy Dermot Ahern, certainly have been to the forefront in this regard also.  I have every confidence that all our Ministers will be doing their best on this very important issue.</P>

	<P>Senator Quinn called for a reconsideration of our relationship with the 24 countries which are party to the Schengen Agreement and made the point that identification is now necessary for those of us who wish to travel within the UK.  I will arrange a debate on this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.  He also proposed the movement of the feast of Easter to the second Sunday in April, as had His Holiness Pope Paul VI in 1975, and I will pass his views on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, with responsibility for European Affairs.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Cummins in their calls for support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We should do everything we can to ensure it has all the resources necessary to fight crime.  There have been huge increases in the funding for personnel and the membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is probably at its highest level in the history of the State.  I will allow whatever time <Col N="1988"/>is needed for a debate on supporting the force and providing it with resources.  Time will not be a problem for that to be discussed in the House so that we can see how we can give further support for the great work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly congratulated Members on statements made in the House last night regarding workers, their rights and their treatment.  We all fully support workforces.   In one case, however, the employer did not have a chance to give notice to its employees that their jobs were to go.  The keys were asked for by another entity and it was taken out of the employer&rsquo;s hands.</P>

        <P>Senator Callely called for legislation on wills and inheritance.  Senator Leyden has spent a lot of time on this matter and has given the benefit of his expertise in the area to the Oireachtas.  The acceptance of his Bill was a watershed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have no difficulty with Senator Callely&rsquo;s proposal.  We, as public representatives, are trusted by our constituents and they come to us for advice in this area.  Our first advice to them should always be to make a will because family disputes arise where there is no will.  Those disputes can continue for a long time and the cost of reaching a final outcome can take up to 40% of the estate.  I have no difficulty in passing the Senator&rsquo;s views on to the Minister and holding a debate in the House to explore how we can improve the situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins asked about the Bill on regulation of the legal profession.  I will make inquiries of the Department and come back to the Senator this afternoon with a reply.  Senator Walsh called for an urgent debate on gambling.  A television programme at 11. p.m. last night dealt with the difficulties involved in gambling.  It seems over 10% of the population have a major problem with gambling.  I do not mind a flutter on the Grand National, whether the Fairyhouse or Aintree version, or even at Cheltenham, where one or two of our colleagues had some fortune on the first day.  We do not know what will happen today or tomorrow but there is a serious level of addiction involving many people and I have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate.</P><Col N="1989"/>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 11, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      
        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">TAXPAYERS&rsquo; ADVOCATE OFFICE</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">1.&mdash;The Ombudsman shall include in her annual report a special report on the overpayment of tax by PAYE taxpayers, and on the take up of credits by such taxpayers, and the branch of her office dedicated to ensuring that the take up of credits is readily available to all taxpayers, and refunds made as rapidly as possible where this arises, as well as ensuring the availability of a ready mechanism for informing taxpayers (particularly pensioners) who are entitled to a refund of <Col N="1991"/>DIRT tax, shall be known as the taxpayers&rsquo; advocate office.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This recommendation relates to a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate office.  We propose the establishment of a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate who would be independent of the Revenue Commissioners and who would take cases independently on behalf of taxpayers and ensure these were dealt with in a fair and transparent manner.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The most effective way of obtaining tax refunds from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of many payments would be to introduce a method similar to that used with mortgage interest relief.  In this regard, the way in which taxpayers get their money would be done centrally and would seem to work quite well after some initial teething problems.  This would help to deal with a range of different refunds to which people are entitled, such as doctors&rsquo; fees and bin charges.  We are putting this proposal forward because it is a way of dealing with what is currently a cumbersome method by which taxpayers must apply to Revenue.  A serious volume of money goes unclaimed.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>We propose that such a process would be overseen by a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate in such a way to help the Revenue Commissioners to overhaul the current cumbersome system.  We hope the Minister would look favourably upon this and support the amendment.</P>

	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s recommendation is one which was debated at some length in the other House.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance is not convinced still of the merits of the case.  The statutory remit of the Ombudsman already incorporates both of the roles proposed for a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate, namely, acting for taxpayers and investigating actions which are contrary to fair or sound administration.</P>
        <P>Since the inception of the Office of the Ombudsman, a significant number of tax queries have been submitted to it.  The Ombudsman has carried out a number of special investigations on the office&rsquo;s initiative, such as an investigation into the repayment of tax to certain widows and the operation of schemes for disabled drivers.  I must point out that when calls were previously made for the establishment of a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate, the Ombudsman drew attention to the duplication of roles and responsibilities that such a development would have involved.</P>
        <P>Apart from the statutory role and responsibilities of the Ombudsman, other avenues are also open to taxpayers to make their complaints or to seek satisfaction for perceived unfair treatment.  They can lodge a customer service complaint about the standard of service received in their personal contact with the Revenue Commissioners.  They can complain to a Revenue office by telephone, correspondence, fax and e-mail or in person.  In addition, or as an alternative, they <Col N="1992"/>can request a review by Revenue of any aspect of the way in which their tax affairs have been handled.  Such reviews are carried out by a senior official who was not involved in the original decision.  Ultimately, taxpayers who are dissatisfied with their treatment by Revenue can make a statutory appeal to the Appeal Commissioners who, by law, are independent of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>In the Finance Act 2007, the Minister introduced new schemes to allow the operation of DIRT-exempt accounts, subject to two conditions.  These were that the account holder must be 65 or over or permanently incapacitated and that their total income must not exceed their current exemption limit.  In 2007, Revenue arranged for an information leaflet to be issued to social welfare customers in receipt of State and other pensions.  Approximately 100,000 leaflets were issued in this way and Revenue will continue to publicise through appropriate channels the facility offered by the accounts.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that their ongoing efforts to inform taxpayers of their entitlements are having the desired effect.  This is demonstrated in the substantial increase in the number of PAYE taxpayers seeking reviews of their tax liability in the context of claiming additional tax credits and reliefs.  The number of PAYE reviews processed in 2006 was 1.14 million, as opposed to 552,000 in 2005.</P>
        <P>Revenue staff in front offices dealing with the public and those manning customer helplines are trained to give full assistance to all customers.  The fact that few people are enthusiastic about paying taxes is all the more reason for effective channels of complaint and appeal by taxpayers against poor service or unfairness.  However, given the comprehensive and accessible system already in place for complaints or appeals by any taxpayer who feels unfairly treated by the tax system, it is not obvious that there is a case for putting in place an additional layer of a tax advocate&rsquo;s office.</P>

        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">CHARITY STATUS OF TIDY TOWNS GROUPS</P>
        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;Any group which in the opinion of the Minister formed or designed towards participation in a tidy towns scheme shall be entitled to benefit from charitable status for the purposes of the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is something to which I drew the Minister&rsquo;s attention yesterday.  There seems to be some confusion in respect of the charitable status of Tidy Towns groups and inconsistencies in the way in <Col N="1993"/>which it works.  While I will not press this amendment, I ask that we look at this issue because these groups carry out a significant volume of work.  Birdhill, which is a parish near me, has won the award for a number of years and the amount of work it does is phenomenal.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister said yesterday that a number of Tidy Towns groups have charitable tax status going back 20 years but others do not appear to have this status.  We need a consistent approach to the way Tidy Towns groups are treated so that they can benefit from the work they do.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand where the Senator is coming from and I am aware of that apparent anomaly.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether a body or organisation has been established for charitable purposes.  I have been advised that the activities of Tidy Towns organisations, generally speaking, would be regarded as satisfying one of the categories of charitable purpose, which is that they are to be of benefit to the broader community.  The other categories of charitable purpose are the advancement of religion, the relief of poverty and the advancement of education.  Obviously, Tidy Towns groups do not have anything to do with these categories.</P>
        <P>A number of Tidy Towns organisations enjoy charitable tax exempt status, the first of which was approved approximately 20 years ago.  Two key requirements must be satisfied for a body to maintain charitable status under the Revenue rules.  The first is that the body must be established solely for charitable purposes.  That would normally be stated in the body&rsquo;s governing instrument.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the body must apply its funds solely for charitable purposes.  This means that, on an ongoing basis, the body must conduct itself in accordance with its governing principles.  Failure to do so will result in a removal of charitable tax exempt status.</P>
        <P>If the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance simply designated all those bodies as charities for the purposes of the charitable donations scheme, as suggested by the amendment, the ongoing means of control would be absent.  The bodies would retain charitable tax exempt status regardless of the function they ultimately carried out.  There is a definition of what someone must do to qualify for charitable tax exempt status.  Any organisation, such as a Tidy Towns organisation, can apply to the Revenue Commissioners to see if it comes within the rules.  Sometimes, after looking at all the facts of the case, the Revenue Commissioners will say that it does, while in other cases it will say that it does not.</P>
        <P>I assume that if one Tidy Towns group establishes a precedent of being designated as a charity under the legislation, there must be something materially different about what is being done by another Tidy Towns organisation such that it does not get that exemption.  If we were automati<Col N="1994"/>cally to designate all Tidy Towns groups as being tax exempt because they are charities, we would have the unusual situation where organisations which might be blatantly acting outside what the regulations provide in respect of charitable purposes would be exempt while others which are probably nearer the definition of charity would not.</P>
        <P>The position at the moment is that a Tidy Towns organisation must apply for charitable tax exempt status and the Revenue Commissioners will decide case by case whether it is inside or outside the statutory definition.</P>

        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;The Minister shall in establishing the commission on taxation include in its terms of reference the following matters:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) to examine anomalies arising from the tax treatment of married persons where one spouse remains out of paid employment in order to attend to child care duties;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) to examine the treatment of unmarried persons living together including gay couples in long term relationships;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) to examine the operation and possible reform of stamp duty particularly the capacity of property developers to avoid stamp duty on certain transactions and the exclusion of certain financial transactions (e.g. contracts for difference) from the lower rate of stamp duty applied to financial transactions;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) to examine the need to ensure that carbon tax proposals have due regard to the ability of less well off individuals including pensioners to meet the cost arising from increased taxation on carbon based fuels such as coal and gas;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) to inquire into the fairness and equity of the overall tax system and to provide for the evaluation of tax breaks and other provisions permitting tax payers to mitigate their tax liabilities and the impact in particular of provisions for exemption from tax and residency rules and shall publish at regular intervals the outcome of their enquiries into the tax system.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment has been somewhat pre-empted or overtaken by the decision by the Minister for Finance to set up a Commission on Taxation.  While I will not press the amendment, I wish to <Col N="1995"/>make a few points.  The terms of reference set out for the commission need to be widened.  They should provide some methodology in respect of the examination of high net worth individuals and the level of tax they pay which, as my party has pointed out on a number of occasions, is not at the required rate.  For various reasons they do not seem to be paying tax although they are investing in capital programmes, etc.  However, some analysis is needed.</P>
        <P>We believe the terms of reference of the commission need to be widened.  If this is not being accounted for, the way it will work will not satisfy the requirements of what a commission should be doing.  While it has terms of reference to deal with many issues, I would like to see it carrying out a serious review of the benefits of tax individualisation, because I and others across many parties are not convinced about its merits.  While I will not press the recommendation, I wish to make those points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>While I note the recommendation is not being pressed, I wish to outline some of my thoughts on the Commission on Taxation.  It was included in the programme for Government at the suggestion of the Green Party and I am happy that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance has established the body.  The terms of reference are not about what the commission can or cannot do.  The commission has a specific remit to examine the taxation system.  The terms of reference cover particular areas the commission will examine and report on.  When published in 2009 I expect the report to be very wide-ranging.</P>
        <P>I was concerned that the Senator&rsquo;s recommendation proposed introducing certain things without taking others into account.  I refer specifically to the carbon levy, which is one of the priorities for the commission.  I find offensive the suggestion that such a levy would be introduced without due regard for the ability of people to pay and its social consequences.  I have every certainty that what will be proposed by the commission and adopted by the Government will be appraised on those lines.  The Labour Party needs to indicate whether it believes in environmental taxation and if so that it can only be introduced without socially negative consequences.  Everyone involved in the political system should accept that, rather than trying to score cheap political points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senators will be aware the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance announced the establishment of the Commission on Taxation on 14 February.  The work of the commission will help establish the framework within which tax policy will be set for the next decade at least.  It is important for the commission to take a strategic, considered and balanced perspective that recognises the evolving challenges we face on the tax front.  Therefore the terms of <Col N="1996"/>reference of the commission that were also announced on the same day are deliberately broadly defined, far-reaching and allow for consideration of all aspects of the taxation system, as Senator Boyle has said.  Introducing the type of very specific terms of reference proposed in the recommendation can only serve to restrict the work of the commission and introduce unnecessary constraints.</P>
        <P>When setting up a commission to examine the taxation system generally, it does not make sense to have terms of reference relating to examining stamp duty on contracts for difference, which would be very restrictive.  If we were to make the terms of reference so specific that it removes the discretion for the commission, why have a commission in the first place?  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated on the Committee and Report Stages in the other House, the members of the commission are drawn from the social partners, the accounting and tax advisory services that advise all businesses, big and small, accomplished people with environmental and economic expertise, and people with wide experience in central and local government.  The wide range of skills and knowledge of the members of the commission will ensure we get a report that will help shape future policy in a positive manner.  I have every confidence in the chairman, who is the former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Frank Daly.  I am sure he is fully conversant with what the commission wants to do and he will ensure the commission is steered in the right direction.</P>

        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">TAX RELIEF AT SOURCE</P>
        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;Tax relief at source shall be available for environmental service charges.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I hope this will be considered favourably.  We believe the tax relief on environmental service charges, including bin charges etc. should be applied at source.  There is considerable under-claiming of these reliefs, particularly in Dublin.  Given the number of environmental service providers we have &mdash; I note the announcements of changes recently particularly in Dublin &mdash; and taking into account all the local authorities, most of which provide some of these services or award them in some cases to private contractors, it is difficult to fathom why we cannot have a central system for doing this.  Households in most parts of the country are being billed.  By doing this we would provide a process by which the house<Col N="1997"/>holders would be able to get the benefit of the relief while importantly taking away the bureaucracy.  As with the other recommendations on which I have spoken, it would help to reduce the number of residents who are not benefiting from the relief they should be getting and would eliminate the administrative burden.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I spoke about people installing geothermal or solar panels on their houses.  Instead of needing to apply for a grant they should be able to get tax relief.  When they apply for grant they need to submit the C2 number of the installing contractor.  It would be less bureaucratic than giving a grant to people who want to make changes to their lifestyles and improve the environment.  It would also be more tax efficient and economic to give the equivalent of the grant as a tax relief and should be considered.  I understand the Government uses it to some degree to control the amount of money it will spend on these grants.  However, it would work out being considerably more efficient in the long term if we set it up this way rather than the existing cumbersome grant applications process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendation relates solely to tax relief for service charges.  I understand what the Senators have said and their arguments for and against.  I will communicate their comments to the T&aacute;naiste.  Relief for service charges is currently available in respect of charges paid by a householder in the previous year subject to a maximum claim of &euro;400 <i>per annum</i>.  Where an individual makes a claim in any year, the level of relief claimed is automatically allowed for all future years.  The Revenue Commissioners have gone that far in giving continuity.  The Revenue Commissioners provide a number of simplified ways for individuals to make their claim for this relief by text or on-line, or by phoning or writing to their local tax office.</P>
        <P>The recommendation proposes that tax relief at source should generally be applied to service charges paid by individuals.  While the principle of relief at source is very effective in ensuring that all qualifying individuals benefit from the relief, I am advised it would involve a cost on the Exchequer from one point of view, namely that individuals who are exempt from tax and who would not be currently be availing of the relief would in effect be getting a direct subsidy from the Exchequer.  In order for such a scheme to operate successfully it would be necessary for the ten local authorities and in excess of 400 private operators to all participate fully.  It could not be envisaged that a dual system of granting relief would apply.</P>
        <P>Service providers use a wide variety of methods to levy the service charges, including direct payments, bin tags and service charges.  There are considerable variations in how the level of service charges is determined.  It would require amendment to some or all of those systems before the <Col N="1998"/>introduction of any such scheme of direct relief at source.  To ensure the tax relief is highlighted to as many eligible payments as possible the local authorities have agreed to assist Revenue in publicising the relief.  The T&aacute;naiste is favourably disposed to the general notion of giving as much tax relief at source to those matters as possible.  The Senators can rest assured that the Revenue will continue working to find a way.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
 
        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">RESTRICTION OF BENEFIT-IN-KIND</P>
        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;Where an employer provides a childcare facility directly to an employee, or pays the childcare costs of an employee to a third party, the provision or payment shall not constitute a taxable benefit-in-kind.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The ethos of this recommendation is a simple one.  I will not use this opportunity to go into the child care debate but this measure would be worthwhile if it were studied properly and adopted.  I hope the Minister will move on this matter soon.  I understand one of the reasons this has not been changed and the Minister is not in favour of it is that there is some concern that people might deliberately use the measure as a way of avoiding tax.  However, this should not negate the fact that a number of genuine employers provide such necessary facilities for employees owing to the unsocial nature of their jobs.  This could also apply to a husband and wife who are employed in the same area.  Such a strict, down-the-line approach by the Government is unhelpful.  If the Minister were willing to re-examine this matter he would receive practical support.  This fairly simple issue does not justify a strict and aggressive approach from the Minister.  In this respect, we are not necessarily talking about people who are trying to avoid tax.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was debated at some length on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance indicated in those debates, the position is that existing law already provides an exemption for an employee benefit-in-kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care to their employees.  However, the exemption applies only on certain conditions.  I will not go through the conditions now but essentially, for the exemption to apply, the employer must be involved in the provision, management or funding of the facilities.</P>
        <P>Concerns were previously expressed that the relief was not available to small and medium enterprises by virtue of their size.  Where the individual SME might not be able to facilitate the <Col N="1999"/>provision of child care facilities on its own, the legislation allows the enterprise to join other small employers in providing co-located facilities, contributing proportionately to costs and jointly providing the child care service.  In this way, SMEs can address collectively the differences of scale in the provision of facilities.  Therefore the recommendation, in so far as it relates to direct provision of child care, is addressed in existing legislation.</P>
        <P>In regard to the second proposal in the recommendation, namely, that employees be given a benefit-in-kind exemption where their employer purchases child care for them from third parties, a core requirement of the current exemption is that employers must be involved in the provision, management or funding of facilities.  Apart from this, there are a number of difficulties, the first of which relates to cost.  The second one is that allowing employers to buy child care for employees from third parties is unlikely to have any significant impact on the supply of additional child care places.  Indeed, it could lead to some displacement with employers buying up most of the convenient child care places for their employees, and with those not getting such a benefit being forced out to less convenient child care facilities.  Third, there could be a knock-on effect on the cost of child care as people being subsidised might be prepared to pay even more for the service.  Certainly, those providing it probably would be inclined to charge even more.  Fourth, it would not be a legitimate policy objective to provide tax relief for some taxpayers who have been lucky enough to be employed by an employer or group of employers that have sourced child care places from the existing complement.  Such a policy would be of no benefit to those without taxable income, for example.  Fifth, ultimately, such a provision, if introduced, very likely would lead to pressure for full tax relief for all those paying their own child care costs, with the associated costs being borne by the Exchequer.  Current Government policy is designed to increase the supply of child care places through the creation of additional places, not to use the resources to grant tax relief for child care costs <i>per se</i>.</P>
        <P>Over several years, the Government has sought to support parents with children.  These support measures, introduced in tandem with significant increases in child benefit payment, include the early child care supplement scheme, the national child care investment programme, the supply of a further 50,000 child care places, the national child care training strategy which aims to produce 17,000 additional child care training places by 2010, increased maternity leave, and a tax exemption for those who mind children in their own homes.</P>

        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;Where an employer provides training to an employee, or pays the training costs of an employee to a third party, the provision or payment shall not constitute a taxable benefit-in-kind.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This recommendation concerns benefit-in-kind training.  I am raising the issue following increases in redundancies and consequent unemployment.  As the Minister is aware, there have been a spate of closures throughout the country, unemployment is at its highest rate for eight years while redundancies levels are up substantially year on year.  Some companies offer phased redundancy packages over a period in a humane manner but, unfortunately, that does not happen in all cases.  Training programmes can be included in such packages, especially for middle-aged people who are concerned about not being re-employed.  Many training packages are provided by State agencies such as F&Aacute;S and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Companies can purchase training from such agencies or colleges.  There is a wide range of training opportunities but where training is provided as part of a redundancy package, the employee is charged on a taxable benefit.  Given the way the economy is changing and the increasing volume of people participating in lifelong learning, including additional training, does the Minister consider the tax code could be amended in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed recommendation seeks to ensure training costs paid by an employer will not result in a benefit-in-kind charge applying to the employee.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in circumstances where an employer either refunds course or examination fees on behalf of an employee or pays them directly on behalf of the employee, and the course undertaken is relevant to the employer&rsquo;s business, then a taxable benefit would not arise.  In addition, my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has introduced section 22 to provide a new exemption to deal with the cost of retraining provided by an employer as part of a redundancy package.  There has been substantial debate about that in the other House and people have sought to have the provision amended.  We will leave it as it is, however, and see how it works out.</P>

        <P Just="Center" el="5">FAILURE BY EMPLOYER TO REIMBURSE TRAVEL COSTS</P>
        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;Where an employee incurs travel costs in connection with his or her employment, which are not reimbursed by an employer, the employee may be afforded a relief on such travel costs against his or her liability to income tax in connection with the employment.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a common sense recommendation but it probably needs to be redrafted.  I will not press the recommendation.  Travel costs are not tax deductible for a number of small businesses which do not derive any benefit from them.  A recommendation such as this one, if redrafted, could encourage greater use of public transport rather than using cars for business purposes.  If the Government were to adopt such a measure, I can understand why a certain cap or scale would have to be put in place, and such travel expenditure also would have to be receipted.  Some small businesses cannot afford additional travel costs to which tax deductions apply.  If the Government were to consider providing relief in this area, it would encourage the use of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue has been around for some time.  When studying at the Institute of Chartered Public Accountants in UCD I was taught that self-employed people may claim travel expenses incurred for the purposes of their businesses whereas employees may claim only for travel undertaken in the performance of their duties, a somewhat narrower hoop to get through.</P>
        <P>The difficulty that arises in this regard is cost.  We cannot provide a tax reduction in respect of travel expenses for every employee.  A person&rsquo;s travel to work is not travel undertaken in the performance of his or her duties.  An employee required to travel as part of his or her duties may claim tax relief on such expenses.  To provide tax relief on travel expenses for every employee in the country &mdash; we now have 700,000 more people at work despite the redundancies referred to &mdash; would result in enormous cost to the Exchequer.  It would also mean some of the tax reliefs given to the less well-off would have to be reversed or partially reversed.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly will be aware of the salary sacrifice scheme, whereby persons employed by a large concern agree to sacrifice part of their salaries in lieu of public transport expenses, the cost of which is not taxable.  There are considerable tax savings to be made in this regard provided the people concerned use public transport.  I understand some private operators now come within the remit of this scheme.  As I understand it, the deal must be for 12 months and, a person who cannot afford to purchase an annual ticket and gives a commitment to purchase a ticket monthly is also covered by the scheme.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="10">The amendment seeks an increase in the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit.  This issue was debated at length in the Lower House.  It is Government policy to encourage both persons in a household into employment.  Down through the years, tax reliefs have been altered to ensure households with double incomes are substantially better off than households with a single income.  This gap has widened significantly in recent years and needs to be corrected.  Often, the person who remains in the home chooses to do so in order to take care of children.  These families are making significant sacrifices to rear their children and this should be taken into account.</P>
        <P>It is Government policy to encourage people to work and to alter the tax reliefs accordingly.  However, that gap has grown too wide.  We should afford more status to children&rsquo;s rights than we do to encouraging people to return to work.  We need to rebalance this system and acceptance of the recommendation would go part of the way in doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The effect of the recommendation would be to double the value of the 2007 home carer tax credit of &euro;770.  The cost of the measure, if implemented, would be approximately &euro;54 million in a full year and &euro;37 million in 2008.  The financial resources available to the T&aacute;naiste for the budget 2008 personal tax package including, PRSI and health levy changes, amounted to &euro;582 million, not an inconsiderable amount at a time when economic growth has slowed considerably.  </P>
        <P>The aim of the income tax measures contained in the budget is to use tax credits and bands to ensure low income earners remain outside the standard tax band and average earners remain outside the higher rate band, as promised in the Government programme.  The measures are also focused on assisting the elderly, lone parents, widowed persons and widowed parents, those with a disability and carers.  More than 54% of the resources in the personal income tax package were devoted to assisting those categories and the low paid.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey will appreciate that the resources available to the T&aacute;naiste in budget 2008 were more restricted than in previous years and choices had to be made in respect of their allocation.  To provide for a doubling of the home tax carer credit as recommended would mean increases in other income tax credits or reliefs <Col N="2003"/>would have to be curtailed or not implemented.  The T&aacute;naiste stated in an earlier debate on this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill that he is satisfied that budget 2007 allocated the available resources in a fair and equitable manner.  For this reason, I am unable to accept the recommendation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tax position of a married single income couple does not change unless their income exceeds &euro;44,400.  According to the statistics available, two out of three married taxpayers in the country do not reach that level of income and as such the discrimination of the difference applies only to one third of married one-income couples.  The maximum differential between the married one income couple and the married double income couple is &euro;5,500 and as such the discrimination only kicks in when the married double income couple&rsquo;s earnings reach upwards of &euro;70,800.  The gap is not as great as is being portrayed.</P>
        <P>A number of the increases in allowances introduced in budgets 2007 and 2008 specifically benefit married one income earners as opposed to anybody else.  It is not true to say that the sole motivation for individualisation was to force married women out to work.  The previous tax system bore hard on the single income earner.  As far as I can recall, ten years ago a single person entered the PAYE net at the equivalent of what is now &euro;84 per week.  That is extraordinary.  We have continued the practice of giving double tax relief to married couples.  We were required first to concentrate our necessary resources on married persons, be they two income or one income couples, and then to change the structure and bring more balance into the system.  In an effort to further balance it, we introduced the home carer credit.  I accept this is the first increase in this allowance since 2000 when it was first introduced.  The Government is committed to doubling the home carer&rsquo;s credit during its time in office rather than in one go.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The issues dealt with in these amendments have been also discussed at length in the Lower House.  As a result of some of the changes introduced at budget time, people who are renting are being disadvantaged when compared with first time buyers or those receiving mortgage relief.  The amendment seeks to rebalance the situation to ensure those who cannot afford to buy even with improvements in mortgage interest relief receive a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of the recommendations and amendments put forward today and in the other House are, on the surface, quite acceptable.  Were I on the other side of the House I, too, could make as good a case in respect of some of them.  However, the Minister must strike a balance.  Resources are not limitless.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 6 of the Finance Bill implements the budget announcements to improve the level of rent relief.  The section amends section 473 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act which grants reliefs to taxpayers for rent paid in respect of private rented accommodation which is their sole or main residence.  The changes introduced by the T&aacute;naiste will increase the amount of rent relief due to all categories of claimants.  For single persons under the age of 55, the credit will be increased from &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000.  For single persons over the age of 55, the credit will be increased from &euro;3,600 to &euro;4,000.  For married and widowed persons under the age of 55, the credit will be increased from &euro;3,600 to &euro;4,000 and for married and widowed persons over the age of 55, the credit will be increased from &euro;7,200 to &euro;8,000.</P>
        <P>The recommendations proposed by the Senator would increase the amounts due for single persons only.  The tax code generally ensures a married couple should get the same level of relief as two single persons and it is not proposed to depart from that principle on this occasion.  The cost of the recommendation, if implemented as proposed, would be approximately &euro;29 million in a full year.  Over the past four budgets the T&aacute;naiste increased rent relief by 57% in total and the cost of living increased by approximately 27% during that period.  Therefore, the real value of rent relief increased by approximately 27% or 28%.  This change proposed to section 6 would increase rent relief by 11%, which would be quite significant.  The T&aacute;naiste is satisfied that the increases in the relief provided for in the Bill will help to reduce the burden of rent for tenants in the private rented sector, particularly in light of reports showing recent increases in the supply of rental accommodation which should lead to reduced rent levels.</P>
        <P>The changes in this Bill, in conjunction with other changes introduced by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, in the previous four Finance Bills are generous.  Owing to the excess in supply of rental properties, there is a downward pressure on rents.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">8.&mdash;Part 30 of the Principal Act shall be amended by inserting a new section:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;785.&mdash;A person who reaches retirement under a Defined Contribution Pension scheme shall from 1st March 2008 not be required to purchase an Annuity unless they do not have an income equivalent to a Non-Contributory Pension prevailing at the time of retirement.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This issue was discussed on Second Stage yesterday and in the Lower House.  This amendment relates to pensions.  People with private pensions who are forced to buy annuities on retirement will be under significant pressure in the next few years owing to changes in the stock market.  The changes that have occurred, especially in the past 12 months, and which potentially will occur in the next few years have eroded and will erode significantly the value of such pensions.  Changes need to be made to protect the pension benefits of those employees who do not have the same benefits as public servants whose pensions are based on their incomes on the day they retire.  Private pensions are based on the value of the investment in the fund and policyholders are forced to buy annuities on retirement which may not retain their value.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In principle, there is much merit in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  Many annuities have fallen in value or are not as valuable when they come to be paid as was originally anticipated.  This is because the yield from Government bonds has dropped considerably and there has also been considerable turmoil in the international equity markets.</P>
        <P>The other difficulty with annuities is that, generally speaking, the benefit dies with the annuitant.  Some people live long lives and other not as long as anticipated and I suppose the numbers balance each other out.  Self-employed persons, provided they can prove they have an income of &euro;12,800, are entitled to convert their pension contributions into cash, but that option is not open to employees in the PAYE system.  There seems to be an inherent unfairness in that regard.</P>
        <P>However, I hasten to add that all the criticism of annuities is not correct.  There are different types of annuities and people can make different arrangements by incurring extra costs or paying extra contributions.  This issue is under discussion in the context of the debate on pensions.  The <Col N="2006"/>Government&rsquo;s view is that to extend the same facilities to employees under the PAYE system as the self-employed enjoy, which on the surface might appear fair, would be to put the cart before the horse given that it has begun to examine the question of pensions, including private pensions.  Any tax changes or amendments to the existing tax structure relating to pensions will fit in with the general scheme on pensions that will be decided on foot of the current deliberations.  It is somewhat premature to make such a change now, but I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  I do not want to anticipate the outcome of how this will evolve.</P>
        <P>I do not envisage that the current system, which provides that the self-employed have the choice of converting their contributions into cash but those in the PAYE system do not, will survive.  However, it is somewhat premature to introduce such a change in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The are three groups involved, namely, the self-employed who own their pension funds, those in the public service and Civil Service whose pensions are indexed to their final pay, and employees in the PAYE system who do not own their pensions funds and whose benefits are subject to the whims of what is happening on the stock market on the day they retire.  Furthermore, the latter group cannot defer the date on which they take their pension benefit or continue to work for a longer period.  This issue should be dealt with now because, as the Minister is aware, it could be two to five years before the recommendations from the discussions on pensions ongoing at Government level are implemented.  Therefore, a significant number of people will be discriminated against in the meantime unless this issue is given greater priority.  If it is not be dealt with this year, it certainly should be given priority in next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s view to the T&aacute;naiste.  People in the public sector, including ourselves, are fortunate in that we have a defined contribution scheme.  The existing position covering many smaller contributors in the PAYE system, whom I suspect the Senator has in mind, could be described as paternalistic.  The Government is of the view that if some employees are given the option of taking a lump sum on retirement rather than having the certainty of an annuity, which will give them a certain guaranteed stream of income over a period, they will be at the mercy of the uncertainties of the stock market and financial advisers.  They would have to depend on their lump sum to supplement whatever provision they may have from the State in the form of a contributory old age pension or retirement pension.  They might not necessarily get the best investment advice.  The self-employed who provide their private pensions tend to have access to better advice and more high powered accountants.  I agree with the Senator that the Government&rsquo;s view in terms of <Col N="2007"/>those employees is a little paternalistic.  I will convey his views to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I received interesting correspondence relating to this section concerning the way in which multinationals operate here.  I do not know if the Minister also received such correspondence.  It relates to the blocking of a loophole.  The individual who raised this issue with me said that if a multinational were recruiting people from aboard, one of the best ways to secure those with the highest talents for the industries we want to have here, namely, the hi-tech industries, the fourth level of development, is to offer them stock options.  That will effectively tie employees to a company and its success is as much in their interests as it is in the interests of other shareholders.  This blocks to some degree the option in this regard.  I am talking about high powered jobs in research and development and marketing.  This individual said that such employees will stay in other jurisdictions where they can be given such stock options as part of their incomes.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and Ministers who travel to the United States next week will undoubtedly seek an assurance from the United States Government that undocumented Irish living in that country will attain legal status.  However, many such people who might be willing to return to Ireland, having gained valuable experience in the United States, may be discouraged from doing so because the stock options available to them in that jurisdiction are not available here.  This represents a disadvantage in attracting a considerable pool of talent back to the State.  Is the Minister aware of the problem with this section?  I can provide him with the information if he has not already received it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not receive the specific letter to which Senator Twomey referred but I am aware of what is being said and who is saying it.  I disagree with the Senator&rsquo;s argument.  The current position is that where an employer gives an employee shares in the company, those shares are taxable at their current market value.  What is happening in many cases is that companies are giving shares, securities or other types of financial interest in the company to employees at a certain market value, which is quite low, which these employees have an immediate right to transfer to a different type of security that is much higher in value.  However, the tax applies only on the lower value.  This represents straight <Col N="2008"/>tax avoidance.  The shares might as well be given tax-free.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, to encourage high-powered people in the software industry and so on to come to Ireland, there are various stock option schemes for which tax relief is available provided one receives the prior approval of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue will give that approval if certain conditions are met.  The stock options schemes in place, although specific and requiring the prior approval of the Revenue Commissioners, are also generous and wide-ranging.  There is no need to allow people concoct their own schemes which may represent nothing other than undiluted tax avoidance.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 30, before section 24, but in Chapter 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">24.&mdash;Where a taxpayer claims relief based on the construction of any premises, he or she shall furnish to the Revenue Commissioners sufficient information to demonstrate that he or she or any relevant contractor is complying with any relevant requirement imposed by the Health and Safety Authority or by law in respect of the construction.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The purpose of this simple recommendation is to ensure that persons claiming relief on the construction of any premises must prove their compliance with all requirements and by-laws in regard to health and safety standards before benefiting from the relief.  Several cases with health and safety implications have recently been brought to the attention of this House.  This relief was introduced for the benefit of these people and the work they are doing.  However, it is puzzling that there is no requirement to demonstrate adherence to health and safety regulations and other by-laws.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Getting the Revenue Commissioners involved in the area of health and safety is a step too far.  There is a bewildering array of health and safety regulations and the Revenue has plenty to do.  Moreover, it is not qualified to assess such issues because its expertise lies elsewhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that point but there are requirements in place regarding the fulfilment of health and safety regulations.  In most cases to which this amendment would be applicable, there is already a requirement for a health and safety certificate.  In addition, many claimants for tax relief will have purchased the property involved from the developer and will have no responsibility or control in regard to the construction itself.  In other words, the property was built before the claimant acquired an interest in it.  Therefore, there is not necessarily a direct link between claimants of tax relief and responsibility for the construction of the building which is the subject of that relief.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This proposal is based on information and advice from Threshold.  The effect of the recommendation would be to restrict the liability of tenants of commercial property to account for the tax due on rent paid to overseas landlords.  Tenants should not have to account for the income tax owed on rent paid to overseas landlords.  Tax on such income would be covered by section 1034 of the principal Act which provides for the liability of overseas residents for tax owed on income earned in the State.</P>
        <P>We propose that the Revenue should adopt something similar to the non-residential landlord declaration operated by the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom.  This effectively places the bureaucratic burden of compliance not on the tenant but on the non-residential landlord, as it should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the thinking behind Senator Kelly&rsquo;s amendment.  Where a tenant is paying rent to a foreign landlord, even if he or she is in receipt of rental allowance from the HSE, the law requires that the tenant must deduct tax at the standard rate from the rent paid against the liability the foreign landlord will ultimately have for tax.  This imposes an onerous burden on tenants.  I am not sure how many tenants are paying rent to absentee landlords but I suspect few of them are aware of this provision. <Col N="2010"/> Nevertheless, I am informed by the Revenue that a certain of money is incoming under this scheme, where tenants hang onto the portion of the rent and pay it over at the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is a difficult issue.  The purpose of the provision is to protect the Exchequer.  The information available to the Revenue Commissioners is that if this requirement is removed, any or all Irish landlords could set up offshore entities to rent out their properties and there would be no obligation on the tenant to disclose this situation or make returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  This would facilitate the avoidance of tax on the part of landlords.  Nevertheless, I accept it is not a satisfactory arrangement.  The Minister is conscious of this and he and the Revenue Commissioners are working to see if a more acceptable system can be devised which still protects the Exchequer.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 35, lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;of not less than 20 in-patient beds&rdquo;.</P><Col N="2011"/>
        <P FLI="0">This recommendation relates to tax reliefs on inpatient palliative care beds.  The Minister said yesterday that there is a great deal of support for this proposal within the sector.  These things always need to be cleared up.  There is some concern about the construction of co-located hospitals.  In the past, tax relief has been given to people who already have significant assets.  One had to have significant property and be earning significant rent before one could avail of tax relief on one&rsquo;s investments.  Ordinary punters have been kept away from tax relief schemes which, in effect, are confined to those who are already significantly wealthy.  Who is entitled to invest in palliative care units?  Is the scheme open to everybody or is it confined to big developers who wish to offset the tax they should be paying against other rental income?  Can doctors and nurses, for example, claim tax relief in this manner?  As things stand, I suspect that many of these palliative care units will be built adjoining private nursing homes.  Will the owners of such homes be able to claim tax relief?  We need to ensure there is no diminution of standards of care.  It is often difficult to define &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; and &ldquo;palliative&rdquo; care.  We should clarify some of these issues.  I assume the Health Information and Quality Authority will be responsible for standards in the palliative care centres.  It is very much being left to the HSE.  Is this another form of the tax reliefs which were given to nursing homes?  Is there much difference between the two types of tax relief?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There is very little difference between them.  The effect of this recommendation would be to remove the minimum bed capacity requirement of 20 beds provided for in the proposed legislation, which introduces a scheme of capital allowances for specialist palliative care units.  The minimum bed number of 20 was decided on following discussions with the Department of Health and Children on the scheme.  The limit was inserted in the legislation to ensure that developments seeking pre-approval, and the benefit of the capital allowances, will have sufficient capacity and critical mass to provide the necessary palliative care services in the areas where such services are needed.  It is important that any palliative care unit developed in the context of this legislation is feasible and sustainable in terms of fitting into the existing plans and needs assessment for the overall development of palliative care facilities in the State.</P>
        <P>Minimum capacity requirements are a common feature of other schemes of capital allowances.  The scheme of allowances for qualifying mental health centres, for example, has a minimum bed capacity requirement of 20.  The same figure applies to the scheme for qualifying sports injuries clinics, which is being phased out at present.  The scheme of capital allowances for private <Col N="2012"/>hospitals has a 70-bed minimum requirement in respect of a private hospital providing outpatient services and accommodation on an overnight basis and a 40-bed minimum requirement if it provides day care outpatient medical and surgical services only.  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated during the Report Stage debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il, there may be room for some flexibility in this area.  This will be examined if and when specific difficulties arise.</P>
        <P>The first hurdle for any proposed development is to obtain pre-approval from the HSE, with the consent of the Minister for Health and Children.  The HSE must find that it is in line with national plans and needs assessment for the development of palliative care facilities in the State.  This requirement, which applies to developments which seek the benefit of capital allowances, has been included for a number of reasons, one of which is to ensure the facility fits in with the overall plan for the delivery of palliative care services in the State.  We have discovered that there are gaps in such provision throughout the State.  The requirement will also encourage private investors to create more palliative care places where they are badly needed.  It has the full support of those involved in this sector.  I understand it was put in place at the suggestion of the hospice movement.</P>
        <P>Almost anybody can invest in palliative care units.  However, EU regulations prohibit those who are running such centres from investing in this manner.  I think that is the reason &mdash; I will check it for the Deputy.  I can inform him that the tax relief system that will apply to palliative care units is almost exactly the same as the system used for nursing homes.  I do not know if a minimum amount of beds is required to qualify for nursing home relief.  I am informed by officials from the Department of Finance that such developments must involve a minimum of 20 beds.  Therefore, the same conditions apply to private nursing homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that these palliative care units, which can be quite similar to nursing homes, will be built specifically for such purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The allowance scheme is the same.  The requirements to qualify for tax relief are the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been suggested that all units which are developed should be big.  It might not be a bad thing if they are attached to nursing homes.  The palliative care report that was published in 2004 stated that there was a dearth of palliative care beds in all regions.  I am worried that 20-bed stand-alone palliative care units might not be feasible outside large urban areas, where there are enough people to provide a critical mass.  The theory that underpins palliative care throughout the country is that patients should receive such care as near as possible to <Col N="2013"/>their original homes, where their families and friends may still live.  It has now been proposed that small palliative care units should be attached to nursing homes.  To what extent will the tax relief that applies to small units &mdash; I do not necessarily refer to a 20-bed unit, as an eight-bed unit might be developed &mdash; be different from the relief that applies to larger units?  We should be careful to bear in mind that there is no single best way of developing palliative care units.  Large units could be confined to large urban areas.  Small units are probably more appropriate to places like County Wexford, which has just six palliative care beds at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.  When the Department of Finance was drafting this legislation, it had to have regard to the advice of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, which was that palliative care units must be sustainable.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE examined the population figures and worked out how many beds should be in each unit if it is to qualify for a capital allowance.  If I were advising somebody who is developing a small palliative care unit, for example attached to a nursing home in a specific part of County Wexford in which 20 beds are not warranted, I would suggest that he or she should link up with the management of a number of other such units if he or she wishes to bring capital allowances into play.  The accountants of those who are developing palliative care units will advise them to work with other providers of such units.  The provision introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, whereby those who earn large incomes must pay a certain minimum level of tax, will apply in this instance.  These allowances are being made available in that context.  If somebody who is paying the minimum level of tax required under the Minister&rsquo;s restrictive provision wishes to invest in a palliative care unit, he or she will not get any extra tax relief.  The limit that is in place will stay in place.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 88, before section 57, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    
        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;CHAPTER 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5"><i>Importation of vehicles &mdash; VRT</i></P>
        <P LI="2">57.&mdash;A new vehicle registered in the State and subject to the emissions-based VRT regime shall not in that respect be treated less favourably than a second hand vehicle not already registered in the State which is brought into the State.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I note that recommendation No. 18 has been ruled out of order as not relevant.  There is a great deal of confusion about the changes in respect of vehicle registration tax, VRT, as all public representatives are aware.  People are asking me to work out the table and whether they should buy before the changeover.  I am about to change my car when I leave the House today and have had to work it out myself.</P>
        <P>Information is needed because there is little information available on-line and one has to enter one&rsquo;s calculations on-line in order to figure out how it will work.  That one cannot use a table on-line and has to use a calculator shows how complex it is.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is famous for his ability to think on his feet.  I am baffled by the procedure and do not know where what I want to say fits into the recommendations but I crave the Minister&rsquo;s indulgence to make a few points that are part of the wider hinterland of the Bill.  These concern the simplification of information about the tax code.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s financial affairs compared with mine are pristine and were an accountant&rsquo;s dream.  Like most members of the public I am as terrified of a tax audit as Americans famously are.  It is said that Americans would rather be mugged than tax audited.  Most PAYE workers find the tax code a nightmare and a morass.  VRT is only symbolic of this.  The result is that many PAYE workers are overtaxed because they do not understand what is going on.  Time and again I meet fellow workers in my industry who are not being taxed correctly and are usually taxed at a loss to themselves because they do not understand the system.  The Minister needs to take on the question of clarifying and simplifying information on all aspects of the tax system, not just VRT.</P>
        <P>Many of my fellow workers feel it is too much hassle and too difficult to work their way through the system to bother lodging a claim to get the money back.  Health expenses are a prime example of this.  It should be possible for dentists, doctors and pharmacists to give relief at source.</P>

	<P>I know the Minister takes this seriously.  I am concerned that Revenue seems to press most strongly on those who are tax compliant because it is easier to deal with them.  Those who are not tax compliant are more trouble than they are worth.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners need powers and I would give the Criminal Assets Bureau all the powers it needs to track down criminals.  I am fully in favour of giving the utmost Eliot Ness powers to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of criminals.  In respect of the public, however, the Revenue Commissioners need to change their culture and take a more liberal and compassionate view of the genuine difficulties most people have in understanding the tax code.  We should <Col N="2016"/>make the distinction between compliant business entities and the criminal classes.  Our legislation and the information on legislation is not set in stone.

	<P>I have a recommendation.  Tax simplification is vital for small businesses and the current tax treatment for private individuals and for the small business sector places a significant burden on them in making their returns.

	<P Just="Left">As one who tries to do my own small bit in my constituency I share his view about the complexity of the information on this matter and intend to speak to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, about it.</P>
        <P>In respect of recommendation No. 17, vehicle registration tax is charged at the time of registration in the State.  Under the revised system, the VRT rate applicable to new cars and used imported cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 will be determined by the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission rating of the car and no longer will be related to engine size.  In so far as used cars imported after 1 July are concerned the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of a car presented for registration in the State will have to be declared to the Revenue Commissioners on form VRT4 at the time of registration by the person registering the vehicle.  The declaration will be required to be supported by documentary evidence of the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of the car.  Acceptable documentary evidence of the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions will include a certificate of conformity for the particular model.</P>
        <P>Since 2001 EU law requires CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions levels to be cited in this document or a previous registration certificate, a certificate from the manufacturer or distributor or an organisation approved by the Revenue Commissioners to provide such certificates.  Where a certificate of measurement concerning CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> levels for a vehicle is not available and does not satisfy the Revenue Commissioners, VRT will be charged on registration at the maximum rate allowable, 36%.  Such a VRT rating would be open to an appeal through the VRT appeal system.  Second-hand imported vehicles therefore will be subject to a similarly rigorous evaluation of carbon dioxide <Col N="2017"/>emissions as subsequent classification for the purposes of VRT as a new vehicle presented for registration in the State and will not be treated more favourably than a new car.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry approached me in state of great concern when this scheme was first announced and this was their main bone of contention.  However, it is now satisfied with the Minister&rsquo;s proposals on VRT that there will not be discrimination as between new and second-hand cars.  The change in the motor taxation system will be a new day&rsquo;s work and we will need to look anew.</P>
        <P>I take the point made by Senator Harris about information.  Dealing with the Revenue or visiting a tax office is now a pleasure compared to when I started in the politics business more years ago than I care to recall or relate.  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing to do everything to make the tax system more user-friendly.  They have introduced information lines for the various tax headings such as CAT and PAYE.  They have introduced a facility for completing tax returns on-line and tax information may be obtained through a mobile phone text service or from any one of the 600 friendly counter staff.  Every effort is made to publicise tax reliefs.</P>
        <P>I have fought various referenda campaigns on behalf of various Governments.  It seems the more information made available to people the more confused they become.  The one complaint on the doorsteps up to the date of the referendum will be, &ldquo;Sure, I know nothing about this.  Nobody is telling me anything about it&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Revenue Commissioners enclose with the annual tax-free allowance certificate a user-friendly and easy to read document which highlights all the allowances to which a taxpayer is entitled.  I take the Senator&rsquo;s point that it would be preferable if more allowances could be claimed at source so that people would be guaranteed to receive them.  In so far as is possible, the Revenue Commissioners have systems in place to claim tax relief at source.  For example, if a person can prove he or she is over 65 years of age with an income not exceeding the exemption limit, the bank or financial institution is permitted to exempt their account from DIRT.  Mortgage interest can be claimed at source.</P>
        <P>There are difficulties with claiming certain reliefs such as medical expenses because there are so many providers of medical services who cost and bill in different ways.  The same applies to relief on refuse charges, a point which has been raised in the House.  Banks and financial institutions are experienced in dealing with mortgages, tax and documents but waste companies are in the business of processing waste rather than dealing with financial transactions and documents.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners can use information data on date of birth to apply age-related relief at source.  They have an arrangement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to provide relief <Col N="2018"/>at source for drugs supplied.  They are working on a system for introducing medical relief at source and also service charges.  I can assure the House that efforts are ongoing in this regard.  They are publicising their more user-friendly services.  They are easier to communicate with and are providing as much tax relief at source as is possible and this will continue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Recommendations Nos. 19 and 21 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 19:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 108, before section 82, to insert the following new section:</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 3</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">VAT ON DEFIBRILLATORS</P>
        <P FLI="0">82.&mdash;Any defibrillator sold or supplied after the passing of this Act shall be exempt from VAT.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard this recommendation as very important but it also bothers me the most.  It relates to the exemption of VAT on defibrillators.  I acknowledge the cross-party agreement with the spirit of this recommendation.  There should be no VAT charged on defibrillators or at least a reduction in the rate of VAT charged.  In my view VAT should not be charged on defibrillators.  The charge is a disgrace and is ridiculous in this day and age, especially with the publicity afforded to sudden death syndrome.  Everybody must know somebody who could have benefited from the use of a defibrillator but who is no longer with us.</P>
        <P>Sports organisations and voluntary groups are increasingly attempting to purchase defibrillators in order to help those who suffer from cardiac arrest.  Sporting organisations correctly believe they are particularly in need of these devices in light of the publicity regarding the prevalence of sudden death syndrome.  It is a great concern that many of these young people must fund-raise to buy these defibrillators with the additional bur<Col N="2019"/>den of this VAT rate of 21%.  A defibrillator is hardly a luxury item.</P>
        <P>More than 5,000 people die each year in Ireland from sudden cardiac death.  Communities and groups all over Ireland are fund-raising to provide equipment and training on defibrillators.  Removal of the VAT burden will greatly encourage these people in their self-help campaigns.  Research has shown that the provision of this equipment can greatly reduce deaths across all age groups.  Defibrillators allow early intervention which is vital to survival.  The faster basic defibrillation can be provided to a patient who has suffered cardiac arrest, the better their chances of survival.</P>
        <P>I am not the first person to raise this issue and I probably will not be the last.  At a recent meeting in Roscrea in my constituency I listened with incredulity to a local activist describing the amount of VAT payable in order to provide these devices to a number of sporting and community organisations across the town.</P>
        <P>The Minister will say this issue cannot be addressed because of EU rules.  I have heard this excuse before on a number of occasions.  I ask the Minister to convey my concerns to the Minister for Finance who has been innovative in using mechanisms in the past in order to facilitate certain tax schemes and grants.  It is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo; but if this regulation cannot be changed because of EU law, I ask him to consider some form of mechanism to allow some grant or tax rebate to organisations in order to counteract this VAT rate of 21% being charged on these devices.  This would be a welcome move and a practical solution.  We are talking about saving lives and especially the lives of young people.  I hope for the Minister&rsquo;s support.</P>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Again, this is a VAT related issue.  All charges between VAT-registered entities should be free of VAT on the production of the requisite certificate.  This is not dissimilar to what happens in many other European countries.  Utility charges is a good example.  This would do much to help prime the pump that is so badly needed at this time of economic correction.  I ask the Minister to consider the wider implications.  I realise he does not have to answer in terms of this particular recommendation, but I should be obliged to hear his views on the general operation of VAT between VAT-registered entities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a defibrillator in the boot of every Garda vehicle, in every fire brigade and in most doctors&rsquo; surgeries, including my own &mdash; and this is tax deductible as a practice expense.  That basically leaves community and sporting organisations who are seeking this VAT exemption.  It is well within the financial par<Col N="2020"/>ameters of Government for the HSE to give a grant to the value of the VAT, which is the quickest way around this, for the issue to be dealt with. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I appreciate the health concerns that form the basis of this recommendation, it should be understood that in matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance and the Government are constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law &mdash; with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service depends on its nature, and not on the status of the consumer.  Accordingly, there is no provision in EU VAT law that permits the removal or reduction of VAT based on the social or economic status of the consumer.</P>
        <P>As regards the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, under the VAT directive, member states must maintain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods or services.  The zero rate cannot, therefore, be applied to defibrillators, which are subject to the standard rate.  In addition, member states may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under annex 3 of the VAT directive.  While annex 3 includes the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use.  The reduced rate therefore cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Exemptions from VAT are also governed by EU law and under the VAT directive we are not permitted to exempt the supply of defibrillators.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey makes the point that if somebody, such as a doctor, pays VAT on a defibrillator for use in his or her business, he or she can claim that as an input against the VAT bill.  On the other hand, charities, community organisations etc. are exempt from VAT and therefore have no way of claiming back the VAT they pay on a defibrillator.  It is open to any member state to provide a grant equivalent to the amount of VAT paid &mdash; and for repayment to made in that way.  That is an option.  Other countries are not doing it, however.  It has been done once here as regards the Band Aid concert, when CDs were sold.  As VAT on those CDs was 21%, the State agreed, as a once-off initiative, to repay a grant roughly equivalent to the amount of VAT paid.  I believe the British Government did something similar.  It is an option.  Having said that, the Government is already investing a great deal of money, both directly and indirectly, in charitable organisations &mdash; as regards allowing the offset of tax for donations to charities.  Charities are well looked after, too, under the stamp duty regime, as are community associations.  I could go through all the various outlays, but I know Senators are aware, generally, what is being done for charities and community organisations.</P><Col N="2021"/>
        <P>With regard to the specific suggestion of providing a grant for people who cannot claim relief against their VAT, I certainly bring to the notice of the Minister for Finance what has been said by Senators Harris, Kelly and Twomey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  This is something simple for which the Government will get quite an amount of support, and kudos, if it can introduce a practical step in this regard.  Communities know their requirements.  In many cases they seek to get defibrillators on the basis of something that has happened or been narrowly avoided, perhaps, which spurs them on, etc.  People know their communities and their own requirements. I do not believe people will overstretch themselves in the sense that they will look for too many.  There is no issue as regards the Exchequer.  </P>
        <P>The suggestion by Senator Twomey and the Minister that some form of grant mechanism &mdash; as instanced in the precedent outlined &mdash; might be put in place is welcome.  I believe there would be unanimity on that and if it were to be put forward everybody would support it.  I suggest the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, emphasises this when speaking to his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This proposes the Minister makes regulations providing for relief in respect of VAT for registered charities, provided they comply with such regulations including requirements as to accountability and financial transparency, as may be prescribed.  The Minister has hit on this earlier today.  I am looking at how charities may be exempted from VAT.  A number of specific reliefs relate to charitable activities.  I have seen them outlined in leaflets that are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Would it not be a good recommendation, that once such organisations had satisfied the require<Col N="2022"/>ments as regards accountability and financial transparency, they be exempt from VAT?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>This recommendation has been proposed on many occasions over the past number of years.  There are a number of reasons why the proposal could not be resolved through the Finance Bill process, the primary one being that such VAT refund schemes are no longer possible under EU VAT law.  Further to this, the real question is whether VAT refunds are the most appropriate intervention in the first place, when more targeted grants, based on public policy priorities, would be a more effective use of Exchequer funds. </P>
        <P>In terms of legislation, the position is that the VAT regime and rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law &mdash; with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under EU law it is not possible to remove or reduce the VAT rate for a particular customer &mdash; in  this case charities, or indeed, educational institutions &mdash; as the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by its nature and not by the category of customer.  It would therefore not be possible to remove or reduce VAT paid by charities.  Furthermore, under Council Directive 2006/112/EC &mdash; charities &mdash; bodies supplying educational services and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot, therefore, recover VAT incurred on goods and services they might purchase.  Essentially only VAT-registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question whether charities could be refunded by the introduction of a ministerial order, the position is that these have been used in a limited way in the past to provide refunds of VAT on certain aids and appliances for the disabled, and on medical equipment donated voluntarily to hospitals, equipment and buildings used by water rescue organisations and humanitarian goods for export.  These orders are focused and designed to target specific circumstances.  However, under EU law, it is no longer possible to introduce new schemes within the VAT Act 1972, to relieve charities or other exempt bodies from the obligation to pay VAT on goods and services which they provide.</P>
        <P>EU law precludes removing or refunding the VAT which charities and exempt bodies are required to pay under the taxation system.  This view is also held by the European Commission, which has stated that while charities cannot be refunded through the VAT system, there is nothing to prevent national Governments paying charities a subsidy to compensate them for the <Col N="2023"/>irrecoverable VAT which they have incurred, provided that State aid rules are observed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to note that the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, ICTRG, understands that charities cannot be granted VAT refunds through the tax system.  However, it is seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of VAT charities must pay on business inputs.  Given that Exchequer funding is made available to very many charitable organisations, this is in effect already happening.  The 140 bodies represented by the ICTRG already acknowledge that they receive &euro;8.6 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer.  However, there are more than 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners.  A recent report carried out by Trinity College on behalf of charities estimates that their annual spend is approximately &euro;2.5 billion per annum.   If even a small part of this sum were subject to a VAT refund, the cost would be astronomical.</P>
        <P>The ICTRG will argue that it represents the largest charities but that is not the case as many health, educational and sports organisations are also registered with the Revenue Commissioners as charitable or not-for-profit organisations.  Therefore, the introduction of a grant <i>in lieu</i> of VAT paid by registered charities would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies, such as schools, hospitals and sports organisations, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a refund scheme.  These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the arguments that have been made on the refund scheme in Denmark, the only EU member state to operate such a scheme, it should be understood that Denmark only operates a single VAT rate for all goods and services of 25%.  This is the highest in Europe.  Ireland operates a far broader regime and has three VAT rates &mdash; 0%, 13.5% and 21%.  The grant scheme in Denmark is limited to a number of charities that benefit from the tax relief on donation scheme.  However, the Danish donation scheme is far more limited than ours, with almost half the number of charities able to avail of it.  In Denmark, educational institutions do not qualify for charitable status, which would preclude them from receiving any tax relief.</P>
        <P>While just one country might be offering a VAT refund scheme, this must be considered in the context of the overall environment in which such schemes operate.  In this regard, it should be noted that our tax code currently provides exemptions for charities from income tax, DIRT, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and dividend withholding tax.  Moreover, charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and which, for the first time, allowed tax relief generally without any upper limit on <Col N="2024"/>personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies.  The relief is based on the marginal rate which, for an individual donor, could be as high as 41%.  In the case of donations in the PAYE sector, the relief is given directly to the charities.</P>
        <P>Even if funds were available for grant-aiding charities and other voluntary groups, I am not sure the most appropriate use of the funds would involve relieving charities of the VAT paid on inputs as opposed to grant-aiding their activities using other criteria, as has already been done.  It is the role of the Government and the Oireachtas to decide on the distribution of tax revenue for the public good and we should not lightly give up our role in this case.  Since the mechanism that would have to be used is a grant scheme, we would be agreeing in advance to give grant aid to a set of bodies based not an understanding of public policy priorities or the efficiency of the bodies concerned but on their spending profiles.  The proposed recommendation does not conform with this principle and therefore the grant scheme in question would be most unusual.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter I have placed on the Adjournment is the need for the Minister for Education and Science to publish a complete list of all school projects in the building programme together with indicative times for completion.  The predecessor of the Minister for <Col N="2026"/>Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, published lists of all school buildings, which included priority ratings and indicative dates of construction.  This brought a much needed measure of transparency and openness of information into the process which, up to then, had been secretive.  In general, school communities were of the opinion that the system was fair.</P>
        <P>When Deputy Mary Hanafin became Minister for Education and Science, she abandoned this system and, since taking office, has not published a comprehensive picture of the building programme.  Many schools have been waiting for years for an indication of when their projects will commence.  No lists are available and there is a major lack of transparency in the issue, which leads to accusations of political interference within the schools building programme.</P>
        <P>The neglect shown to the issue of school buildings by this Government is something which we now are seeing all too often.  Schools in this country have entered into financial crisis and this is plain to see.  Soaring water charges, under-resourced classes, overcrowded classrooms and the underinvestment in education by the Twenty-six Counties Government, most especially in the primary sector, are truly appalling.</P>
        <P>I received an e-mail yesterday from a mother whose three children attend the Holy Rosary School in Oldcourt, Dublin.  This school is a prime example of the incompetence of the Government to provide assistance to schools most in need.  The mother&rsquo;s eldest child attends class in a prefab which is freezing every morning and unbearably hot every afternoon.  The child constantly suffers from a cold because of this.  The home-school liaison teacher has a small desk in one of the corridors of the school due to lack of space.  Most worryingly, reports were made last week of there being rats in the school and of a child stepping on one of them.  This seems to be a worrying, all too frequent trend in many schools.</P>
        <P>In my constituency in Donegal there is a school, Scoil Mhuire in Creeslough, in which children must sit three to a seat and, in some classrooms, they sit on the floor because of the simple fact that there is just not enough space for desks.  The classrooms and their size are described as unsuitable for many of today&rsquo;s subjects such as practical science.  This school desperately needs extra space, more classrooms and a full upgrading of the existing facilities.  A spokesperson for the school&rsquo;s board of management has stated that it is more than three years since it first submitted its proposals for improvements to the Minister for Education and Science but, officially, they have heard nothing in return.  They are left in the dark.  This is a completely unfair and unacceptable way to treat pupils, teachers and parents.</P>
        <P>These incidences are not isolated and there are many other schools in such a position.  For example, the parents of pupils at Gortahork national school, also in my constituency, were forced to withdraw their pupils because of its con<Col N="2027"/>dition.  They were promised a new school six years ago but they still await the commencement of the project.  Glenswilly national school, which has been seeking an extension since 1992, has called itself &ldquo;Seeking a New Extension since 1992 Glenswilly National School&rdquo;, as an example of their frustration with the Department and the schools building programme.</P>
        <P>In Ballinamore, County Leitrim, the Government committed in 2001 to a new comprehensive school but, seven years on, pupils, parents and teachers are still waiting.  When the Minister visited the town recently, she slated the parents and board of management for contacting her Department daily.  What are parents, teachers and pupils to do if they are still waiting after seven years and have to travel in the pouring rain between classrooms for their education?  It is terrible in this day and age.</P>
        <P>Another example is a school in Galway which had to import smaller desks because normal-sized desks would not fit owing to the number of pupils in the school.  There is a need to produce a list but, with no list available as to times of completion of all school projects in the building programme, these and countless other parents, pupils and teachers are completely in the dark and have no idea when improvements will be made.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State think that any child deserves this ordeal on a daily basis?  Does he think that any child deserves to sit in a freezing cold classroom day in, day out, where they potentially could pick up a lethal disease from rat urine should they come into contact with it?  These schools and countless others throughout the country need answers.  For too long they have been kept in the dark, for too long they have been left waiting and wondering, and for too long pupils have attended class in conditions not befitting an animal.</P>
        <P>I will finish by reading a poem sent to me by an 11 year old student in her frustration at what was happening.  She has now left primary education but she wrote the following to the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Bertie Ahern</P>
        <P LI="1">I&rsquo;m sending you this letter for your concern.</P>
        <P LI="1">You have ignored us time after time</P>

        <P LI="1">All we want is a proper building for our school.</P>
        <P LI="1">How can this be so impossible for you to do?</P>
        <P LI="1">Our school is better than the best,</P>
        <P LI="1">Why can&rsquo;t  we just have a proper building like the rest?</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10">Next year I&rsquo;ll be leaving primary school for good</P>
        <P LI="1">And in a proper building I have never stood.</P><Col N="2028"/>
        <P LI="1">I think you should hang your head in shame</P>
        <P LI="1">For all your excuses have been so lame.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10">There is one other thing that I should point out to you,</P>
        <P LI="1">In a few years&rsquo; time we&rsquo;ll be voters too.</P>
        <P LI="1">I think I&rsquo;ll be a politician when I grow up,</P>
        <P LI="1">So my party will drive Fianna F&aacute;il into the muck.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10">I&rsquo;ll make sure every child has a building for their school,</P>
        <P LI="1">That&rsquo;s how my party will rule.</P>
        <P LI="1">So come on Bertie, give us our school!</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a poem by an 11 year old child.  It shows the frustration felt by the children of this nation because they have to be taught in such conditions.  I ask the Minister to address my central issue by letting us know when the schools will be built and giving us an indicative timeframe.  Take schools out of the dark and publish the list, as the predecessor of the current Minister for Education and Science did, to introduce some accountability into the school programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, I am glad to be given the opportunity to outline the position on the schools building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>This year, more than &euro;586 million is being provided by the Government for school buildings.  This will allow significant progress to be made on new schools, extensions and refurbishments throughout the country.  Commitments arising from contractual commitments entered into during 2007 and in earlier years have a first call on the capital allocation for 2008.  These commitments include 67 large-scale projects that were under construction during 2007 and most of these will reach practical completion during the course of 2008.  More than 100 permanent accommodation and small school scheme projects commenced during 2007 and all these projects will be completed in 2008.  Commitments also arise on other programmes that commenced during 2007.  These include commitments given in respect of contingency and emergency works, furniture and equipment applications and outstanding balances due on the 2007 summer works scheme.</P>
     
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At the beginning of February, the Minister announced the large-scale building projects approved to commence construction this year.  These projects will deliver 13 new schools and two extensions at primary level, two new schools and one extension at post-primary level and a further 30 new primary schools in rapidly developing areas, planned to be in place by next September. <Col N="2029"/> These schools are the first phase of the projects that are due to go to construction in 2008.  The next announcement regarding projects to proceed to construction will occur after Easter.  The Minister intends to make further announcements regarding projects that will be advanced through the architectural planning process during the course of the year as the school building programme is rolled out.</P>
        <P>The Minister also confirmed in the February announcement that the 254 projects previously announced under the permanent accommodation and small schools schemes that had not at that time commenced construction, should position themselves to go on site and complete their works during the course of 2008.  Throughout the year the Department will also fund a number of other important elements of the schools building and modernisation programme.  These include applications received from schools relating to emergencies that arise such as roof damage and applications for temporary accommodation.</P>

        <P>Rather than publishing one large list, the Department of Education and Science manages the schools building programme on a rolling basis, with announcements made throughout the year.  The number of projects on the programme and their place on it changes constantly.  It would, therefore, not be appropriate to publish one large list.  The approach adopted by the Department, with progress being made all the time, is far preferable to one big bang announcement as it ensures that it helps to create a pipeline so that there is a smooth flow of projects through all stages.</P>
        <P>I assure the Senator that the Minister and her Department are committed to providing sufficient school places in developing areas and to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Under the rolling basis methodology, the Minister will announce further details during the year in the context of priority and budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister says it is preferable to keep pupils, parents and boards of management in the dark and not publish a large list.  This is only preferable for the Department and not for parents, teachers and pupils.  The Minister of State must know of the frustration among the community in terms of the schools building programme.  Nobody expects every school will be modernised tomorrow morning or next week, but we need an indication to be given to communities throughout the State as to where they are on the list and when they will be provided with a timeframe for the work.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the Minister knows the information.  When my party asked a parliamentary question with regard to the number of prefabs being used as classrooms, she did not have that information.  When we asked how many schools were rat infested, she could say that six were <Col N="2030"/>reported, but acknowledged that many more were.  I question whether the information is available.  Is the failure to produce a list and the keeping of schools in the dark a way of hiding the Minister&rsquo;s lack of accountability?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the matter of the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline if the Government is fully committed to providing funding for the operation of the CT scanner that has been lying idle in Nenagh General Hospital for almost a year and to provide an indicative date for the commencement of its use.</P>
        <P>This is one of the biggest farces of the HSE, and all involved in politics in my part of the country accept it is a farce.  The CT scanner in Nenagh hospital was announced with great fanfare in April 2006 by two of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues, including the current Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor.  This new scanner would mean approximately 500 patients would not have to be ferried to Limerick for scans.  It is now March 2008 and the CT scanner is still sitting in its own unit in Nenagh hospital with the plastic on it.  It has never been used.</P>
        <P>The work on the CT unit was completed in June 2007, but there has been no movement since.  I visited the hospital with my party leader Deputy Eamon Gilmore. The issue, however, is such an embarrassment to the HSE that it would not permit us to view the new unit, despite the fact we had journalists and photographers with us.  We were barred from seeing the new CT scanner in case we photographed.  I pointed out that I could download a similar photograph from the Internet and use it, but that made no difference.  The CT scanner is an embarrassment to the hospital.</P>
        <P>This issue has a wider impact than the matter of whether scans are provided in the hospital.  It has a significant impact on the service being provided by the ambulance service, a matter I have raised in the House previously.  The ambulance service is stretched for a number of reasons.  It is now down to one stretcher and capacity is halved.  The same ambulance service, which can operate only one ambulance in the evening, ferries people in and out to Limerick.  If there is an emergency on the N7 or nearby, the ambulance may be doing the job of ferrying people to Limerick for scans, despite the fact there is a scanner lying idle in the hospital to which the ambulance is attached.  This is ridiculous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand from the HSE that when the manager of Nenagh hospital applied to get eleven <Col N="2031"/>people to run the unit, he was told Bantry hospital could do it with 6.5 people.  I understand the hospital in Ennis got approval through the National Hospitals Office for 6.5 people to run a scanner, despite the fact it does not have one.  Nenagh got no approval, although it does have a scanner.  I pointed out this several times previously.</P>
        <P>The budget for Nenagh hospital is approximately &euro;22 million for 2008, an increase of approximately &euro;75,000.  Medical inflation runs at 10% and with the way general inflation is going this is an effective drop in the budget of 12%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Inflation is going down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>With medical inflation included, the budget is effectively reduced by 12.5%.  This means Nenagh hospital was under funded for this year, but it has always spent over the allocated funding.  The manager has been told he must fund the CT scanner and the people to operate it from current funds.  That is impossible for him.  He already has approximately 35 people employed who, according to the HSE, should not be employed.  How then is he meant to provide for the scanner?</P>
        <P>The hospital already suffers from the fact that the elderly care unit was closed over Christmas.  A team work report is due and it will consider the role of the hospital. Many of us are worried that report will have an impact on accident and emergency services and on the clinical area.  The hospital has already closed many of its wards and now provides just 75 beds.</P>
        <P>We have been told that in order to run the CT scanner the hospital needs specialist radiography staff and a clinical nurse specialist.  I understand that.  However, the response to the situation from the HSE is laughable.  It does not come back with a response to queries for days.  When it does come back with an answer, it is so generic it is useless.  The hospital manager provides as much up-to-date information as he can at his forums, which I attend but which are not usually attended by the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Hoctor.  However, information from the manager is not the issue.  The problem is we cannot get an answer from the HSE as to when it will put in use this badly needed scanner that is sitting idle.  Its operation would also have a dramatic impact on the ambulance service in the area.</P>
        <P>The HSE has stated that all options are being explored at present in order to commence this diagnostic service at the earliest possible date.  That is complete and utter waffle.  It should provide an indicative date.  It should give us a date for which the hospital manager can budget.  Perhaps the date could be provided before the publication of the team work report relating to Nenagh hospital and other small hospitals which <Col N="2032"/>is due in April.  It is an indication of the lack of joined-up thinking if it is provided later.</P>
        <P>The situation is an embarrassment for the HSE, the Government and local government representatives in the area, Deputies Hoctor and Lowry.  I look forward to a response.We need to know when it will be opened and we need an indicative date.  We need to know if the hospital will get the funding.  A sum of &euro;22 million to run that hospital simply will not work.  I beg the Minister of State not to begin his response by saying that this is a matter for the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  Senator Kelly does not want to hear it but the facts are that the provision of services at Nenagh General Hospital and across the mid-west region in general is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The Government is committed to providing a high-quality service to all patients.  Nenagh General Hospital, which has 81 beds, provides a range of acute services for the people of north Tipperary.</P>
        <P>The HSE advises that the staffing and budget of Nenagh General Hospital has increased significantly over recent years.  The revenue budget for the hospital has more than doubled from &euro;8.5 million in 2000 to &euro;20.5 million in 2007.  Staffing levels at the hospital have increased from 182 in 2000 to 248 in 2007.  The additional staffing includes the appointment of four dedicated emergency care physicians providing round the clock medical cover for the accident and emergency department.  On the capital side, &euro;2.74 million has been invested to facilitate new developments and upgrades in the accident and emergency department, the laboratory department, the X-ray department and the development of CT scanning</P>
        <P>The HSE acknowledges that additional staff are required to facilitate the introduction of a CT scanning service at Nenagh General Hospital.  The commissioning of services flowing from the capital developments completed in the recent past, including the CT scanner, will be considered by the HSE within its overall budget.  Various options are being explored at present to commence this diagnostic service at the earliest possible date.  The HSE will continue to do all it can to ensure the provision of a high-quality, patient-focused service to the people of north Tipperary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a great deal of respect for what I hope the Minister of State is trying to do in the area of innovation.  However, both he and I know that what he had to read out was a load of waffle.  He did not even have the spirit to read it in a good tone.</P>
        <P>I have a very simple question.  Could the Minister of State pass on to the Minister for Health and Children a request that this be dealt with one way or another before the publication of the Teamwork report?  Otherwise, there will be no <Col N="2033"/>joined-up thinking.  Can we have an answer one way or another before the expected publication of the Teamwork report in the first week in April?  The report could be published later on in April.  If we do not get an answer, the Teamwork report could override it, which would be a war in itself.  There will then be concerns about whether this is outside or inside it.  We need a date and to know whether it will be opened.  It is an embarrassment.  We need to know whether the scanner and its facilities will be used because people see this as a symbol of how the hospital is treated and whether this Government believes it has a future.  By not opening it, a clear signal is being given that, unfortunately, the Government does not have faith in maintaining the hospital in the future, which is something we all must fight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise that matter with the Minister.  In respect of the Senator&rsquo;s comment about not maintaining the hospital, a few years ago, I listened to the debate on Nenagh General Hospital and arguments that it was to be downgraded.  When one sees the extra staffing and funding for the hospital, one can see that the Government intends to ensure the hospital continues and provides a better service to the people of the Senator&rsquo;s area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The matter I am raising on the Adjournment concerns the future of the domiciliary birth service, which is more commonly known as the home birth service, in this country and, in particular, the immediate threat that indemnity cover will be removed for independent midwives who really provide the home birth service to women who choose to birth their children in their own homes.</P>
        <P>The model of maternity care in this country has changed significantly over the past 100 years or so.  We have moved from what was largely a system of home births to one which is now largely a hospital-based service.  In 2001, which is the last year for which I have complete figures, fewer than 1% of births occurred at home.  There is a need to reorient the maternity care services to provide a woman-centred model of maternity care which facilitates choice among women and also continuity of care.</P>
        <P>Independent midwives have been told that indemnity cover will be removed from them at the end of this month.  This will leave them with a choice between operating without indemnity cover, which would not be desirable, or ceasing to practise.  I am sure the Government would not <Col N="2034"/>like to see this situation arise.  I call on the Department of Health and Children to provide at least an extension of cover until the issue can be resolved.  I know there are certain issues relating to clinical governance and so on which need to be resolved, but I ask that this would happen.</P>
        <P>Looking back at what the Government has done, I know an expert group on domiciliary or home births was set up in January 1997 and that three pilot projects were set up.  In 2003, a domiciliary births group was established which made recommendations arising from an evaluation of the outcomes of those pilot projects.  The evaluation confirmed the feasibility and safety of home births and stated that when these home births were adequately resourced, there were high levels of satisfaction for clients and staff.</P>
        <P>There are issues relating to home births.  They are most suitable for low-risk women and there is an issue about identifying women for whom home births are most suitable.  The recruitment and retention of experienced and competent midwives is another issue that arises.  Unfortunately, the profession of midwifery is suffering a collapse of morale because of the lack of recognition of the expertise that midwives have, particularly in terms of providing woman-centred care in the community.  The role of the midwife is integral to models of care which promote normality in the birth process.  This is the major objection some women have to the hospital-based model of care towards which we have increasingly moved.  They believe birth is medicalised and almost industrialised rather than being a natural, normal process that occurs in the most natural way possible which supports women in the process of giving birth.</P>
        <P>It is important that any home birth service that is provided nationally is backed up by a modern hospital system in case a transfer proves necessary.  Unfortunately, independent midwives who operate in the community frequently complain about a lack of co-operation from local general hospitals in terms of providing scans or tests for women whom they are preparing for home birth.</P>
        <P>A range of maternity services could be provided in the community, including home birth services but also including midwife-led units which are very close to that and which are either attached to or part of general hospitals.  We need an expansion of community-based midwifery-led services.  I asked the Government today to clarify what its vision was for the future development of home birth services.  Judging from the situation the domiciliary birth service is in at the moment, it appears the Government may be neglecting it to such an extent that it will disappear and the choices available to women will be restricted to hospital-based choices.</P>
        <P>I mentioned clinical governance.  An Bord Altranais has a competency framework which governs the practise of midwifery but there is a need for clinical governance structures which should be established at national, regional and <Col N="2035"/>local levels to support the development of new models of maternity care.</P>
        <P>There appears to be no statutory basis for the provision of domiciliary births.  The Nurses Act 1985 requires health boards to supervise midwives who practise outside health care institutions.  However, there are no regulations to implement this provision.  There are a variety of arrangements in different Health Service Executive areas throughout the country concerning the payment of grants for home or domiciliary births.  This is unfair.  A woman living in one part of the country might find it easy to access a grant for a home birth while a woman in another area might find it difficult to do so.  This practice needs to be standardised throughout the country.  I have mentioned how indemnity cover is a problem for independent midwives who are largely involved in supervising and carrying out home births.</P>
        <P>As a party in Government, the Green Party is asking for evidence that the Government has thought through and is proactively pursuing a policy to develop and support domiciliary births and other models of maternity care that are not exclusively hospital-based in order to provide choice to mothers of the most natural possible systems of maternity care, which in the long run will be in the interests of the mother and child.  It would also be considerably less expensive than hospital births.  There are increasing fears of litigation leading to considerably more intervention in the birth process, including the use of caesarean sections, etc.  If we had more natural birth processes that were supervised and with the right supports available if necessary, it would be considerably more economical for the State.  The Government must address this issue.  If action is not taken now and a clear vision is not articulated and pursued by the Government we will see home births die out and we will see independent midwives disappear, and the country would be poorer for it.  I look forward to the response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I will be responding on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Minister supports choice for women in childbirth.  However, the option of domiciliary births must be provided in a safe and secure manner.  A national implementation committee on domiciliary births has been set up by the HSE to implement the recommendations of a 2004 report on domiciliary births.  The committee has set up four sub-groups dealing with selection criteria and evidence base; legal, indemnity and grants; <Col N="2036"/>training and support for midwives; and development of maternity services.  Membership of both the national implementation committee and the sub-groups includes key stakeholders from the HSE, primary community and continuing care, the National Hospitals Office, population health, HR specialists, consumers of the service, midwives, obstetricians and neonatologists as well as the State Claims Agency, and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 19 midwives practising independently and they attend 200 to 300 births annually out of a total of 70,000 births nationwide.  The Minister is aware of concerns regarding indemnity insurance for independent midwives.  Independent or self-employed midwives are not employees of the public health service.  As the independent midwives are private operators who do not have service level agreements with the public health service it is not possible at present for them to come within the ambit of the clinical indemnity scheme administered by the State Claims Agency.  The Irish Nurses Organisation provides a certain level of insurance cover to independent midwives who are members of that organisation.  The INO had indicated that it would not be providing insurance cover after 31 March.  However, I understand that it has been in touch with its insurer about extending this cover until the end of September.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department of Health and Children are working with the HSE to put in place a robust national clinical governance framework in order to ensure that the practice of independent midwives is brought into close working relationships with maternity services delivered by the HSE and the voluntary maternity hospitals.  Subject to this being achieved it would then be the intention to bring the independent midwives within the scope of the clinical indemnity scheme by means of an extension of the cover under the scheme to the HSE.</P>

	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for the response, only the question regarding indemnity cover for domiciliary births was answered.  I also asked the Minister to outline her vision for the future development of the service and I am afraid nothing in the response gave me any hope for the future of the service other than the hope that a system will be put in place to extend indemnity cover.  I ask that the matter be brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and perhaps at a future state I can table another motion and get some more detail.</P>
