        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify the reason he has not approved funding for Westmeath County Council&rsquo;s application, given Athlone&rsquo;s gateway status, to provide the main drainage necessary to service the increased growth and development as required by the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify the current position in developing the 24 hour Garda station for north Inishowen both in terms of the personnel and the building of the new facility in Carndonagh, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am extremely concerned about the current situation as regards the pharmacists and their negotiations with the HSE.  There is still a deadline of 1 March in place.  There appears to be a great deal of intransigence on the part of the HSE and the Government in this regard. I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business as I want the Minister for Health and Children to outline her position and that of the Government in relation to the deadline of 1 March.  This matter needs urgent attention in the House today.</P>
        <P>Deputies and Senators from all sides of the Oireachtas spoke yesterday at the Joint Committee for Health and Children about their concerns in this regard.  Fine Gael was extremely concerned about the potential closure of rural pharmacies.  We are told many pharmacies will have to close and lose staff.  Patients will suffer, the vulnerable, the sick, the elderly who need to attend these pharmacies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In the event of their closure, these are the people who will suffer from a lack of service.  I want to move an amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business and I want the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the Seanad and explain the Government position.  Is the Government happy to leave in place the deadline of 1 March or will it remove it, appoint an independent arbitrator, as the Minister indicated as far back as December she wanted to see in place?  In the meantime, the HSE sent a letter to all the pharmacists asking them to sign the contract.  Can we have clarity <Col N="759"/>from the Minister on the Government&rsquo;s position in this regard?  Is the Government willing to change the deadline?  It was very clear from the HSE representatives at the health committee yesterday that if the Government were to give a different direction on this and show flexibility, negotiations could go ahead.  I want to move an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister to come to the Seanad today and inform the House what stance she and Government are taking on this issue. </P>

	<P>I want to return to a question I raised last week, because it was not answered by the Leader.  I asked why a crucial part of the national roads strategy campaign was not being implemented, namely, the speed cameras.  It seems from a report by Tim O&rsquo;Brien in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> that apparently the Government had shelved its plans to roll out a countrywide network.  I raise this issue because Mr. Gay Byrne, the chairman of the Road Safety Authority said he had been passed from three different Departments and did not get an answer.  He said he would do what he had indicated originally and possibly resign if he was not treated in a better manner.  I asked the Leader this question the other day.  He did not answer it but talked a good deal about driving on the right hand side of the road and  having different rules for foreigners, a suggestion bordering on the illegal.  That could not be implemented.  What is the Leader&rsquo;s understanding of the position as regards speed cameras, and what is the reply to Gay Byrne? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We often hear bad news on the Order of Business.  We should, however, recognise that internationally there is some very good news.  The electoral success of Mr. Barack Obama in the United States suggests that great country may at last be finding its conscience and moving away from the criminal enterprises of Mr. Bush.  I hope Guantanamo Bay will not be closed, but cleansed of the present inmates who are given due process and that Messrs Bush, Rumsfeld, Rove and Cheney will be sent there if they are found guilty as a result of a trial for international war crimes. </P>
        <P>I very much welcome another American event, that is, the heroic stance of Mr. Steven Spielberg in dissociating himself, as an adviser, to the Beijing Olympics because of the activities of the Chinese in terms of human rights.  I place that in the context of the attempt by the British Olympic committee to muzzle those persons attending.  This is a glorious opportunity to highlight issues such as the cultural genocide of Tibet and the extraordinary way in which the Chinese Government is operating as a colonial and imperialist power in Africa where it will buy up any quantity of raw materials, making the money directly <Col N="760"/>available to dictators and thereby undermining the leverage of our overseas development aid.</P>
        <P>I intend to withdraw the Civil Partnership Bill 2004 from the Order Paper in disgust at the way in which this matter is being treated.  It has been on the Order Paper for nearly four years.  I have taken it twice in my Private Members&rsquo; time.  I had thought of taking it again this time but I will not do so because I will not facilitate an evasive and queasy Government that appears to have no relish for this and has abrogated every undertaking given to me.  We were told to wait for the report of the Colley committee.  It went to the appropriate committee of both Houses, the committee on the family and the Constitution, and the Law Reform Commission.  They have reported in the same way and yet nothing has been done.  We were given an undertaking that the heads of a Bill at least would be prepared.  We have had the indications of legislation from the Chief Whip&rsquo;s office but there is no sign of it.  The heads of the Bill have not been prepared and have not been put before Cabinet.</P>
        <P>I am not prepared to wait any longer.  I attempted to behave in a very moderate way.  In the explanatory memorandum to my Bill I indicated that I would not use the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; in deference to the religious sensibilities of people but now I will.  I am now joining the campaign for full civil marriage for gay people in this country.  We are entitled to no less.  I am an equal citizen and if and when the Government eventually gets its courage together and introduces a Bill, I will wait to see how many people in this House are prepared to stand up and tell me that I am not worthy to have my relationships fully recognised, that I am a lesser human being than they are.  The argument about diminishing marriage and diminishing the rights of other people is precisely the argument that was countered so effectively by Daniel O&rsquo;Connell when it was used to try to deprive Roman Catholic citizens of the then United Kingdom of their full entitlements.  I am an equal citizen of this Republic and I will take no less than full and equal rights.</P>

	<P>To allow for the removal of the Bill, it will have to be included in today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  Does the Senator wish formally to move an amendment to have No. 6 taken before No. 1?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not want it taken at all.  I am signalling that I am going to remove it from the Order Paper because it is a waste of time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not at any stage thought it was appropriate or desirable that we should second-guess the proceedings of the Mahon tribunal.  I have always taken that view sternly and carefully.  Now that the Taoiseach has seen fit to go to the High Court as part of what appears to be an unrelenting attack on the Mahon tribunal, I ask the Cathaoirleach to facilitate a debate in this House and that the Taoiseach be invited here.  I do not think we have had the pleasure of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s presence in the House since we sat last September.  I ask the Leader and the Cathaoirleach to invite him to the House in order that we can have a debate on the importance of upholding and defending the integrity of the Mahon tribunal which was set up by an order of this and the other House in October 1997.  I am holding a copy of the motion moved by the current Leader, Senator Donie Cassidy, on 8 October 1997 stating that Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolved to set up what is now the Mahon tribunal.  It is extraordinary we have reached this point after all the debate we have had and after all the requests and demands by members of the Government and their supporters that we let the Mahon tribunal do its work.  How many times have we heard it said that we should let the tribunal do its work?  The Taoiseach does not wish to allow the Mahon tribunal to do its work.  He has now taken the extraordinary step of drawing into the debate an important principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  I do not want anyone to mention the Mahon tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what is happening.  A hugely important constitutional question is being raised by the Taoiseach.  I am entitled, as a Member of this House, of which the Mahon tribunal is a creature, to make the point that there ought to be a debate in this House, as there has been in the other House, in respect of the integrity of the Mahon tribunal.</P>
        <P>While the Taoiseach has not been in the House since I was elected to it, when he was here in September 1997 he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is unacceptable that people who have held high office and enjoyed a high degree of public trust should give evidence that is, in the words of the tribunal, unacceptable and untrue or deliberately conceal vital information from this House, or from a tribunal set up by this House.  There is no excuse for this.</P><Col N="762"/>
        <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach is now posing as a defender of the privilege of this and the other House in the action he proposes to take to the court in circumstances where he tells us he is instructed by lawyers to do so, when manifestly he has made the decision himself to go to court to seek to curtail the tribunal or prohibit it from asking him about &mdash; this is the extraordinary part &mdash; statements he has made in the D&aacute;il, one of the Houses that set up the very tribunal he is seeking to curtail.  Manifestly, there is a requirement for a debate in this regard.</P>
        <P>I know it is uncomfortable for members of the Government but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is said in the D&aacute;il is irrelevant to us and is a matter for the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach will be aware that I never overstay my welcome on the Order of Business.  I intend to finish on the following point.  The notion of a dig-out has passed into the political lexicon in this country.  There is no greater dig-out being afforded to the Taoiseach at present than the dig-out being given by his colleagues in Government &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il, the Greens and what is left of the PDs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The notion that the Taoiseach would seek through this ruse to undermine in a most serious way the work of the Mahon tribunal is a disgrace.  The silence of the Greens and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I did not know I had been silent, particularly this week.  It may be in order in the relatively short term to have a debate on the question of privilege, once the High Court has adjudicated on particular matters.  The use of privilege by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas is a matter that needs to be debated in 2008.  There is an onus on all of us to find out how and when it is used, and whether it is used effectively.</P>
        <P>The idea of how we comment on tribunals in general &mdash; there are other tribunals in place &mdash; has been an issue that has not reflected well on our political system.  Members of the Opposition parties in particular have been notoriously inconsistent.</P>

	<P>I am not talking about an individual tribunal.  In wider debates on this issue, Members should be consistent on whether they think tribunals should continue, close or whether the matters being determined by them should be decided by them or in these Chambers.  That is the problem.</P>

	<P>Where is the Senator&rsquo;s moral compass?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like a debate on aviation policy because if matters are not resolved regarding the ongoing debt at Cork Airport linked to its new terminal, it has been threatened that the future management of the airport will come under the auspices of the Dublin Airport Authority, which is contrary to a programme for Government commitment to work towards the independent management of both Cork and Shannon Airports as soon as possible.  Were the threat to come to pass, it would be regrettable.  The Minister for Transport needs to come to the House to discuss whether the debt will be waived completely or partially or whether the entire debt must be met by Cork Airport.  Those of us who represent the Cork region would like such a debate.</P>
        <P>I regret that Senator Norris has removed his Bill from the Order Paper because it helped to inform and forward the debate.  He may not be aware of a meeting in Government Buildings last week with representatives of gay and lesbian groups who were satisfied by the progress which will ensue from the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  The heads of the Bill will be available in March and it will be published in September.  The House will have the opportunity to pass that legislation which is very much part of the programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Frances Fitzgerald.  Given the deadline of 1 March, I hope the Leader agrees arbitration is vital and we will not get anywhere without negotiation.  Arbitration was promised previously and no one wants to see small towns and villages in rural Ireland dealt a blow if the Health Service Executive gets its way.  It is to be hoped something useful will emerge from the Joint Committee on Health and Children on it.</P>
        <P>Does the Leader agree on mature reflection that his suggestion last week about driving on the other side of the road was a cockamamie idea and a total scata bull&aacute;n?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>He probably meant well and a clarification from him would be important because his remarks took from the useful, good suggestions many Members from both sides made on the subject on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, a national evening newspaper reported that a 13 year old female non-national child was raped by a 16 year old.  I do not know if any other Member read the article but I am concerned as a parent that such a thing could happen.  Money has been paid over <Col N="765"/>and the family of the girl will not take action because it is within their culture.  I always understood rape to be a criminal act in this country and our laws must be obeyed by everybody, including immigrants, who are welcome.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader and the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on children facilitate a debate in the House as soon as possible with the relevant Minister, whether that is Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor or Deputy Brendan Smith?  This is outrageous.  It has to have been the most important story printed that day even though it was only a short article.  A 13 year old was raped and the Garda&rsquo;s hands are apparently tied because culture is involved.  If that is culture, I fail to understand the meaning of criminal intent.  Something must be done about it and I will continue to raise the matter until it is addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposed amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  Last week, I tried unsuccessfully to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  A full debate is warranted on the ongoing difficulties pharmacists are experiencing with the HSE.  It does not take a genius or a rocket scientist to realise that resolving the issue requires independent negotiations with no preconditions.  The Minister would do well to examine the past ten years of the peace process which show that preconditions are stumbling blocks to negotiations.  I urge the Leader to facilitate a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I propose that Government time be provided in the coming weeks for a debate in the Seanad on the issue of collusion.  The D&aacute;il debated the issue two weeks ago but no motion or proposed course of action arose from it.  We have an opportunity to put that right through a debate based on a motion agreed by all parties at the earliest possible opportunity.  More than 50 people were killed in this State directly as a result of collusion between Unionist paramilitaries and British State forces.  Nearly two years ago, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il passed unanimous motions calling on the British Government to establish a full and independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane but this was refused.  The British Government has also refused to co-operate fully with the investigation established by the Oireachtas.  We need, therefore, to revisit this crucial issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies for labouring the issue of the impending financial crisis hanging over the heads of many small and medium sized firms, which I also raised last week.  The issue is not making the headlines, although perhaps it should.  Approximately 6,000 farmers are awaiting payments for REPS 2 and 3, and the figure is increasing by about 4,000 every month.  This crisis has beset farmers who legitimately joined REPS on the understanding that payments would be made on time and who entered into financial arrangements with their banks on the same <Col N="766"/>understanding.  If these payments are not made immediately farmers will have no option but to renegotiate their financial terms with their banks.  It is extremely unfair to put them in this position.  In a press release issued last October, the Minister for Agriculture and Food agreed that she and her officials would find a method for ensuring that payments for REPS 2 and 3 were punctual.  I ask the Leader to immediately liaise with the Minister to ensure her commitment is honoured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Cannon in regard to REPS payments for farmers and concur with Senator Fitzgerald on the urgency of the crisis pertaining to pharmacists.  Between now and 1 March, I ask the Leader to use his good office to ensure all preconditions contained in the interim contract proposed by the Minister for Health and Children for pharmacists are removed and that the contract is renegotiated.  If that does not happen, we will face the prospect of rural pharmacies closing.  On Monday, I was told by 60 pharmacists in Oranmore that they will have to cut between one and three staff in each pharmacy.  The sickest in our community will be the ones to suffer.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s good words but I ask the Leader to intervene with the Minister on the issue.  Yesterday, the issue was debated for five hours by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We expected an agreed motion to be produced by the Government side this morning but it was not forthcoming.  The most seriously ill people in our community should not be made to pay.  Pharmacists have made clear to me that they will not be able to stock expensive medicines if this proposal is introduced.  Medicines that will, for example, cost &euro;100 or more for those suffering with shingles&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I already ruled on that matter.  An amendment to the Order of Business has been proposed and seconded.  I accept that the Senator is making an important point but I would appreciate if the matter were not discussed now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to the appalling attempt made on the life of the President of East Timor, Jos&eacute; Ramos-Horta, a former winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.  Ireland gave <Col N="767"/>great support to East Timor during its time of struggle and I have no doubt it will do so again now.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is due to pay a visit to that country to discover the up-to-date position in respect of the conflict resolution initiative.  It would be useful if, on his return, he came before the House and provided a report on our policy in respect of East Timor.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>My second point relates to local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government introduced planning guidelines in respect of updating the design of houses in local authority areas.  I welcome these guidelines, particularly in the context of how they relate to improved community facilities and transport infrastructure.  I do not know whether the Minister&rsquo;s words were misinterpreted but there seems to be an impression among members of the media that he advocates curbing the role of the councils regarding how they might frame their local area development plans.  I seek clarification on this matter.  If the Minister introduces a policy directive, there might be a need to amend the planning legislation.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House to clarify matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to outline the position in respect of pharmacies.  It emerged from yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children that the Minister informed the HSE that it must find &euro;100 million in cuts in respect of the distribution of medicines.  It appears the backs of the HSE&rsquo;s staff are to the wall and that they cannot allow the 1 March deadline to be extended.  There is a need for the Minister to come before the House to clarify matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come before the House?  The Minister recently introduced new building regulations and new planning guidelines.  A debate is required in respect of both and I would welcome it if the Minister were invited to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to strongly condemn the killing of a 27 year old man in a church car park in Donegal late yesterday evening.  The man&rsquo;s body was discovered at 7.30 p.m.  I agree with the local priest, Father Brian McGoldrick, who stated that this was an appalling act.  The gunning down of a person in that manner in a civilised society is nothing short of utter brutality.  I support the Garda&rsquo;s request that anyone with information should present themselves at the incident room that has been established at Lifford Garda station. I call on the Leader to contact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure every effort is made to bring <Col N="768"/>about the required close co-operation between the Garda and PSNI to bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is the second such incident that has occurred in the Border area stretching from Lifford St. Johnstone back to Castlefin in the past number of weeks.  It is now a worry for families and people living in that area.  I appeal for cross-Border co-operation to take place.  I ask the Leader to convey the request or perhaps we can discuss it in the Seanad.  I have full confidence the Leader will convey the matter to the Minister to ensure the criminals are brought to justice.</P>

	<P>I raise the issue of the debt in Cork Airport.  I welcome that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has appointed a noted industrial relations expert to attempt to find some compromise between Dublin Airport Authority and Cork Airport Authority on the &euro;220 million debt Cork has been saddled with.</P>
        <P>Reading media reports and listening to commentary this morning, one would think the Minister is a knight in shining armour.  It must be acknowledged he is taking a more proactive role in the matter than his predecessor, who spent almost two years in the Department literally not answering any questions on it.</P>
        <P>Approximately four years ago in this House, the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, gave a clear commitment that if he broke up Aer Rianta, Cork Airport would begin its autonomous life without debt.  Now the Government is almost blaming the two airports for not coming to a resolution on the airport debt.  This is scandalous.</P>

	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s motion to amend the Order of Business to withdraw the civil partnership Bill, for the reasons he has mentioned.  The Government has treated him extremely shabbily in respect of this Bill.  I note the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s comments about the time-frame for the introduction of Government legislation on civil partnership.  It is the first time that it has been put on record that the heads of the Bill would be introduced in March followed by the Bill in September.  That is welcome but time is slipping by.  At this point same sex couples should seek and get full equality with opposite sex couples, nothing more and nothing less in terms of legal recognition. </P>

        <P>I wish to renew a call I made last term for a debate on women&rsquo;s representation in the Oireachtas.  Senator Norris mentioned Barack Obama&rsquo;s successful run in the US presidential election campaign.  On behalf of women Members, I note that Hilary Clinton has also been doing extremely well and should not be written off yet as a Democrat candidate.

It is traditional for a newly elected Taoiseach to address the House.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, did so in 2002 and 1997 and the former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, did so in 1994.

I refer to Deputy Michael Lowry.  The Taoiseach was responsible for the establishment of that tribunal.

	<P>I wish to support Senator Cannon who raised the question of the REPS payments which is of considerable importance to a large number of farmers.  Were Ireland to fail to abide by an European Union ruling or directive, we would be brought into line quickly by the Union, the courts and the legislation therein.  The farmers had a legal agreement with the European Union and it is incumbent on Members to ensure this legal agreement is upheld unless both sides agree to any change.  This matter is causing considerable hardship and distress to the farmer community.  That plans made on the basis of a legal and binding agreement have been changed by an institution that has gained so much respect in this country is causing considerable hardship and distress among the farming community.  We must ensure that right is done by the farming community and that the EU authorities are asked by the Government to abide by the legally binding agreement into which they entered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request of Senators Burke and Ormonde that the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to clarify the position on the guidelines on sustainable planning, which are now subject to public consultation.  It is very important that such guidelines, which have a great impact on communities, be properly debated in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill is being considered in the D&aacute;il at present.  Will the Leader ascertain from the relevant Minister whether there will be any provision made for waiver schemes for waste management collection in local authority areas throughout the country?  There is an anomaly whereby local authorities are at a disadvantage to private operators in the operation of waiver schemes.  They are not on a level playing field and this needs to be addressed in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>We debated volunteerism some time ago in the House.  In this regard, special mention must be made of the work of the Irish Red Cross and Order of Malta Ireland in Civil Defence units throughout the country.  Will the Leader organise a debate on this to ensure the volunteer groups are properly resourced so they can continue their good work and expand?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite to the Seanad the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, who has not been here yet?  There was much chat and abuse last week about Cork but I visited the new Cork School of Music two <Col N="776"/>weeks ago where the &euro;60 million investment therein is a credit to everybody involved.  Will the Leader ask that there be such a school for every county?</P>
        <P>I want the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism invited to the House to discuss investment in the arts.  The Arts Bill, passed some years ago, proposed a sub-committee on traditional arts.  It published a report and &euro;3 million was made available for the traditional arts.  Subsequently a sub-committee was formed to evaluate the role of the arts in education, on foot of which evaluation a report was to be presented by May 2007.  I believe it has been completed and it is time that it was circulated.  It is time that arts education in general received the kind of boost received through the investment in Cork School of Music and other activities.</P>
        <P>I asked the Leader last week about having a debate on workplace bullying.  Since there were many requests last week, I am not sure everything was written down and therefore want to reiterate my point.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to that of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in condemning all the brutal killings that are taking place.  There was talk last week about the fact that we have moved on and it was stated there were threats from extremists.  We should have moved on from all the killings and murders and we must express our disgust at them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Boyle in asking the Leader to have an urgent debate on the Government&rsquo;s aviation policy.  I do so conscious of the fact that I have raised the need for the Government to make a decision on Cork Airport Authority&rsquo;s debt on an Adjournment matter and the Order of Business.  Unlike Senators Boyle and McCarthy, I believe it is ridiculous that there has been a complete Government U-turn this morning in the wake of the appointment of a mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells.  I do not welcome his involvement in the process because it suggests a complete U-turn that will affect the people of Cork and the board of Cork Airport Authority.  A clear commitment was made by the Government to have a debt-free airport in Cork but it has been reneged upon.  It is not good enough.  The people of Cork are being treated like second-class citizens.  I challenge Members opposite, in particular the Cork Members, to stand up for the people of Cork.  It is not good enough to come into the House and pay lip-service.  I call for a debate because the rainbow warriors on the benches opposite have yet again let down the people of Cork.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Bacik in calling for a debate on the representation of women in the Oireachtas.  The recent experience of Hillary Clinton has shown some of the issues which pertain to the representation of women.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the <Col N="777"/>House to explain why he is enforcing the birds directive which is making a special area of conversation of the entire harbour area of Wexford town.  It will effectively stymie development and will mean we cannot get a second bridge and that the harbour, which is a public fishery, will not be able to work.  Even our opera festival will be affected.  It is opened with a fireworks display but that will frighten the birds, so it will not happen.  In short, this directive is for the birds and I beseech the Minister not to implement it.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the tribunal because nobody on this side of the House is afraid of such a debate.  Let us bring everything out in the open &mdash; for example, who is leaking information?  We should debate the systematic leaks and dubious witnesses getting dubious immunity from prosecution from the tribunal.  Perhaps the Members opposite know who in certain professions, particularly the barristers&rsquo; profession, is leaking information to the<i> Daily Mail</i>.  Let us get a few answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a serious allegation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The tribunal itself is affecting democracy, undermining natural justice and judicial principles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want a debate on the tribunals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a slippery slope to the bottom.</P>
        <P>I have come into the House and listened to matters about the solicitors&rsquo; profession and how its standards are being lowered, but the same applies to barristers.  Who is leaking information?  Whoever is doing so is preventing justice from being served.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is entitled to defend himself.  I am sure if Senator Alex White was in another profession and if the Taoiseach was his client, he would recommend the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not a defendant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Cannon and others who raised the issue of the rural environment protection scheme and the delay in payments to farmers.  While there is a direction from the European Union, it has been varied for Ireland over the past 12 to 15 years since the REPS has been in operation and farmers are looking for a continuation of that.  This situation will lead to serious financial hardship for a number of farmers who have entered into agreements with financial institutions in terms loans they have taken out to upgrade their farm holdings.  I urge the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House as quickly as possible to dis<Col N="778"/>cuss this issue and to try to bring about a positive resolution.</P>
        <P>I again ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to discuss the issue of a university for the south east region.  We have heard contradictory reports in recent weeks about the status of the current application by Waterford Institute of Technology.  A report was submitted by Dr. Jim Port on the application by WIT for university status for the south east region.  It seems to be common knowledge that there is a degree of division in the Cabinet on this issue and that the Minister is determined not to grant university status to WIT.  I ask that the report produced by Dr. Port is published and that the Minister come to the House in order that we can have a full debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I mention the candidature of Senator John McCain or the US presidency since all the other candidates have been mentioned.  There is a need for balance.  Senator McCain would make a fine president.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Before Christmas I raised the issue of local radio stations being taken over by various groupings.  Since then I have received a number of representations from people involved in local radio stations outlining that on the takeover, the commitments given in the original granting of the licence disappears.  It is imperative this issue is debated and I ask that the Minister is invited to the House to debate it.  Another annoying matter is that following some of these takeovers, staff are asked to take wage cuts, which is wrong.  It means local radio stations are losing some of their brightest and best people to the national radio stations, if they can get into them.  It is imperative that we have a debate on this matter and that the Minister investigates the taking over of local radio stations in the past 12 to 18 months.</P>
        <P>I am aware Senator Coughlan had a vested interest in a local radio station at one stage but I do not think that is still the case.</P>

	<P>There are young people who want to get involved in broadcasting and many others got into it through local radio or even through the pirate stations in the old days.  The salaries now being offered to some of them are below the minimum wage and this needs to be investigated urgently.  The Leader should arrange for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, <Col N="779"/>to come to the House and debate this.  I have no doubt he is unaware of what is going on.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland should also carry out an investigation to see what is happening with local radio stations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Coghlan, Doherty, Healy Eames, Burke and many others called for an urgent debate on pharmacies and the Health Service Executive.  I compliment all those who are doing their best to assist in the difficulty being experienced by pharmacies, the HSE and ourselves as public representatives.  A meeting of the joint committee is taking place and the Minister is endeavouring to do everything she can.  I can ask the Minister to come to this House at an early stage for an urgent and forthright debate.  We have had such a debate with her.  I have been a long time in this House and the interest generated at the proceedings yesterday and the views of both sides gave a little clarity to the issue.  I look forward to a possible all-party motion coming from the committee on this.  I cannot agree to an amendment to the Order of Business today because the first I heard about it was on the Order of Business.  That is the right of any individual Senator but if I can facilitate the request as soon as possible, then this will happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan complimented me on my views last week on road safety.  The Senator is a long-time Member of this House and I fully agree with him regarding the media coverage, which has been incredible.  We put road safety centre stage and to get such media coverage was unbelievable.  The contents of many requests made to me last week were all matters relating to road safety.  If 90% of the people of Europe, America and Canada are going one way, we had better join them.  On the other hand, road safety must be the paramount issue.  Senator Hannigan brought to our attention that 25% of all drivers killed last year were not wearing safety belts.  Surely manufacturers have a great responsibility to put in a limiter that a car engine cannot start until the seat belt is engaged.  These are simple, commonsense proposals.  Senator Coghlan has always been to the fore with common sense in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke about the matter which Gay Byrne pointed out in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The Minister&rsquo;s office was in contact  on many occasions last week with the chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, Mr. Noel Brett, and we are fortunate to have him in that position, as we were with his predecessor, Mr. Eddie Shaw.   I am sure that will allay the fears of that very competent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>To allay the fears of the Senator, I support the call for the quick installation of speed cameras.  We will have an urgent debate and an update on road safety with the Minister before the Easter recess, if the House agrees.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, which was seconded by Senator Bacik and was clarified by Senator Boyle.  I propose to support the amendment and I will take No.6 as an amendment to my proposal with the agreement of the House later on.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, Boyle, Leyden and McDonald all expressed different views on the Taoiseach.  Natural justice must always be the order of the day.  I look forward to the Taoiseach addressing this House and I hope the issue he addresses will be of great significance to our country and to future generations.  It is on that invitation I will propose that he address the House.  I take on board the views of all Senators but particularly the views of young Members such as Senator McDonald and what she had to say on the current debacle.  The Senators also called for a debate on privilege and I have no difficulty in setting aside some time for this.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle, McCarthy and Buttimer spoke about national aviation policy, especially Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports.  I certainly will allow a debate on this which I hope will take place before the Easter recess as well.  I will pass on their views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan and Senator Glynn called for an urgent debate on children and I can facilitate their request.  The experiences and concerns they highlighted are alarming to say the least.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty called for a debate on collusion.  Senator Walsh also called for a similar debate and asked for an all-party motion. I will bring this to the attention of the leaders of the <Col N="781"/>various groups in the House and we will discuss it at our meeting next Tuesday.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon, Senator Hanafin and others called for an update on the position in which 6,000 farmers find themselves regarding REPS payments.  In the course of the ongoing discussions on the payment arrangements for REPS 4, the European Commission raised questions last month about the established practice of paying REPS 2 and REPS 3 farmers at the beginning of each contract year.  At that stage, around &euro;6 million had been paid to REPS 2 and REPS 3 farmers since 1 January 2008.  The Department officials have argued strongly with the Commission that the practice of paying at the start of the contract year is well established and that the Commission is well aware of this.  The Department&rsquo;s position was outlined in considerable detail at the meeting with the Commission in Brussels on 25 January 2008.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, made the same point directly to the Commissioner when she met her in Dublin last week.  She emphasised the seriousness with which she regarded the situation.</P>
        <P>The Minister and her officials are pressing for a quick resolution to the issue and high level contacts are ongoing with the Commission.  Until the matter is clarified, however, the Department is not in a position to release any further payments under REPS 2 and REPS 3.  I assure the House that we will monitor this weekly and when it is appropriate, the Minister will come to the House to hear the views of Senators.  We all support the plight of the 6,000 farmers as correctly outlined to the House by Senators Cannon and Hanafin.</P>
        <P>Senator Ann Ormonde called for an urgent debate on East Timor and for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be invited to the House to discuss the matter after his visit there.  We have had many debates on East Timor in this House over the years.  I have no difficulty in arranging for that debate.  The Minister has agreed to come to the House to have a wide-ranging discussion on the foreign affairs portfolio.  Perhaps we will defer the holding of that debate until after his visit to East Timor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Ormonde, Burke and Coffey called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be invited to the House to debate issues pertaining to local authorities, local authority developments, planning guidelines and various other matters.  I have no difficulty in such a debate taking place.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Keaveney condemned the killing of a man at 7.30 p.m. yesterday in Donegal and called for communities, North and South, to support the Garda and the PSNI in their investigations.  We lend full support to that call and extend our sympathies to the family of that unfortunate man who lost his life in such a tragic way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Bacik and McDonald called for support in encouraging women to enter politics.  I have already made known my view on encourag<Col N="782"/>ing women to become involved in public life.  We all should do our best in that respect.  Politics is not an easy life but we all know of great public representatives, male and female, who served in this House over the years.  It is lovely to see all the young ladies who have joined us in this Seanad and I look forward to working closely with them and wish them all the very best.  As Members will be aware, I cannot express my view on the elections in America, but everyone knows where my heart lies in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey inquired about including a proposal in the social welfare Bill which will be before Seanad in the coming weeks.  I will pass on his views on the waiver scheme for domestic refuse charges.  His proposal is worthy of inclusion in that Bill.  I suggest that he request his D&aacute;il colleagues and other Members require their D&aacute;il colleagues to put forward that point in regard to that Bill.  Those who are on the breadline and can only afford the basics of tea, butter, bread and sugar are most in need a waiver for domestic refuse charges.  I fully support that call.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party might even table a Private Members&rsquo; motion on this matter.  The introduction of wheelie bin collections to promote a cleaner, greener Ireland has resulted in a marvellous transformation in dealing with refuse.  Anything that would enhance and help everyone to participate in that initiative would be welcome and for the sake of the expenditure of few extra euro, the introduction of a waiver scheme for refuse charges has been a godsend.  I support that proposal by Senator Coffey.</P>
        <P>The Senator also expressed his support for volunteers and called for a debate to support them.  The Taoiseach has been to the forefront in his support of volunteers and volunteerism.  The Red Cross and the other organisations the Senator mentioned need our support.  I have no difficulty in making time available for such a debate.  It could well be the subject of an all-party motion.  I will discuss with the leaders at next Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting the tabling of an all-party motion on how the Seanad and D&aacute;il can play a part in acknowledging and supporting the plight of the volunteer.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney called for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to be invited to the House to debate the issue of the traditional arts.</P>

        <P>Senator Keaveney also called for a debate on bullying in schools.  I can request the Minister  for Education and Science to address this matter.  Perhaps it can be included in a debate on education in general when the Minister comes to the House.  She will be in the House in the next week or so to discuss another aspect of education.  We might avail of that opportunity to include also a discussion on the matter raised by the Senator.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan raised the matter of an application for university status made by Waterford Institute of Technology.  I will pass his views on to the Minister for Education and Science.  Perhaps that matter also could be discussed when she visits this House the week after next.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis called for a debate on the takeover of local radio stations.  This is an alarming development for those of us who were Members of the Oireachtas many years ago when unlicensed radio stations were the order of the day and were very successful.  We convinced the then Government to license radio stations.  It was never envisaged that the communities who were given those licences would sell them on and make millions of euro from those sales.  Those licences were granted to serve the interests of the community.  Local radio&rsquo;s great strength is that it is <Col N="784"/>local and everyone who wants to listen to it has access to it.  From the listeners&rsquo; point of view, which is what is important, the Government and the Department have a duty to put a stop to the sale or future sale of local radio stations, having regard to the way they are being taken over.  Neither can anyone condone the wage cuts staff have been asked to take following such takeovers, as outlined by the Senator.  I will make time available to discuss this matter in the Seanad at a future date.</P>

I <Col N="784"/>pay tribute to other Members of the House, on all sides, who spoke in a very humane way on this matter which is significant and confronts this House.  On my desk I have two piles of cases involving persons in this situation caught in an agonised fashion and for the past four years the Government has failed to address the issue.

        <P>I would also like to pay tribute in particular to the work of my distinguished colleague, Senator <Col N="785"/>Bacik, who worked very hard with our small committee to create this legislation.  It is not easy for Independents to write legislation.  It is a highly technical matter.  I had the assistance of Senator Bacik to whom I am very grateful.

    <Title>Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
      
        <P FLI="0">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to present to the Seanad the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007.  It is a relatively short but important Bill, not only for the criminal offences it will introduce into Irish law but for the very clear message it will send out on our determination to ensure that Ireland does not become a destination or transit point in the evil trade of trafficking in human beings.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Before I outline the purpose of the Bill, it might be useful for Senators if I explain the place of the Bill in the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive strategy for dealing with the growing world-wide problem of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation.  First, and most important because it underpins the other initiatives taking place, is the Bill which we are discussing today which criminalises trafficking and offers protections through the criminal law to trafficked persons.</P>
        <P>Second, are the immigration issues. I will not dwell on these today because they are contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 and there will be ample opportunity to discuss them when that Bill comes before this House.  The Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings specifically requires parties to the convention to take legislative measures to provide a period of recovery and reflection for alleged victims of trafficking.  Therefore, I will briefly draw attention to section 124 of that Bill which provides for such a period of recovery and reflection.  The period provided in the Bill is 45 days.</P>
        <P>If it is necessary for the alleged victim to assist the Garda in its investigation or prosecution arising in relation to the trafficking, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can grant permission for a further six months&rsquo; temporary residence, which may be renewable.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill is clearly <Col N="787"/>the appropriate place for such provisions as that Bill effectively modifies and restates the laws governing the entry into, presence in and removal of certain foreign nationals from the State.</P>
        <P>The third element of the Government strategy is concerned with the protection of alleged victims of trafficking and the provision of services to them.  This can be done administratively under the requirements of the Council of Europe convention.  A new interdepartmental high level group has been established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to recommend the most appropriate and effective response to the Minister on those matters.  The group is co-chaired by the Director General of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Assistant Secretary in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealing with crime.</P>
        <P>The group will consist of representatives of relevant Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive.  It will bring on board as appropriate new members from other offices and agencies that have a contribution to make to ensure the response of the State is co-ordinated, comprehensive and more holistic than it has been to date.  The group will decide on the most appropriate way to engage constructively with the non-governmental organisations and other interested parties to ensure the most effective response to this crime.  The NGO community will have an important role to play, particularly in the provision of services to victims.</P>
        <P>Also a member of the group is the newly appointed executive director of the new anti-human trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ms Marion Walsh.  A key objective of the group will be to draft a national action plan under four main headings &mdash; prevention of trafficking and awareness raising, prosecution of traffickers, protection of victims, and response to child trafficking.  Additional resources have been assigned to the new anti-trafficking unit.</P>
        <P>Having placed this Bill in the context of the other initiatives taking place, I will turn to its purpose.  It is a criminal law Bill that introduces specific criminal offences of trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation or for the removal of their organs.  Legislation in the area of human trafficking already in place is largely designed to deal with smuggling of human beings, as contained in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, and trafficking in children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, as contained in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provisions of the Bill are extracted from the general scheme of the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006.  In addition to trafficking issues, that general scheme also contained provisions relating to the protection of children from sexual exploitation.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="788"/>Reform has decided to proceed without those provisions in order to expedite the drafting, publication and enactment of the trafficking provisions.</P>
        <P>The provisions protecting children have not been forgotten.  They will likely form the basis of further legislation but will be expanded to take account of developments since the general scheme of the original Bill was prepared.  These include recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Child Protection, the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and views received on the general scheme. It is also intended to update and to bring the legislation underpinning the sex offenders register more into line with that in our neighbouring jurisdictions and to further strengthen the legislation on sexual grooming in the light of continuing developments in technology.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated shortly after his appointment that bringing forward legislation in the area of human trafficking would be a priority for him.  The early publication of this Bill is testament to that commitment.  Creating offences criminalising the trafficking in persons for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs will enable the Garda to deal more effectively with the trafficking of human beings into, through or out of the State and to co-operate more fully with other police forces in breaking up the international gangs that are often involved in such trafficking.</P>
        <P>Human trafficking takes many different forms.  It is dynamic and adaptable and, like many other forms of criminal activity, it is constantly changing in order to defeat efforts by law enforcement agencies to prevent it.  The responses to the problem are also rapidly evolving.  International co-operation, which is so crucial to the success of most interventions against human trafficking, is gaining new momentum and new co-operation mechanisms are being developed.  Recently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced further initiatives to deal with other aspects of this phenomenon, to which I will return later.</P>
        <P>Before turning to the detail of the Bill, I wish to make clear that I consider trafficking in human beings an abhorrent crime and a violation of fundamental human rights.  It is a crime which involves many persons, including recruiters, facilitators of transportation and fraudulent employment opportunities, exploiters and end beneficiaries of so-called goods and services provided and produced by trafficked persons.  While most persons&rsquo; idea of trafficking would be of ruthless international gangs, that is not always the reality.  The profits from trafficking in persons are in the same league as profits from drug trafficking and smuggling of weapons but it is a well-established fact that the recruiters are sometimes women who <Col N="789"/>are neighbours, friends or even members of the family of the unfortunate victims.</P>
        <P>The year 2007 marked the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade in the former British empire.  Trafficking in persons has been described as a form of modern day slavery.  I want to send a clear message that the criminal trading of people as commodities, for whatever purpose, has no place in a modern Ireland.  This form of modern day slavery is an evil crime with no regard by the perpetrators for the human or societal consequences.  It is known that traffickers exploit people&rsquo;s desire to have a better life.  They prey on those who are vulnerable because of poverty or other social reasons.  They deceive people into travelling with the promise of a better life.  Instead, the victims often find themselves trapped and unable to leave exploitative and abusive situations.  They become commodities who are moved, bought and sold many times to maximise profits.  Sadly, it is a multi-billion dollar business.</P>
        <P>It is a crime that is transnational, almost by definition, and can best be addressed in an international context.  The European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations have all prepared instruments addressing this issue.  The criminal law provisions of the following instruments have been taken into account in drafting this Bill: the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings; the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings; the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.</P>
        <P>Ireland was involved in the negotiations on these instruments and will continue to fulfil its obligations to participate in the activities of many international organisations against human trafficking.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently participating in meetings of the European Union, the Council of Europe, the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe alliance against trafficking and the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to tackling this crime and recognises the need to draw together all the work that is being done across the various Departments and agencies.  While there is no evidence of an appreciable human trafficking problem in Ireland, any level of this crime is deplorable and unacceptable.  Due to its clandestine and criminal nature, accurate statistics on the magnitude of the human trafficking problem are elusive and unreliable.  The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the State Department in Washington estimates that 800,000 people are trafficked worldwide each year.  Inter<Col N="790"/>national experts estimate that at any given time some 2.5 million people throughout the world are recruited, entrapped, transported and exploited.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reports that trafficking in persons, whether for sexual exploitation or forced labour, affects virtually every region of the world.  Data taken from the database on human trafficking trends document the trafficking of human beings from 127 countries to be exploited in 137 countries.</P>
        <P>Evidence to date would suggest that trafficking into Ireland is not at present a significant problem, although any case of trafficking is one too many.  However, it would be naive to think it is not potentially a serious problem and could grow without remedial action.  Recent research concluded that a minimum of 76 women were probably trafficked into Ireland in the past seven years.  This is 76 too many and is indicative of a small but growing problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Among the difficulties in calculating the true number of persons trafficked into Ireland are the different definitions used to describe trafficking and confusion in the differences between trafficking and smuggling.  The definition of trafficking in the Bill will provide a standard internationally-recognised meaning of trafficking in human beings.  It can be distinguished from smuggling in persons as follows.  Smuggling will always involve illegal border crossings with false or stolen documents.  It is always voluntary and is ultimately a crime against the State.  Trafficking can involve legal or illegal border crossings or even no border crossings.  Documents may be genuine or forged and usually will be taken from the victim by a person in the trafficking network.  Coercion and repeated exploitation are usual, with restrictions on and control of the victims&rsquo; movements.  It is a crime against the individual.  What trafficking and smuggling have in common is that they are profitable criminal enterprises involving human beings and carried out by criminal networks.</P>
        <P>Trafficking offences are difficult to prosecute for some of the same reasons that they are difficult to investigate.  Because of the nature of the offence, the frequent need to rely on evidence collected abroad and the potential for victims and witnesses to be traumatised and intimidated, the prosecution of these offences offers new and difficult challenges.  However, absence of reliable statistics does not justify inaction in response to the problem and enhanced international collaboration and the development of stronger witness protection measures must be part of any strategy to address these challenges.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures to combat trafficking I have already outlined, the Garda National Immigration Bureau will continue to deploy whatever resources are necessary to counteract the problem of human trafficking.  That office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are actively co-operating with the UK agencies on Operation Pentameter 2, which was launched a couple of months ago in London.  This <Col N="791"/>is a co-ordinated campaign of law enforcement activity to tackle the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation into Britain.  Due to the land border and the common travel area, co-operating with and contributing to such operations makes practical sense.  Officers from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sit on the operation&rsquo;s gold command team as observers and have developed new contacts throughout the policing and non-governmental organisation community in Britain.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to fully co-operate with the UK Human Trafficking Centre.  The centre, which is the UK law enforcement response, is quickly becoming a centre of excellence.  Last year, officers from the centre participated in the training of more than 100 garda&iacute; in issues relating to human trafficking and victim identification and care.  Ireland is part of a European G6 initiative against human trafficking.  This initiative, launched last October, is a co-ordinated international campaign of activity to tackle the trafficking of human beings.  Six European countries are participating, namely,the UK, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland, and the initiative is supported by Europol, Interpol and Eurojust.  It is a multi-strand operation marrying strategic policy development with a period of operational policing enforcement activity.  The strands of the initiative are intelligence gathering led by Europol, an enforcement strand led by the Netherlands relating to labour exploitation and by the UK in regard to sexual exploitation, an awareness strand led by Ireland, and a victim&rsquo;s strand led by the UK and Ireland.</P>
        <P>Ireland hosted an international meeting on awareness raising in Dublin on 15 January 2008 as part of its lead role in that strand.  The meeting documented and discussed the effectiveness of all the awareness raising campaigns carried out in participating countries in the past three years.  As an outcome of the meeting, detailed proposals for a shared campaign this year designed to raise awareness and discourage demand for services of victims of sexual and labour exploitation in participating countries are being prepared.  The G6 initiative is designed to ensure the EU becomes a more hostile environment for criminals engaged in trafficking.  Through initiatives such as this which involve practical co-operation between member states and Operation Pentameter 2, we learn more about the problem of human trafficking in the European Union.  This will help us develop the necessary domestic structures to ensure human trafficking does not become a substantial problem here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to outline the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions.  Section 2 defines several important terms used in the Bill.  The terms &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo;, &ldquo;labour exploitation&rdquo;, &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;trafficks&rdquo; are given meanings based on what is <Col N="792"/>required or intended by terms used in the international instruments to which I have referred.</P>
        <P>Section 3 creates an offence of trafficking a child for the purpose of the child&rsquo;s exploitation.  &ldquo;Exploitation&rdquo; in this section does not include sexual exploitation which is dealt with at section 4 by way of an insertion into the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  This section criminalises persons who traffick children for the purpose of labour exploitation or the exploitative removal of their organs.  The causing of an offence or an attempt to commit an offence is also criminalised.  The section provides for a maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for committing any of the offences in the section of life imprisonment and, at the discretion of the court, an unlimited fine.</P>
        <P>Section 4 substitutes new provisions into the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  It provides a new definition of &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; which is more in line with the definition of &ldquo;sexual exploitation of adults&rdquo; in section 2 and defines &ldquo;child&rdquo; for the purposes of the section as a person under 18 years.  Under the 1998 Act a child was defined as being under 17 years.  Raising the age is in line with international norms and is also required by the international instruments on trafficking.</P>
        <P>I propose to create an offence of trafficking in persons aged 18 years or over for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of organs under section 5.  Currently no specific legislation protects adults.  The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 was designed primarily to deal with people smuggling.  A person involved in trafficking invariably commits other serious offences such as rape, assault, abduction and false imprisonment.  The wording in this section closely follows the wording in the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings which, in turn, is closely aligned to the wording in the UN protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.</P>
        <P>The main difference between section 5 and sections 3 and 4 is that while children cannot consent to being trafficked, older persons can.  The international instruments all recognise this and, for an offence of trafficking in adults to take place, there must be threats or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of the person having control over another person.  The concept of adults consenting to being transferred from one jurisdiction to another is controversial but we must accept adults can give a valid consent and, in some cases, as I mentioned, there is confusion between trafficking and smuggling.  If a trafficked person subsequently consents to the exploitation <Col N="793"/>for which that person was trafficked, however, that will not invalidate the offence of trafficking.</P>
        <P>This section also places mentally impaired persons in the same position as children who are trafficked.  Consent is not an issue.  The definition of &ldquo;mentally impaired&rdquo; is the same as that contained in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, that is, &ldquo;suffering from a disorder of the mind, whether through mental handicap or mental illness, which is of such a nature or degree as to render a person incapable of living an independent life or guarding against serious exploitation.&rdquo;  This definition is used generally in criminal law provisions, particularly those that protect mentally impaired persons against sexual abuse or sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P>Section 5 also includes a new offence of selling, offering for sale or purchasing a person.  This is not a requirement of the international instruments and, while not confined to trafficked persons, it acknowledges that those persons can be sold and purchased many times, whether <i>en route </i>to or in the destination country.  This can result in repeated suffering for the trafficked person.  A similar offence in section 3 relates to the selling or purchasing of children.  A person found guilty of any offence under section 5 is liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and, at the discretion of the court, an unlimited fine.  The severe penalties for these offences are an indication of how seriously the Government considers the crime of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>Section 7 deals with jurisdiction.  Ordinarily, Irish courts accept jurisdiction for offences committed within the jurisdiction.  International instruments call for wider jurisdiction provisions, some mandatory, some voluntary.  The provisions contained in section 7 are based on the jurisdictions contained in the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996.  We automatically accept jurisdiction when an offence is committed in the State, including on ships or aircraft registered in the State.  We are also in the Bill accepting jurisdiction where an Irish citizen or person ordinarily resident in the State is alleged to have committed a trafficking offence abroad or where a trafficking offence is alleged to have been committed in another country against an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident in the State.  When an Irish person does something in another country that is not an offence in that country but if committed in the State would be an offence, that person cannot be prosecuted here as he or she has not committed an offence.  Sections 8 and 9 contain standard provisions regarding proceedings relating to offences committed outside the State and double jeopardy.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for exclusion of members of the public from proceedings.  Trafficked persons can be very vulnerable and traumatised and the traffickers and their criminal associates may wish to harm them or members of their families or prevent them from giving evidence.  This provision will give a judge power to exclude from <Col N="794"/>the court persons other than officers of the court, persons directly connected with the proceedings or other persons as the judge may determine.  This will ensure a lack of publicity surrounding these cases.</P>
        <P>Section 11 is another protective measure. It provides for a guarantee of anonymity of alleged victims of trafficking unless the judge fully or partially waives the anonymity in the interests of justice.  Breach of this section could have serious consequences for the alleged victim.  Accordingly, an offence under section 11 will be triable on indictment with a maximum penalty on conviction of an unlimited fine and-or ten years&rsquo; imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Section 12 contains another protective measure for alleged victims.  An amendment to the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 will allow an alleged victim of trafficking to give evidence through a live television link, with the leave of the court in the case of adults, from either within the State or abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 13 provides for amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  Some of these are technical in nature but others are important for the smooth operation of that Act.  An important amendment raises the maximum penalty for non-compliance with the notification obligations in the Act, which is more commonly known as the sex offenders register.  Failure by a person so obliged to notify the Garda of his or her address is an offence with a maximum penalty on summary conviction of a fine of &euro;1,905 and 12 months imprisonment.  The proposal in this section raises the penalties, thus ensuring the offence can be tried on indictment.  As an arrestable offence, it will allow garda&iacute; to arrest on the spot a person who has not complied with the notification requirements.  The section also gives power to probation and welfare officers to prosecute persons who fail to comply with the conditions attaching to an order for post-release supervision.  To aid the smooth running of the Act, the provisions requested by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the probation and welfare service relating to the notification requirements and post-release supervision have been included.</P>
        <P>The amendment in section 14 to the Bail Act adds the offences created in the Bill to the Schedule of that Act.  This means they are serious offences for the purpose of the Bail Act.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, there has to be a co-ordinated comprehensive approach to the challenges presented by international trafficking gangs.  This Bill deals with the criminal law response to these challenges.  The offences in the Bill are comprehensive, going beyond the requirements of the international instruments but retaining all the essential elements of the meanings given to terms such as &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo;, &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;labour exploitation&rdquo; in those instruments.  This is important for ratifying the instruments and for international co-operation.</P>
        <P>On enactment of the Bill, we will be in full compliance with the EU framework decision on <Col N="795"/>trafficking.  I hope I have adequately explained the legislative, administrative and operational initiatives that are being taken in tandem with this Bill to comprehensively address any existing manifestations of trafficking in this country and to prevent proliferation in trafficking.  As soon as progress is made on the administrative initiatives we will be in a position to ratify the UN protocol.  We will first have to ratify the parent convention against transnational organised crime but, with the administrative response in place, ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings can take place as soon as the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill is enacted.</P>
        <P>I wish to briefly address the question of whether we should provide for the criminalisation of using or availing of the services of a trafficked person.  When this issue was raised during the debate in the other House, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform undertook to consider it and, if it proved feasible, introduce an appropriate amendment in this House.  From a policy point of view, the arguments are finely balanced and it is not beyond argument that such an offence would work to the detriment of trafficked persons because it also would be almost impossible to prosecute.  However, it would send out a message that using the services of a trafficked person is unacceptable and could potentially have repercussions for the client.  Other aspects to be borne in mind in any such amendment are that trafficking can be for sexual or labour exploitation or for removal of organs and that the trafficked person can be a child or an adult.  For example, it is already a serious offence to have sex with a child under 17 years of age irrespective of whether the child was trafficked.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on this complex issue and, in the meantime, the Department is considering whether and how such an amendment could be worded.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a positive debate on the Bill.  It is a crucial part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the cruel trade of trafficking in human beings and I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.  As Minister of State at the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is my pleasure to present the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s comprehensive introduction to the Bill and its main provisions.  He referred to the Bill&rsquo;s timeliness and the priority given to it by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  However, the Bill is intended to implement the Council framework decision on combatting trafficking in human beings which was adopted on 19 July 2002 and which set a deadline of 1 August 2004 for implementation by member states.  If that is the pace <Col N="796"/>at which we implement EU framework decisions on this and other issues, it is most unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these reservations, the Bill is welcome and I acknowledge the vigorous debates held on its various stages in the other House.  The Minister has improved the Bill by taking on board many of the amendments proposed by Fine Gael and other parties.  The legislation started life as the criminal law (sexual offences) Bill 2006 and has since been re-introduced.</P>
        <P>The issue of human trafficking is subject to international laws and conventions, notably an optional protocol which supplemented the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and a Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings signed in Warsaw in May 2005.  The UN convention sets out clear requirements for effective action to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children, but it also prioritises the protection of victims of trafficking.  As the Minister of State noted, the Bill deals solely with criminal law aspects of trafficking but I wonder whether it respects the EU plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in human beings which we adopted in 2005.  It has been stated that the protection of victims of crime is more a matter for the upcoming immigration Bill but it is integral to the effectiveness of the legislation before us.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about complex issues such as involvement of victims&rsquo; families in the trafficking.  Deportation in such circumstances only adds to the misery of the individual who was harmed in the first instance by this terrible trade.  Neither the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 nor the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 has ever resulted in a successful prosecution for the crime of trafficking, although individuals have been arrested and charged.  Victims fear they will be deported rather than treated as genuine once they are in the hands of the police.  With regard to the 45-day period and the six-month renewals, these concern only third-country nationals.  The figures indicate that 73% of those trafficked into Ireland come from eastern Europe.  How will protection be provided to people from eastern Europe under this Bill and the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated the value of this trade, which appears to be the third most lucrative of its kind in international crime circles.  This highlights the priority that should be given to dealing with this matter.  We need a legislative framework and an enforcement framework to be put in place in order that we might have a real deterrent in respect of this type of crime.</P>
        <P>Ireland has signed but not ratified the UN trafficking protocol &mdash; which was opened for signature in 2000 and which urges states to protect and assist victims of trafficking, with full respect for the rights of the child &mdash; neither has it ratified the UN&rsquo;s optional protocol on the rights of the child. <Col N="797"/> In addition, Ireland has not signed or ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  The failure to either sign or ratify these instruments and the delay in introducing the Bill are evidence of the fact that we have not been to the forefront in dealing with this matter.</P>
        <P>The key point I wish to make relates to the way victims are treated.  On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, a comprehensive amendment regarding a victims charter was brought forward but was not accepted.  There is a flaw in the Bill in this regard, particularly in the context of citizens from eastern Europe as opposed to third country nationals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the amendment of the Bill to the effect that consent will not be a defence.  The latter is an improvement.  The Minister of State indicated that the argument is finely balanced with regard to the criminalisation of availing of services.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s view on this matter is that while formulating an appropriate provision would prove complex, the inclusion of such a provision would improve the Bill.  Such a provision would have my party&rsquo;s full support.</P>
        <P>The work of the high level group on combating trafficking in human beings would be improved by the participation of the NGOs, which have first-hand experience and knowledge of this terrible trade.  To keep them at arm&rsquo;s length, as the Bill proposes, will weaken the effectiveness in respect of understanding and dealing with this complex issue.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome and has my support and that of my party.  However, a provision relating to availing of services should be included.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify precisely how victims from eastern Europe will be catered for under this Bill or the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome to the House the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith.  This is the first occasion on which I, as my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on justice, have had the pleasure to be present when he has addressed the House.  I compliment him on the excellent job he has done in his brief to date.  Even though I have known the Minister of State for many years, he has surpassed even my expectations.  I have come to admire his excellent and succinct observations in the national media.  The Minister of State is clear in his thinking and is doing a great job.  I compliment him in that regard and I encourage him to keep up the good work.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  Estimates indicate that a total of 76 human beings were trafficked into Ireland in the past seven years.  One person being trafficked into this country is one too many.  We want to nip in the bud such behaviour.  Between 20 and 30 years ago, many people emigrated from Ireland.  Now, however, as a result of our sustained economic growth and wealth, many people are coming here to work.  The cruel, wicked and <Col N="798"/>evil individuals involved in human trafficking see opportunities to enslave women and bring them here.  Approximately 80% of all human beings trafficked are either women or children, which is sickening.  Ireland must be seen as a nation that does not condone in any way behaviour of this sort.</P>
        <P>There are many reasons offered in respect of what causes trafficking.  I refer here to the lack of employment opportunities, organised crime, regional imbalances, economic disparities, social discrimination, etc.  However, none of these can be given as a justification for trafficking.  Traffickers, who are professional criminals, are making huge amounts of money and we are trying to introduce legislation to curtail and stymie their activities.  They are employing ever more sophisticated and advanced methods to move people from location to location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must be careful about what I say, but I am of the view that the trade of prostitution here is as vibrant as it is in other western European countries.  It is regrettable that in many instances eastern European and Russian women are being trafficked into Ireland to become involved in this trade.  The authorities must be increasingly vigilant to ensure the exploitation of these individuals is stymied.  They should monitor the activities of lap-dancing clubs, etc., and ensure the women employed in such establishments are here of their own volition and are not being exploited or abused.</P>
        <P>It has been stated that human trafficking is similar to enslaving people.  When drugs such as cocaine, heroin and marijuana are trafficked, they can be used only once.  With human trafficking, however, people can be sold on a number of times, which is appalling.  When I studied law &mdash; it is too long ago to state exactly when I did so &mdash; in our first year we were obliged to read a famous book on Roman law by Max Kaser, which I hated.  I am sure that when I graduated I burned it along with other books that broke my heart.  My recollection is that while slavery was acceptable under Roman law, even slaves had basic rights.  As far as I recall, they were allowed to marry, etc.  They were exploited, primarily but not exclusively, for the work they could do, namely, housework, farming their owners&rsquo; lands, providing cheap labour and so on.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, people who are trafficked today have few or no rights and, among other things, are subjected to imprisonment.  It is a matter of concern that the value of the international human trafficking trade stands at approximately &euro;10 billion.  It is clearly a lucrative trade.</P>
        <P>We also think most human beings who are trafficked are used for prostitution and sexual exploitation.  Others are used as forced labour.  It may not have been a widespread practice but when eastern Europeans came here before the expansion of the EU, there were cases where people would pay them &euro;1 an hour or much less than the minimum rate.  It would be foolish of us to say <Col N="799"/>otherwise, although I am thankful it was stamped out.  This happened here recently because of the greed of people who were probably making much money.  Instead of paying a person &euro;8 or &euro;9, there was exploitation.</P>
        <P>The sickest of all exploitation is trafficking for the removal of organs, in many cases from young people.  Stealing organs from me when I am past 50 and well worn out probably would be a waste of time.  Young people, such as teenagers or even younger, could be trafficked and forced to have their kidneys removed.  When a liver or other organ for transplant is to be removed, that trafficked person may even be killed off.  That is appalling.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State noted in his speech the importance of differentiating between human trafficking and smuggling.  Smuggling is deplorable and we have seen appalling instances of people smuggled in containers.  There were cases of people dying in the process.  The people involved in smuggling are mainly adults who, with free will, enter into a deal with smugglers to get to Ireland or another location.  They may indicate they will pay a sum such as &euro;5,000 to get from A to B, so they can have a better lifestyle.  Although that is deplorable, it is not as low on the scale as human trafficking.</P>
        <P>Figures I came across in research are frightening.  It is believed up to 800,000 people may be trafficked internationally every year, with 80% being either women or children.  That is an appalling record.  I remember considering the matter of children&rsquo;s rights and first-time offenders under legislation introduced in Australia and New Zealand.  These countries brought in legislation to deal with young offenders and had a very good template.  We have often considered the position in Canada.</P>
        <P>In my research I was surprised that in Canada modern sexual slavery was investigated, and a report called Falling Short of the Mark was published.  This is an international study of the treatment of human-trafficking victims.  The principal author is Benjamin Perrin, who wrote that Canada has ignored calls for reform and continues to re-traumatise trafficking victims with few exceptions by submitting them to routine deportation, and it fails to provide even basic support services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge that this should not happen here.  In the event of somebody finding a woman in any part of Ireland who has been enslaved for prostitution through human trafficking, she should be treated humanely when she is freed from slavery.  The worst action to take would be to deport such a person.</P>
        <P>This is a fairly recent report, from 2006.  We often perceive Canada as being a country well above the mark and a nation that can be admired.  According to this report, when somebody is found there who is a victim of trafficking and involved in prostitution, that person is deported <Col N="800"/>to wherever they came from, be it India, Cambodia or Russia.  That is appalling treatment.</P>
        <P>We should learn from that and in the event of similar situations arising here we should ensure the person is treated humanely and receives counselling and medical treatment.  If people are brought here against their will and used for prostitution, for example, perhaps they should be given asylum in order to be educated, trained and given comfort, and more importantly, recognition and compassion.  I would be jumping up and down if I thought people &mdash; we are mainly talking about females &mdash; were being exploited and abused and their only recognition for escaping such slavery was to be deported.  They could again be exploited and trafficked.</P>
        <P>I picked up on this report because sometimes we can learn from what happens in other countries.  Thankfully, we are probably not in the most serious league of international people trafficking.  The report gave a &ldquo;D&rdquo; grade to the United Kingdom, our neighbours, and Canada received an &ldquo;F&rdquo; grade.  Ideally, a country would get an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade.  We should also recognise that countries such as Australia, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Italy received &ldquo;B&rdquo; grades.  I wonder where we would end up if graded.</P>
        <P>I hope we strive to achieve an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade in this regard.  Le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, that is what we will do with the help of this legislation, among other measures.</P>

	<P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing this long overdue legislation.  It at last means Ireland will comply with international obligations.  Back in September, shortly after my own election, I put a motion to this House, which remains on the Order Paper, calling on the Government to bring forward legislation without delay criminalising the practice of trafficking in persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation and noting Ireland is at present in breach of international and European obligations in failing to have such legislation in place.  We would all acknowledge this is long overdue and very welcome.</P>
        <P>This is very much an incomplete Bill and it is very difficult to debate it in any real sense without debating it alongside the provisions contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, to which the Minister of State referred.  In my view and in best practice in general, it would have been far preferable to have included measures for the protection of victims of trafficking within the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill rather than hive them off to another Bill dealing with immigration matters.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>The two issues should not be seen in isolation from each other.  Persons trafficked into this country will have immigration issues and be in need of serious protection from an immigration point of view, as well as various other human rights perspectives.  That many of the protective provisions are contained in the immigration Bill and not the trafficking Bill is a cause of concern.</P>
        <P>The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill falls short of the adequate protections for victims of trafficking that would be recognised in best practice elsewhere.  For example, the Minister of State referred to the provisions in terms of a period of recovery and reflection; that where persons are found to have been trafficked into a country, rather than being simply deported &mdash; the worst practice and in violation of human rights &mdash; most other countries provide for a period of recovery and reflection.  This would assist the Garda in its investigation of trafficking offences <?oasys _dc28- ?>and in trying to apprehend alleged traffickers, and it would give victims time to produce statements.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The period provided in the Bill is only 45 days, which is far too short and should be extended.  In the immigration Bill, there is a discretion to give a visa for six months of temporary residence to victims of trafficking.  We should view this in the context of the human rights of persons who have been trafficked into the country.  Their rights have already been violated and they deserve a more long-term recognition of their status.  The Minister should have discretion to give them a more long-term, and possibly indefinite, visa to remain here.  At the very least the period of recovery and reflection should be three months rather than 45 days.</P>
        <P>There will be real fears among victims of trafficking not only in respect of deportation and their immigration and residence status but in respect of the danger that they would be prosecuted for other offences, most obviously soliciting and loitering for the purpose of prostitution.  The legislation should contain a clear non-punishment provision.  I pay tribute to the non-governmental organisation Ruhama that has been pressing for many years for the rights of trafficked persons and those engaged in prostitution.  It is concerned that the question of non-punishment and the right of victims of trafficking not to be punished is not sufficiently clear.  It is also concerned about the lack of protection for victims of trafficking from EU member states.  We think of trafficked persons as being from non-EU states but that is not necessarily so.  Ruhama believes the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill does not adequately address that issue.  Consent is a serious issue in the definition of trafficking and exploitation.  The Minister of State referred to this and it has been dealt with in debate, but it may require more clarity when we discuss the provisions of that Bill in detail.</P>
        <P>It is important to consider the human rights of trafficked persons as a whole and not as criminal <Col N="802"/>law issues on the one hand and immigration issues on the other.  The Minister of State said we need a co-ordinated response but that is not evident in the Bill.  It is unfortunate because this is a missed opportunity to explore further the suggestion to criminalise using or availing of the services of a trafficked person.  This could have been an opportunity to consider a more radical approach to law reform on trafficking and prostitution generally and study the Swedish model by which using the services of a prostitute is a criminal offence.  This removes the need to prove that the alleged abuser knew that the victim or prostitute was trafficked.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider that issue and to try to take a more inclusive approach to the human rights of those who are trafficked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for allowing me to take part in this debate and for sharing her time with me.  This Bill is very welcome but is it not an appalling comment on human nature that such a Bill has to be introduced, that there are persons among us, and around the globe, who are prepared to treat other human beings merely as commodities to be bought and sold and ground into slavery of the most degrading and awful kind?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share some of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s reservations.  The long title of the Bill states that it is &ldquo;an Act to give effect ... in part, to the United Nations Protocol&rdquo;.  What parts were left out?  Are they the parts to which Senator Bacik referred when she spoke about the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill?  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan addressed that matter very sensitively.  It is appalling to think of people being deported out of this country having already suffered a trauma, although there is an interval of 30 or 40 days, with the possibility of three months.  In the light of the trauma, however, it is not appropriate to further punish these women and, occasionally, youths and boys, given that they have been so badly treated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State has established a think-tank in the Department, the so-called high level group.  Will this be financed?  Does it meet the requirements for a co-ordinating agency to address directly, immediately and effectively, on a daily basis, the question of trafficking?  If not, that is what we need and we need to involve organisations such as Ruhama, of which I also approve.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Luckily I do not believe we are involved in the business of the removal of organs.  That is happening all over the world.  In a recent horrifying case in India a doctor was caught who had been involved in 800 such cases.  The trafficking of persons generates &pound;8 billion annually.  Somewhere between 500,000 and 5 million people are involved.  The Minister of State cites 800,000 but no one knows the actual figure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the most significant elements of the Bill is the provision of protection for persons who are mentally impaired or suffering from a disorder of <Col N="803"/>the mind or whatever the definition is.  This is critical in the light of the Iranian case I have cited several times of a 16 year old mentally handicapped girl who was sentenced to death for not protecting herself vigorously enough against her rapists.  That is shocking.  I attended a conference last weekend, organised by the Bar Council, during which a recent Dutch case was quoted involving another 16 year old mentally handicapped girl who was not entitled to bring her rapist to court because being mentally impaired she could not make a complaint.  This happened in Europe.  Luckily the Council of Europe stepped in, <?oasys _dc28- ?>through the European Court of Human Rights, and the case against Holland was found to be justified and the situation has been rectified.  That shows the extraordinary vulnerability of such people.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">We must provide more services to deal with people involved in this activity.  The number may be small; the Minister of State says approximately 70 cases over the past seven years.  The figure I have received is 90, which seems small but each case is an appalling tragedy for the person involved and it is a reproach to us as a society if any of these cases continue to exist.  My figure of 90, or the Minister of State&rsquo;s 70, are only the ones we know about.</P>
        <P>It is useful to put a human face on these figures.  In 2004 an 18 year old eastern European woman was brought to the attention of the Garda when the neighbours called them to a house in Dublin.  She was taken to hospital by ambulance.  She had been beaten by a man at the house who had forced her to have sex with 200 men.  She was six months pregnant by that man.  She told the Garda that she had been taken by bus from eastern Europe to Spain, given a false Italian passport and trafficked to Ireland.  That is the real human face of what has been happening in this country.</P>
        <P>I came across a case in <i>The Sligo Champion</i> on 26 April 2006 in which a 17 year old west African girl was brought to the attention of the Garda in Sligo after working as a prostitute.  It came to light that she was a minor and further investigation revealed she had been trafficked to this country specifically to be exploited by an organised prostitution ring.</P>
        <P>The last case is by far the worst.  It involved a north African minor whom the Garda had rescued from a brothel and was put into the care of the Health Service Executive, HSE, in Dublin.  I believe I raised this case on the Order of Business some months ago.  The HSE did not have adequate staff to look after her and she went missing from that centre within days.  What is the fate of a woman such as that?  That is why we need not just a ministerial think-tank but a clear, specific, target-orientated and well-funded group to implement the provisions of this Bill which, in conjunction with my colleagues, I welcome strongly.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="804"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There has been a general welcome for the Bill, as there should be, and it is about time as it is informed by international law such as the conventions of the UN and of the Council of Europe.  We have been tardy in recognising the existence and scale of the problem and the need for appropriate legislation to deal with it but, thankfully, the Legislature is dealing with this.  The Bill was improved during its passage through the D&aacute;il and it is hoped the debate in the Seanad will involve further consideration of areas that need to be examined to deal with the dangerous crime of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>While the trafficking of people for sexual purposes has been most prevalent in Ireland, there also have been sad examples of people being imported in inhumane conditions into the State.  Sadly, deaths have occurred as a result of such trafficking incidents, which makes a Bill of this nature all the more important.  I am grateful for the general acceptance of the principles behind the Bill and the common acceptance of the need to ensure the Bill will operate to the highest possible standards.</P>
        <P>Two areas should be considered when trying to improve the Bill further and may be criticisms to which Members will return in a later debate on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  In recent years, most items of legislation have shared a common feature, regardless of the composition of the Government of the day, namely, the need to give power through secondary legislation to the Minister and his or her successor to produce regulations as to how the Bill might operate.  Members should ensure this power is used as little as possible.  When it is used they should ensure such regulations are brought forward to this House by way of a statutory instrument to facilitate proper further consideration and the approval of the House is obtained in such matters.  Such a principle should be adopted in respect of legislation such as the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second area has been already alluded to.  Despite the provisions on anonymity in this Bill, those who are victims of human trafficking, particularly in the sexual area, may be open to discrimination in other areas.  It is commonly accepted that prosecutions under laws on public propriety and sexual offences will not be applied as a result of this measure and that a rule of thumb will be applied by the law authorities.  I again refer to the future debate on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  There is a danger that people who have been trafficked into this country and who have suffered appalling abuse will be subjected to possible removal from the country, having been identified.  Members should not be prepared to stand over such occurrences.  While this matter cannot be rectified directly in this Bill, it is referred to in subsequent legislation and I hope Members can return to this issue.</P><Col N="805"/>
        <P Just="Left">Several organisations have been mentioned already in this House in respect of their campaigning role and in ensuring that all public representatives are aware of the need to introduce effective legislation on this issue.  I add my voice in support of such organisations.  I also will be parochial in naming an organisation that has not been mentioned yet, the Sexual Violence Centre in Cork.  Through its stop sex trafficking campaign, it formed part of a coalition of bodies that made public representatives aware of the issues associated with this Bill and of the need to place on the Statute Book the best possible legislation.  One also must acknowledge the role played by the Irish section of Amnesty International.  It submitted a great deal of material to Members in respect of this Bill to inform them of the international aspect of human trafficking in general, its existence and the role Ireland has as a moral country participating in international negotiations in this field.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister addressing the areas I have raised on the conclusion of the Second Stage debate next week.  Between Second and Committee Stages, this House should have an opportunity to enhance further the Act that will eventually be put in place, in a similar manner to the opportunity already afforded to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I am confident, given the record and reputation of the Seanad, that Members will be able to do so with their usual ability.  The Minister should take into account such views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Boyle.  Senator Alex White has ten minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I believe I have ten minutes, in deference to some of my colleagues who are present I will not use them all.  However, I wish to reserve my right to so do.</P>
        <P>Like all Members, I strongly welcome the publication of this Bill.  As Senators Boyle, Regan and others have noted, it has been subjected to rigorous and thoughtful debate in the other House.  The Minister has been prepared in some instances to accept amendments from the Labour Party, Fine Gael and others, which is all to the good in this context.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I wish to refer to a point made by Senator Boyle, with which I strongly agree.  I have made this point in the House in the past and as an issue of principle it is worth repeating.  I understood Senator Boyle to say that the practice of legislation confining itself to enabling provisions, thereby shifting the power to make or at least to elaborate the law to secondary legislation and ministerial regulation, should be resisted.  This should be done only when a compelling case to so do exists.  The matter under debate is one on which Members should ensure the principle of the law as they elucidate it and wish it to be is set out in primary legislation.  It should be subject to debate in this House and among the public in order that it has the credibility of laws genuinely <Col N="806"/>promulgated by the Houses of Parliament, rather than simply by Ministers.  While this does not constitute a criticism of individual Ministers who must operate within the law, it is much better that laws are made by legislators rather than allowing them to be left to ministerial orders or regulation.</P>
        <P>The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill has gone before the D&aacute;il and will come before the Seanad in the coming months.  It is an example of legislation that strays too far into the practice of including enabling provisions that do not set out in sufficient detail the principles of the legislative provisions that society desires.  This is a pity and Members will have an opportunity to raise this matter when the aforementioned Bill comes before the House.</P>
        <P>It is no exaggeration to refer to human trafficking and trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation as modern forms of slavery.  My colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has made the point elsewhere that it is no exaggeration to describe it as such.  People were of the opinion that slavery was a phenomenon that finished in the 19th century.  However, they only need to look at the regular news reports of really shocking exploitation, sometimes in the context of international sexual slavery rings.  Ireland is no more unscathed in this regard than any other country.</P>
        <P>It is known that the women concerned, some of whom are girls in their early teens, are being sold into sexual slavery.  Sufficient empirical evidence exists to enable one to be certain that young girls and boys are sold into sexual slavery as a result of their vulnerability as individuals because of their youth, the circumstances that obtain in their countries of origin or because they wish to make a better life for themselves.  This simple fact should make one pause and consider.  While they do not wish to be exploited and have a right not to be, their principal motivation as human beings often is that fundamental motivation shared by all, that is, to make a better life for themselves.  The exploitation of young people in such circumstances is a particularly vile feature of the phenomenon of migration.  Any civilised country or society must regard as a matter for condemnation the circumstances in which young people, who are attempting to flee poverty in their own countries or some form of oppression or who simply wish to improve the conditions of their lives and futures, fall into the clutches of the lowest form of criminals.  I refer to those who are prepared to grow wealthy from trafficking and exploiting people in prostitution.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s publication and was impressed by the breadth of the Minister&rsquo;s analysis and description of the problem, both nationally and internationally.  It forms a good basis on which to have the debate required by Members and wider society on this issue.  While part of the function of debate in these Houses is to introduce the best legislation possible, it also is to signal to wider society that legislators take seriously this issue.  It should be signalled in the <Col N="807"/>most public way that it is not a practice we will allow to continue.  Even if we are addressing this question a little late, it is important we are doing so now.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleagues&rsquo; statements on the vital contribution made by a number of different organisations in respect of trafficking.  National Government organisations and voluntary organisations have been raising the issue over the years, sometimes with very little response from politicians.  Ruhama, which has been mentioned by some of my colleagues, has been to the fore in this area.  I had the pleasure of meeting some of its representatives during the course of the general election campaign because some of them live in Dublin South.  I was left with a very clear message from the organisation that this issue needed to be addressed in a robust way by the Legislature.  I am glad we are now doing so.</P>
        <P>I am not suggesting human trafficking is morally equivalent to any other form of exploitation but believe strongly that it is another feature of exploitation and forced labour which unfortunately comprise a phenomenon of developed countries, including Ireland.  I have raised the issue of labour standards in Ireland.  I am not suggesting this is an aspect of the same issue as it is a discrete area that deserves to be dealt with in its own right.  We are reminded that an increase in wealth and economic activity is accompanied by the emergence of an ugly underbelly of which trafficking is one example.  Our legislation needs to deal with it specifically and also to understand that where there is success and economic achievement, there is also an ugly form of exploitation.</P>
        <P>I look forward to addressing some of the specifics of the Bill that I do not regard as absolutely satisfactory.  The question of the protection of victims must be addressed.  It was considered in the other House but has not been resolved adequately.  The Minister of State has been inclined to say the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 will deal with some of these questions but it only deals with non-EEA immigration.  As Ruhama and other organisations have pointed out very compellingly, a very large percentage of young people trafficked into Ireland come from eastern European countries that are now members of the European Union.  It will not be sufficient to state the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will be the vehicle with which to deal with victim support.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to the risk of deporting victims.  One could find oneself trafficked into Ireland and exploited and then deported if the exploitation comes to an end, perhaps as a result of an economic bust.  The Senator was correct to raise this issue but he will accept that the risk he outlined is not resolved in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007.  It is a serious question and needs to be addressed.  This ought to be achieved in this Bill rather than in another. <Col N="808"/> Let us adopt an holistic approach rather than a narrow one based on criminal law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for his speech which was an exemplary model of how a Bill should be presented in this House.  I compliment him on the extraordinary work he did in respect of the child care subvention scheme introduced on 18 December.  I do not apologise for complimenting him thereon.  It was a tremendous political achievement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In May 2006, Irish citizens were shocked by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on prostitution, particularly prostitution in Dublin.  The show depicted a hotel and apartment block where women, including trafficked women, were being used for prostitution.  I contend that 99.9% of Irish people, including myself, were shocked and horrified this was happening in Ireland and that Irish men would stoop so low to abuse women in the manner described, as I stated in the Seanad at the time of the revelations.  The show was a very good example of how a television programme can point to activities in respect of which laws should be enacted.</P>
        <P>Since the television programme, representatives from CORI and Ruhama were before Oireachtas committees.  The former Leader of the Seanad, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, promised to ensure legislation on human trafficking would be brought before the Oireachtas.  One of the first statements made by her nephew, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when he entered office was that he would do so.</P>
        <P>The clergy in Ireland, including the organisations CORI and the Irish Missionary Union, have been to the fore in exposing the trafficking of women into Ireland.  Sister Frances Robinson of the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights two years ago and stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">My main concern in this presentation is to highlight the terrible consequences for women who are trafficked.  I invite the committee to consider the following job advertisement.  It was devised to raise awareness by Whisper, an organisation concerned by trafficking[.]</P>

        <P FLI="0">Sister Frances Robinson asked members of the committee how many of us would encourage a sister, daughter, wife or partner to apply for such a job.  Do such jobs exist?  They do.</P>
        <P>At the time of the presentation by Sister Frances Robinson, we had no legislation making trafficking a crime.  I am so pleased to have met those who brought this to my attention.  I could not believe what was happening in our country.</P>
        <P>The Bill will criminalise trafficking, which I welcome.  However, it does not set out guidelines for the protection and support of the victims of trafficking.  I wish to put forward some procedures which should be in place for the victims.  They should include legislation which sets out services to be provided for victims having an understanding of the needs of trafficked persons and the importance of victim assistance; legis<Col N="810"/>lation which regards the trafficked persons as victims and not as criminals; and legislation which does not force the victim to decide on seeking asylum or returning to their country of origin for a period of four months while recovering from their trauma.  I urge the Minister to include these points to aid victims in rebuilding some semblance of a life for themselves.</P>
        <P>Trafficking is a not merely a potential problem for Ireland, it is an absolute and real problem.  The Minister of State raised the question of whether we should provide for the criminalisation of using or availing of the services of a trafficked person.  It should be a crime and we should create an offence of using the services of people who are trafficked.  As the Minister of State said, it would send out a message that using the services of a trafficked person is unacceptable and could potentially have repercussions for the client.  We should consider such a provision.</P>

    <Title>Millennium Development Goal: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann acknowledging The Millennium Development Goal committing us to reducing maternal mortality by 75 percent between 1990 and 2015 in developing countries, supports the Government on its commitment to this goal and its substantial contribution to the new UNFPA trust which will be used to support 75 of the poorest countries deliver better services for women before, during and after childbirth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am honoured to be among the first to extend my congratulations to the Government on its commitment to promoting reproductive health in the developing world.  The contribution Ireland has made to the No Woman Should Die Giving Life fund will promote real advances in the struggle against maternal mortality and disability.</P>
        <P>Statistics are important but they are easy to hear, digest and forget.  Some 500,000 annual deaths due to maternal mortality is a shocking number but ultimately, it is a number.  What we need to remember is that these are mothers dying to bring children into the world.  These are mothers who look forward to raising their children, providing for them and teaching them.  However, the excitement and anticipation of pregnancy is mitigated by the very real possibility that childbirth will be accompanied by illness, disability or death.</P>
        <P>These are real communities and they lose some of their most active contributors.  They are families, not so different than our own, that lose a care-giver and a provider.  They are children brought into a world without ever knowing their mothers.  Babies are deprived of the maternal care which is so essential in that first year of life while children are deprived of the guidance and <Col N="811"/>the support of their mothers.  We cannot expect to reduce child poverty on a large scale when millions of children grow up without the fundamental support that mothers provide.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of the first countries to donate to the No Woman Should Die Giving Life fund which was recently established by the UNFPA to stem the overwhelming numbers of mothers who die during pregnancy and childbirth.  This contribution is a significant step towards eliminating the problem of maternal mortality and achieving the millennium development goals, which aim to end extreme poverty by 2015.  However, this millennium development goal is one which the world is failing to meet.</P>
        <P>We have made some significant progress towards achieving the goals set out by the United Nations at the beginning of the century.  More children around the world are attending primary school, more women are participating in politics and certain health crises are beginning to be contained but maternal mortality continues to be an international crisis.  The rate of maternal mortality in developing countries indicates not only inadequate health care services but also reflects a widespread violation of basic rights to life and health.</P>
        <P>In Africa and south Asia, complications that arise during pregnancy are the most frequent cause of death among women.  Unsurprisingly, the number of maternal deaths is highest in countries where the shortage of skilled health personnel is most acute.  Exacerbating the problem in these countries is a severe lack of clean facilities and a dearth of adequate equipment.  What facilities exist can be difficult to access for women who do not have a reliable means of transportation or an income above the poverty line.</P>
        <P>Many women in developing countries report that a lack of cultural sensitivity, the unavailability of female health care providers and language barriers discourage them from receiving pre-natal care and prevent them from giving birth in hospital.  Without the provision of culturally appropriate health care options, we cannot expect women to voluntarily seek care at hospitals, no matter how well medically supplied the facilities might be.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s recognition of these problems will go a long way towards getting more mothers access to appropriate health care facilities.  The No Woman Should Die Giving Life fund is doing vital work to address the currently inadequate provision of health care for expectant mothers in the developing world.  The UNFPA fund provides the support and tools for upgrading health care facilities and works toward ensuring universal access to information about reproductive health.  This includes education on family planning and sexual health and making contraception more universally available.</P>
        <P>The UNFPA fund maintains a special focus on ensuring the availability of pre and post-natal <Col N="812"/>counselling and care and on increasing the quality and availability of emergency obstetric care.  Additionally, the UNFPA is committed to advocating maternal health reforms and women&rsquo;s rights on both national and international levels.  The UNFPA actively seeks the aid and input of local community and religious leaders who best understand the cultural needs of their communities.</P>
        <P>The Government has also made generous contributions to funds that target the problems of obstetric fistula and female genital cutting.  Obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged and complicated labour without treatment, is a leading cause of death for infants and disability for mothers.  Given the stigma associated with fistula, a woman disabled by fistula will often descend into social isolation, depression and deepening poverty.</P>
        <P>Fistula is entirely preventable but only with timely access to emergency obstetric facilities.  Obstetric fistula throws the differences in maternal care between the developed and the developing worlds into sharp focus.  While fistula affects an estimated 2 million women in developing countries, it is virtually non-existent in Europe and North America.  One estimate suggests that in Ethiopia, it takes a woman an average of 2.5 days to reach an operating room to address a complicated pregnancy.  By the time she gets there, it is usually too late to save the infant and the mother will be disabled for life.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;500,000 to the UNFPA Campaign to End Fistula will aid the provision of skilled attendants at births in 35 countries where fistula is particularly prominent.  The fund also provides treatment and assists reintegration for women who already suffer from fistula.  The UNFPA is working to increase awareness of the gravity of fistula both at a community-level and among policy makers.  Obstetric fistula is a condition that no woman should live with.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s vision in targeting this serious cause of maternal disability.</P>
        <P>The Government has also made a contribution to a fund targeting the practice of female genital cutting.  Genital cutting affects about 130 million girls and women worldwide and 2 million more are at risk every year.  This procedure threatens sexual and reproductive health as well as psychological well-being.  The UNFPA programme works with young people and religious and community leaders on a local level to establish approaches to eliminating the practice that are sensitive to the cultural dignity of the community.  These programmes have seen success in several developing regions and with the Government&rsquo;s contribution to the fund, the programmes can be extended across much of sub-Saharan Africa.  Again, I applaud the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help eliminate a practice fundamentally contrary to basic human dignity.</P>
        <P>Maternal mortality and disability have a devastating effect on families and communities.  More <Col N="813"/>than half a million mothers die annually from complications that arise during pregnancy and childbirth.  More than 10 million others are left with severe illness or disability following delivery.  The vital contribution women make as mothers, carers, members of the workforce and active community members cannot be replaced when lives are lost or mothers are seriously disabled during childbirth.  Maternal mortality leaves more than 1 million children motherless each year, and children who have lost their mothers are up to ten times more likely to die prematurely.</P>
        <P>We are capable of drastically reducing the occurrence of death during pregnancy and childbirth.  The real tragedy of maternal mortality is that it is so highly preventable.  Investments in training for health care providers and the upgrading of health care facilities have already significantly reduced the number of mothers dying during childbirth in Latin America, south-east Asia and the Middle East.  Progress in these regions is laudable, but the situation is still dire in many parts of the world.  Given that it is so preventable, maternal mortality is unacceptable anywhere.  The Government&rsquo;s contribution to the No Woman Should Die Giving Life fund is a significant step toward ending the unnecessary deaths of mothers.</P>
        <P>As Ireland grows increasingly cosmopolitan, our world view has also broadened.  Our economic success has created the opportunity to look beyond our own borders and become active citizens of the world.  The steps we are taking to eliminate the problem of maternal mortality underline our commitment to the world&rsquo;s poor.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Government again on its international leadership in working to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of mothers and children.  This important contribution has brought us one step closer to realising the ideals that the millennium development goals set eight years ago, and the impact made in the lives of millions of mothers and families will reverberate across the developing world.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion that Seanad &Eacute;ireann acknowledges the millennium development goals and that we are committed to reducing the maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015 in developing countries.  I also acknowledge the commitment of the Government and its substantial contribution to the new UN population fund agency, and that we will support 75 of the poorest countries to deliver better services for women before, during and after birth.  I agree with all those aspects of the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I acknowledge his announcement that he has now provided over &euro;3 million in funding to programmes targeting maternal mortality and reproductive health in developing countries.  Let there be no doubt that the Government&rsquo;s intention is sincere.</P><Col N="814"/>
        <P>I acknowledge there was a lack of response to the millennium development goals and perhaps we should have pushed a little harder.  Nevertheless, the sincerity is there and we will reduce maternal mortality.  The least amount of progress was in the area of maternal mortality.  At present, the number of women dying in child birth is huge.  The risk of dying is great among those giving birth, with 500,000 dying last year.  It is horrific to read that and the Minister of State is very much aware of it.  As a nation, we must do everything in our power to see how we can make sure those numbers will decrease annually.</P>
        <P>We are the first country to contribute to the UN population fund agency.  I love its beautiful line, &ldquo;No Woman Should Die Giving Life&rdquo;.  We must keep that in our thinking all the time, because if every country adopts that line in its commitment to reducing maternity mortality, then the sincerity will be reinforced.  This fund is providing funding to 75 countries to help women before, during and after birth.  The agency is promoting the right of every man, woman and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity.  It is trying to reduce poverty, to ensure that pregnancy is safe and wanted, that every young person is free from AIDS and is treated with dignity and respect.  That is the value of this agency.</P>
        <P>I did not know anything about the agency until it became part of my brief to understand the nature of overseas aid and to see how I could contribute to make sure that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution will be to the forefront.  I compliment the agency for making sure that its concepts are endorsed.  Ireland is a strong supporter of this agency and it contributed over &euro;4.5 million to the organisation in 2007.  Ireland also contributes over &euro;1 million for reproductive health issues such as contraceptives and basic obstetric supplies.  These are areas that we should be promoting and we should be making sure that all the facilities are available for pregnant women.  I wonder if &euro;500,000 is enough, or whether back-up supports are available to help young women in these situations.  We need to reduce the number of those who die at child birth for the simple reason that they do not have the facilities, the supports or the supplies available.  I question the Minister of State on that sum.   We are talking about 500,000 women who die every year at child birth.</P>
        <P>I am also aware that &euro;500,000 is provided to stop female genital cutting, a phrase which sounds awful.  How can we reach out to these young people when over 3 million girls are at risk of this practice annually?  I would like to shout the question from the rooftops as to how we can stop it.  Is there any way to break through this religious and cultural way of life in some of these communities?  We must do it.  I want to be a leader in this, if I can.  These young people are vulnerable, and include baby girls only one or two years old.  They come to Ireland as asylum seekers on the basis that if they are sent back to their own countries, they will be subjected to these practices.</P><Col N="815"/>
        <P>My heart is in the right place when I talk about this issue.  The Minister must do everything he can to promote these changes.  It can be done through public relations exercises, through our services, our NGOs and our missionaries.  The infrastructure is in place and we must move to make sure that this is no longer a part of our thinking.  We should not be talking about issues like this in ten years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the goals we have set for the next ten years.  The policy in this respect is to reduce maternal mortality and ensure reproductive health.  We, as a nation, should do that in any way we can.  We should shout from the rooftops to protect young and older women from atrocities carried out in sub-Saharan states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to move the amendment to the motion.  We reached agreement on the motion, which was changed.  Therefore, we are pleased to withdraw our amendment as a result of that change.  It is important there is unanimity on this type of issue.</P>
        <P>At the UN in 2000 the Taoiseach pledged that Ireland would reach the target of 0.7% of GNP in development aid by 2007.  That pledge fell by the wayside.  However, we acknowledge that if the trend of the past two years continues, we should reach the target by 2012.  Based on last year&rsquo;s budget it is expected that &euro;914 million in overseas development aid will be provided this year, which is a significant sum.  It is imperative that this taxpayers&rsquo; money is used wisely and accounted for fully.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael strongly supports the millennium development goals laid out by the United Nations in 2000.  Their principles, eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, achieving universal primary education, gender equality, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and ensuring a global partnership for development are all worthy and necessary.</P>
        <P>The motion before us refers to the fifth millennium goal, improving maternal health.  The target is to reduce by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 the maternal mortality ratio.  According to the UN Millennium Development Goals Report 2006, the rates of maternal mortality appear to have changed little since 1990.  The worst affected regions are sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia.  To understand the scale of the problem, I recommend that Members check a website, <i>mdgmonitor,</i><b> </b>where one simple map illustrates the severity of the problem.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Family Planning Association&rsquo;s role is largely concerned with, as its name <Col N="816"/>suggests, family planning and avoiding unwanted pregnancies, safe child birth, avoiding sexually transmitted diseases, combating violence against women, stopping the horrendous practice of female circumcision and promoting gender equality.  Ireland, as well as the EU, has a history of supporting the UNFPA in its work to ensure fewer deaths as a result of pregnancy.</P>
        <P>The George W. Bush Administration claimed that the UNFPA is involved in the promotion of abortion.  This has been disproved by a number of independent researchers.  I received a document from the Pro-Life Campaign yesterday, as I am sure did others Senators, a group which also questions the funding of the UNFPA.  Perhaps the Minister of State might wish to clarify and comment on this matter.</P>
        <P>The maternal mortality ratio has been declining at a rate of less than 1%.  In 2005 536,000 women died of maternal causes compared with 576,000 in 1990.  In sub-Saharan Africa a women&rsquo;s risk of dying from such complications in the course of her lifetime is one in 16, compared to one in 3,800 in the developed world.  This is a damning statistic.</P>
        <P>Though the causes of maternal deaths are varied, the majority of such deaths and disabilities could be prevented through appropriate reproductive health services before, during and after pregnancy and through life-saving interventions should complications arise.  Attendance at delivery by skilled health personnel is critical in this respect, as such personnel are trained to detect problems early and can effectively provide or refer women to emergency obstetric care when needed.</P>
        <P>One of the major problems in targeting this development goal is the lack of appropriate data both for earlier years and more recently.  The statistic annex of the UN Millennium Development Goals Report 2007 does not have adequate data for 1990 to provide a base level for maternal mortality, nor for any year since 2000.  A single piece of data in 2000, namely, the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, reveals a stark contrast between the developed world and certain developing regions in the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa.  The number of births attended by skilled health personnel shows that while some regions have made substantial progress in this area, for example, north Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, others have fallen back slightly or remain in very low terms.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that Irish Aid assisted two projects relating specifically to maternal mortality in 2006.  It assisted an obstetric care maternal mortality project in Sierra Leone and a body in Nicaragua to build 14 mother and child care hostels, which also received a significant grant.</P>
        <P>The &euro;3 million funding which the Minister of State announced is to be welcomed.  We, on this side of the House, certainly welcome it.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for sharing time with me.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to make some brief comments on this debate.  The Irish Family Planning Association is a collaborating non-governmental organisation with the UNFPA and, as such, has assisted in the work of the all-party committee on sexual and reproductive rights, founded in 2000 by Mary Banotti, a former MEP and the former Senator, Mary Henry.  I congratulate them on the work they have been doing since then.</P>
        <P>In the short time available to me I want to outline a few facts on the experience of adolescent girls in developing countries and to ask the Minister of State to pay particular attention to this issue and perhaps discuss with Irish Aid how it can invest more strategically in the health education and livelihoods of adolescent girls to empower them to avoid the trap of becoming mothers while still children.  This is a major issue in many developing countries.  We need to ensure more programmes are put in place to target young first time mothers and to reach out to those young women in need of health services, including sexual and reproductive health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Pregnancy and childbirth related death is the number one killer of 15 to 19 year old girls worldwide.  Each year nearly 70,000 teenage girls die and at least 2 million more are left with debilitating or chronic illnesses that can bring them lifelong suffering.  It is estimated that every year 14 million adolescent girls between the ages 15 and 19 give birth and many other younger girls give birth who do not even feature in the records.  High rates of adolescent pregnancy persist in many countries, even though the rate is declining worldwide.  These are countries where poverty and poor health are endemic.  On average, one third of young women in developing countries give birth before the age of 20.  This puts these young women at huge risk.  I ask that we focus on this group of young women in the aid we give and develop more strategic programmes to reach them in the countries to which we give aid.  This is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa where more than 50% of adolescent girls give birth by the age of 20.  In some sub-Saharan countries the figure is more than 70%.  This happens particularly in countries where child marriage rates are high, including much of west, central and east Africa, and south Asia.  It is an area on which we need to focus and if we do, we will substantially improve the lives of these young women.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome this opportunity to recognise the important contribution that Ireland is now making towards achieving the millennium development goals, in particular goal No. 5, which has been referred to by other speakers, to improve maternal health and specifically to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality rate in developing countries.  Under this commitment the aim is to reduce <Col N="818"/>maternal mortality by 75% over a period of 25 years.  This is a significant and ambitious target, but it is entirely achievable.  It is clear from this debate that so many of these deaths are avoidable.  They are deaths which would not occur if the mothers were living in the developed world and are due to the lack of antenatal services which is the cause of a great number of the complications that arise around childbirth. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Some 75 of the poorest countries will be targeted by the millennium development goal and Ireland has made a substantial financial contribution both to the UNFBA fund of &euro;2 million and also the trust fund on female genital mutilation, operated jointly by UNICEF and UNFBA.  Currently, female genital mutilation or cutting affects between 100 million and 140 million women and girls &mdash; and 3 million girls are at risk of the practice annually.  The programme is designed to work with cultural and religious leaders to encourage a societal change and the abandonment of the practice.  That more constructive approach is to be encouraged as sometimes we may express cultural disapproval of practices in the developing world without understanding the long traditions and roots in particular communities.  A process of education and encouragement is a more productive approach.  Funding of &euro;500,000 will be provided for that along with another &euro;500,000 from the Government to the fistula schematic trust fund.</P>
        <P>Again, this was established as part of the UNFBA&rsquo;s campaign to end fistula.  Obstetric fistula is typically the result of prolonged and obstructed labour, most usually when medical intervention or Caesarean section is not available.  The pressure of the baby&rsquo;s head against the mother&rsquo;s pelvis causes extensive tissue damage, making her incontinent, and in most cases the baby does not survive.  This programme aims to prevent the condition by ensuring skilled attendance at births and to provide treatment from those who have suffered from fistula.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is very important that the half a million who die every year in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia from treatable and preventable complications of pregnancy and childbirth will now be supported, and hopefully other EU member states will also contribute to these funds.  Ireland has been one of the first to do so.  When expected outcomes for mothers in sub-Saharan Africa are compared to the prognosis for women giving birth in developed countries, the risk of a mother dying in the former region from childbirth related complications over the course of her lifetime is one in 16 as compared to one in 3,800.  Those differentials are unacceptable.  I am not a mother, but any woman in the developed world who is, must have an instant sense of concern and responsibility for women who find themselves in those situations in less developed parts of the world, and who face much poorer outcomes.</P><Col N="819"/>
        <P Just="Left">What can be done in terms of trying to address this very ambitious target of a reduction of 75% in maternal deaths?  Other speakers have referred to the importance of introducing appropriate reproductive health services, before, during and after pregnancy and also through life-saving interventions if complications arise.  This involves attendance at deliveries by skilled health personnel, doctors, nurses and midwives, who are trained to detect problems early and can effectively provide or refer women to obstetric care when needed.  The regions with the lowest proportions of skilled health attendance at birth are sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia but unfortunately, they also have the highest numbers in term of maternal deaths.  Disparities in the supports available to women during pregnancy and childbirth are also evident both among countries and within them.</P>
        <P>According to surveys carried out between 1996 and 2005 in 57 developing countries, 81% of urban women deliver with the help of a skilled attendant, as against only 49% of their rural counterparts.  The difference the increased supports that are available to urban women make stand out in comparison to their rural counterparts.  Hopefully the UNFBA programme will focus to a large extent on the rural women who seem to have much poorer outcomes.</P>
        <P>Some 84% of women who have completed secondary or higher education are attended by skilled personnel during childbirth.  That is more than twice the rate of mothers with no formal education.  While educational level  plays an important part in outcomes, such as in childbirth, this will have to be taken into consideration.  Antenatal care has long been recognised as a core component of maternal health services and can serve as an important entry point into the wider health care system for women who, perhaps, do not avail of important and critical health services.  Since 1990, every region in the developed world has made progress in ensuring that prospective mothers receive antenatal care at least once during pregnancy.  Even in sub-Saharan Africa where the least progress has occurred, more than two-thirds of women receive antenatal care at least once during pregnancy.  This is stated in the UN&rsquo;s millennium development goal report in 2007.  That same report states that for antenatal care to be effective, international experts recommend as essential at least four visits to a trained health care practitioner during pregnancy.  Another point made very clearly in this report is that no single intervention can address the multiple causes of maternal deaths, and that efforts to reduce maternal mortality need to be tailored to local conditions, since the cause of maternal deaths can vary across developing regions and countries in Africa and Asia.</P>
        <P>In Africa and Asia haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal deaths while in Latin America and the Caribbean, hypertensive disorders during <Col N="820"/>pregnancy and childbirth pose the greatest threat.  Obstructed labour and abortion account for 13% and 12%, respectively, of maternal mortality rates in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Asia, while anaemia is a major contributor to maternal deaths, but is a less important cause in Africa and a negligible factor in Latin America.</P>
        <P>It is important that whatever programmes are developed are very much tailored to local needs.  The last issue to which I wish to refer &mdash; the report touches on it &mdash; is that of preventing unplanned pregnancy and the need to make contraceptive services and contraception more freely available to young women, particularly in developing countries.  It is estimated that at present, 137 million have an unmet need for family planning in the developing world.  An additional 64 million women are using traditional methods of contraception with high failure rates.  Contraceptive prevalence has increased slowly, from 55% in 1990 to 64% in 2005, but it remains very low in sub-Saharan Africa, at 21%.  These are all issues that need to be tackled, but I commend the Government on the important financial support it has given towards achieving the millennium development goal of reducing maternal deaths.  I look forward to a further opportunity to address this topic, perhaps in a year&rsquo;s time, when we can review the issue again and see what type of progress has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The idea of the Irish Government spending money for these declared purposes is laudable.  The millennium development goals commit us to reducing maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015.  Any money we spend seeking to prevent female genital mutilation and maternal mortality and on the campaign to end fistula is money well spent.  I commend the Government on its right intention in contributing generously to these purposes.</P>
        <P>What is less clear, however, is whether the UNFPA is the organisation that should receive this funding.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State has inherited a situation here.  He is not long in the brief.  As Senator Cummins mentioned, concerns have been expressed about whether the UNFPA is the correct organisation to be trusted with funds for these very sensitive purposes.  Its activities in regard to the promotion of abortion in different parts of the world have been documented.  I wonder whether Senator Cummins was asking if that had been disproved or merely disputed.  The voices that have expressed concern about the UNFPA&rsquo;s activities are very respectable.  I understand they are the right aims but I put the Minister of State on notice that I will be visiting him in his Dublin office and in his home constituency to talk about whether the UNFPA should be in receipt of Irish funding without guarantees that we have not had to date.</P>
        <P>Let me say a little more about what I mean.  I shall start by talking about two cases.  Magna <Col N="821"/>Morales was a Peruvian woman.  Government officials in that country, as part of its controversial policy of population control, took her from her village in Northern Peru and subjected her to tubal ligation.  Essentially, it entailed the tying up of her fallopian tubes in order to stop her having any more children killed her.  The mother of five children died ten days after the operation due to the lack of follow-up medical care.</P>
        <P>On the other side of the world, in Sihui county in China, women are routinely forced to have abortions and sterilisations under that country&rsquo;s horrific one-child policy.  Women who have had more than one child, or two in rural areas, are subject to fines, and can have their houses destroyed if they attempt to flee.  This policy, which is almost 30 years old, was intended to curb population growth in that country.  It has certainly achieved that but at a huge cost, as in Peru, to women&rsquo;s rights and human dignity generally.  These barbaric practices may seem to belong to a more brutal era but they are happening now and we in Ireland may well bear some responsibility for them.</P>
        <P>As we debate this motion congratulating the Government for giving an extra &euro;3 million for these purposes, most of it to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, we have to ask about the UNFPA&rsquo;s performance to date.  This is an organisation that received &euro;4.5 million in core funding last year in addition to funding of TRUS.  It is assumed, therefore, that they will receive between &euro;5 million and &euro;8 million this year.  The UNFPA insist, as do its many defenders, that it does not promote or support coercive population policies.  It points to its statutes which forbid the funding of abortion, involuntary sterilisation or coercive practices of any kind.  It limits its reproductive health promotion to the provision of contraception, or so we are told.  For over a decade, evidence has been building up to show that it is intimately involved in promoting abortion, in terms of providing equipment and pressurising countries whose laws forbid abortion to legalise the practice.  It is no consolation to me that Senator Fitzgerald mentioned that the enforcing agency &mdash; I think she used the interesting term the &ldquo;collaborating agency&rdquo; &mdash; in Ireland of the UNFPA is the Irish Family Planning Association because it does not have a good record when it comes to honouring the constitutional values of the dignity of all persons born and unborn.</P>
        <P>In 1998, an investigation by the US Congress found that UNFPA activity in China amounted to effective support for China&rsquo;s notorious forced abortion and sterilisation policies.  Evidence was recorded of forced sterilisation, forced  abortions and extra judicial detentions for those who did not comply with the Chinese government&rsquo;s policy.  All this was happening while the UNFPA was aiding the Chinese population programme and denying there was any coercion.  In 2001, a further hearing determined that coercion was still a key <Col N="822"/>part of Chinese policy.  People who like to close their eyes to these facts like to claim that the people who make these claims are right wingers.</P>
        <P>Congressman Chris Smith in the United Stated is no right winger.  He is a champion of various human rights causes, from the rights of immigrants to the rights of people with autism to the prevention of torture.  In fact he should run for the presidency of the United States some time.  He would make a refreshing change from those who seem to advocate torture as a necessary part of keeping their country safe.  He says that the UNFPA has worked hand in glove with China&rsquo;s repressive population policy.  He points to the fact that the UNFPA has repeatedly defended the Chinese one-child policy, even praising it on some occasions.   In 1981, the then executive director of the organisation, Rafael Salas called the one-child policy &ldquo;a superb example of integrating population programs with the goals of national development&rdquo;.  In 1983, the UNFPA established a new honour called the United Nations Population Award, a sort of Nobel Prize for population control programmes.  One of its inaugural recipients was the Chinese state family planning commission, which was responsible for all I have outlined.</P>
        <P>In 1998, UNFPA changed tack, condemning the coercion so crucial to Chinese policy.  However, it still maintained its close ties with the Chinese regime.  According to UNFPA and its allies, UNFPA only resumed operations in China after Chinese officials agreed to end all quotas and birth restrictions.  Former US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, no right winger, declared in 2002&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris will have his chance in a short time.  He declared in 2002, on the basis of a state department investigation, that the US was suspending its funding of the UNFPA because of its involvement in the Chinese one-child policy.  He specifically referred to the UNFPA&rsquo;s assistance in administering the &ldquo;social compensation fees&rdquo; which the Chinese Government impose on women who have more than the regulation number of children.  Where are the activists for women&rsquo;s rights now?  This penalty can be up to three years worth of income, which is a crushing amount.</P>
        <P>If the House is still not happy with the examples I have given, consider the Peruvian situation where its leader, Alberto Fujimori, ran that country like a personal fiefdom for nearly a decade before he was turfed out in elections in 2000.  What emerged after his departure from office was a series of sandals, the most serious of which involved the forcible sterilisation of women in poor rural villages.  Government officials, who were given monetary rewards for each woman sterilised, used carrot and stick techniques to cajole, trick or force them.  When the Peruvian <Col N="823"/>parliamentary commission examined the issue it discovered that the UNFPA was central to these activities, together with the US foreign aid agency, USAID.</P>
        <P>We need to address issues of maternal mortality as a fundamental issue in the promotion of human dignity.  We have to look hard again at whether UNFPA as an organisation can be trusted to honour our constitutional values which are about showing love and care to women and men, born and unborn.  We need to give the money but, perhaps, we need to consider giving it to non-government organisations which can be trusted, such as Mater Care, an organisation which seeks to assist women and children in pregnancy.</P>

Time and again, however, highly-regarded institutions such as the WHO and the UN have refuted the allegations being made.  Senator Mullen chose his words carefully, saying &ldquo;or so we are told&rdquo; and replying to Senator Cummins by asking whether information was &ldquo;disproved or merely disputed&rdquo;.  I disagree and suggest the arguments have been well refuted at this stage.

	<P>The response is the same as it has been since I became a public representative.  It is a case of send out the e-mail and forget about the changes in facts and the new studies and results.  It is a case of, &ldquo;We believe the UNFPA is assisting with maternal health and we do not agree with it, so let us keep this show on the road.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>A particularly laudable aspect of this development goal is that maternal mortality is largely preventable and is one of the millennium development goals on which we can really make progress.  I applaud Ireland&rsquo;s increased assistance to and support of the UNFPA, as I applaud the new initiatives on the part of the Government in regard to gender-based violence and the targeting of funding against female genital mutilation, which is highly important.  Given that maternal mortality is largely preventable, it is a problem the international community should galvanise itself to eradicate &mdash; Ireland is doing a good job in this area.</P>
        <P>Pregnancy is the number one world killer of adolescent girls.  That should not be the case.  We know from our own experience the extent of maternal mortality and related problems.  Contraception was part of dealing with that problem.  People, particularly women because they carry the burden of the pregnancy, are entitled to the choice.  Turning a blind eye to the function or role of contraception in dealing with the millennium development goals and population issues is utterly foolish.  We need only look at our own his<Col N="825"/>tory.  Women died while giving birth to their 16th child.  It is inhumane to subject a person to this.  Just because we have advanced, it is not acceptable that we deny that option to poorer people.</P>
        <P>Another issue with regard to the millennium development goals is the unmet need for family planning.  The Minister of State will know I am chair of the all-party group on sexual and reproductive health.  We offer an invitation to the Minister of State to meet us, and hope he will do so.  It is a cross-party group which welcomes all shades of opinion.</P>

	<P>We do so because a good debate is needed.  We would welcome the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the work of the all-party group on which it would be good to have all-party agreement &mdash; I think we will achieve it &mdash; is legislation to outlaw the practice of female genital mutilation.</P>

	<P>It is important we achieve that.</P>
        <P>It is through international travel that one gets to know more about these issues and this is an issue of which I am aware through the work of the all-party group.  I support the work of the Irish Family Planning Association in this country and abroad.  It is our duty as parliamentarians to see what is going on in the world.  It is our duty to the Irish people that we know what the UNFPA is doing with Irish money.  This is why I welcome visits on the part of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or the all-party group on sexual and reproductive health, which has a good reputation for the work it has done, including, as noted by Senator Frances Fitzgerald, the great work done by its former chairperson, former Senator Mary Henry.</P>

I do not understand the rush to attack the UNFPA to which Senator Mullen seems to have succumbed.  I understand and respect the views he holds, and he has articulated them very well in this House, but the notion that the UNFPA or other UN organisations cannot be trusted because they engage in vital work in this sector seems odd.  I question whether Senator Mullen&rsquo;s criticism of or attack on the UNFPA is in a sense a cloak for some other points he wants to make in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator White, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The kind of work for which the UNFPA is using its budget, and which appears to concern Senator Mullen, has to do with, for example, being part of ensuring a significant decline in maternal mortality in countries such as China, Cuba, Egypt, Jamaica, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Tunisia as more women have gained access to family planning and skilled attendance at birth, with backup emergency obstetric care.  This is the kind of initiative in which the UNFPA is engaged and is not one in respect of which I have any concern.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand how anybody could for a moment have a difficulty with such an organisation.  The UNFPA is engaged in vital work to ensure we reverse the situation in our great, rich world whereby the risk of a woman dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth during her lifetime is approximately one in seven in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone compared with approximately one in 30,000 in Sweden, which presumably is the country Senator Mullen would have difficulties with in regard to its family planning regime.</P>

	<P>An estimated 200 million women in the world, despite what the Catholic Church and others say, wish to delay or avoid pregnancies without availing of family planning.  I cannot understand why a policy would be in place anywhere to deny women access to family planning.  I ask all Members and not only Senator Mullen why we would deny family planning to women.</P>
        <P>It is correct that the UNFPA and other organisations should promote family planning in every country and not, as Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, only in rich countries where people can afford it.  Demand for contraception is increasing not only in the coercive sense where people are told to use contraception to limit their families but because they make a free decision to do so.  That does not have to flow from the coercion of women.  One in three deaths relating to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective childbirth had access to family planning.  An estimated 19 million unsafe abortions are carried out each year in developing countries.  What will be done about that?  Is it not correct that an organisation such as the UNFPA should have a role in addressing such issues?  If internationally funded organisations are charged with addressing these issues, I have no difficulty with them dealing with these &ldquo;sensitive questions of contraception and abortion&rdquo;, as Senator Mullen called them.</P>

I congratulate the Government on what it has done.  It is vital it continues to make the contribution at international level that it has.  Ireland should have no concerns, such as those expressed by earlier speakers, in respect of the UNFPA.  The agency is doing magnificent work and we ought to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about Senator Alex White congratulating the Government, when the Government congratulates itself, it smacks of a self-delusional, almost patronising and colonial attitude.  It is not long since Ireland declared itself a republic and the Government should not engage in such behaviour but when parties are in Government too long, these habits creep in.  The debate gives a sense of us all trying to keep ourselves happy and we are deluding ourselves regarding the protection of the environment and carbon credits and so on.  The sum of &euro;4.5 million for this development goal will not make a significant impact.   This is our contribution while our overseas development aid budget is in excess of &euro;900 million.  I expected the debate to focus on the broader issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The diverging views that have emerged during the debate are interesting and no one&rsquo;s contribution should be dismissed whether reference was made to family planning or the misappropriation of UN funds.  These issues should be investigated and evaluated further.  If on behalf of the people the Government will spend almost &euro;1 billion annually on ODA in years to come, it must be sure such abuse is not taking place.  The recent focus on ODA has highlighted the issue of aid finding its way to corrupt officials in certain countries.  They are being handed cheques to spend as they wish.  It does not matter whether this relates to a corrupt African nation or a UN body which is accused of being very bureaucratic and top-heavy in administration.</P>
        <P>The lifestyles of many of those who work for the development agencies is very good.  We <Col N="829"/>assume countries such as South Africa, Kenya and Mozambique are poverty stricken but that is not the case.  One can have a good time living in these countries.  Many of those working for development organisations have fine houses and swimming pools and it is important the issue of these organisations spending their allocations appropriately on the basis of the expectation of the Irish taxpayer or administratively should be debated.  The taxpayer, for example, would not approve of coercion into forced sterilisation.  Rather than shouting down Senator Mullen for raising this issue, it should be investigated further by the Government to ensure it is not taking place.</P>
        <P>The issues raised regarding maternal death are incredibly important, including the medical facilities available in these countries and the lack of nurses and doctors.  This lack is due to First World countries poaching them to work in their own hospitals and other health care facilities because they do not spend enough money to train enough personnel of their own.  When one visits any hospital in Dublin, one will meet doctors and nurses from Nigeria, Mozambique, Sudan, Chad, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan.  If they are here, they are not looking after their own people.  A sum of &euro;4.5 million is poor compensation for those countries considering we are stealing their health care workers.  The Government must face up to this and stop clapping itself on the back because it is contributing to many of the problems experienced by Third World countries.</P>
        <P>Much of our overseas aid is spent on armaments to support undemocratic regimes.  The way these regimes spend this aid and abuse their own citizens by burning or shooting them or turning them into refugees results in a huge cost to those countries.  We must face up to our responsibilities and discuss these issues during debates such as this.  We could put forward proposals but we should not shout down any Member who raises an issue that might not necessarily fit with our ideology.  Our best approach is to seek value for money for the ODA budget of &euro;1 billion, examine where it is being spent and take the radical actions mentioned.  This would include denying funding to regimes that might be stealing the aid and exercising the same quality control over this budget as would be exercised over departmental budgets to ensure the money is spent on the mothers and children who need this health care.  We are discussing maternal deaths but neonatal and early childhood death rates are also significant in these countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Millennium development goal No. 6 concerns HIV-AIDS, which has ravaged sub-Saharan Africa to the extent that grandparents are rearing children with HIV simply because they have no access to antiviral treatment.  Hepatitis B is another important issue in this respect.  For hundreds of families who were lucky enough to be asylum seekers in this country, a cycle which had lasted 400 or 500 years of mothers passing hepa<Col N="830"/>titis to their children was broken because the children were given antivirals when they were born.  This basic and inexpensive treatment is freely available here.  The same can be said in respect of vaccinations for illnesses such as measles, which used to cause havoc in this country.  When spurious research published in the UK persuaded parents in the Dublin region to refuse MMR vaccine for their children, three children died and a number of others were left with nervous deformities.  This is happening every day in parts of the world where children do not have access to vaccines rather than because of silly nonsense and some sort of neoliberal attitude that prefers natural methods to vaccination for children.</P>
        <P>We should focus on these matters because they will make a huge difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  The simplest steps that make the greatest difference are vaccination, retaining health care professionals and improving hygiene.  Many of the hospitals in these countries lack electricity generators or proper sterilisation equipment.  Even though &euro;4.5 million is small change, it will go a long way, and the overall UN budget for all the millennium development goals is in excess of &euro;1 billion.  We need to ensure that money is well spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the pressing international development issue of maternal health and mortality.  I thank Senators for their contributions and I am pleased the motion is agreed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2000, maternal health was selected as one of the eight highest priorities for the future of developing countries.  By including the issue in the millennium development goals, heads of state and governments underscored the magnitude of this problem and its tragic implications not only for the women affected but also for their children.  I regret to say, however, that the challenge is not being met by the international community.  Despite the promises made in MDG No. 5 to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters by 2015, the mortality rate has remained at the same level as in 1990.  The actual number of women dying has increased, from 529,000 in 2000 to 536,000 at present.</P>
        <P>This mortality rate varies hugely by geographic region.  With 96% of maternal deaths worldwide, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia suffer disproportionately.  In some African countries the lifetime risk of death in childbirth for women is as high as one in seven.  Within Africa the figure can vary wildly from country to country.  Deaths per 100,000 live births are 230 in South Africa, 1,000 in Mozambique and a shocking 1,800 in Malawi according to the most recent figures.  There is no sign of this overall picture changing despite pockets of encouraging progress.  While progress has been slow in all regions, sub-Saharan Africa shows the least progress in the maternal mortality <Col N="831"/>rate, dropping by only 0.1 % annually compared to the target of 5.5%.  This lack of progress has been due to a number of factors.  For many years, the largest obstacle to progress in maternal health has been a lack of political will and resources.  In the competition for scarce resources in over-stretched health systems, women&rsquo;s needs have tended to be pushed aside.  Emergency obstetric care has been often viewed as a luxury rather than as a basic right.  Access to contraception is also a major factor.  When women in the developing world cannot choose to control the spacing between births, their ability to return to health between births can be compromised.  This increases the chances of complications in pregnancy, bringing greater risks to their health and to that of their child.</P>
        <P>The latest maternal mortality figures have evoked a reaction not only among the donor community but also in developing countries.  It is now clear there will be no progress on the fifth millennium development goal unless there is a sea change in thinking.  This includes major advances in funding from donors and the prioritisation of the issue by developing countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total human cost of these unnecessary deaths is increasingly clear.  The cost is not only the loss of these young women and the trauma to their families but also the added vulnerability of the children they leave behind.  It has been shown in many UN studies that children who lose their mothers at a young age have an increased risk of dying before the age of five and those who do survive have a lower likelihood of attending school.  They also have a greater lifetime risk of extreme poverty.  Therefore, these young women are not only important in their own right but are vital to the lifetime prospects of their children.  MDG No. 5 on maternal health and MDG No. 4 on child survival are intrinsically linked.  Safer childbirth for the mother is also safer for the child, reducing the number of children dying shortly after birth.  A link has been also identified between maternal mortality and malaria, HIV and AIDS and a number of other medical conditions.  Issues as basic as human resources for health, access to functioning medical equipment, adequate supplies and medical hygiene are all key factors in improving survival rates.</P>
        <P>In the past year donors have taken additional steps to address this important issue.  A number of European governments, including Ireland, have increased their funding to issues around maternal mortality and attempted to bring to public attention the shocking loss of life being sustained by women in developing countries.  In the White Paper on Irish Aid, the Government clearly outlined its commitment to supporting the specific health needs of women.   The White Paper states that, &ldquo;addressing women&rsquo;s health needs, particularly in the areas of basic healthcare and maternal and reproductive health must lie at the <Col N="832"/>heart of an effective overall response to improving health in developing countries&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Since the White Paper&rsquo;s publication, Irish Aid has developed a health policy which addresses issues of maternal mortality, including the determinants of maternal mortality.  It strengthens systems, especially those serving the poor, and it contributes to an effective international response to their health needs.  Irish Aid does this through bilateral assistance, regional partnerships where appropriate, global partnerships and civil society.  In our bilateral programmes we support priority country governments in sub-Saharan Africa to deliver a package of basic health care, including reproductive health care.  Additional support is granted for specific initiatives on maternal health, such as the new midwifery school in Northern Province, Zambia, which opened in 2006.  Another example is our commitment of &euro;2.3 million in 2006 to a four-year project in Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi to improve the provision of maternal health services by mid-level health workers.  In addition to this funding, Irish Aid works through several partner agencies in the UN system to address maternal health and contraception.  Ireland gives significant support to WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNAIDS and UNDP and the Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria, all of which contribute to reducing maternal mortality.</P>
        <P>One of the main barriers to achieving universal access to reproductive health is the lack of empowerment of women in developing countries.  These issues form the core mandate of the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, which is one of Ireland&rsquo;s key partners in the UN system.  The importance of its work on gender, reproductive health, maternal mortality and HIV-AIDS is recognised by the 180 governments worldwide that contributed to its funds in 2007.  In light of its important mandate, the Government increased core funding to UNFPA in the past five years from &euro;1.8 million in 2003 to &euro;4.5 million in 2007.  In addition, in 2007 the Government made a contribution of &euro;1 million to the UNFPA trust fund for global reproductive health commodities security, which aims to ensure that governments have a constant supply of reproductive health products.  These include basic supplies for obstetric care and to allow for safer births.</P>
        <P>Its particular focus on reproductive health and maternal health made UNFPA the natural home for a new UN trust fund to harness the donor commitment to maternal health.  This new campaign &mdash; No Woman should Die giving Life &mdash; was launched in December 2007.  Ireland was among the first countries to donate to the fund, contributing &euro;2 million.  Those responsible for the fund will work with governments to increase capacities in three specific areas which have been proven to reduce maternal mortality, namely, family planning, skilled attendance at birth and emergency obstetric care.</P><Col N="833"/>
        <P>The need for family planning is one of the most important factors contributing to the current unacceptable rates of maternal mortality.  UNFPA estimates that 200 million women who want to space their children cannot currently do so.  This lack of empowerment has a serious adverse impact on their health and increases their risk of dying in childbirth.  In countries where the age of marriage is lower, family planning can avert many of the dangers associated with high-risk adolescent pregnancies.</P>
        <P>Having skilled attendance at birth has been proven to be the most effective intervention in reducing maternal mortality.  In some countries the percentage of women with access to skilled midwives is as low as 5%.  Predictably, these are the countries with the highest mortality rates.</P>
        <P>The most common cause of death in childbirth is post-partum haemorrhage.  A woman can bleed to death in under two hours.  For this reason, UNFPA will work with governments to introduce a network of emergency obstetric centres.  These will deal with emergencies that are beyond the training of attendants with basic skills.</P>
        <P>The fund has divided its work into two periods.  For the period 2008-11, it will operate in 25 of the worst affected countries, developing the most effective strategies and adapting them as needs be.  In the second period, 2012-15, the fund will extend its work to a further 50 countries in an effort to make the much needed progress before the millennium development goal deadline of 2015.  In light of the excellent reports that I hear back from Irish Aid offices in the field and UNFPA&rsquo;s record in delivering good results for women in developing countries, I am confident that this trust fund will make a very positive impact on maternal health.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is pleased to have also contributed to two other UNFPA trust funds intended to improve the quality of life of mothers.  We have contributed &euro;500,000 to the trust fund to support UNFPA&rsquo;s work in obstetric fistula.  This fund was launched in 2001 and has drawn extensive attention to this distressing condition affecting women in developing countries.  Obstetric fistula is typically the result of prolonged labour and in most cases the baby does not survive.  The humiliation of the condition often leads women to be stigmatised within their communities and abandoned by their husbands. The prevalence of this condition is highest in sub-Saharan Africa.  However, the condition is easily preventable, by ensuring skilled attendance at birth.  Treatment for those who have suffered from fistula costs only &euro;200.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is also supporting work on female genital mutilation through a trust fund established by UNFPA and UNICEF.  These two organisations are working jointly in 17 countries to encourage the abandonment of this practice, which currently affects between 100 million and 140 million women and girls and 3 million girls are at risk annually.  This programme is designed to work with cultural and religious leaders to encourage <Col N="834"/>what Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to as a societal change and the abandonment of the practice.  Those responsible for its operation have selected 17 countries and are working systematically at government and local level to change attitudes.  I announced Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;500,000 to the trust fund this month.</P>
        <P>We are now more than halfway towards the deadline for the achievement of the millennium development goals.  It is unacceptable that maternal health continues to lag behind the rest.  This issue remains a priority for Irish Aid.  We are proud of the contribution we have made to date but we are acutely conscious much more remains to be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the concerns of Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Malley in respect of adolescent motherhood.  UNFPA is doing important work in this area, which we will support.  The Senators will be aware that empowerment and access to family planning are key factors in improving the circumstances of adolescent women.  This aspect lies at the core of UNFPA&rsquo;s work and is a priority for Irish Aid in its support for the latter.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Twomey&rsquo;s comments regarding audits, oversight and scrutiny in respect of our overseas development programme.  We discussed this issue at this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The Senator also referred to value for money.  We carry out value for money audits, particularly in respect of HIV-AIDS.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins and Mullen asked if UNFPA is involved in promoting abortion.  The policy laid down by the governing council of UNFPA in 1985 states that it is the policy to the fund &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services or abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.  Through our membership of the UNFPA&rsquo;s executive board and as a result of our missions in developing countries, we are confident that UNFPA abides by the policy laid down by its governing council.  Furthermore, we received a categorical assurance from UNFPA that it does not support any acts relating to abortion.</P>
        <P>We will continue to work at country level and with our partners in the global development system to improve conditions for women and to ensure they receive a suitable level of health care.  Success is vital, not just for the sake of the women concerned but also for their children and for the societies in which they live.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, which has been very well informed in nature.  I was impressed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution at this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was a useful exercise.  It will come as no surprise to the Minister of State or other Members to realise that I fully support UNFPA.  I had the privilege to visit Thailand where it engaged in a massively effective campaign in <Col N="835"/>respect of HIV-AIDS.  The honesty and openness of the instructions given to people on the verge of embarking on sexual life was very impressive.</P>
        <P>I have been of the opinion for some times that population issues are the elephant in the room.  Since I graduated from Trinity College, the world&rsquo;s population has doubled and it is now four and a half times larger than it was in 1900.  We cannot ignore that fact.  I applaud governments such as that in China for trying to face up to this problem.  I accept that the Chinese may not have displayed sensitivity in doing so and that there may have been violations of people&rsquo;s human rights.  However, unlike other institutions with political tentacles, they recognise that this is a real problem.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am glad the Minister of State placed on record the truth regarding the position, particularly in the context of the charter of UNFPA.  It is important to outline the real situation.  UNFPA has always promoted a rights-based approach to family planning &mdash; not coercion &mdash; and in China this is clear.  Those of us who believe in this important issue are delighted that Irish Aid has satisfied itself on numerous occasions that UNFPA is a deserving recipient of taxpayer&rsquo;s money and that there is no substance whatever to the allegations that have been made.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, stated in October 2006 that, &ldquo;We are proud to remain a strong funder of UNFPA notwithstanding the criticism of that agency, none of which is based on evidence&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In November last year, just a few months ago, there was also a smear made on the UNFPA that it exaggerated maternal mortality statistics for some extraordinary reason.  The position is quite clear that it was speaking about a case of underestimating maternal mortality.  There can be very manipulative and selective quotations, which can be angled in a particular way.</P><Col N="836"/>
        <P>For example, the following was being claimed:</P>
        <P LI="1">The problem with the number [the latest maternal death estimate] is that it cannot be substantiated, this is according to the former head of the UN statistics office, Dr. Joseph Chamie.  The primary reason the number is suspect is that most countries in the world do not report accurate information on deaths at all.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The fuller quote, when put in context, implies the contrary.  I will put the quote on the record.</P>
        <P>Dr. Chamie states the world was underestimating maternal death numbers.  A point made in the publication was that the old way of getting abortion death figures greatly underestimates the number of deaths caused by abortion and:</P>
        <P LI="1">Caution should be exercised when examining maternal mortality ratios and making comparisons across countries.  Under-registration of maternal deaths varies by country, as does under-registration of the cause of death.  Even in developed countries, such as the United States of America, maternal mortality has been found to be under-registered by as much as 27%.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In view of this it is not a question of exaggerating but a question of being careful with statistics.  We should also be aware that there is under-estimation of the matter.</P>
        <P>I will give another quotation from these lobbying groups.  It states &ldquo;even where the deaths are derived from a civil registration with complete coverage, maternal deaths may be missed or not correctly identified, thus compromising the reliability of such statistics&rdquo;.  The actual quote, from <i>The World&rsquo;s Women 2005</i> in context is:</P>
        <P LI="1">Reliable estimates of maternal mortality are still difficult to obtain for many countries [which only excerpts UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO explanations of the 2000 death estimates].  There are often the problems of significant under-reporting and misclassification of maternal deaths.  Even where deaths are derived from a civil registration system with complete coverage, maternal deaths may be missed or not correctly identified, thus compromising reliability of such statistics.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The problem is again under-reporting rather than exaggeration.  It is very important we know this.</P>
        <P>With regard to the United States, my colleague, Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen is a man for whom I have a genuine estimation and affection.  However, I do not agree with him.  He raised the question of the American administration and cited Colin Powell.  For a general, Colin Powell is rather gutless on these issues.  I remember when there was an attempt to introduce equal rights for people with regard to sexual orientation in the American army and it collapsed under the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; concept.  That is the amount of moral fibre that fellow has.</P><Col N="837"/>
        <P>This attack, as a result of the extreme evangelistic Protestant right wing in the United States of America, was carried out in the face of the fact that they had already appropriated the funds.  More importantly, the eminently respectable independent assessment team of 2002 found no evidence supporting false claims that UNFPA supported or participated in managing a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation.  The team recommended the release of funds to UNFPA.</P>
        <P>The report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">During our visits to five of the 32 countries we asked many SFPC [State Family Planning Commission] officials, doctors of the local hospitals under the Ministry of health, county administrative officials and ordinary Chinese in spontaneous/no-notice encounters on the street, in a school or in factories whether they were aware of any recent coercive abortions or involuntary sterilisations.  All answered in the negative, although some admitted that prior to the joint SFPC/UNFPA programme there had been such cases.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, UNFPA is operating in China to prevent these coercive policies.  That is the truth.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want to hear more?  Other teams, including one from the United Nations, a parliamentary group from the United Kingdom and a multi-faith panel of religious leaders from the United States, came to the same conclusion.  The annual human rights report of the United Kingdom indicated, &ldquo;these allegations are without foundation.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>There is plenty of good news, including in China.  Knowledge of HIV and AIDS has risen from 75% to 93% and knowledge of effective prevention methods has remained at 90%.  Knowledge of more than three modern contraceptives has risen from 73% to 99% and abortion rates have dropped from 24 per 1,000 women of childbearing age to ten per 1,000.  That is a direct result of the policies of the UNFPA.</P>
        <P>The same misinformation is given in regard to Peru.  I mentioned the Protestant fundamentalist groups in the United States and we should also look at the impact of the Vatican.  There is a pathetic case in the Philippines, where 80% of the people are Roman Catholic.  The president is a staunch Catholic, as is the mayor of Manila, Jos&eacute; Atienza.  He produced what was termed a &ldquo;natural family planning&rdquo; programme, passing an executive order which upholds family planning but he was very careful not to ban artificial contraception outright.</P>
        <P>The impact was that condoms and contraceptive pills, which had been freely available, were removed completely.  People could not get them.  There was a case here of Mrs. McGee, and people in the Philippines are now going through the <Col N="838"/>same process.  People were able to get some access by travelling and the matter is now going to court.  I wish these people well as I do not think they should be deprived because of a faith-based view, which is not supported by evidence.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to place in context some of the matters my colleague, Senator Mullen, has discussed with the most honest intentions.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for deputising for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  My issue this evening is the need for the Minister for Transport to clarify the timeframe for the implementation of the Claregalway bypass, as he indicated and promised in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I trust the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is familiar with the case.  Claregalway is a village approximately 5 or 6 miles from Galway city, choked by daily traffic volumes of more than 33,000 cars, as recorded by Galway County Council, the National Roads Authority, NRA, and other agencies.  This brings the village to a halt and severely affects people&rsquo;s quality of life.  At a public meeting a year ago one woman said she counts 41 cars before she can go out her gate.  There have been fatalities over several years.  There is mayhem at the local school of 200 children, which is at the junction of the N17 and the N18.  The road is seriously dangerous.  Local councillors &mdash; I was one &mdash; cannot provide local funds because these are national routes and the Department of Transport has not provided money to relieve the traffic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was embarrassing to see the numerous deputations that came to Galway County Council.  Deputies Grealish and Fahey declared the promised land in the form of a bypass which is in the programme for Government.  Meanwhile, local people provided local solutions with rat-runs.  This is where the real danger lies and I fear lives will be lost.  These rat-runs are Cregmore to Lydican, and Claregalway to Corandulla to Clonboo.  The engineer for Galway County Council told me today that the problem is greater now on the N84, which is substandard at Clonboo, as a result of the traffic being diverted from Claregalway.  There are traffic delays of three to four hours morning and evening in Claregalway.  Growth in Tuam is stifled as a result of this traffic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Claregalway was not considered a major inter-urban route although towns with lower traffic volumes have been bypassed, for example, Loughrea.  It is time to widen the brief.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to build a bypass in Claregalway.  The N17 is not the answer for the number of people living in the rural hinterland who need daily access to the city.  There are studies and traffic counts to support this point.  Claregalway is ripe for development because of its strategic location and range of social, educational and commercial infrastructure but it is choked and needs a bypass.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When will the Minister for Transport sanction the money for the building of the Claregalway bypass as promised in the programme for <Col N="840"/>Government?  I checked the programme today in case it had gone away.  I want an answer to that question this evening and I am not talking about the N17.  When we have the answer we will be able to work out the timeframe for the delivery of the bypass because we know that tenders, contracts etc. need to be worked out.  I want no fudges, just facts because we have had many broken promises.  Galway County Council submitted a preliminary report on the bypass route to the Minister seeking &euro;20 million.  That bypass would comprise a 5 km road, one major bridge and five roundabouts.</P>
        <P>Within the past month a red herring was thrown in to the pot at a county council meeting.  I want the Minister of State, at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Killeen, to tell me the truth tonight.  Does the Department of Transport plan to sanction 100% of these moneys or will it expect a local development contribution?  If so, what percentage does it expect that contribution to be?  I have heard a figure of 20% local money and 80% from the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>If the Department seeks a local contribution that will require a vote from members of Galway County Council to raise a loan for that 20%.  To do that we will need to get the members of the county council who are not local to Claregalway on our side which will involve considering the broad transport needs of the county.  Galway County Council has submitted 22 capital schemes to the Department of Transport that would amount to &euro;300 million.  This would include Barna, Spiddal, Oughterard and the Oranmore dual carriageway.  The county manager wants to know whether the Department of Transport is willing to work with Galway County Council on the basis that it will provide 80% of the money.  Galway County Council would need to raise &euro;60 million, being 20% of &euro;300 million, over the next five to ten years, at a rate of approximately &euro;10 million a year.  The Department would need to fund the balance of &euro;50 million a year over six years.  This is a red herring because it will slow down the bypass.  The county manager says that if the Department does not work with the council on this issue it will stifle growth in County Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this issue.  I will try to answer her questions in so far as the information is provided.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and funding of the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects, including the allocation of moneys to those projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority under sections 17 and 19 of the Roads Act <Col N="841"/>1993, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agreed programme for Government includes a commitment, in the context of the NRA programme, that Claregalway is to be bypassed by 2012.  Claregalway is located on the N17 and will be bypassed as part of the N17 Galway-Tuam road which is a national road project.  The scheme is being advanced as a motorway and the motorway order and environmental impact statement was published at the end of 2007.  A date for the oral hearing has yet to be announced.  The 2008 allocation is &euro;0.75 million.  The Minister is confident that the commitment in the programme for Government will be delivered and that the Claregalway bypass will be in place by 2012.</P>
        <P>In addition to the development of the N17 Tuam-Galway motorway, which will provide considerable relief to the town of Claregalway, Galway County Council has approached the Department of Transport about possible funding for an interim relief road.  This proposal was put forward on the basis that it would provide relief from traffic congestion, in advance of the motorway, but also on the basis that a new road in the area would open up land for much needed housing and related development.  A road designed to facilitate such development might qualify for funding under the Department of Transport&rsquo;s regional and local road strategic grants scheme.</P>
        <P>In December 2007, Galway County Council was asked to supply additional information to support the proposal for an interim scheme.  In particular, it was asked to give a breakdown of the estimated cost including details of the cost of land, construction costs, design and supervision, and other costs, to indicate the extent to which it would open up land for necessary development, and to indicate the financial contribution the council would make to the road, including the potential income from development contributions arising from development supported by the road.</P>
        <P>A reply from the council is awaited.  When the information is received, it will be examined in the Department of Transport to assess whether the proposal would quality for grant aid under the terms of the strategic grants scheme.</P>
        <P>The work progressing on the major inter-urban routes will have a positive impact for all regions and is aimed at ensuring that critical bottlenecks on the network are dealt with.  The national roads programme must focus on projects with benefits for all regions.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>Three projects in the BMW region are under construction in 2008, two of which are in County Galway.  The N6 Galway to Ballinasloe scheme, which consists of 56 km of high quality dual carriageway, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2010.  The N6 Athlone to Ballinasloe project, which consists of 19 km of high quality dual carriageway, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009.  A major programme of projects is in planning and includes <Col N="842"/>the N6 Galway city outer bypass, the N17 Tuam bypass and the N17 Tuam to Claremorris project.  The N18 Oranmore to Gort and Gort to Crusheen schemes have been prioritised in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The N18 schemes comprise 49 km of high quality dual carriageway and it is expected that construction will commence on both of them in the last quarter of 2008.</P>
        <P>The development of the Atlantic road corridor from Letterkenny through Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford will connect the national spatial strategy gateway cities.  It has been a longstanding concept in the national roads upgrade programme and has now been reinforced by Transport 21.  It is envisaged that the route will be upgraded substantially to dual carriageway road standard.</P>
        <P>A number of significant projects have been completed on the Atlantic corridor in recent years including the N15 Donegal bypass, the N15 Clar to Barnesmore scheme, the N15 Ballyshannon to Bundoran scheme, the N17 Knock to Claremorris bypass, the N18 Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass, phase 1 of the N7 Limerick south ring road, the Lee Tunnel, the Croom bypass, the Youghal bypass and the Ennis bypass.</P>
        <P>A central theme of Transport 21 is connectivity with the BMW region, that is, the improvement of strategic road links to and from the BMW region by upgrading the N2, N3, N4 and N5.  There also will be targeted improvement of a number of national secondary routes, which are particularly important for regional development.  Examples include the N56 Donegal coastal route and the N59 coastal route from Sligo via Westport to Galway.</P>
        <P>The major investment in roads in the Galway region is being complemented by increased investment in public transport.  Work is under way on the western rail corridor.  This project, which is due for completion this year, will restore the rail link between Ennis and Athenry and will enhance commuter services between Athenry and Galway.  Transport 21 also provides for the Athenry to Tuam section of the western rail corridor to be completed by 2011.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is upgrading its bus fleet throughout the country, including in the Galway area, through the deployment of 235 new buses funded by the Exchequer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He was in the House the last time I raised an Adjournment matter and I thank him.  I wish to raise a pressing issue regarding the Athlone main drainage project and the Government&rsquo;s failure to allocate adequate funds to the scheme, as promised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for many years.  It has been promised since I first was elected to Athlone Town Council in 1999.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;15 million has been allocated to the scheme under the water services investment programme 2007-09, as part of the national development plan.  However, &euro;15 million falls far short of the expected cost of the scheme, which has been examined and detailed in a comprehensive report that was submitted to the Department in 2006.  The report was never examined by the Department.  Consequently, Athlone Town <Col N="844"/>Council revised the original report and re-submitted it to the Department in 2007.  Unfortunately, Westmeath County Council and Athlone Town Council have received no response from the Department, except to state that the scheme is still under consideration.  It is appalling that the application for funding for the Athlone main drainage project has been sitting on someone&rsquo;s desk for a full year without any response being made to the local authority.</P>
        <P>The report notes that the total cost of the scheme is estimated to be &euro;80 million.  Consequently, the allocated sum of &euro;15 million falls &euro;65 million short of this figure.  This means that Athlone cannot address its sewage problems.  These figures and the lack of action provide ample evidence that the Government is not committed to the development and sustained growth of Athlone.</P>
        <P>Athlone already has received applications from five companies that are willing to begin work on the drainage scheme.  However, as the Minister of State is aware, planning of the construction phase of the scheme cannot begin nor can a commitment be made to a building contract unless the Department accepts the county council&rsquo;s proposal and allocates the funding.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that without any hitches arising, the building work to improve drainage and sewage treatment will take three years to complete from the date of approval of the preliminary report and the appointment of a consulting engineer to draw up the design.  While it will take three years to complete without any hitches, I will not hold my breath because the design phase has not yet been reached.</P>
        <P>This was outlined in Westmeath County Council&rsquo;s report to the Department. I urge the Minister of State and the Government to accept the proposals in order that this important work can begin.  Were Athlone not designated as a gateway town in the spatial strategy, I shudder to think what would happen.  The Minister of State has already referred to this point in his comments to Senator Healy Eames.  How can the Government be committed to a national spatial strategy that aims to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development across Ireland when in reality, the most basic access to fundamental drainage and sewerage facilities are not in place?</P>
        <P>The current position in Athlone is absolutely appalling.  The River Shannon is being polluted by overflows of untreated raw sewage.  This is a matter of serious concern to local residents and unless addressed, will have negative and lasting effects on wildlife and the environment.  The risk of disease and the potential spread of infection also constitutes a serious threat to residents.  Members already have seen the devastating effects caused by cross-contamination of fresh water by untreated sewage in County Galway.  I do not want a position to arise in County Westmeath in which the county&rsquo;s residents will have <Col N="845"/>no clean water, despite the effects of water contamination on their businesses, tourism, and livelihoods.  One runs the risk of the same thing happening in Athlone as happened in Galway until the drainage and sewage treatment scheme commences.</P>
        <P>The town of Athlone is expected to become a city in the near future.  However, without basic drainage and sewage facilities in place for residents, the town will not be able to sustain itself. As matters stand, its facilities are at full capacity.  This will have serious implications on the town&rsquo;s people and its future development.  Until the scheme is implemented, town planning, growth and development cannot continue.  Moreover, new houses cannot be built and existing houses and business cannot be maintained.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy requires the building up of areas of sufficient scale and critical mass through a network of gateways and hubs.  The spatial strategy designated four new national level gateways, which include the towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  These towns are supposed to increase their populations by providing a centre for business, residential and amenity functions.  The spatial strategy also identifies an important need to support the role of smaller towns, villages and rural areas.  Westmeath County Council has recently completed its development plan and a complete freeze on development has been imposed on the town of Moate because its sewerage system is at capacity.  This is will happen in Athlone unless it gets its drainage scheme.  How can Athlone be considered a gateway if it cannot provide for basic amenities and infrastructure? If the current situation remains, the gateway will not have the capacity to become a reality.  It is of primary importance to put in place the fundamental infrastructure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the national spatial strategy, the importance of other plans and programmes and their relevance to achieving the aims of the strategy are recognised.  This, it is hoped, will grant quicker and greater access to the gateway plan but I cannot understand how development in other areas is possible if the most basic needs of our town&rsquo;s infrastructure cannot be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government cannot ignore this matter any longer.  Urgent action is needed.  It is very frustrating for the local authority, including its members, to hear the same points year in, year out.  I urge the Minister of State to raise my concerns with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to clarify the position on the important Athlone sewerage scheme.  The scheme has been approved for funding under the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme for the period 2007 to 2009 at an estimated cost of &euro;15 million.  The scheme is one of a total of 19 water services projects being progressed in <Col N="846"/>County Westmeath at present with the support of unprecedented Exchequer funding from the Department under the national development plan.  The current programme, which the Minister announced last September, allows for the investment of &euro;219 million in water and sewerage schemes in County Westmeath over the next few years.  A copy of the programme is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The range of new water and sewerage schemes planned and in progress for Westmeath provides strong evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to safeguard the environment, while at the same time making provision for new jobs and new development and all the other requirements of a successful economy, including residential activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The midlands linked gateway of Athlone-Tullamore-Mullingar is one of the nine gateways in the national spatial strategy.  Linking the three strong midland towns will ensure they work in partnership to promote economic and social development in the midlands region.  The alignment of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 with the principles and objectives of the national spatial strategy places the strategy at the heart of future investment decisions by Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>The &euro;15 million Athlone sewerage scheme involves a major expansion and overhaul of the wastewater treatment plant and the collection network around the town.  The objective is to facilitate economic growth and expansion.  The scheme clearly underlines the key role envisaged for Athlone as a central element of the midland gateway under the national spatial strategy.  As well as supporting development and economic expansion, it also provides for a range of environmental improvements, including the elimination of discharges into the marina, reduced frequency of storm overflows to the Shannon itself and the rehabilitation of existing sewers.  There will be a large increase in the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, which currently deals with a load in excess of 20,000 population equivalent to 40,000 population equivalent.</P>
        <P>The preliminary report for the scheme, which sets out the design parameters and objectives of the project, together with a brief for the appointment of consultants for the procurement and construction stages, have been submitted to the Department by Westmeath County Council.  The Department will be responding to the council very shortly.  The objective of the response will be to guide the council on how to advance the scheme through the remaining stages with the least possible delay.  In that context, it is apparent that the treatment plant element of the project will require an environmental impact assessment.  The Department will work with the council to allow the EIS process and other necessary preparatory work on the scheme to proceed in parallel with a view to optimising progress towards the tender and construction phases.  The <Col N="847"/>necessary funding is allocated for draw-down by the council as required.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Senator that the Minister is equally anxious to see the scheme go to construction and completion quickly and the Department will be doing everything it can to facilitate this.  However, the Senator will also appreciate that multi-million euro projects that are being funded by the taxpayer must proceed through the proper planning and development processes to ensure they meet their intended objectives, that they are designed and constructed in an environmentally acceptable and economical manner and that they produce treated wastewater or drinking water, as the case may be, to a standard that meets national and EU requirements.</P>
        <P>I fully agree that this project is vitally important for the development of Athlone.  The Senator will be aware that the Department has already funded works to upgrade the existing water treatment plant at Athlone at an estimated cost of &euro;4.2 million.  These works, which will be finalised in the coming weeks, provide for increased water treatment capacity in the town.  The status of Athlone as part of the midland linked gateway is well understood and the Department will continue to work closely with Westmeath County Council to ensure that the sewerage scheme is also delivered as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Noel Ahern, is not present but Deputy Killeen is a good and capable substitute.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the need for a 24-hour Garda station for north Inishowen.  As some might know, Inishowen is part of County Donegal but many people from the region believe it to be the 33rd county.  It is the size of Louth and has the population of Leitrim and is therefore <Col N="848"/>a sizeable entity.  It is mostly surrounded by water and is practically bordered by Northern Ireland on two sides.</P>
        <P>There is a Garda station in Buncrana under construction, which I welcome.  It is part of an overall development project for the town worth &euro;21 million.  The Garda station is being constructed with the decentralised and consolidated offices of  the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>If there is only one 24-hour Garda station in one part of the peninsula, one must travel a substantial distance to service the rest of it.  I won the argument in favour of having a second.  Progress was made and I was led to believe we would secure a site for it.  It may well have been acquired by now.  Some months ago, I was led to believe that the Carndonagh project would proceed along with that in Buncrana.  It is from this perspective that I ask whether the Carndonagh project is close to proceeding to construction.  In many respects, the construction of the station in Buncrana had many false starts but I am glad to say the work has started.</P>
        <P>We need the new Garda station because there has been a high level of deaths on our roads.  This has lowered on foot of the presence of the Garda traffic corps.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should note that people appreciate the presence of the corps and would like it to continue to focus on the locations most prone to accidents and also on the times at which they occur.  The people who are of most danger to themselves and other road users are always the target and are not in any sense the soft targets or fish in the barrel that we often hear about.</P>
        <P>I do not attribute the deaths on the roads to boy racing because the two issues are not always linked, as everybody knows.  However, noisy exhausts are a problem in the town centres.  People want garda&iacute; to be visible to address this.  Where there is only one 24-hour station, there is a perception &mdash; regardless of whether it is true &mdash; that there is a very small number of garda&iacute; on duty in an area with a very scattered population.  In Dublin 30,000 people would inhabit an area less than 1 square mile but, in Inishowen, they would inhabit an area stretching from Newtowncunningham to Malin Head, which is probably a distance of 50 miles, or from Desertegney over the Greencastle and Shrove.  If there is as problem in one area while there is only one Garda car available, one can imagine how adequately served the population feels.</P>
        <P>I appreciate it was accepted there was a need for the north Inishowen 24-hour Garda station.  I do not know if the Minister of State has details of personnel deployment in the station.  Residents from places such as Clonmany were worried that there was a lot of delinquent-type activity in the town.  There was a particularly bad phase although there are good and bad phases.  The main problems in my town of Moville and in <Col N="849"/>Carndonagh are petty vandalism and noisy behaviour at anti-social hours.</P>
        <P>Much of County Donegal is bordered by the Six Counties and the large population base of Derry.  As a result, it is not the quiet backwater people would like to believe it is.  When it comes to money for roads, etc., people see County Donegal as separate from the counties surrounding it.  The fact the counties surrounding it are in a different jurisdiction does not mean the people are different.  There is much movement across the Border.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the construction of the station in Buncrana and the fact we have a paddywagon.  We want greater Garda visibility and more closed circuit television systems to assist garda&iacute;.  There has been quite a turnover of senior Garda personnel in the Inishowen area and I refer, in particular, to superintendents.  While every superintendent had merits, at one stage we had five in six years.  I come from a teaching background and if a school had that type of turnover of principals, one can imagine what would happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not want to go into the controversies surrounding the Garda in County Donegal but there is a need for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister to restore confidence in the force, to support the building of team spirit, to ensure sergeants do not rotate as quickly as it sometimes appears and to encourage superintendents to stay in the area and build up a rapport with the people and their staff so that the community initiatives which are needed, such as mini-policing forums, evolve.</P>
        <P>As I said, much of the county is bordered by the Six Counties.  Many of the Border villages have become unrecognisable.  We are not what many people in Dublin believe.  We are quite a vibrant little community which is undergoing change.  That is very much due to the fact Border villages have turned into quite large towns virtually overnight.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, particularly in regard to north Inishowen and the facility at Carndonagh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this matter and affording us the opportunity to clarify the current position in developing the 24-hour Garda station for north Inishowen both in terms of personnel and the building of the new facility in Carndonagh.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform is unavailable to take this debate and I am happy to stand in for him.</P>
        <P>First, I would like to address the issue of Garda personnel in the north Inishowen area.  North Inishowen forms part of the Donegal Garda division.  The personnel strength, all ranks, of the Donegal division on 31 December 2002 was 416 and the personnel strength on 31 December 2007 was 476.  This represents an increase of 60, or 12.6%, in the number of personnel allocated to the Donegal division since 2002.</P><Col N="850"/>
        <P>Buncrana Garda district covers the north Inishowen area.  The personnel strength, all ranks, of the Buncrana Garda district on 31 December 2002 was 77.  The personnel strength of the Buncrana district as at 31 December 2007 was 90.  This represents an increase of 13, or 14.44%, in the number of personnel allocated to the Buncrana district since 2002.  The Buncrana Garda district is made up of the following Garda stations: Buncrana, Burnfoot, Carndonagh, Clonmany, Culdaff, Malin, Moville and Muff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Buncrana Garda station is open to the public on a 24-hour basis.  An extension of the opening hours of the other Garda stations in the Buncrana Garda district would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>
        <P>Specifically, in regard to the north Inishowen area, a rural policing initiative was launched there on 21 February 2007 and involves two sergeants and 12 garda&iacute;.  It covers the sub-districts of Carndonagh, Clonmany, Malin and Culdaff.  The initiative is currently being reviewed to identify ways of enhancing the policing service to the community.  The Minister shares the view of the Garda inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that it is based on strong foundations in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The next allocation of probation garda&iacute; is scheduled to take place on 14 March 2008.  The needs of the Donegal division, which include the north Inishowen area, will be considered by the Commissioner in the allocation within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Carndonagh is one of the priority locations on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s building programme and it is intended to build a new Garda station there.  A site has been identified and the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the construction and maintenance of Garda accommodation, is in the process of acquiring it.  Once this is done, the OPW and the Garda authorities will bring forward the necessary detailed planning for the new station.</P>
        <P>The Government and the Minister are determined to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is provided with the necessary personnel and equipment to undertake its role effectively and efficiently.  We are committed to providing the force with the financial and other resources it needs.  This year the Garda budget stands at over &euro;1.6 billion.  This is an unprecedented investment in policing, representing an 11% increase on the Garda budget for 2007.</P><Col N="851"/>
        <P>In general, there is a significant ongoing programme for the replacement and refurbishment of Garda premises around the country.  A sum of &euro;260 million is assigned in the national development plan for Garda stations and other accommodation.  In addition to this, a total of &euro;9.5 million is available in the Garda budget this year for maintenance of Garda premises.</P>
        <P>The House should also note that the OPW is carrying out a review of a number of rural stations around the country in consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to putting in place a targeted programme of renewal.  The results of this review will feed into a broader <Col N="852"/>Garda accommodation strategy which is being developed at present by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  With regard to the two sergeants and 12 garda&iacute;, and the number on duty at any given time, the Minister of State said the needs of north Inishowen will be considered in the next deployment.  We should maintain a variety of personnel in the area.  It is one thing to get probationer garda&iacute; but it is another thing to have only probationer garda&iacute;.  We need to maintain the experienced staff as well.  </P>
