	<P>I have notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify, with regard to St. Mary&rsquo;s primary school, Church of Ireland, Royal Oak Road, Bagenalstown, County Carlow, when funding will be made available for commencement of construction of this premises given that the school has awaited this funding for in excess of two years.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to become directly involved in the provision of resident-only car parking and park and ride schemes for residential areas near major sporting stadia.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline the reason so many years after the peace process has commenced that routine security checks are being pressed on all those using the Foyle car ferry and his views on how this equates with the demise of Border road checks.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to clarify when it is planned to commence the implementation of the national broadband scheme and the length of time it will take to have the service made available to areas of the country that do not have broadband provision currently, including parts of County Donegal.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the application for top-up funding on essential repairs grants and disabled persons grants made by Westmeath County Council.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P><Col N="238" />
        <P LI="1">In view of the ongoing concerns regarding Galway city&rsquo;s public water supply and the health effects of contaminated water the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the measures and the oversight he has put in place to guarantee safe drinking water for the people of Galway city and county, and to outline his plans for the clean-up of the very polluted Lough Corrib, the original source of Galway city and county water.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Phelan, Donohoe, Keaveney, &Oacute; Domhnaill and McFadden as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Phelan, Donohoe and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The remaining Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Healy Eames as it is repetitious.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I propose the Order of Business, I would like to pay a short tribute to the late, great Jack Tobin, who was a distinguished Clerk of this House.  Jack Tobin, as we all knew him, was a hard-working, decent public servant.  He served with great distinction and served as Clerk of the House from 1973 to 1987.  He was Seanad returning officer on five occasions.  I had the great privilege of being a candidate on four of those occasions and of winning three times out of four.  Mr. Tobin set a very high standard for all of us who worked for him and the respect in which he was held by Members on all sides of the House has stood the test of time.  He set standards for the House of which we have all been proud over the years.  I, as Leader of the House, propose a vote of sympathy to his family on his sad passing.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business"> 
    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the Hunger Task Force report to Government; No. 2, motion re the orders of reference of the Select Committee on European Affairs; and No. 3, motion re the sub-committee of the Select Committee on European Affairs.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that No 1. will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and that it is to conclude not later than 6 p.m., if not previously concluded.  Spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes, and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House.  Nos. 2 and 3, motions re the Select Committee on European Affairs, will be taken together for the purpose of debate, which debate will be brought to a conclusion not <Col N="239" />later than 6.30 p.m., with the contributions of the group leaders or spokespersons not to exceed five minutes, and the Minister to be called upon five minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments.  It is proposed that at the conclusion of this debate I will ask the House for a sos of approximately 20 minutes in order that the Committee on Selection can meet to nominate members to the committee and the sub-committee, and lay its report before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of the Leader in regard to the late Jack Tobin.</P>
        <P>Many members of the public watching the emerging debate on the banking and international financial sector and on the economy in recent days will have been struck by a number of factors.  One is that, as I said in last week&rsquo;s debate, we are not at the end of the situation in regard to the banks; we are still very much at the beginning, and there are many uncertainties out there.</P>
        <P>Members of the public will also be struck by the need for the bankers, in particular, to show some humility given the scale of the support they have got from the Irish taxpayer.  This has been lacking in the debate in the past few days.  The public will be also asking what is the real debt of the banks.  Many are still not reassured in this regard and wonder what is the real story about this debt.  I do not believe members of the public were hugely reassured by the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s appearance on television in recent days.</P>
        <P>We are at the beginning of a debate that needs to be as rigorous as the debate we had last week on all of these issues.  I assume the Government will bring in the regulations in the next few days.  Above and beyond this, however, is the question of what is happening in the real economy and what is happening to individuals who are losing their jobs.  As I said recently, unemployment is of huge concern.  The ESRI talked today of the rate of unemployment being expected to rise from 6% this year to 8% in 2009, with thousands of individuals losing their jobs.  Many are concerned this will increase hugely after Christmas, when many small companies will not be in a position to hold on to their employees unless action is taken.</P>
        <P>Last week, I asked for a debate on unemployment involving a question and answer session with the T&aacute;naiste, and I spoke about the need for competitiveness and for measures to be introduced to restore competitiveness.  While we have had this immediate reaction to the crisis in banking &mdash; it was a crisis &mdash; it is clear there are longer-term issues in our economy that need to be addressed.  We have had very bad mismanagement by Government at a national level.  We have had inflationary budgets, a series of wasteful projects and a lack of oversight.  The very things we are asking the banks to do now, the Government in many ways failed to do, which are to oversee and manage effectively.</P>
        <P>The House is entitled to have this debate today.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in order that we get the opportunity to debate in the House today the very real issues of unemployment and restoring competitiveness.  I hope the Leader will agree to this amendment and ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House and tell us the specific actions she is taking, whether in the area of retraining or restoring competitiveness for small businesses.  I would like to hear what actions are being taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to the debate on the regulations coming from Government.  The most important decision we made last week was to have that debate this week.</P>
        <P>The Government should be well aware at this stage of the views of people from all walks of life and all sides of the political spectrum, and within Government itself, that in this situation the banks should be made pay for the commercial costs.  I heard the chairman of a bank over the weekend saying it would be very unfair, having said thanks to us, if the banks were to be <Col N="240" />&ldquo;crippled&rdquo; with the demands we have put on them.  While I would go along with that and do not want to see them crippled, I would not mind seeing them winded or dunted a bit lower down, so they had to clutch at their privates for a while.  There is a mood out there to ensure they would be made feel and share the pain on this one.  In simple terms, what that means is people can argue about what it would cost to insure the risk on the marketplace.  They can argue about whether it would be 1%, 3% or 4%.  However, we should remember it is a very easy sum to do.  We are talking about a liability cover of up to &euro;400 billion, 1% of that is &euro;4 billion and 3% of it is three times that figure.  There is a lot at stake.  Surely 1% is the minimum the banks should be asked to pay over the next two years.  We need to bear that in mind as we go along.  I look forward to the debate on the matter so I will not say any more, but I thought it was important to make a few points as to what the Government should do before it brings the regulations through the Houses.  The House will be aware that neither this House nor the other House will be entitled to make changes to the regulations.  We are empowered simply to reject or accept them.</P>
        <P>I join with what the Leader of the House said about Jack Tobin, a former Clerk of the House.  I only knew him for a month while he worked here although I met him a few times afterwards.  It was a very difficult month because my colleagues, Senators Ross and Norris, in conjunction with Senators Brendan Ryan, John A. Murphy and Mary Robinson gave me the very attractive task of trying to sort out office space with Mr. Tobin and the Superintendent.  He spent a month arguing with me before he took retirement in 1987.  I found him a very decent man to deal with but a very difficult man.</P>

	<P>He was straight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He certainly had a reputation.  When I came into the House, Senator Ross had dealt with him for five years before the neophytes like Senator Norris and I arrived.</P>

	<P>The younger Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In that regard, he would know him far better than we did.  He certainly was a man of extraordinary intelligence, cultured and interested in music in particular.  He knew the rules backwards.  If he were here today, he would have some interest in the point I raise next, which relates to the second item on the Order Paper.</P>
        <P>Since that month 21 years ago, in all my time in here, I have no recollection &mdash; I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; of the House ever establishing a sub-committee of another committee.  It never happened before.  The D&aacute;il did it last Thursday but I believe it went beyond its jurisdiction in doing that.  It was <i>ultra vires</i> its own Standing Orders.</P>
        <P>I will outline why that is the case.  We set up a Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I have no objection to the committee.  I refer to the procedure establishing it.  Last October we set up a select committee of Members of this House who would join the other select committee to form the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  We empowered the select committee comprising Senator Donohoe, Senator Quinn, Senator Prendergast, and some Members from the other side of the House to establish sub-committees under the terms of Standing Orders 70(1) to 70(9), inclusive.  We also established a joint committee.  We gave the joint committee the powers as defined in Standing Orders 70(1) to 70(9), inclusive.  Standing Order 70(3) refers to the &ldquo;power to appoint sub-committees&rdquo;, etc.  We have given away the power to establish sub-committees of the Joint Committee on European Affairs by a decision of the House.  It is a regulated decision and it is the normal way of doing business.  We are overriding that.  At this point we do not have the power to establish a sub-committee.  We could establish a special <Col N="241" />committee or other kinds of committees but we do not have the authority to establish a sub-committee of either the select committee, which we appointed last year, or the joint committee that was formed by the two select committees.  I do not raise the matter to create a difficulty for the Leader but this is <i>ultra vires</i>.  I have never seen it happen before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from the points I have made, in terms of normal parliamentary convention or organisational convention, the power to establish sub-committees has always been vested in a committee.  The only people who can be members of a sub-committee are the existing members of the committee.  What we could do today is appoint additional members to the select committee and, accordingly, to the joint committee, and then let the joint committee set up a new sub-committee, which is perfectly in order.  Our actions today are open to challenge.  They are not within our powers under Standing Orders or under the Standing Orders of the D&aacute;il.  One cannot give powers and then take them back, unless the option is to take from the joint committee the power to establish a sub-committee.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to create a problem for the Leader or the Cathaoirleach, but there is a significant problem with this issue.  Last year we gave away powers to establish committees twice in the one motion, first, to the select committee, comprising Seanad Members and then to the joint committee, made up of the two select committees meeting together.  We are purporting to set up a sub-committee of the joint committee despite having giving away the power to do so.  It will not work.  There is another technical way to deal with this matter.  It should not prove difficult if we simply appoint additional people to the joint committee and take it from there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the tributes paid to the late Mr. Jack Tobin.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole appears to have a compelling point.  The notion that the Houses could set up a sub-committee seems odd.  The Houses may set up a committee and it, in turn, may set up a sub-committee.  We should have some guidance from the Leader on this matter and perhaps we should take advice from the Committee of Selection.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Counsel could also be asked to advise us on this serious matter.  Since it been raised, it may be appropriate to consider, in light of the banking crisis last week, the possibility of a committee established to deal with banking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be an odd way to proceed, under Standing Orders, if we proposed a sub-committee on banking to be set up from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  How could that work?  Clearly, it is a matter for that committee to set up a sub-committee.  If the House is now in a position whereby it can establish sub-committees over the heads of committees, as it were, then Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right in saying that it is an issue that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Leader communicating to leaders of the other groups in the House before the Order of Business that statements on banking are to be discussed tomorrow.  The Leader has indicated we will not debate the matter until we have sight of the Government scheme, which is reasonable and which I appreciate.  It would be odd to proceed with the debate without having sight of the specifics of the Government&rsquo;s intentions.</P>
        <P>I agree with the comments of Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole that some humility is called for from the banking community, especially its leaders.  We have all suffered from sleep deprivation in recent days given the onerous task which was before us.  However, I had to rub my eyes when I heard that one of the individuals concerned made a series of demands regarding <Col N="242" />what the Government should do with universal child benefits, which he believed should be attacked, State pensions, and the abolition of medical cards for those aged over 70.  This proposal comes from one of the people who was saved and whose bank was in some difficulty last week.  If this person has trouble with his day job, which appeared to be the case last week, perhaps he could have a future in the entertainment industry as a comedian of some sort.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>For this person to suggest to the Government that it should consider such cuts when he has been the beneficiary of such largesse, the extent of which we do not yet know, seems extraordinary.</P>
        <P>Today the Irish Congress of Trade Unions sponsors a very important event called the world day for decent work.  I wish to mention it briefly to the House because while such days come and go and frequently they do not mean much, this is important in the current context of the banking crisis.  The notion and principle of regulation have been dirty words for two decades.  However, they are suddenly back in vogue in certain quarters.  Aer Lingus announced today its intention to chop off, as it were, whole sections of its operation, replacing reasonably well paid jobs with what inevitably will be lower paid jobs.  In those circumstances, it is timely that we should draw attention to the fact that approximately 200,000 people in this country earn less than &euro;10 an hour.  That is the reality of what an army of low paid and low skilled employees are facing.  Senator Fitzgerald was right to call for a debate on unemployment but we must look to see what we are talking about in that regard.  It is not just a notional issue.  These are real people who face real challenges in terms of living their lives on low pay and without much hope being offered to them by the Government.  We should have that debate.</P>
        <P>Everybody is now coming around to the view held by those on these benches that regulation is something that should be examined again.  I ask the Leader to outline what will happen in respect of the different Bills that have been agreed in the transitional agreement recently agreed with the social partners?  I refer to legislation on employment rights, temporary agency workers, employee representation rights and all of those areas that are vitally important for employees, workers and taxpayers.  When will that legislation be brought forward?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate to be held early next week on the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme in light of the forthcoming budget and, in particular, the role of decentralisation in the redevelopment of regions throughout the country?  It has been a successful campaign and we are looking forward in particular to the decentralisation of the former Land Registry, the Property Registration Authority, to Golf Links Road, Roscommon town, which was agreed last April.  It is hoped the contracts have been signed.  Permission has not been granted by Roscommon County Council and I call on it to grant it as quickly as possible to ensure we will achieve a major decentralisation of over 250 jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Last week we witnessed an historic debate in the late hours in the Seanad.  We in Fine Gael supported the Government&rsquo;s financial Bill in the interests of the State but with many reservations.  We should not forget those reservations especially, as Senator Alex White said, in light of the Government scheme, which is to be announced later in the week.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald spoke about humility.  I did not see much humility being demonstrated over the weekend by these so-called bankers but my concern was about what the regulator was doing.  On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; he appeared to be praising the Government for the wonderful job it was doing.  He said the <i>status quo</i> remained, nothing had changed and he stood over everything he said three months ago.  I do not have much confidence in him as a regulator of our institutions.</P>
        <P>The chief executive officers of these institutions must be accountable.  We were told that one of them earned &euro;3.3 million in bonuses.  The compensation culture must come to an end.  The bank charges that low paid workers, older people and those who are not so well off will have to endure to maintain the standards to which bank chief executives have become accustomed cannot be imposed.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister that, as Senator Fitzgerald said, the bankers have to be humble.  Our people cannot suffer because of the way the bankers have carried on.</P>

	<P>I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to clarify the current situation in respect of Valentia and Malin Head coastguard stations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, indicated on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; that the Government&rsquo;s preferred option is to develop the Shannon facility.  The Minister of State, the Department of Transport and the T&aacute;naiste do not seem to be clear on this matter.  I had been led to believe that no decision had been made.</P>
        <P>My main concern relates to Malin Head station which, like Valentia station, is working very well.  We should maintain what we have during the economic downturn, rather than creating greater expenditure in this manner.  It makes sense, from an economic, emotional and infras<Col N="244" />tructural perspective, to upgrade what is in place at present.  Nothing more complicated than that needs to be done.</P>

	<P>Since the introduction of post-leaving certificate courses 20 years ago, hundreds of thousands of students have taken advantage of the opportunities offered to go back to school and retrain.  Last year, I spoke in this House about the McIver report, which was completed four years ago.  The report was published as part of an attempt to strengthen the adult education sector and increase the number of students who take post-leaving certificate courses.  It dealt with issues like teaching, class sizes and accommodation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, told this House last year that he would examine the report, but we have heard nothing about its implementation since then.  As other Senators have said, it is important in the current economic climate to invest in aspects of education such as retraining and upskilling.  Will the Leader ask the Minister of State for an update on the McIver report?</P>

Today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> publishes the results of a survey of people between the ages of 15 and 19, which was conducted by the newspaper in conjunction with RTE.  Half of those surveyed said that they know people in their own age group who have died from suicide, or have attempted suicide.  I am seriously concerned that the HSE is not giving the issue of suicide the priority it deserves.  On average, 500 people die from suicide every year.  A further 11,000 people present to accident and emergency departments having tried to kill themselves.  The National Suicide Research Foundation claims that 60,000 people harm themselves each year.  I am concerned that the serious recession we are entering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal for a debate on unemployment, in the presence of the relevant Minister.  When the Leader was cogitating over the weekend, perhaps while in his bath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;did he not consider, on mature reflection, that his assault on the media may have been somewhat over the top?  I refer to his comments about RTE radio, in particular.  The Leader&rsquo;s comments were unbalanced and unbecoming of him.</P>
        <P>Turning to more serious matters, I refer to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  In view of the admission by the Minister for Finance, having met the relevant Commissioner in Europe, that some tweaking will be necessary to fit the framework agreed at European level, will amending legislation be necessary?  I thought it was cheeky of the German Chancellor to say she was not amused at the Irish action when she then promptly proceeded to do the same herself in Germany.</P>

	<P>Absolutely.  Everybody in the Government parties should be glad that we in the Opposition almost unanimously agreed to the scheme, and that it will have to be <Col N="245" />brought before both Houses.  Some of what is intended will be put into the scheme, but I would still like to know if amending legislation will be necessary.  Can the Leader tell us when this House will debate the scheme?  I understand that it is to be signed off at Cabinet this evening.</P>
        <P>The markets are taking a very different view to what the Financial Regulator and the governor of the Central Bank have been saying.  The 2007 stability report stated that around 85% of new lending was related to property.  We should be demanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised a matter on the Adjournment last week concerning difficulties which have arisen in Mayo about finalising the draft development plan in the county, as well as the ongoing exchanges between the council and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Since then, I have been inundated with correspondence from councillors in other counties, predominantly but not all from Munster, where it seems the same level of difficulty is being experienced.  Can the Leader arrange for the Minister to attend the House and clarify his position regarding section 31 of the Local Government Act 2000?  What does he feel are his powers and what are the powers, if any, of elected county councillors?  What is the position of county managers?  They now seem to be in the invidious position of having to take orders from the Minister, while at the same time being legally bound to carry out the wishes of their councillors, as expressed at county development planning stage.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that we are having statements on the banking system tomorrow, which may or not be replaced by the detail of the Bill.  The debate in this House on the detail of the Bill will be critical because the Minister got a blank cheque last week.  It is now very important that we use the wisdom and expertise in this House, including on these benches, which can help to guide the progress of this scheme.</P>
        <P>The banks have shown a contempt over a long period for their ordinary customers.  I am not referring to the counter staff but rather to the people leading the banks and devising policy, those sorting people into very long queues and reducing staff at the counters, making their <Col N="246" />lives difficult as well, and showing that they really did not want the little people.  However, now they have come to the little people to be bailed out by their tax revenues.</P>
        <P>I said last week in the House and I said it before this crisis arose that there are people, in particular young people, on critical mortgages who need to be protected.  People both here and in America have taken substantial bonuses.  I refer to the obscene spectacle of the chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers who took $500 million in the past year in bonuses, share issues and such like.  Such people have had their snouts stuck in the trough while repossessions have been taking place.  The House should address that point, either in that context or separately.  I suggest the question of house repossession should be taken as a separate item.  I have been raising this matter consistently.  I note in today&rsquo;s newspaper that a senior judge has raised concerns at the increase in the number of repossession orders presented in her court as we speak.</P>
        <P>This is completely obscene.  This is where neo-liberal economics, deregulation, privatisation and outsourcing leads.  I was one of a small minority which opposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  I had a feeling where such a move would lead and now we have outsourcing.  I share Senator Alex White&rsquo;s concern that perhaps this is an attempt to jump the gun legislatively, so to speak, because some legislative protections were in the process of being introduced in the aftermath of the disgraceful manner in which Irish Ferries treated its Irish employees and brought in so-called yellow pack workers.  This is not acceptable.  I note also the number of people contacting the money advice and budgeting service for advice.</P>
        <P>I support strongly my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, in his reservations about the second item on the Order Paper.  What is the need for this extra number?  Who are they and have they been contacted directly?  This is a Minister interfering in and politicising the work of a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is not the first time this Minister has done this and it rings alarm bells for me.  I do not like this kind of interference in the work of the committees.  The strength of the committees is that they are non-partisan and operate collectively.</P>
        <P>In light of our concerns about oversight of spending and decentralisation, will the Leader find out the state of the proposals to develop new government offices in Carlow on a car park which for many years has been subjected routinely to flooding to such an extent that the new proposed buildings would have to be built on stilts 7 ft. above the ground?  There is no indication that this will be done after the &euro;20 million flood prevention scheme has been installed.  Are we still wasting money in this profligate manner with no thought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the economy with a particular emphasis on F&Aacute;S, not with reference to the difficulties in F&Aacute;S but rather the benefits of the community employment schemes and the need to extend them, and on the subject of training and retraining?  I am conscious of the ESRI report published today which indicates that unemployment will reach 8% over the next few years.  In that eventuality it would be important to place ourselves correctly for the future.  It is interesting to note that even during the 1930s, there were growth areas in economies, in the new technologies of the time and in electronics.  It is important that people who have been earning very good money in the construction sector in particular and who need to retrain would be given that opportunity.  The House should debate this issue with an emphasis on what needs to happen for the future.</P><Col N="247" />
        <P>I agree with other speakers who are amazed at a person who can receive bonuses higher than the gross domestic product of some countries, sums of $500 million in bonuses, salaries and packages, in a year in which they have brought the world economy into recession.  I am thinking in particular of the CEO of Lehman Brothers.  There should be a clawback on people like that who have caused such misfortune for us by repackaging loans that were inherently unstable and without any responsibility for undertaking the management of those loans by selling them forward.  It must be wrong for people to have received such sums.  One wonders if that CEO had received the full $1,000 million would we now be heading into a depression.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  I also support her statements on the banks.  The House had a comprehensive debate last week and took on trust the Government&rsquo;s proposal, lending it qualified support.  We know it is only a temporary reprieve as we can see from the market movements this week.  In respect of the capitalisation of banks, the distinction between liquidity and solvency &mdash; as well as the quality of the assets the banks hold and the manner in which they value them &mdash; has been missed in all this, and the Minister must provide clarification.  Statements by the banks and the regulator in recent days suggest that it is just business as usual with the State guarantee and that everything will continue as before.  One can rebuild capital by postponing dividends and increasing margins.  We must be concerned, however, that when such a State guarantee is given the banks will not use it to build up their capital reserves in a way that is damaging to ordinary taxpayers who stand by this guarantee.  If the regulator and the Minister cannot get to the bottom of this and set out a plan as to how banks can recapitalise given the comfort of this State guarantee, the Comptroller and Auditor General may investigate and report where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of substantial risk to State revenues.  There is therefore a case to be made for the Comptroller and Auditor General to review the risk, liquidity and capitalisation of banks and report to the D&aacute;il on the matter.  Such reports could be prepared periodically as long as this guarantee lasts.  Perhaps the Minister can make a statement to the House at some stage this week on the issue of capitalisation of the banks, as well as the idea of the Comptroller and Auditor General investigating the matter.  Unlike the Financial Regulator, the Comptroller and Auditor General is answerable to the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senator Mary White on suicide.  In the last Seanad, I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which established a sub-committee that reported on suicide.  There were some startling revelations in that report.  Young males are particularly vulnerable in this respect and are seven times more at risk of suicide than females of the same age group.  The problem is that while young females will return home and tell their parents about problems, young men will not do so.  That is because they think it is not manly.  When I was a member of the Midland Health Board, along with the Leader and your good self, a Chathaoirligh, we had a help line motto, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get down, get help&rdquo;.  It was very useful and is still in operation.  I strongly advise anybody who is feeling down to make good use of that help line.  </P>
        <P>I support what Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan said earlier.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I supported the proposal to have members of Mayo County Council appear before that committee to give their views on the matter.  I await with interest what they may have to say.  Without prejudice, I strongly support the powers of councillors and, whatever about increasing those powers, I would certainly not subscribe to reducing them.  This area may require clarification because there is much concern among local representatives in the run up to next year&rsquo;s council elections.  There are signs in all parties that not as many people are coming forward.</P>

        <P>I agree with Senators who have requested a debate on unemployment.  It has been raised by a couple of Senators already today.  Aer Lingus has in the past two days again given the two fingers to the Irish people who made that company and who created the circumstances by which it could be successful. It has also given the two fingers to the workers who made sacrifices in the recent past to make the company what it is today.  It is disgraceful that the chief executive will not speak publicly about the need for what he is doing.</P>

        <P>The management at Aer Lingus has done it again.  It has acted in this way since the company was privatised.  It was the wrong decision.  Market forces do not always work.  We live on an island.  Unfortunately, a price will be paid, especially by the tourism industry.  When the cabin staff are gone, the first impression for those arriving in Ireland will be totally different.  Unfortunately, the move over the past two days symbolises a bigger one that Aer Lingus is planning, that is, the removal of other slots for commercial reasons from Ireland to probably Britain and the United States.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request from my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, for an early debate on the economy and banking matters.  It is important that when we are spending a great deal of time here properly casting a verdict on what happened last week, we bear in <Col N="249" />mind what the financial markets are saying about this plan.  I do not want to spend too much time listening to what they are saying, given the difficulties that we are talking about.  Nonetheless, since the Government announced its scheme shares in the large banks on the Irish, European and American stock markets have continued to slide.  Yesterday was a cataclysmic day in terms of the performance of stock markets throughout the world despite the work of governments in all countries in stating what they will do about the challenges facing the banking sector.  We would not be seeing these falls in share values if there was not severe doubt about the principles of the plan and the commitment to make it work.</P>

	<P>There is an air of unreality about any calls for humility in the banking sector.

	<P>I wish to be associated with the remarks from all sides of the House on the death of Jack Tobin.  I remember him very well, as a different type of clerk from the current ones.  That is not pejorative or complimentary.  He was a rather distant, severe and very traditional man.  On my first day in the House I put down a motion on Seanad reform.  </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The time is up now; Senator Ross may have to put down another motion.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a tribute to him.  It was Jack Tobin who put me right on this and told me I was unlikely, in that session, to make a great deal of progress.  That was 28 years ago.  He was not particularly enthusiastic about the motion, and he got his way.  In many other ways he was robust in his views which he could convey in a particularly subtle way.  He was never party political in any sense of the word, and he was very likeable.  He also had a great way of dealing with the Cathaoirleach, which did not involve whispering in his ear at every possible opportunity.  He briefed him well before he came into the House and never needed to brief him in the House.  He was a distinguished, distant and extremely loyal, and loyal to the procedures of this House.  We should recognise that.  I express my sympathy to his family.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business, I am struck by the words of Senators Fitzgerald, Donohoe, Coghlan and other.  On the issue of banking, which we will discuss tomorrow, what is striking is that this crisis is not over.  That is worrying.  I am also struck by the fact that everybody is beginning to be critical of the regulator.  The regulator should resign because he has equal responsibility with others for what has happened.  The issue of most concern, as Senator Donohoe mentioned, is that the guarantee which we gave is not convincing the markets that it has a great deal of credibility.  What the Government did was not wrong; it was a good pre-emptive strike.  To give a guarantee of &euro;400 billion when one cannot possibly ever pay it defies people to see what it entails.  The national debt is approximately &euro;43 billion.  We have given a guarantee on which we cannot possibly deliver, especially now when we are not a particularly healthy economy.  We are not expecting to ever have to deliver but it is very unusual, in banking or commercial terms, for anybody to accept a guarantee from anybody who cannot pay it.</P>
        <P>The credibility of this scheme is now in serious danger.  I call on the Government to present the details of it to us immediately, not next week, or it will land us in more trouble than we expected.  It does not matter what happens on the stock market, but the inability of the banks <Col N="250" />to borrow on the money markets is continuing.  The details of the scheme need to be outlined immediately before things get out of hand.  The markets continue to fall, which is an indication of what people think of what we have done, although that does not mean it is a reflection on what we have actually done.  Nevertheless, it is important.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

He was also appointed by the then Taoiseach as the first secretary to the newly established New Ireland Forum, which signified how highly regarded he was held by the Government and the Houses as a civil servant and an officer of this House.

The guarantee that was given by both Houses last week is not free; the State will charge for it.  We will have a better knowledge of the position when the regulations are brought before the House later this week.  I thank the leaders of the groups in the House for their support.  I will inform Members on the Order of Business tomorrow when it is proposed to put the regulations before the House, and I will allocate a full amount of time for Members to express their views on them.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to provide for a debate on employment and competitiveness.  Senator Hanafin and other colleagues suggested that F&Aacute;S and the economy also be discussed in that debate.  The House will be aware that the budget is to be introduced next week.  On Wednesday night following the Budget Statement and during Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; business, I intend to afford Members the opportunity to express their views on the economy, competitiveness and all matters related to employment, as Senator Fitzgerald mentioned today.  I will propose to extend the time for Private Members&rsquo; business by an hour to provide for a three-hour debate on the economy, and Members will have the benefit of knowing the content of the budget from the previous day.</P>
        <P>This is a difficult time for ordering business in the House.  We have an obligation to ensure legislation is processed.  Before the end of this week the regulations must be agreed and passed by both Houses.  I thank the party leaders in the House, the Whips, the Cathaoirleach, the clerks, the staff and all my colleagues for their understanding and support in this regard.  It makes my job a great deal easier.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Alex White highlighted their concerns about No. 2 and the establishment of the sub-committee.  The business has been ordered and is proceeding, but I will convey the Senators&rsquo; concerns to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White and Senator Kelly expressed their concerns about the situation in Aer Lingus, employment, employment rights and, in particular, the matters that have been agreed in the national agreement.  It is certainly a challenge for the Government and, indeed, everyone.  It has crossed my mind on numerous occasions over the past week how the challenges we face are changing and are doing so by the day.  Formerly, there was an interval of a week or month between challenges but now they are arising by the day.  Ireland is not alone in confronting problems in the banking industry; it is a worldwide challenge.  Other countries, especially our European colleagues, must face up to what we have had to do and respond in the same way.  It is a liquidity problem and has nothing to do with stocks and shares.  Our European colleagues must confront the challenges.  Some of them have done so since the last sitting of the House.</P><Col N="251" />

        <P>Senator Mary White and Senator Glynn asked for a debate on suicide.  Senator Mary White, who is a champion in this area, put an alarming figure before the House when she said that up to 60,000 people harm themselves each year.  This is an alarming statistic, especially now when people are under pressure for one reason or another, and particularly given the various challenges in business and employment.  We must do everything we can to deal with this.  I will allocate time for a debate and invite the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, to attend.  It will be an opportunity for her to receive an update on the Senators&rsquo; experiences and views and for her to give the up-to-date position on this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan and Senator Glynn spoke about the development plans of various counties and supporting local authority colleagues.  This is most important, and I thank the Senators for bringing the matter to our attention.  I have no difficulty with inviting the Minister to the House at an opportune time to debate section 31 of the Local Government Act and to examine how we can assist the members of local authorities.  We are their representatives.  They are obliged to meet the challenges they confront in the best possible way and they will have a difficult time over the next few years.</P>
        <P>Some Members will recall the downturn in the economy during the 1980s and how difficult it was for members of health boards, vocational education committees and local authorities to strike the estimates.  I proposed the estimates in 17 of my 18 years on Westmeath County Council.  I recall that my colleagues at the time were very concerned and worried, but we had a duty to fulfil.  I wish everyone well in this regard and we will assist local authority members in every way we can.  I am proud and privileged to have been elected so many times.  Most of my colleagues in the House are here at the behest of the local authority electorate and we will do everything we can to assist those members.  I certainly will invite the Minister to the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>I agree with comments about the coverage of the Listowel Races on TG4 and support my colleagues in that regard.  Finally, I wish to acknowledge that a distinguished former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Sean Dublin Bay Loftus, was in the Visitors Gallery earlier today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to join Members in the Seanad for this debate on the Hunger Task Force report.  It comes at a particularly difficult and turbulent time on the international scene.  This House has debated long and hard, well into the night and early morning, the crisis in the international financial sector, and Members have been bombarded and lobbied in regard to intricate and exotic financial matters.  However, there is another crisis facing the world at present, namely, the hunger crisis.  There is one voice Members did not hear, the voice of the 862 million people on this planet who will go to bed hungry tonight.  These are the silent, hungry millions who populate our world.  Today, in this Chamber, we have an opportunity to listen to their voice and hear their concerns.</P>
        <P>I thank the members of the task force, particularly its chairman, our former Oireachtas colleague, Mr. Joe Walsh, for a very clear, concise and focused report.  It gives a voice to the <Col N="253" />hungry and articulates in an urgent tone what needs to be done to put an end to hunger once and for all in this world of plenty, and provides pointers for what Ireland could do to help to achieve this.</P>
        <P>The genesis of the report was the White Paper on Irish Aid which was published two years ago, a seminal document which charted the way forward for the Irish Aid programme in the medium to long term.  One of the key recommendations of that White Paper was to establish a Hunger Task Force to examine the particular contribution Ireland can make to tackling the root causes of food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  It was particularly timely that Ireland as a nation took this initiative before the food security crisis developed throughout the world in the past 12 to 18 months, when basic staple foods and foodstuffs became extremely expensive and inaccessible to hundreds of million of people.  That Ireland already had this process in train, and had the foresight to bring some of the world&rsquo;s top experts together to analyse the issue and ascertain how Ireland could contribute towards resolving this truly difficult problem, is a matter of which we can all be justly proud.</P>
        <P>On foot of the recommendation to set up the task force, a 15-member group was established under the chairmanship of Mr. Joe Walsh and composed of prominent national and international experts, including Ms Josette Sheeran, the director of the World Food Programme, and Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, special adviser on food issues to the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  The task force commissioned research and analysis of the issues involved, and held a number of meetings in Ireland, in both Dublin and Cork, as well as a field visit and meeting in Malawi.  I understand the Malawi visit was particularly rewarding as it gave the task force the opportunity to interact directly with officials and civil society representatives of a country which has had some success in recent years in battling a situation of persistent chronic food insecurity.</P>
        <P>That success is a point I would like to highlight.  I had the opportunity of visiting Malawi in July to see a country which had faced a food security crisis and serious food shortages for 5 million people a few short years ago.  Through very proactive measures, which have been successful and which we have studied and brought into the report, that figure of 5 million going hungry each day has been reduced to approximately 500,000, and perhaps provides a template as to how we can proceed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This report details the deep-seated challenges we face in ridding the world of hunger.  However, at the same time it also highlights a series of success stories to show how we can win this war on hunger.  Others have done so.  We just need to decide that this is our priority and that we are determined to win this battle.  The case studies are available in the report.  Some of them like China, Vietnam and Brazil are well known, but others are less well known, especially two cases in sub-Saharan Africa including Ghana and Malawi.  Ghana has halved the number of undernourished by increasing agricultural productivity through the application of successful agricultural research coupled with improved public sector services to agriculture.  In two years Malawi has almost trebled production of its staple food crop, maize, from 1.2 million tonnes in 2005 to 3.4 million tonnes in 2007.  The key to that was the provision of subsidised fertiliser and seed to smallholder farmers, which massively increased their productivity and helped them to get away from subsistence farming.  These examples show that the problem can be tackled, that we need to put our minds and political will to the task and decide that it is a priority and we are going to solve it.</P>
      
        <P>The report covers a range of issues involved in the complex task of overcoming and ending hunger.  I wish to focus on two issues, namely, gender and nutrition.  It is fair to say that in Ireland when we think of a farmer, we think of a man.  However, a farmer in sub-Saharan Africa is most likely to be a woman.  In sub-Saharan Africa women are responsible for 80% of <Col N="254" />food production.  That simple fact has major implications for how we should approach the task of increasing smallholder production in Africa &mdash; one of the three main approaches recommended in the report.  The African smallholder has a multiplicity of roles &mdash; farmer, mother, and home maker.  The demands on her time are insatiable.  She may well be undernourished, at risk of, or suffering from HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis or a myriad of other ever-present health threats.  To increase smallholder productivity we must factor in that very difficult and challenging reality.  Our programmes must not treat smallholders as some kind of unit of production.  They are human beings with a range of needs and our programmes must be broad enough to encompass the full range of needs including health, welfare and the welfare of children.</P>
        <P>The other element I wish to highlight is under-nutrition.  This is the silent and least visible thread running through global hunger.  Maternal under-nutrition is prevalent in both sub-Saharan Africa and in south Asia.  The report shows that such under-nutrition can run through the generations with an undernourished mother giving birth to an undernourished infant.  A child that has inherited under-nutrition from the womb is at a severe disadvantage from birth.  Unless we can get proper nutrition services to such a child he or she will in turn grow up undernourished and will pass on that low nutrition status to the next generation, and so on through the generations.  Research shows that we must intervene with such children in their first two years of life.  If we do not, then it is likely they will suffer irreversible damage to their future physical and mental development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anyone present who has children will know how difficult it would be to see a child growing up undernourished in its early years, consigned to a life of misery, and physical and mental retardation.  Such lives are lives lost.  Already, 50% of children in east Africa and 42% of children in central Africa are stunted &mdash; a clear symptom of chronic malnutrition where children are much smaller than they should be for their age.  At a global level, 10% of all children are wasted &mdash; a clear symptom of acute malnutrition where they are grossly underweight and may be in need of therapeutic intervention.  Yet, as the report points out, nutrition is frequently an institutional orphan &mdash; falling between the responsibilities of Ministries of health, agriculture, women&rsquo;s affairs, education or whatever else.  The report rightly characterises nutrition as &ldquo;the partial responsibility of many &mdash; but the main responsibility of none&rdquo;.  I very much welcome the spotlight that the report has placed on the nutrition and the need to break the cycle of under-nutrition.</P>
        <P>I also very much welcome the findings of the report and I agree with its analysis of hunger.  The analysis is well-informed and was carried out by eminent people with expertise and high standing nationally and internationally.  I welcome also the overall thrust of the report.  I support fully its recommendations that we focus on three key elements, namely, to prioritise the abolition of hunger in our development policy and in our broader foreign policy and to follow through on commitments made, to target smallholder agricultural productivity, and to promote effective actions to counter maternal and infant under-nutrition.</P>
        <P>The report will influence the future direction of development policy and of broader foreign policy.  On foot of the report&rsquo;s recommendations I will establish within Irish Aid a special unit on food security that will be tasked with advancing our work to address hunger.  The recommendations are both detailed and focused.  The first task of the unit will be to carry out a full analysis of the recommendations, and of the extent to which current programming by Irish Aid responds to the many facets of hunger.  The House has previously discussed the millennium development goals.  The primary goal is the right to life and the right to feed everyone on the planet.  Unless we fulfil that commitment, all of the other goals are meaningless.  Once that exercise has been completed, we will be in a position to plan how we can best <Col N="255" />pursue the recommendations with a view to making a real and lasting contribution to the abolition of hunger from the world.</P>
        <P>Development aid is often described in percentages and comparative volumes of money relative to what other countries contribute.  Ireland has shown that one can contribute in many different ways.  We can bring our genius and ingenuity to the world stage.  The chairman, Joe Walsh, and members of the hunger task force brought the report to the Secretary General of the United Nations.  The report was presented to the UN in the presence of such luminaries as Bono and Mr. Geldof who have worked tirelessly in this area.  We have shown that we can bring added value by using our own ingenuity and initiative to produce a report that has application not just in Ireland but in many other countries.  I was proud to bring the report to the attention of European development ministers at last week&rsquo;s meeting.  I invited them to examine the report to see whether they could apply it to their aid programmes.  That shows we can bring our influence to bear to tackle this most intractable problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power.  I join him in thanking the task force for producing such a report, which I hope will play a pivotal role in the global fight against hunger.  The report gets straight to the point in outlining a record of world failure to tackle world hunger.  All our promises to the Third World have failed.  In honouring commitments, all those who placed their trust in us and those who work to ensure that hunger is eradicated have been betrayed.  One in five developed countries have reached the 0.7% gross national income target.  The United Nations millennium development goals target on hunger is unlikely to be met in either sub-Saharan Africa or is south-east Asia.  The hunger target set by the world food summit in 1996 will not be met either.  The official development assistance commitments of the G8 Gleneagles summit will not be met either, despite commitments given at that time.  Of the African states, only five will reach the target for agricultural spending adopted at the Maputo conference in 2003.  This is a poor record of failure and a betrayal of those who are weakest, namely, those in danger of losing the most important thing of all, their lives.</P>
        <P>What are the reasons for this failure?  It is prevalent at so many policy levels, including international, governmental, regional, local and administrative.  Perhaps part of the problem is that the matter is seen as a case of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;.  Well-meaning leaders at summits can make commitments, which they may sincerely believe, but in many instances they and their administrators have no experience of what is happening.  In their offices, thousands of miles from the starving, the statistics they read in briefs are merely cold, hard statistics.  They have no connection or first-hand knowledge of the starving families whose lives are in danger because of food shortages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish people died in the 1840s in the great Famine because policy makers in Dublin Castle and Westminster could not grasp the scale of what was happening.  This &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; approach echoes in capitals worldwide at present.  The problem also exists in Africa where leadership elites have failed to deliver reforms to help eradicate hunger.  Some of the countries worst affected often do not have a single ministry or national authority to deal with their plight.  Those most affected by malnutrition, as the Minister of State, Deputy Power, stated are usually women and children.  These are often some of the most marginalised in states.  They are targeted in conflicts, caught between sides in wars and outsiders in society.  These are people that African governments can often marginalise and ignore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This report is a welcome initiative in focusing our minds on these issues, including the aims and the failures.  Ireland has a proud history in tackling and taking seriously the problems of famine and food shortages.  Memories of the great Irish Famine spur us to ensure that others do not suffer as we did.  We also have an awareness of African issues through our missionaries, <Col N="256" />who brought home an awareness of the Third World to every parish and community.  Our NGOs are among the most professional, experienced and respected worldwide.</P>
        <P>Many developing countries in Africa and Asia are aware of their colonial past.  We share with them the experience of being colonised, so we possess a greater empathy with new nations setting up after wars of independence.  This cultural and historical background leaves Ireland uniquely placed to contribute an independent voice which understands their hopes and fears.   We must use this independence of mind and spirit to work for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and lead the world in honouring our commitments.  Even if the millennium development goals were on target &mdash; they are not &mdash; some 585 million people will still be hungry in the world by 2015, which is a frightening statistic.  To put this number into context, it means the number of hungry people would be some 205 million greater than the population of the United States of America, or some 86 million greater than the population of the entire 27 countries of the European Union.  This is the magnitude of the task which confronts us.</P>
        <P>Climate change, water shortages, rising population levels and spiralling food costs will add to the difficulties faced by the poorest regions.  If we could not achieve progress in securing the millennium development goals at a time when the western world was experiencing boom times, as in recent years, what chance is there when it goes into recession, as is happening now?</P>
        <P>It is imperative that Ireland gives the lead and that we meet the 0.7% gross national income target by 2012, as promised.  I hope that even after a tough budget these people will not be neglected.  We should do everything possible to achieve our targets.  We should not sacrifice the right of starving children to food even when we find ourselves in a recession.  Even in recessionary times our society is richer than such people could ever hope to be.  They need us to deliver for them at this time.</P>
        <P>This report is a welcome study, but it must be more than just a study.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State indicate that he has presented it to EU Ministers for their perusal and that it has been presented to the United Nations.  We need this sort of action and such reports should be given to the people who make decisions.  We must become facilitators to ensure that both the developed world and the developing world deliver on their commitments.  In the 21st century there can be no moral, social or economic justification for a situation where millions of our fellow human beings do not get adequate food and face starvation.  That is an abomination and something we must do all in our power to prevent.</P>
        <P>I commend the task force on the study and on the report.  Let us hope the conclusions of the task force will be acted upon as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael P. Kitt, and acknowledge he became aware of his new role last year.  I wish him well in that new role.  I acknowledge the role of our former colleague, Mr. Joe Walsh, who oversaw the production of this report and analysed the reasons why we have such mass global hunger.  I commend him and his team on producing this report for discussion and for its recommendations.  On reading the document, I reflected on the position of Ireland some 160 years ago.  It suffered at first hand from the devastating effects of crop failure.  Ireland is familiar with starvation and hunger and many of our ancestors could speak with authority on the subject.  However, for some parts of the world I question what has changed since then.</P>
        <P>Today, as the Minister of State outlined, almost 860 million people do not have access to enough food.  Food prices are escalating.  Some 10 million children under five years of age die every year.  Malnutrition is the underlying factor in half of these deaths.  Access to safe and nutritious food is a fundamental right for everyone.  Most women and children suffer from anemia, due to iron deficiency.  This is a major cause of maternal death.  The Government is <Col N="257" />convinced of the need for a high profile, concerted and effective international effort to eradicate mass global hunger.  We committed in September 2005 to reach the target of 0.7% of the gross national income for overseas development aid by 2012 and, within that commitment, an increased effort to tackle the root causes of hunger.</P>
        <P>The task force on hunger identified what can be done to reach that target.  We have to look at the contribution Ireland can make and thus achieve the first millennium development goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015.  That was a main focus of the report and a commitment in preparing this report on how to rid the world of hunger.  It sets out a programme to eliminate hunger and highlights three critical areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">First, increase the productivity of small farm holdings, mainly women farmers, in Africa who account for up to 80% of food production in developing countries.  We have to encourage agricultural diversification among small scale farmers.  Second, we must target the prevention of maternal and infant malnutrition by supporting programmes that encourage exclusive breast feeding for the first six months.  We must support programmes that ensure maternal nutrition.  We must also support programmes of preventative measures against HIV-AIDS and other diseases.  We must support programmes that provide school feeding &mdash; breakfast and lunch meals.  Such programmes have proven to be critical to providing nourishment for children at school, allowing them to learn better as well as increasing attendance rates, also focusing on female children and encouraging them to stay on in school.  Progress in agriculture should link with nutrition.  That should be part of future policy.</P>
        <P>Third, a critical area that should be prioritised at national and international level is the reduction of hunger and malnutrition.  That will not be achieved overnight.  The commitment on hunger eradication must be a joint effort.  The aim is to reach the development goals by 2015 by reducing by half the proportion of people suffering from hunger.  A welcome recommendation in the report is that there should be a special envoy for hunger to ensure that targets are met in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to reach the 0.7% of GNI target by 2012 and that at international level the United Nations Secretary General should establish a high level task force comprising of heads of all the relevant agencies and institutions to deal with emergency food assistance, nutrition intervention, agriculture development of small hold farmers to boost agricultural production, school feeding and feeding at work.  Those are examples of what can be achieved.</P>
        <P>We must also promote international mechanisms to ensure governments honour their commitments and priorities in the reduction of hunger and malnutrition.  Another recommendation in the report worth considering is that the United Nations should have a commissioner who, along with a team, would audit the actions of individual countries in addressing global hunger and with the authority to hold governments to account where their actions are inadequate.</P>
        <P>We should also support new initiatives by international financial institutions to direct funds towards agricultural food assistance and nutrition.  Strengthening small scale farmers and assisting them in diversification is important also.  The provision of rural infrastructure should be encouraged.  For example, there are very poor roads in many underdeveloped countries which block access to markets at local and national level.  The provision of infrastructure, therefore, is another important area.</P>
        <P>Risks in agriculture must also consider climate change.  Risk in water stress, water harvesting and water management systems will be increasingly important both for food production and household use.  Access to clean household water is vital for proper nutrition and health.</P>
        <P>Hunger is not an insurmountable challenge.  While governments can give leadership, the global hunger problem requires a response from all in Irish society &mdash; Government, non-governmental organisations, missionary organisations, higher education and research insti<Col N="258" />tutions, the private sector, and the citizens of Ireland who are always ready to respond with compassion to food crises in the developing world.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report because it will encourage and inspire our Government, other governments and multi-national companies to give a global commitment to making the elimination of world hunger a reality.  I commend the report.  I hope it will be acted upon.  We must achieve our millennium development goals and stick to our plan of 0.7% of GNI to target the eradication of hunger not only in the developing world but throughout the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I sat next to him at a meeting last week at which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul launched its report on poverty in Ireland.  It made the point that on hunger in this country that the proportion of income spent on food is much higher among the poorer.  If that is true in a wealthy country like Ireland, how devastatingly more true must it be in the more disadvantaged parts of the world?  As the Minister of State said in his contribution, we in Ireland are in a particular position to appreciate that, and the point was made in the report that all of us have been touched by the ancestral memory of the famine.  One of the striking images in Dublin is the famine memorial near the Custom House.  In my own family, even though there were fairly substantial people on my mother&rsquo;s side &mdash; in 1845 they had very considerable land holdings in County Laois &mdash; after the famine they were reduced to a few hundred acres.  An entire generation was wiped out because they refused to take rents and they caught famine fever.  I know, therefore, from the memory in my own family, how devastating the impact of the famine was and we need to bear that memory in mind imaginatively when we confront the situation in the world.</P>
        <P>I share Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s concern that something should be done about this problem and I echo her words.  I do not believe it will be done.  Even in this House there is not the passionate concern.  There is not a crowded chamber with people giving vent to utter horror at the scale of what is going on.  We have not woken up yet to the complete scale of the matter.  We are not alone in that.  That is universal.</P>
        <P>The report points out that governments consistently give grandiose commitments in front of the television cameras and then fail to live up to them.  That is a scandal.  There should be a form of index rating.  Every time a government gives a commitment in these areas that they will help fellow human beings in their most dire suffering, we should monitor them and they should be exposed for not doing it and held up to the court of world opinion.</P>
        <P>There are ways in which this problem could be dealt with.  Very large sums of money might be needed but we only have to look at the squandering of money on armaments.  That could be a source of revenue to deal with part of this problem.</P>
        <P>I welcome the one brief mention of population in the report but it is not enough.  Very few people do; it is the elephant in the room.  It is the aspect that underlies so many of our problems, be it resources, the use of fossil fuel, water, international conflict, overcrowding and the increase in world commodity prices.  The population of this small planet has doubled since I did my leaving certificate.  Some 860 million people are at the most critical level of poverty.  The number of people at that level has increased by more than 860 million during my lifetime.  If that increase had not taken place, perhaps we would be in a better position to confront this problem.  Nothing can be done until the underlying problem of this planet&rsquo;s gross overpopulation, the extent of which is continuing to increase, is directly confronted.  We cannot cope with this exponential increase.  I do not mean to be Scrooge-like about it.  I do not want people to die so that the planet&rsquo;s surplus population can decrease.  However, we must reflect on the impact of overpopulation on human resources, animal life, the extinction of species and global <Col N="259" />warming.  We need to examine the population explosion in the context of any examination of world hunger.</P>
        <P>The problem to which I refer is found not just in some of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, but also in countries such as Sudan.  It is obscene that the Government of Sudan, which is racked by famine from time to time, is selling its best arable lands to Arab investors so that the considerable crop yield of such lands can be exported.  Does that echo in this Chamber?  I refer to 1847, when food was exported from this country in the face of the starving people.  The Government of Sudan is doing the same thing to its population this minute, as we speak.  People said &ldquo;never again&rdquo; after the Famine, but the events about which we say &ldquo;never again&rdquo; tend to happen repeatedly.  We are refusing to learn lessons.  We have not heard a peep from our so-called spiritual leaders, some of whom, particularly in the Vatican, have suggested we should breed more people.  I do not understand such an attitude.  They suggest that there are plenty of resources which, if managed correctly, could feed an amount of people 18 times the current population of the world.  While such a model might apply in theory, we would have a totally depleted quality of life if we had to stand shoulder to shoulder in wretched and miserably overcrowded conditions.</P>
        <P>Other Senators have spoken about genetically modified food.  I am on the same wavelength as Prince Charles of the neighbouring island in this regard.  When he was in India recently, he quite rightly spoke out against Monsanto&rsquo;s production of genetically modified crops in that country by quoting Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s line about commerce without morality.  He mentioned that there has been a rash of suicides among Indian farmers who were disappointed by the yields arising from genetically modified crops.  We are always told that such crops are much better, but that is not true in the case of Monsanto&rsquo;s genetically modified form of cotton, known as bollgard.  I presume the bollgard crop was developed to repel the boll weevil.  We are aware that such crops tend to invade and contaminate neighbouring fields.</P>
        <P>The human motivation behind Monsanto&rsquo;s behaviour is ruthless and naked greed.  Some people believe that greed is fine.  Margaret Thatcher and others told us that &ldquo;greed is good&rdquo;.  It was good for a limited period, but we need to look at the mess it has got us into now.  The financial systems of the western world cannot cope with the aftermath of unbridled greed.</P>
        <P>Is it appropriate for a multinational corporation to colonise the choices of individual farmers in countries such as India?  I was glad to hear Prince Charles saying something I have been saying for a long time.  The comments I have made to defend myself against some of the scientists in Trinity College, for example, have been unpopular.  I will continue to say such things because I believe they are true.  Even if the scientific merits of genetically modified crops were proven beyond doubt, it would be politically and commercially valuable for Ireland, as an island, to retain its GM-free status as a significant marketing ploy.  I was interested to hear Prince Charles suggest that it would be wise and prudent, as a precautionary principle in case some disaster occurs as a result of genetic modification, to ensure some part of the world is kept free of genetically modified crops.</P>
        <P>There is overwhelming scientific evidence to suggest it is more efficient to generate foodstuffs from crops that are properly managed with respect for the environment.  I refer to organic crops, in particular.  Professor Bob Watson, who led the world&rsquo;s biggest agricultural study of this area, showed that organic farming techniques in Brazil increased yields by 250%.  The study came to the conclusion that this kind of environmentally friendly farming represented a much better solution than the production of genetically modified crops.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report of the Hunger Task Force.  It is a good report.  It is important to mention that Ban Ki-moon has indicated that a further 100 million people have been affected by these problems since the start of the food crisis.  The United Nations millennium development goals <Col N="260" />now comprise something of a catalogue of shame.  The first goal is to reduce by half the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day.  This involves reducing by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, the prevalence of underweight children under the age of five and the percentage of the world&rsquo;s population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption.  These aims are quite modest because they would leave hundreds of millions of the most vulnerable people in the world, women and children included, in the unenviable categories I mentioned.  Although the report mentions that there has been a slight percentage decrease in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, if one examines the figures one will appreciate that there has been an actual arithmetical increase in the number of human beings suffering from poverty in such areas.  Even though our aims in this regard are quite modest, as I have suggested, we have not achieved them.</P>
        <P>Another absolute catalogue of shame is outlined on page 5 of this report.  We have all made promises, but have we lived up to them?  No.  Just five developed countries have reached the target of 0.7% of gross national income.  We are moving towards it but we have not got there.  I hope we do.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which has been pushing for it.  My colleagues on all sides of the committee, including those on the Government side who represent Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, have joined me in that regard.  Why have we not got there yet?  The UN&rsquo;s hunger target under the millennium development goals is unlikely to be met in sub-Saharan Africa or south Asia.  The more ambitious target set by the World Food Summit will not be met.  The official development assistance commitments agreed at the G8 summit at Gleneagles are unlikely to be met.  Just five African states have met the target that was set at that summit, which is appalling.  It is catastrophic.  We need to take the strongest possible measures.</P>
        <P>As Senator Ormonde said, 2 billion people in developing countries suffer from anaemia.  The former Senator, Mary Henry, who has visited such areas, told us all that the simplest medical intervention could prevent anaemia at a minimal cost.  We have not done that, however.  There is an impact on education.  Children cannot concentrate if they have hunger in their bellies.  They are sometimes too weak to get to school.  That is what we are facing.  If one examines the graphs in the report &mdash; I appreciate that they cannot be reproduced in the Official Report &mdash; one will see that there has been a staggering Alpine leap in the graph depicting world commodity prices.  Other graphs relate to global grain consumption and the question of population, which no one will tackle.  The wealthy countries are resorting to bio-fuels.  We thought that was the answer, but that attempt to atone for our greed for fuel resources has had an impact on the food crisis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss the report of the Hunger Task Force. Other Members have spoken eloquently before me, so it is difficult to find the right words to describe the sense of hopelessness out there.  Even in the 21st century, we see examples of chronic hunger and chronic food insecurity in parts of the world, specifically sub-Saharan Africa.  This task force report is a welcome indicator of the fact that the international community is determined to try to tackle this seemingly intractable problem in a coherent, planned and systematic way.</P>
        <P>It is important to look at the statistics behind the report which addresses global hunger.  Around 860 million people in the world are undernourished and almost 30% of children under five are underweight.  There is a huge challenge and luckily, Ireland has taken a positive global leadership role.  None the less, our progress towards achieving the targets we have set ourselves under the millennium development goals are no cause for celebration.  It is to be hoped that <Col N="261" />the approaching budget will not see a significant reversal of the steady progress we have made towards meeting our targets for 2015.</P>
        <P>Ireland already provides a high level of support for agricultural development and research and attempts to respond to food crises in many parts of the world through the Irish Aid programme.  The hunger task force will make a further contribution by helping to prioritise the work of Irish Aid.  The hunger task force was called for in 2006 as part of a White Paper on Irish Aid, and it was established in 2007 to look at the particular contribution that Ireland could make in tackling the root causes of food insecurity, especially in Africa.  The composition of the task force is made up of both national and international experts in the area of hunger and food security.</P>
        <P>The report sets out a number of recommendations which include increasing agricultural productivity, especially among the women who make up 80% of African farmers, preventing maternal and infant malnutrition, as well as prioritising the fight against hunger at a national and international level.  The remarks made by the Taoiseach at the meeting of the UN on 25 September were very telling.  He said it is unthinkable and unacceptable that in this century, as we pride ourselves on huge technological advances and the development on an interlinked global community, hunger is still the waking reality for a least 860 million people, and that number continues to rise.  The report makes it clear that Ireland and Irish Aid needs to do a lot more.  It certainly will not be achieved overnight, but the report sends a clear and ambitious roadmap for our future engagement with hunger reduction.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that at a national level, Ireland needs to declare eradication of hunger as a cornerstone of its development aid programme and as key component of its foreign policy.  We need to put this at the heart of our foreign policy and to use our position within the EU to ensure the eradication of hunger should also form a part of the common foreign and security policy of the EU.  The report also recommends that Ireland take a strong leadership and advocacy role internationally to ensure the hunger target of the millennium development goals is reached and, if possible, exceeded.  I think we will set an example.  The decisions we make on the forthcoming budget next week will send an important signal to EU member states and others as to how serious we are about this leadership inadequacy role.  There has been a serious economic downturn and the budget will be difficult, but it is to be hoped that we show our resolve in maintaining the progress we have made to date in working towards achieving our own targets.</P>
        <P>Other recommendations include working towards an indicative target of 20% of our budget development aid to actions to alleviate and eradicate hunger.  This target is to be achieved on a phased basis by 2012 in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to reach the target of 0.7% of gross national income by that date.  Senators have mentioned the recommendation to appoint a special envoy for hunger to ensure the overall recommendations of the report are implemented.  The special envoy would engage with the Government and with relevant non-governmental organisations in Ireland and could represent Ireland in important international fora.</P>
        <P>There are several recommendations at an international level, and Ireland should be using its influence to promote them.  The first recommendation is to support reform of the international architecture to tackle world hunger and promote coherence across the UN agencies and the entire international system.  When we look at different international agencies, their objectives and the work they do often seem to be contradictory, including within the UN.  Therefore, we need to see greater coherence.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends promoting robust international mechanisms to ensure governments in developing and developed countries honour their commitments and prioritise the <Col N="262" />reduction of hunger and malnutrition in their national development strategies and assistance programmes.  One possible suggestion put forward by some members of the task force would be for the Secretary General of the United Nations to appoint a UN commissioner for hunger, and establish under that commissioner an audit body that would report on individual countries&rsquo; actions in addressing global hunger, with the authority to hold governments to account where their actions are inadequate.</P>
        <P>Unless we want to remain at the level of rhetoric and aspiration, we need to put mechanisms such as this in place.  An office such as the UN commissioner for hunger would focus energy and attention on the issues at hand.  We also need the audit body because despite the best intentions of individual countries, many other issues distract them from the targets they have set.  The idea that this body would hold governments to account is something that would deliver results.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends the possible establishment of a global fund designed to deal with smalholder agriculture and long-term nutrition, which would operate in a manner consistent with existing structures.  Global funds have been mentioned in other contexts, and the Tobin tax has been proposed on currency speculation in the international financial markets.  I think it is especially relevant at a time when we are seeing the consequences of reckless behaviour within those markets.  It has been suggested that the proceeds from the Tobin tax could be used to establish a global fund which could be used to fund the kind of projects mentioned in the report.</P>
        <P>The Green Party welcomes the publication of the report and its recommendations.  We hope the Government will live up to the ambition and aspirations set out in the report and that when we discuss this next year, we will be able to say that Ireland is playing its part in tackling the serious challenge of global hunger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the publication of this excellent report.  It contains not just an account of the problem but, as Senator de B&uacute;rca has pointed out, also contains quite a few compelling and clear pointers as to what might be done by countries, including Ireland, to attack this problem.  Other Senators have referred to different aspects of the report and have quoted from it.  Each of us has noted an item that appears more striking than others.  I noted in particular the reference in the report to hunger being a failure of governance.  If anything this is an understatement.  The distinguished authors of the report state, &ldquo;This amounts to a governance failure at many levels.&rdquo;  Perhaps the most devastating statement in the entire report is a self-evident statement but which bears repeating.  &ldquo;Despite numerous commitments, there appears to be a willingness amongst both the international community and national governments, to live with the current extent of global hunger.&rdquo;  It is unfortunate but this appears to be true.  As my colleagues, Senator Norris and others, have indicated, whereas practical steps have been taken and many more can be taken, this is not a problem that we can say, with hand on heart, has in any sense been genuinely or substantively tackled by the international community with any kind of clear results in recent years, despite a considerable amount of good intentions at international level.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State used the term, &ldquo;war on hunger&rdquo;.  I agree with his use of such a phrase. However, it may seem a strange view but in the context of the war on terror, the notion of an international war on something has been devalued in many ways because of the manner in which that rhetoric has been used in the past six or seven years by some world leaders.  The idea of a war on terror has been reduced to a rhetorical notion.  When the Minister of State refers to a war on hunger I know he does not intend that to be a rhetorical statement but one that has real meaning.  His reference to the question of political will is well taken because it is <Col N="263" />a question of political will.  We can outline and describe the problem and give examples and recall the historical significance of hunger and famine in our own country.  I do not mean to devalue the contributions but it is more difficult to ensure that the fundamental problem is dealt with.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the authors of this report and I congratulate the Government for publishing it.  We have had in recent days a good deal of political debate and argument about a certain other matter, described by a Minister as &ldquo;the current position&rdquo; regarding the banking and economic crisis.  There will be political disagreement on that issue but there will never be political disagreement with the Government on the part of my party in so far as the Government is dealing with this issue.  There will not be one moment of disagreement nor a moment of opposition from my party.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The report sets out a number actions which the Government should take.  The Minister of State in his contribution concentrated on the three main areas of priority for the Government.  The report also includes a section entitled, &ldquo;What should Ireland do?&rdquo; and this is more detailed than the three priorities listed by the Minister of State.  Senator de B&uacute;rca referred in her contribution to the eradication of hunger being a cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s development aid programme.  The report recommends taking a strong leadership and advocacy role in international matters and working towards an indicative target of 20% of overseas development aid in order to alleviate hunger.  The fourth priority is to appoint a special envoy for hunger to ensure that these recommendations are implemented.  I ask the Minister of State to state whether it would be the Government&rsquo;s intention to take up that recommendation because it is not clear from his contribution whether the Government intends to appoint a special envoy for hunger.  This would seem to be a practical proposal and it would ensure the implementation of many of the fine objectives and principles set out in the report.</P>
        <P>However, as the Minister of State said, the implementation of this report requires political will.  He also said that whereas money and resources are very important, they are not everything.  The level of our commitment is not simply characterised by the amount of money or resources committed.  I am in agreement with him on this point but we should not depart too much from the fundamental reality of the need to transfer resources in a prudent way and in a manner which ensures that people receive the value of those resources and can invest in and improve their own situations and livelihoods.</P>
        <P>There is a fundamental imbalance of resources in the modern world.  If we agree with this argument, we must take action to redress that imbalance but this is when it becomes more difficult, as has been seen in the past fortnight when the international banking system has been under threat.  Even in this country we have been given a fair glimpse of where power and resources lie.  We will have an opportunity to discuss that issue at a later occasion.</P>
        <P>The relationship between governments and private enterprise and between Government and the banks is an imbalanced one.  International banks and financial institutions, including some of those operating in Ireland, are far more powerful, have far more resources at their disposal and have far more influence over these issues we are discussing, than sovereign governments, including the Irish Government.  This does not need to be the case because governments can step forward and assert their sovereignty and their central and important role in dealing with this question.  This means that governments will fall out with big private institutions such as banks.  They will need to disagree with them publicly and demand that they change their practices and help to change this imbalance.</P>
      
        <P>People who own wealth do not voluntarily give it up.  It will require concerted action by governments and international organisations, whether the United Nations or the European <Col N="264" />Union or governments working in co-operation in multilateral arrangements, to ensure that changes occur.  Earlier this year, a report was published by Christian Aid, entitled Death and Taxes: the True Toll of Tax Dodging.  In a most compelling and engaging way, the report points out that the money and resources do exist to address hunger in our modern world, if only those who owe taxes would pay up.  In Christian Aid&rsquo;s own words the report &ldquo;seeks to expose the scandal of a global taxation system that allows the world&rsquo;s richest to duck their responsibilities while condemning the poorest to stunted development, and even premature death&rdquo;.  Christian Aid&rsquo;s report refers to &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s transnational corporations wielding their enormous power to avoid [literally] the attentions of the tax man&rdquo;.  Moneys are moved around the world, in particular stripping resources from developing countries in ways that sovereign governments cannot even identify.</P>
        <P>We are talking about tax havens and the inordinate power of international capital to avoid proper scrutiny and taxation.  We need to address such matters domestically and internationally.  The debate on taxation should be politicised.  The following point may not be particularly well received by my colleagues, but I want to encourage people to think about it.  This country&rsquo;s rate of corporation tax is 12.5%.  We have all argued for that, we support it and agree it should continue.  Over the summer a number of very large corporations based in the United Kingdom moved their operations here.  At least two or three such companies moved staff to occupy a few floors in a building in Dublin so they now pay corporation tax in this jurisdiction rather than in the UK.  We should query what impact that move has on the resources available globally to address poverty and malnutrition.  If there is a higher rate of corporation tax in one country, that money is clearly not being levied at that level and is not available to, for example, the British Government to deploy on the issues we are debating.  We levy less corporation tax in this country so the overall amount of money available potentially is reduced.  When we talk about our own interests and keeping taxes low, it is never the end of the story.  Ultimately, all financial and economic decisions made in this country are political.  In addition, far more of them than we think impact on what we are doing, or not doing, to eradicate hunger and poverty.</P>
        <P>I welcome this report and commend the Minister on sponsoring it.</P>

	<P>It is difficult to imagine a mother and her children starving but we, more than most, can understand it as we had a famine.  I welcome the impressive report produced by the committee under the chairmanship of the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Mr. Joe Walsh.  He was an outstanding Minister and knows how agriculture can be of enormous support to those suffering from starvation.  We can agree to provide a percentage of gross national product to people in the Third World who are less well off than ourselves.  The most important contribution we can make, however, is to send people abroad to demonstrate how agricultural production can feed those who so badly need it.  That is the key to the problem.  We have done so before.  We sent our missionaries overseas and our brothers, sisters and priests have done an outstanding job in various parts of the world.  Our non-governmental organisations are doing significant work there now.  We must continue this.  We are the sixth highest contributor to the Third World, which is a great achievement.  Most importantly, however, we must continue to send our men and women to physically work in the Third World, including nurses, doctors, teachers and others.  If we teach a man to fish, he will be able to feed himself for life.  That is vital.</P><Col N="265" />
        <P>Money must be spent properly so that we get value for it.  We must insist that governments in developing countries in which our aid workers are involved should display a certain commitment to agriculture.  This seems to be a major problem as we can see in countries where starvation is occurring.</P>
        <P>The projects we undertake in future will underpin the proposals in the report we are considering.  Senator Norris said we do not take this seriously enough, which we do not.  We talk about it in this house but what do we do afterwards?  Is it finished then?  We must educate people and tell them what is happening.  Approximately 1 billion people suffer from starvation while we belly-ache about banks and other matters on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; radio programme every other day.  We should be thinking how to alleviate hunger in this world of ours.  We must think also of our own people in the forthcoming budget.  We must govern and deliver for our people, but when the world is starving, we must not forget to do our best to look after those who are suffering.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Butler.  It is easy to make a speech and then forget about it, but he has rightly reminded us not to do so.  I am conscious of our own history, which was brought back to us recently in the television programme &ldquo;Who Do You Think You Are?&rdquo;  In that programme, Mr. Eddie Hobbs spoke about the situation in Cork during the Famine.  At the time, the bridges in Cork were blocked off to stop people from the countryside entering the city to search for food.  At the same time, the holds of ships leaving Cork harbour were laden with food.  The situation is similar in many African countries today.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a rich agricultural country.  We export 90% of our beef products.  We are a major food exporter.  The situation in many African countries is similar and that is what makes it so upsetting, in a sense.  Many of these countries produce cash crops to repay loans which were taken out for infrastructural projects with endemic corruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Moneys were filtered offshore and the people were left to pay the bill.  Instead of producing food for themselves and their families, they must produce cash crops to repay the loans.  This is another devastating travesty for those people.</P>
        <P>The beauty of the Irish aid is that it comes so naturally.  From the outset, we understand it.  What has happened to us is written in our DNA.  It started with our missionaries who went to all corners of the world, including the white man&rsquo;s grave in west Africa where many died of malaria in the first few years, to bring the faith and to teach the people how to help and fend for themselves.</P>
        <P>Even when our own economy took off in the 1960s, Gorta started, to be followed quickly by many others.  One I especially like is B&oacute;thar, which was started by the agricultural community, in particular T. J. Maher, with the support and assistance of the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly.  This is a project that helps people using the holistic approach where they teach the family how to manage the animal it will receive, that the first-born off-spring is to be given to another family which in turn is trained in how to manage the animal and how to work to produce the best return.  In a way it lifts the family because there is a high-yielding Irish animal in an African context that is assisting that family, and other families subsequently.  That is a positive aspect.</P>
        <P>The fact that in recent times we again have seen hunger in places such as Haiti, Vietnam, Egypt and Indonesia shows the fragile nature of the world economy.  Due to the shift to bio-fuels, and 30% of the arable area in the US switching over to them, there was a large increase <Col N="266" />in the price of food commodities.  In addition, when the stock market started to fall, there was speculation in commodities, including the price of oil.  On the international stage, Ireland should object to brokers speculating on food commodities.  It is a matter on which we could take a strong stance.</P>
        <P>If there is one Minister who can make a difference to people&rsquo;s life, it is the Minister of State with responsibility for Irish Aid.  He has the responsibility for making a direct influence on people&rsquo;s livelihood.  It is ironic that poverty needs to be tackled, not just because it is poverty but because one pays either way.  If, for instance, one does not look after people here in Ireland with social services, one will find that they will need health and other services more and there is a deterioration.  It pays to look after people.  In particular, I would suggest, now that the Doha round has collapsed, that Ireland has a role within the EU of having bilateral arrangements and treaties with Third World countries to ensure they get fair trade with an emphasis on their having sufficient food to look after their own needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas lena gcomhairleoir&iacute; ar fhoilsi&uacute;ch&aacute;n na tuarasc&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin touched on a point which I was going to raise at the end of my speech but with which I will begin, namely, that we need to look at the issue of fair trade being properly resourced and funded and that the countries being neglected and being treated unfairly should be prioritised.  I concur with Senator Hanafin in that regard.</P>
        <P>The UN Secretary-General, in the report, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Nothing is more degrading than hunger, especially when man-made.  It breeds anger, social disintegration, ill health and economic decline.</P>
        <P FLI="0">How true it is that in the 21st century, when we all live in a relatively affluent Irish society, we focus upon poverty in the world.  It behoves the question to which the Minister of State referred in his speech when he spoke about giving a voice to the hungry.  Who really will do that?  Senator Norris referred to it in his remarks, as did other Senators.  Are we really serious about it?  Are we serious about eliminating world hunger and giving life to people who deserve better?  In many ways the few are dictating to the many.</P>
        <P>I support the publication of the report and I welcome the broad thrust of it.  Deputy Peter Power is in an unenviable position, being the Minister of State responsible for overseas aid at a time when we in this country are facing massive budgetary cutbacks.  I accept his bona fides and believe he will fight his corner.  If Ireland is to be a serious player in giving a voice to the hungry, then we need to stand by our commitments and be a leader within Europe in that regard.  This exemplary report will be lost if we do not meet our commitments.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment by those of us on the political stage to alleviate world hunger, but is it evident among the big players?  Are they really serious about it?  We saw last week how the US House of Representatives was reluctant to vote for a bail-out bill for the banks at the first stage.  Have they got the political will really to lead the challenge?</P>
        <P>We can be that voice, given our experience of the Famine where the geopolitical legacy of the British Government still leaves a poor taste with many of us.  The Famine was very much a consequence of bad political management.  We also recall the Live Aid concerts of the 1980s pertaining to Africa.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the elimination of global hunger is to be a political aspiration, it requires leadership and in many ways the call, &ldquo;Show us the money&rdquo;, still pertains.  I agree with Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s remarks on the mechanism involving use of a United Nations hunger office, which forms part <Col N="267" />of the report.  It is time for organisations such as the UN to stand up and take on the political leaders of countries which are not interested or which pay lip-service, a consequence of which is that millions of people are dying because of a failure of governance.  Can we all live with such consequences?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, spoke of it as a deep-seated challenge.  While he is correct, I would ask whether the world community really prioritises the elimination of world hunger the way it should.</P>
        <P>I recall attending a summer school in New York a number of years ago which was addressed by a young woman from Ghana.  She was a young farmer.  The Minister of State in his speech correctly referred to the fact that when we in Ireland think of a farmer, we think of a man.  He is correct that this is usually not the case in Africa.  At that conference for religious education teachers, the woman spoke about the fact that every morning she had to make a fundamental choice regarding her sons and her only daughter.  Because of the hierarchy of the country, the sons won out and she had to make a choice against her daughter.  We need to change mindsets.  That woman left a lasting impression on me, and the Minister of State referred to this in his speech as well.</P>
        <P>We are dealing here with people, not small stakeholders or producers.  We need to have the political will to effect change.  The report is excellent, especially if it is acted on and there is genuine commitment by the Government regarding Irish aid.</P>
        <P>We live in an unequal world.  That is the reality.  As Senator White stated, we are required to redress the imbalance.  None of us should countenance the fact that we condone or accept hunger as part of our world today, in any continent.  A fundamental task of politicians is to change the way in which the wealth of the world is distributed.  Senator Hanafin mentioned the fact that people with cash crops must work to repay loans.  This can start in our own households where we can buy Fairtrade products.  We must also educate the young people in our schools.</P>
        <P>There are 862 million people exposed to malnutrition, hunger and death.  We need to take a lead.  The Minister of State used the words &ldquo;war&rdquo; and &ldquo;hunger&rdquo;, phraseology with which, unlike Senator White, I agree.   I do not agree with war, but we need to take this issue by the lock and determine what we will do.  We have a war on our hands.</P>
        <P>There are many countries who are not living up to their expectations and commitments.  There was an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on the issue of HIV and AIDS in countries across Africa.  There is a complete failure of education and governance.</P>
        <P>We are not dealing here with small-holders as units of production tackling under-nutrition but with human beings.  It may not be the cool thing to talk about given these recessionary times and we may not have had Bob Geldof to push Live Aid and other such events, but at the time of the famine in Ethiopia, the BBC had footage broadcast every night into our homes which left an impression on people&rsquo;s minds.  On one level, we must scare people regarding world hunger.  If we do not, we will not develop the mindset to deal with a time that may approach when we are not producing enough food for everybody.  The issue of food security must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has stated that hunger is degrading.  It leads to social disintegration and, as we know, it leads to death.  As political leaders, we have a responsibility to become proactive rather than passive.</P>

	<P>Is mian liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na tuarasc&aacute;la seo.

N&iacute; c&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn stop a chur leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Ba ch&oacute;ir lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh leis, mar n&iacute; thagann stop riamh leis an ocras ar fud na cruinne.</P>
        <P>Hunger, like war, has commercial aspects.  Commercial bodies often benefit from war and hunger, and in many ways are responsible for their existence.  It is ironic that on a day when we are discussing this document a survey was published that showed one-third of all food purchased ends up in the dustbin each day.  When I throw away waste food, I have a pang of conscience.  I speak for every person in that regard.  One difficulty is that we do not know how to change and respond to it but we should try to salvage some of the food or save money we would otherwise have spent and provide for those in the world who are actually hungry.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing aid.  The money it provides is exceptionally well spent.  When the former Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, discussed this he referred to the controls in place to ensure that the money is properly spent.  Much of the hunger is found in countries with some type of conflict, and often one cannot be sure that the money which is supplied will go to those for whom it is intended.  There are cases where the money has gone back into the hands of despots and used for their own purposes.  The Government has been cautious in this regard.</P>
        <P>We  must pay tribute to non-governmental organisations.  They are at the coalface, and see the fire brigade action required on a daily basis.  We all get letters in the post seeking subscriptions and contributions on a daily basis for a crisis which has arisen.  The Irish people have been very generous in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is frightening to consider the billions, if not trillions, spent on war by comparison with the amount spent on alleviating hunger in the world.  It is amazing how money can be found by big powers at short notice.  One example is the invasion of Iraq.  There was no difficulty in finding the money at that time, and when Europe did not respond as quickly as America, which started the invasion, it had to endure insults because it wanted to hold back.  It would be far better if diplomacy had been used in some of the places in the world with conflict, and the money saved donated to those who are hungry and dying of hunger.</P>
        <P>Millions of people are dying of hunger; there could be thousands of people dying every second.  We must have short-term alleviation.  That is vital.  Whatever difficulties we have with our economic downturn, I hope the aid we provide will not be diminished.</P>
        <P>When the time comes history will judge mankind for all kinds of reasons.  We will be judged because we stayed silent on an issue when we should have put our heads above the parapet.  We will be judged on political expediency, because we felt we did not have the courage to stand up and say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; on a given issue.  Nowhere will the judgment of history be more severe than that we allowed a billion people to be hungry on a daily basis when there was so much wealth and food wasted in the world.</P>
        <P>Ireland can act not only as a contributor but also as an honest broker.  It was particularly interesting in recent days that the Irish Government could take such decisive pre-emptive action to deal with the financial situation.  Everybody knows now how correct that was.  Would it not be wonderful if, in addition to the contribution we are currently making to world aid, we were always prepared to stand in every forum in which this country is represented, in Europe and elsewhere, and make it the catch cry that hunger cannot be tolerated and that people must take a stand on the issue?  Hopefully, the big powers at some stage will realise that the money spent on, for example, armaments and on propping up useless, superfluous political structures could be redirected once and for all.</P><Col N="269" />
        <P>It might be simplistic but I believe that if we had responded earlier to some of the difficulties that existed in the conflict flashpoints of the world, there would not have been the subsequent wars.  What we now need is a reconditioning of our political approach to the difficulties when they arise.  Big commercial bodies are capable of going into and exploiting the poorest countries on earth.  There have been many such cases.  If one can believe what one reads in the media, one oil company, which I will not name, has raped the economy of some of the most under-developed countries in the world.  It has taken the wealth out of those countries to the point that the natives, when they confronted the company, were not just imprisoned but in some cases were executed for taking a stand.  There must be more than lip service and a flow of verbal compassion.  There must be a confrontation of the issue in all its forms.</P>
        <P>A certain percentage of the money provided for aid must be used immediately to ensure the alleviation of hunger.  I accept that other percentages must be allocated to enable people to develop crops, buy vehicles and do whatever else is necessary.  However, a certain percentage must be allocated to alleviate hunger itself.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report and I hope we will discuss it again.  Some issues cannot be dealt with in a single day&rsquo;s discussion or in a single report.  It should be an ongoing discussion.  We must find ways to measure our input.  We should engage with non-governmental organisations.  In addition, we should be prepared to have the courage, even if we rattle cages, to talk on the bigger issues of conflict, exploitation of humanity and those issues commercially driving the terrible primitive conditions in which people find themselves.</P>
        <P>I compliment Mr. Joe Walsh and the rest of the committee.  On reading their names I was pleased to consider that people of such calibre and expertise are prepared to give their time.  It was an intensive task and we owe them a debt of gratitude.  Again, I compliment and congratulate the Government for setting up the task force and for ensuring that the contribution that has been made will continue and increase in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I dtosach, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach chun an &aacute;bhair an-thabhtach seo a phl&eacute; inniu.  I have listened to the speakers on this topic and it is striking that, given our current economic difficulties, the opinion is that this issue should supersede the financial difficulties being encountered.  The Minister of State said that we live in a world of plenty.  While there might be less when the current turmoil is over, the world will still comparatively be a world of plenty.  Perhaps there will be a refocus on where our priorities should lie socially and politically as a consequence of the upheavals in the market place at present.  A new and more caring order might emerge from what will be a chastening experience for everybody.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that Ireland take note of the hunger that afflicts the 862 million people the Minister of State mentioned.  That is an astounding figure; it is one in seven or one in eight of the world&rsquo;s population.  It is an extraordinary proportion, particularly when one considers the affluence of the western world.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the amount of food that is wasted.  Go to a restaurant and look at the prices being paid and the amount of food left on plates at the end of an expensive meal.  In many ways it must challenge us to consider redistribution.  Many people speak about redistribution of wealth but redistribution of food must surely rank as a priority.</P>
        <P>The Famine in this country was not due to a shortage of food but to the fact that the staple diet of the people failed and they did not have the resources to source alternative food.  As a consequence, 1 million people died, approximately 2 million emigrated and our population was almost halved over that period.  That has made us acutely aware of what an affliction famine and hunger are for a nation and society.  An interesting story is told &mdash; I am sure there is an element of truth in it, as there is with many stories in these Houses &mdash; that when the statue of Queen Victoria was being removed from the grounds to be put in a breaker&rsquo;s yard before <Col N="270" />eventually being sent to Australia, the late former Deputy Ber Cowen, waved &pound;5 at the statue, saying: &ldquo;Take this.  You gave it to us at the time of the Famine.&rdquo;  That was a clear indication of how paltry was the response of people with resources and power to that challenge.</P>
        <P>That is reflected again today in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, as is clear from this report.  There are many alarming statistics in the report.  I join my colleagues in complimenting the initiative in the White Paper to establish a hunger task force to focus on how best to tackle the issue.  The report states that in 2005, 32% of children under five years of age were stunted, with particularly high rates in eastern Africa of up to 50% and in central Africa of up to 42%.  However, India has the highest number of stunted children, at 61 million.  A total of 10% of children globally, 55 million, are wasted.  That is an enormous proportion of the young population.  The highest rate is in central Asia, with 29 million.  Of these, 19 million children are severely wasted.  They often require emergency interventions, including therapeutic feeding.</P>
        <P>Those statistics, when one considers the western world and the comforts of its people, constitute an appalling reflection on policies over a long period of time and demonstrates the need to change them.  The Minister of State has been to China.  One of the great success stories of China is the fact it was able to feed up to 1.3 billion people spread across a large country where there is a great degree of poverty, particularly during the communist era.  It was a real achievement that it did not have a very severe famine.   Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from the Chinese initiative of targeting the smallholder with a view to increasing agricultural productivity.  This is underpinned in the report and constitutes a key component thereof.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest Senator Butler&rsquo;s statement, which is quite true, that if one gives a man a fish, one feeds him for a day, but if one teaches him to fish, he will be fed for life.  Sustainability is a factor but, as other Senators stated, there are immediate issues to be addressed in addition to more medium-term and long-term issues.</P>
        <P>It is only right that Ireland be in the vanguard of those countries that are placing tremendous priority on the issue of hunger.  This is because of our history and because many good agencies and NGOs have been established in Ireland whose <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> is to prioritise the fight against hunger.  I refer to Tr&oacute;caire, B&oacute;thar, Gorta, Concern, GOAL and many others.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler rightly identified and applauded the efforts of our missionaries over many decades.  His experience is replicated throughout the country.  Very elderly priests who are working in Kenya and other countries but who are natives of Wexford come home to the county in the summer.  They have devoted their lives to giving selfless service to those in need.  They should be an example to all of us and should demonstrate how we can make a contribution, even though we would not be taxed in the same way and although we would not in any way be making the same effort.</P>
        <P>John F. Kennedy once said one man can make a difference and that every man should try.  Two of our musicians, Bono and Bob Geldof, have been very much to the fore in recent decades in this regard and have made a very significant contribution, not only through their own initiatives but also in awakening the consciousness of Western Governments and influencing policies to try to ensure a coherent approach to tackling hunger.</P>
        <P>The second priority, which is clearly identified in the report, is to promote effective action to counter maternal and infant undernutrition.  This must be tackled because if the mother suffers from malnutrition, her children will be seriously stunted as a consequence.</P>
        <P>The report makes reference to changes in governance and leadership priorities.  This identifies the need to build real political commitment to reducing hunger.  Europe, in many ways, may have greater social awareness than some of the other large economic blocs.  This is not to <Col N="271" />say there is not an element of social awareness in those blocs &mdash; there obviously is &mdash; but that Europe has a tradition in this regard.  Ireland, using its influence in the European Union, should lead the way.  It would be pushing an open door to some extent.  In going this route, there is an element of self-interest because, if we can get the African and Asian economies to run properly, it would be good for the global economy.  This process is separate from our prioritising the task of assisting those who are disadvantaged and poor and who do not even have the resources to feed themselves.  The latter problem comprises one of the main human rights<?oasys _jy ?>areas.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, has responsibility in this area and is interested in it.  He will note that other bodies, such as local authorities, can have a role.  A Fianna F&aacute;il councillor in Louth, Peter Savage, drew my attention to an initiative of Louth County Council with regard to Malawi.  It has been in operation for some years and the council has made a financial commitment to the project.  I discovered Wexford County Council was engaged in such a project, possibly in Ghana.  Only last year, it was extended to Pakistan because a missionary who came home drew attention to educational issues in that country.  The local authority is giving some support.  Using the local government system is useful because it creates awareness.  Staff in Wexford County Council make a voluntary contribution in this regard.</P>
        <P>In many ways, the report under discussion can be a very influential catalyst in accelerating efforts already being made.  I hope a chord will be struck with the international community.  While the resources are in place, it is only through concerted effort that we can hope to make progress on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for my brief absence, in which I missed the contributions of Senators Cummins and Ormonde.  They may rest assured that I will examine their contributions in detail in due course.  All the contributions to which I had the pleasure of listening were very insightful and, in some cases, thought-provoking, particularly in the case of Senator Alex White.</P>
        <P>This debate is very timely and useful in informing the Government&rsquo;s response to this important report.  In a world that is relatively affluent and which appears to be consumed, 24 hours per day, by financial crises involving billions and trillions of dollars, euro and yen, we should note that, at the end of this debate, 862 million will be hungry.</P>
        <P>If this debate achieved anything, it was the focus on this extremely powerful statistic, of which we must not lose sight.  Senator Walsh mentioned that the statistic includes one in every seven people on the planet.  Those affected are sometimes consigned to a life of physical retardation and, worse, severely retarded mental development, which consigns them to a life of pure misery.  These are the facts and we must ask how we should deal with them.</P>
        <P>I reflect the views of the House in expressing my appreciation for the work of all those experts who spent valuable time producing this report, not least our former colleague Joe Walsh.  Senator Butler was correct that Mr. Walsh brought political experience to bear on the report in addition to his agricultural experience.  From my contact with many on the hunger task force, I note he was very skilful in producing the very focused report.  The issue is so multifaceted that the report could have been lost in a myriad of details and statistics.  Mr. Walsh focused the minds of the team of experts and they produced a very concise and readable document.  He stated at the launch that a report that did not make uncomfortable reading was not worth writing at all.  It certainly does make uncomfortable reading for all the Governments to which it applies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White made a very insightful contribution.  He made a point on terminology and referred to the &ldquo;war on hunger&rdquo;.  I do not know if the Senator was present when Senator <Col N="272" />Butler stated he agreed with this term because one could substitute the term &ldquo;war&rdquo; for &ldquo;fight&rdquo;.  It is a fight and struggle in which we must engage. The Senator&rsquo;s point that the currency is debased was well made.  The irony is that much of the hunger is as a result of war and conflict throughout the world, a point that should not be lost on us.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made the interesting point that the resources of the world are fundamental and that their transfer and the redressing of global imbalances between the northern and the southern hemispheres is key to this issue, which I accept, notwithstanding that we are making a real contribution in a non-monetary way through this report by promoting debate and giving leadership on the international stage.  The irony is that Africa, to focus just on that continent, is blessed with enormous resources.  However, it does not always have the capacity in which to realise those resources, or in some cases those resources are raped by the northern hemisphere.  These are issues of which we ought not lose sight.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White also made the point that in some cases financial institutions wield more power than sovereign governments.  While that might not be the case after events on world stock markets in the past week, his point is well made.  It reminded me of a point made by Professor Jeffrey Sachs at the launch of the report when he noted that the total of all the bonuses paid on Wall Street in 2007 was more than all of the aid for Africa in 2007 from all sources.  If that statistic does not hit home hard, I do not know what does.  Perhaps in light of their losses this week, some people might reflect on that interesting statistic.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer made a very interesting contribution which questioned whether we are serious about giving aid, which was a theme of many speakers.  The Senator asked whether we intend to deliver and whether we are showing real leadership.  I believe we are showing leadership by virtue of commissioning this report and by examining it to ascertain how it can inform our programme, which I assure the House it will.  Also, by tabling it on the world stage in front of the Secretary General of the United Nations in a week of major turmoil when major issues were being discussed in New York, we were very much at the heart of events.  The Taoiseach went to New York and launched this report to great acclaim in front of the UN Secretary General and major players on the international stage.  If that is not leadership, I do not know what is.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made by Senators Hanafin and Walsh that we should use our influence in Europe.  At a meeting of development Ministers in Europe last week, I was in a position to literally hand the report to every development Minister present and to ask them to read it and apply it in their own country development programmes.  This formed the basis of much of our discussions in Bordeaux last week.  Therefore, I believe we have shown leadership and that we are very much at the forefront of the international effort in terms of aid.</P>
        <P>The point was made by several speakers, including Senator Walsh, that if it does anything, the report serves to refocus our minds.  This country has a long and tragic history of food shortages.  We need to refocus our programme in terms of tackling this issue.  I assure the House that, as Minister of State, this is not lost on me and was not lost on me even before the publication of this report.  We may need to re-prioritise among the different calls on our funding, be it for education, health or small or large projects.  At the end of the day, none of these means much if people in sub-Saharan Africa in particular do not have enough food.  The report focuses on hunger and the need to give people, especially women and children, adequate food and nutrition.  If it achieves this and if it informs the way the Irish aid and development programme will operate in years to come, it has served a very useful purpose.</P><Col N="273" />
        <P>I conclude by noting that we owe a huge debt of gratitude to those who produced the report.  We certainly will examine its conclusions very seriously.  It has refocused our minds on the hunger which, unfortunately, is still all too prevalent on planet Earth today.</P>

	<P>I urge that the Seanad approve the motions to expand the membership of the Select Committee on European Affairs and to establish a sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s future in the European Union.</P>
        <P>The sub-committee is being tasked by the Houses of the Oireachtas to analyse the challenges facing Ireland in the European Union following the Lisbon treaty referendum result and to make recommendations to enhance the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in European Union affairs.  It will also examine ways in which we can improve public understanding of the European Union and its fundamental importance for Ireland&rsquo;s future.  The sub-committee represents a vital element of our work to find a way forward after the Lisbon treaty referendum.  It represents a new departure for the Oireachtas.  We are creating a new inclusive process to analyse the challenges now facing Ireland in the Union and to report by the end of November.  This crucial debate will be open and transparent.  The debate will be also widely available to the public thanks to the media facilities in these Houses.  I am grateful to Members for agreeing to work in an innovative way on the single, biggest foreign policy challenge we have had in the 35 years of membership of the European Union.  By agreeing to step up to this task I hope we will leave behind the division of the campaign itself.  There is nothing to be gained from re-fighting a referendum campaign that is over.</P>
        <P>I hope we are deciding to look ahead and not to idle in the past.  I hope too that people will recognise that respecting the sovereign will of the people means we have to understand fully the implications of that decision for Ireland&rsquo;s influence and standing internationally.  We have shown that we are best when we work together and innovate to find solutions for the country.  The committee can start its deliberations from a positive place.  The results of the recent research into Irish people&rsquo;s attitudes to the EU show that we want Ireland to continue to be fully involved in the Union.  A total of 70% of us agree that membership is a good thing, while only 8% disagree.  I believe this is a strong and positive reflection of the intent of the Irish people.</P>
        <P>The importance of the work of the sub-committee should not be underestimated.  We cannot assume that our standing in the Union remains unchanged by the referendum result, because that is not the case.  Nor should we believe the result has gone unnoticed in the wider world, especially in the international investment community because, again, that is not the case.  We cannot delude ourselves that somehow or other the position we are in is a good one or is cost free.  The task ahead is a serious one with far-reaching consequences.  It demands that we undertake reasoned and considered deliberations.  Ultimately, we must come together to chart a map that is best for us as a nation.</P><Col N="274" />
        <P>We also must be acutely aware of the widespread benefits European Union membership has brought to Ireland.  At its most fundamental, I believe that in the 35 years since we joined the Union, our sovereignty has developed and strengthened.  I asked members of an Oireachtas committee earlier today to consider the situation when the eurozone did not exist, when we had the benefit of our monetary sovereignty being tied to London.  We had to wait for a telephone call from the Treasury to find out where we were going.  Our economic independence has been greatly enhanced by European Union membership, with wider export markets and greater inward investment opportunities.  Membership has been hugely beneficial to our agricultural sector and to rural Ireland.  Across the board, therefore, in the economic, social and political fields, European Union membership has been fundamentally good for all our citizens.  In short, the vibrant Irish society we have today would be unthinkable without our central involvement in the European Union.</P>
        <P>We want to address the concerns expressed by the Irish people at the ballot box on 12 June.  We will work here in Ireland and with our European Union partners to arrive at a fair, balanced and meaningful solution.  There are many themes and issues to be addressed that were raised during the debate leading to the referendum and which have been debated since, for example, economic issues, social and moral issues, political issues, neutrality and the European Commission.  The work of the sub-committee can make a real contribution in pointing the way forward for Ireland in Europe.  We want to be at the heart of the European Union in order that our membership can continue to anchor our prosperity and advance our interests in a complex and rapidly changing world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since we voted on 12 June, 12 countries have ratified the Lisbon treaty.  It is likely that by the end of this year at least 25, if not all 26, other member states will have done so.  We will find ourselves at that stage in an uncomfortable position.  We must chart the way ahead in unison.  This job lies not only with those who advocated a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, but also those who advocated a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  I believe we all had one objective in the referendum campaign, namely, what we believe to be best for the country.  It is, therefore, important we work together.  The sub-committee provides the opportunity to do this in a constructive, thoughtful way which mutually respects points of view and which will produce the best solution for the people.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House.  The failure to ratify the Lisbon treaty poses significant economic, social and political challenges for the country.  We must pause and understand the implications for the national interest.  The terms of reference for the sub-committee are designed to enable us to look to our future within Europe, evaluate our attitudes to the project of the European Union and reassert the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this process.  The House can and should play a greater role in European affairs.  The establishment of this committee is timely, but the mechanism may not be correct.  I listened with interest to the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole during the Order of Business and I wonder why the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not ask the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to set up a sub-committee, rather than go through this process.  However, the establishment of the sub-committee is necessary.  A very demanding deadline is in place for the sub-committee to report.  It is vital that this work is done well, but I question why the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs was not asked to form a sub-committee to deal with this matter.  It probably could have dealt with the matter more expeditiously than today&rsquo;s proceedings.  We support the establishment of the sub-committee, but we have reservations about the manner in which it has been established.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.  The purpose of his visit is to establish the sub-committee which will analyse the issues arising from the failure to <Col N="275" />ratify the Lisbon treaty.  We have reflected on this matter in recent months and I am weary from the many discussions with many people on the reasons for this failure.  I am pleased the research body was established to examine the issues and to highlight the main reasons of concern to the public.  It was interesting to learn that those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; still wanted to be a part of the European Union, which is important and we must not forget this.  We are a part of Europe in terms of trade so there is a problem about how best to proceed.  We do not wish to rehash the Lisbon treaty in its old format.  That is gone out the door and we are not thinking about it.  However, we must examine the consequences of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and where we go from here.  By the end of this year there will, perhaps, be 26 countries which have ratified the treaty and we may be the only country left out.  This may put us in a very difficult situation and we could very easily be marginalised and vulnerable given that most of our trade is with other member states.  This puts us in a dilemma on how to best proceed and on which areas we must concentrate.</P>
        <P>The study seems to indicate that a lack of understanding about the contents of the treaty was relevant.  It is important the sub-committee is set up to analyse and examine how we can reach out to the public.  If people wish to be a part of the European Union we must inform them about what that involves.  We must inform people of the role of the national parliament and how it is associated with the European Union.  We must get this message across to the public.  There were other relevant issues such as conscription, our national identity and other matters.  However, a lack of understanding about the treaty was the main issue, which is interesting.  If those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; understand what it means to be a part of the European Union it is possible they will become &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; people if we proceed with another referendum.  I do not know the answers but it is important for reasons of economics, finance, social policy and foreign affairs.</P>
        <P>The role of the national parliament must be enhanced in future.  It was always our belief that the citizen did not understand what was happening in Europe.  This was a major issue throughout the campaign.  Such people felt their identity was lost, that decision making power was not here but in Europe.  We must convince citizens that we have a sizable role, that the national parliament makes all decisions and that directives from Europe cannot be implemented unless they are endorsed by national parliaments.  This is an important message to spread.  It is important to provide an understanding of the European Union and Ireland&rsquo;s part in it.  Do we, or do we not, want to be a part of Europe?  This is the fundamental issue and I believe we want to be a part of it.  The establishment of the sub-committee should analyse the challenge of how to reach out to the public and highlight our part in the future of Europe.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House.  The Minister of State knows my position on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Senator continues, it was agreed to take the two motions together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That suits my comments.  I see the need for a committee such as the proposed sub-committee.  I look forward to proposing my colleague Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen to represent the independent group on the sub-committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As long as we ask the people to give a single answer to seven different questions, we will never get the answer we seek.  We must contrive, find, invent or develop a way to have six different questions on six different issues as part of the same constitutional referendum.  This is the only way to find out where people stand on these matters.  We are creating a concert of opposition with the current approach.  Some seven different people will have seven different reasons to oppose the treaty and will vote together accordingly.  I do not have a difficulty with <Col N="276" />the motion to extend the Orders of Reference of the Select Committee on European Affairs by extending the membership or to do the work outlined to which I look forward.  However, the following step is wrong.  The D&aacute;il has made a mistake and acted <i>ultra vires</i>.  The people who opposed the referendum looked for every sliver of information and every angle to come back at us.  I believe we are now handing them ammunition to use against us and I will tell the Minister of State the reason.  First, the only people who can appoint a sub-committee are the members of a committee and, second, the members of a sub-committee must, in all cases, by any set of conventions I have ever seen, be members of the main committee.  Otherwise, a special committee must be set up, which is different.  Perhaps that is what the Minister should be doing in this regard.  We are not setting up a special committee; we are a parent committee setting up a sub-committee.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Standing Orders of this House, and as far as I know they are the same in the other House, under Standing Order 69 we can establish a select committee.  This House did that in October 2007 when we established the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  The motion stated that the Joint Committee shall have the powers defined in Standing Order 70(1) to (9) inclusive.  Standing Order 70(3) gives the committee &ldquo;power to appoint sub-Committees and to refer to such sub-Committees any matter comprehended by its orders of reference ...&rdquo;.  It is clearly within the remit of the Joint Committee on European Affairs to set up a sub-committee of the nature the Minister is talking about to do the job he has asked it to do.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
        <P>I am 21 years a Member of this House and the Minister has been a Member for nearly as long, if not as long &mdash; I cannot recall but we have shared time here together &mdash; and in all that time I have never heard of nor seen either House appoint a sub-committee of another committee.  We always appoint a select committee.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has tried to get around that today in various ways and it has failed to do it.  Establishing two select sub-committees to come together in a joint sub-committee has never been done before and it contravenes the Standing Orders of the House.  Under Standing Order 69 the Seanad may devolve to a committee any power it so wishes.</P>
        <P>We have set up a committee with the power to establish sub-committees and to do all the Minister has asked it to do.  This House can establish a select committee to do what he asks us to do.  We do not have that power, nor does the D&aacute;il, but nobody in the D&aacute;il reads the rules, as I well know.  They always do what they are told.  They never read the rules.  The Minister&rsquo;s adviser from the Department of Foreign Affairs is smiling because he knows I am right about that.  The Members in that House do what they are told.  They are like children.  This concerns a select committee, however, and we cannot do it.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs knew what it was doing because sub-section (2) of the motion on the Order Paper states that the sub-committee, the one we are trying to establish, &ldquo;shall have the powers defined in Standing Order 70(1), (2) and (4) to (9) inclusive&rdquo; but there is no reference to Standing Order (3).  Did we ever see that before?  The sub-committee we are establishing today, unlike any committee we have ever established in our time, does not have the power to establish a sub-committee.  It is the only power it is not given, which means that somebody knew what was going on and they took the power to do that.</P>
        <P>The Minister may believe he can get this issue through on a vote of the House but it is not that simple.  I have no difficulty with the first motion but in the second motion the Minister is asking us to do something we do not have the power to do.  He may still vote it through the House but that does not make it right.  A minority with courage is the majority on his own.  That is the way I look at these matters.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is a moral question.  </P>
        <P>I want to bring something to the attention of the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The way we select these people is through the Committee of Selection in both Houses.  Standing Order 88 states, &ldquo;There shall be appointed at the commencement of every Seanad a committee to be known as the Committee of Selection, which, unless it shall have been otherwise ordered [in other words, unless we change the orders of reference of that committee, which we have not done] shall nominate the Senators to serve on Select or Special Committees ...&rdquo;.  It does not have the authority to appoint people to sub-committees or to any other committees.  I am a member of that committee and if this issue is forced through the House, I will have no option but to ask that we consult with the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>This is the type of issue on which we would make fools of ourselves but there are ways around it.  We can either establish a special committee, which is the easiest option, or, if the Minister wants an additional five people on the Joint Committee on European Affairs, he should appoint five people to that committee and they will do the business for him but we must do it right.  We should not leave ourselves open to the charge of acting <i>ultra vires</i>.  The Oireachtas cannot afford to do that and in this regard we cannot afford to do it.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to listen to my view.  We do not have a problem with the first motion.  The second motion is <i>ultra vires</i> and should be ruled out of order.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to consider whether it is in order in the light of what I have just said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear what Senator O&rsquo;Toole is saying and from the point of view of veracity it should be checked out.  I am not sure whether precedents exist in terms of the committees we have established in this Oireachtas.  We set up a committee on children&rsquo;s rights, which is part of the workload of the existing committee on the Constitution, and put aside a separate membership of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a separate issue.</P>

	<P>That is a distraction.</P>

	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We also have an Oireachtas committee that deals with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in favour of that.  We should do the same again.</P>

	<P>Senator Boyle, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My thinking is the same as the Senator&rsquo;s on that.  We also have an Oireachtas committee on climate change and energy security, which deals with functions that exist in two other Oireachtas committees.  If it is a question of phraseology about a sub-committee as opposed to a special committee, perhaps motions could be phrased along that line but however we name this group, and it is named a sub-committee as of now, it is a time specific and issue specific grouping which falls into the remit of a special committee.  I believe that is the intent of the motion before the House and we should address it along those lines.  I accept that no one in this Chamber is arguing against the need for such a grouping and we should progress along those lines.</P>
        <P>The workload of this committee must be specific and should not be distracted by the type of ancillary debate that has plagued European issues since we first had referenda in this country.  I <Col N="278" />accept Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point that the direct &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; referendum is probably what has led us here but the ancillary debate has been about shooting the messenger, daring the right of people to think differently and introducing extraneous matters regarding the roles of previous court decisions and the ability to make effective arguments.  The only deterrent to making effective arguments on European referenda has been our role within the political class.  As politicians we have failed to present effective arguments that people could believe.</P>
        <P>I hope this committee, however it is structured or however it adheres to the Standing Orders of this House and the other House, will address its workload on those grounds.  If we are to persuade people that the future of Ireland lies in an enhanced European Union, it can only be done by seeking to persuade people and not seeking to use other means to deflect from arguments we have been unable to make effectively to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Along with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I have no difficulty with the proposal in the first motion but on the second motion Senator O&rsquo;Toole has to be right in what he said.  It cannot be the case that the Houses of the Oireachtas can go over the head, so to speak, of an Oireachtas committee and purport to set up a sub-committee of that existing committee.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point is an unanswerable one.  It has to be right.  In those circumstances it is clear we need the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.  I will not repeat the points the Senator made other than to endorse them.</P>
        <P>I agree largely with what Senator Boyle said but I respectfully disagree with the example he gave of the committee on the constitutional amendment on children.  As it is a free-standing Oireachtas committee, it does not derive its powers or origins from any other committee.  It was entirely set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A full independent committee does not come from anywhere else, whereas a sub-committee derives its existence from its head committee.  That is why I suggest we should not proceed with this proposal, which is wrong, in its current form.  I agree with what Senator Boyle said about the intent of what we are doing.  In some ways, it is a pity this problem has arisen to distract us.  We have to deal with the distraction, however.  If the motion were to note &ldquo;an intention&rdquo; on the part of the committee to establish a sub-committee, it might be possible for us to proceed if we were to endorse that intention.  I am just canvassing that to my colleagues as a way out of this problem.  If the House wants to go further, it could recommend to the Joint Committee on European Affairs that it should establish a sub-committee along the lines set out in the motion.  That would be in line with the intention of the proposal.  It seems to me that it would not offend against Standing Orders or against the procedures we have in this House.  We should not reduce these things to procedural niceties.  I accept that nobody has done that.  Procedures are as important as other matters which appear to have greater substance.  They are there for a reason.</P>
        <P>I agree with other Senators that the issues which arose in the context of the Lisbon treaty debate should be explored in a timely and efficient manner.  It is absolutely vital that the deliberations of this committee are not seen to be internal to these Houses and to those described by Senator Boyle as the &ldquo;political class&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure they are not.  I know this appeal will be taken up.  If the committee is seen to simply shift things around a little, dust them down a bit and have a number of meetings during which the issues are thrashed out and rehearsed internally in this political environment, it will not have the credibility it needs to have and it will not do the job it needs to do.  There is a manifest need for such a debate to be conducted.  I appeal to the Minister and to my colleagues who will be on this committee to ensure that happens.  I understand a distinguished Member of this House is being mooted as the Chairman of the committee.  It is important for all the members of the committee to agree that the debate should be held in as public a manner as possible.</P><Col N="279" />
        <P>Senator Ormonde and others spoke about the reasons for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Many reasons have been canvassed.  Research has been done.  It is difficult to see what the committee can do about the question of people not understanding the treaty.  What would be the nature of the debate it would have on the fact that people did not understand it?  I accept that we need to reflect on what Senator Boyle has rightly said was the failure of all the political parties in this regard.  There must be a real sense of self-criticism in this respect.  At the risk of falling out with Senator Boyle and his colleagues on the other side of the House, the principal responsibility in this regard lies with the Government.  Other groups have responsibilities too.  The Government failed to communicate the actual contents of the treaty to the people of Ireland.  In such circumstances, there was a signal failure.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the role and functions of the Referendum Commission.  It would be useful for the committee to explore the expectations we placed on the commission.  Senator Boyle and I are members of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which has touched on this matter.  What is the role of the commission?  What do we expect from it?  Perhaps our expectations were too high.  Perhaps a different type of commission is needed.  It has been commented on that it was odd that just one interest group distributed the actual treaty itself &mdash; the book comprising the treaty &mdash; throughout the country during the campaign.  It was not distributed by the Government or by any of the parties supporting the treaty.  The group that distributed the document, which it was entitled to do, was one of those advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Why should we continue to believe that people cannot absorb detailed information?  They can absorb much more than we give them credit for.  Some people &mdash; I do not refer to the Minister &mdash; believed in the notion that all we needed to do was to get this thing over the line.  We cannot just hope that people will come with us as we try to get it over the line.  It must be explained.  The proposed sub-committee would assist with that process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with care to the point that was made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Senator Quinn made the same point at this afternoon&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  The last thing I want is to be involved in any controversy regarding the establishment of this sub-committee.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is quite right &mdash; if the Houses were operating <i>ultra vires</i> their own rules, it would be a serious reflection on the House.  I understand the approach being adopted in this motion was discussed with the House.  The information available to me suggests that the secretariat that was examining this proposition regarded both approaches as equally valid.  I refer to the approach advocated by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, which is that the committee would have to take it upon itself to establish a sub-committee and members of the committee would then be assigned to it, and the approach which is being adopted.  That is my advice.  I have asked staff to check that again.  It is the advice as I stand before Senators.</P>
        <P>This approach is being taken for a reason.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, wanted to have a debate in the House.  He also wanted as many people as possible from all sides of the debate to enjoy membership of the committee.  If one examines the current composition of the relevant committee, it is clear that those who have concerns about certain issues and negative feelings about the Lisbon treaty are not represented on it.  We decided to do business in this manner for positive rather than for negative reasons.  I assume Senator O&rsquo;Toole, whose mind I can practically read, will respond by saying that if one is operating in a manner that is <i>ultra vires</i>, it does not matter whether one has the best intentions.  I accept that it does not mean one is operating in a manner that is <i>intra vires</i>.  I ask the Senator to accept my bona fides in this regard.  I have been advised that this is an equally valid way of doing business.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond to a couple of comments.  I agree with Senator Alex White that Europe is so important to the people of this State that the bona fides of everybody who campaigned on <Col N="280" />the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; sides are under scrutiny.  Nobody on either side of the campaign said that Ireland should leave the EU.  All involved said they supported Europe.  If they were speaking truthfully, we all have an equal responsibility to work through this.  The last thing I want, or anybody in this House wants, is for Ireland to be isolated within Europe.  As I have said on numerous occasions, only to be accused of scaremongering, my biggest fear is that at the end of this year, this treaty will be ratified by all other member states.  If they believe it is the best deal for their citizens, for their nations and for Europe as a whole, their right to want to move forward is equal to our right to want to make our decision.</P>
        <P>We rightly and properly demand that the decision of the Irish people be respected by the other 26 member states.  Equally, the other 26 states can say that while they accept that right, we must respect the fact that they want to move in a certain direction.  That forces us to test all sorts of hypotheses that were put forward in the period leading up to June.  I do not want to go there, however, because I do not believe it would be fruitful, progressive or right to refight the referendum.  The reality is that the Irish people have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I respect that decision even though I am one of the most disappointed people in this Chamber in that regard.  Equally, the Irish people have said they want to stay in Europe.  I want to respect that decision too.  How do we produce a solution that addresses these contradictory positions?  The establishment of this sub-committee is a good way of doing that.</P>
        <P>I fully respect the bona fides of Senator O&rsquo;Toole in raising the issue.  I ask him to accept my bona fides too.  Since I heard of his concerns, the results of my queries have indicated that there is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has asked a valid question.  The secretariat of the committee asked for advice on this from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As this issue was brought to my attention at 3 p.m. today, I took it very seriously.  I will give the Senator the name of the official and he can check up on it.</P>
        <P>Senators Ormonde and Alex White both raised the issue of information.  There was a failure of information involved.  From the time of the Irish Presidency in 2004, I have been advocating that there needs to be a sense of real communication between the Union and the citizens.  The Union has to learn to speak to the hearts of the citizens, and it must learn to listen, because communication is a two-way process.  It is right that the committee should examine how we do that.  The research figures show that the only figures that stand out relate to the 42% of people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; because of the issue of their knowledge, while 47% abstained due to the same issue.  It is important that this committee is open and that its activities are broadcast.  It is important for the life of this nation that RTE does not consign the work of this committee to ten seconds on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  It is important that the people hear the arguments for and against the issues.  If people make mistakes on either side of those arguments, it is very important that the people are convinced of the actual arguments.</P>
        <P>The committee will have my support.  I trust that the matter raised will be checked again.  It is a matter for each individual House to rule what is in order and what is not in order within its own remit, and I understand this House has ruled that this is in order.  Afterwards, I will provide to the Senator the name of the individual who gave us the advice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this topic which is a serious issue in my constituency.  It is a personal issue and I openly declare my interest.  I have been at the heart of developing the car ferry in the Foyle in my time in politics, which dates back 13 or 14 years.</P>
        <P>Twenty years previously my father had been involved in working with a small number of Limavady councillors to develop a car ferry.  In the late 1970s they went down to Tarbert to see the work going on there and evaluate the potential for a car ferry in the Foyle.  They also looked at bridges.  They looked at all the different potential solutions.  Finally, the car ferry became a reality in 2002 because the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, believed me when I said that if he gave us substantial moneys from the 1999 peace and reconciliation fund, we would be able to spend it on something which really would build peace and reconciliation in my part of the world.  As a result, we got a car ferry.  Within two years 1 million customers had used the car ferry.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, left Dublin now and typed Moville, Greencastle or any part of Inishowen into his satellite navigator, which he, with a driver, probably does not need, he would be brought to Magilligan where he would cross over to Greencastle.</P>
        <P>It is an important a piece of infrastructure for us from the point of view of tourism and the chamber of commerce and as a getting-to-know-you exercise between the communities on both sides of the Foyle.  I walk the shore quite often and I regularly meet people who still come over just to stand and look back at their area to work out where Greysteel, Ballykelly, Portrush and Portstewart are.  They have never seen their own area from the other side of the Foyle.  Likewise, we go over and contribute to the economies of places such as Limavady and Coleraine.  That is brilliant.</P>
        <P>However, anyone who sees what is happening on arrival at Magilligan &mdash; it was important that it was witnessed by BBC television &mdash; would think it was a clip from the 1970s or 1980s.  Every car is being stopped.  This happens in a cage because a cage was provided as part of <Col N="285" />security in the initial concept.  People are taken out and searched similar to what one would encounter at airport security.  They have the long metal pole with the mirror on the bottom to check under the cars, I assume for bombs.  They have all forms of security which, as I stated, hark back to a time that is not reminiscent of or conducive to developing peace and reconciliation.  It impacts severely on the car ferry&rsquo;s operation.</P>
        <P>I accept what Limavady Borough Council has told me, that this is part of staff training, that it is important they know how to implement the security and that it will not be as bad in the future.  I want the international port designation removed from this location.  This is an inland waterway.  An international port is supposed to serve something that is surrounded by water.  The North is not a jurisdiction that is surrounded by water and, therefore, it does not comply with the terms of what an international port should be.</P>
        <P>If this were a bridge instead of a ferry, which it might have been because it is 0.6 of a mile across, then it would have been exactly the same as Lifford and Strabane.  Lifford is in Donegal and Strabane is in Tyrone.  There is a bridge across the same river; there is no routine security.  There is customs at times, but no routine security.  It is not a sufficient measure to say that this will be stepped down.  Security is an important aspect of any country.  There is a finite point of Greencastle and Magilligan.  If I were an international terrorist &mdash; I have no criminal mind &mdash; I do not think I would get on a regular ferry service, cross over and go onto a narrow road that goes past Magilligan prison and is surrounded by locations in which the army is undergoing training and exploding bombs.  I would pull into an enclave or cove on any other part of the Foyle, Antrim or Donegal coast.</P>
        <P>This is so ridiculous that it is hard to believe I am talking about it.  It is a reality that must stop, for many reasons.  My father would not have believed that the ferry came into existence.  Yet it did so and is an exceptional example of cross-Border cooperation.  It took 30 years to materialise, but when the money was provided the political will on every side was in place.  I hark back to the BBC newsclip that was done.  We had people from all sides, political and non-political, who were clearly saying that it should be on both sides or neither side, but preferably neither side.  We do not intend to hark back to the 1970s or 1980s in Donegal, and we do not want it brought back to us in Magilligan either.  I speak for the majority of the people of the north west, not just on one or other side of the Border.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney.  I sat in the front room of her house on a winter&rsquo;s evening in 1992, with her late father, talking about remoteness and isolation.  It is sad that this issue must be raised today.  The fact that the ferry is a reality is a memorial, not just to Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s father, but to the fact that he produced a feisty young lady to represent that part of Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the decade since the Good Friday Agreement great progress has been seen on this island, North and South.  The restoration of the devolved institutions on 8 May last year was an important moment.   One of the elements which underpin the progress towards a new and shared future for all on this island has been the creation of improved economic and physical links between the two jurisdictions.  While economic development North and South has followed different paths at times, we now face similar challenges to respond to the increasing pace of change and intensity of global competition.  There is a new recognition that by working together we can build efficiencies and critical mass in areas such as infrastructure, innovation, skills, trade, tourism and investment promotion. Our shared goal is to strengthen our competitive advantage globally, to address the economic problems that persist as a result of the Border and to deliver better services for all our citizens.</P>
        <P>We are working to achieve this, including through the objectives in the national development plan and the programme for Government.  Progress includes the development of the all-Ireland electricity market, the improving of road infrastructure between the two jurisdictions, and an <Col N="286" />important increase in cross-Border trade.  Against this background, it is understandable that representatives from the north west should be perturbed and amazed by what has happened.</P>
        <P>The increased security checks for passengers travelling on the Foyle have become a matter of disquiet locally.  The Chamber will agree that the operation of the Foyle car ferry over the past six years has been a resounding success, and a positive symbol of the new cooperative spirit that exists on the island.  Its importance is not just its physical presence; it is a strong philosophical reminder that if we work together on the island we all gain significantly.  It is illustrated by the fact that there are two Governments involved in co-operation with the ferry, and the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland have all been involved in it.</P>
        <P>As well as directly creating 10 full-time and a number of seasonal jobs, the service has also provided infrastructure that is supporting tourism and economic development in the north west region, one of the most geographically isolated parts of this island.  After less than three years in service the one millionth passenger stepped aboard the ferry, and that is an indication of progress.  This is because the ferry cuts travelling time by at least half an hour, linking rural Donegal with rural Derry, and is a tangible manifestation of the new dispensation that exists in that area.  The positive benefits of cross-Border partnership are encapsulated in this project.</P>
        <P>However, that the ferry links both jurisdictions can sometimes present difficulties and complications, such as have arisen in this case. The security checks to which Senator Keaveney refers are carried out on the Magilligan side of the crossing, in County Derry.  Since its launch in 2002, Limavady Borough Council have been carrying out random security checks on vehicles boarding the ferry for travel to Greencastle, on the Donegal side. There are no such checks imposed on vehicles entering or exiting the ferry at Greencastle.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The matter of increased security has been raised by officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs with Limavady Borough Council, which is the relevant implementing body in that jurisdiction, and through the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  Limavady Borough Council has advised that these additional checks are due to private staff training, which has taken place over the last three weeks.  As such, it is anticipated that the checks will shortly return to normal levels, with only spot checks being carried out.  I understand that the matter will be raised at a meeting of the borough council over the next weeks and this is welcome.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor the situation</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>It is important that we do not let the benefits offered by the Lough Foyle ferry be overshadowed by a focus on security arrangements.  The ferry makes a positive contribution to the economic development of the north west region.  Everyone gains from that.  I look forward to security arrangements returning shortly to those which previously pertained, in keeping with the spirit of co-operation and trust which has enabled the great progress on this island over the past decade to continue into the future.  I will continue to ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to monitor what is happening in this regard and to ensure our concerns are shared and are known to the authorities involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am rasing the issue of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church of Ireland national school in Bagnelstown County Carlow.  I have raised a number of school issues in the last months.  It is a sign of the time.  St. Mary&rsquo;s is a four teacher school which caters for approximately 85 pupils.  The school has a very large catchment area.  The existing school building has two classrooms.  It was hoped that a new four classroom school would be built under the new school building programme.  The Church of Ireland community is providing a site outside Bagenalstown for the new school and there is no additional cost in that regard for the Department.  The existing school premises has two classrooms and two prefabs, one pro<Col N="287" />vided by the Department and the other by the parents council of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church of Ireland national school.</P>
        <P>Playing facilities for the students are limited.  There is a gravelled area adjacent to the Church of Ireland which doubles as a playground.  There is a continuous problem with vandalism of the school facility.  It is hoped this will not be such a difficulty on the new site, which is just outside the town.  The school authorities have already raised the relevant amount of matching funding for the school development.  A considerable amount has been raised and they are now awaiting the Department&rsquo;s sanction to build the new school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The authorities were told a short time ago that the school was one of ten pilot schemes.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that.  Planning for the new school is pending but there is a sense of desperation within the board of management and the community that they will be left to one side and forgotten in the current post-Celtic tiger era.  I ask the Minister to reassure them that the new school will be built as soon as possible and that the amount of work and effort the community has put into raising the considerable funding will not be in vain.  The fact that the community is providing the site for the new school, which is a considerable benefit to the Department, should be taken into account.</P>
        <P>The school authorities were guaranteed that the new school would be built in 2006, when the full grant was approved.  However, no commencement date was given.  The community has been waiting anxiously for the past two years for a firm commitment from the Government that the funding will be released for the new school building.  I hope the Minister can give me positive news in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The position with St. Mary&rsquo;s Church of Ireland primary school, Royal Oak Road, Bagenalstown, is as Senator Phelan outlined.  It is a co-educational school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class inclusive.  The enrolment at 30 September 2007 was 82 pupils.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, three teachers and one learning support teacher.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the school was offered &euro;575,000 to build a new three classroom school under the small schools scheme.  However, as the numbers in the school had increased and a larger school was needed, the school authority withdrew from this scheme.  The Department of Education and Science now plans to provide a new four classroom school building for St. Mary&rsquo;s on a greenfield site and the project is being delivered by traditional methods.  All applications for large-scale capital funding under this form of delivery are assessed in accordance with published prioritisation criteria and assigned a band rating which reflects the type and urgency of the works needed.  The project for St. Mary&rsquo;s attracts a band two rating, indicating that a new school premises is needed.</P>
        <P>The project was approved for the commencement of architectural planning under the 2007 school building and modernisation programme.  A design team was appointed to enable this.  The project has now reached stage 2(a) of the architectural planning process which is the developed sketch scheme.  The design team&rsquo;s submission in this regard is with the Department and is currently being examined by the Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff.  When this stage is approved, the next stage is detailed design of the building.</P>
        <P>The further progression of all large-scale building projects, including the project for St. Mary&rsquo;s, from the initial design stages through to the construction phase will be considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible for the Minister to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project for St. Mary&rsquo;s to the next stage of architectural planning at this time.</P>
        <P>Large-scale building projects are advanced consistent with the band rating assigned to them under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  In this regard, a <Col N="288" />band two rating is the second highest possible.  The Minister shares the school authority&rsquo;s desire to move forward the project for St. Mary&rsquo;s as quickly as possible and he wishes to assure the school that this will happen when the requisite funding is available and consistent with the band rating attaching to it.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Phelan for raising this matter.  Over the lifetime of the new national development plan the Government intends to provide &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings such as St. Mary&rsquo;s, which is a huge investment.  Currently, however, the school must wait pending the position of the capital programme.  The Minister will continue the programme with whatever resources he secures this year and he will keep St. Mary&rsquo;s and other schools in mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a former member of a board of management of a national school and I have never seen more homework put into a project, if Members will pardon the pun, on the part of the board of management and the stakeholders involved.  There is a contradiction in the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks.  He spoke about the Minister being unable to give a timeframe, yet he later referred to the fact that the Government has committed &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings over the term of the national development plan.  If that sum is committed, there is no reason a possible timeframe cannot be given.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of urgency, as is obvious from the amount of time and effort put into the project by the local community.  The Church of Ireland community is small in that part of the country but comprises a dedicated bunch of people.  I hope they are not sidelined due to the economic difficulties the country is going through at present.  I hope the Government will adhere to the &euro;4.5 billion school building programme in the national development plan.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister.  He will be familiar with the subject of this Adjournment matter.  It concerns the immense difficulties that can be caused in areas surrounding major sporting venues.  I wish to focus on Croke Park, parking around that venue for major match fixtures and the work of residents&rsquo; associations and others in trying to put forward a solution to this problem.  When people who do not live adjacent to Croke Park hear me and others describe the difficulty match fixtures can cause they tend to discount our advocacy and describe us as &ldquo;cranks&rdquo;.  They claim it cannot be that bad.  However, anybody who lives in the Glasnevin, Drumcondra, Phibsborough, North Strand or East Wall areas is aware of the near chaos that sometimes descends on their areas when a major sporting event takes place in Croke Park.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This chaos can take a number of different forms.  In residential areas, it can mean residents being unable to get into or out of their houses if they do not have a parking scheme in place on the road.  It can take the form of ambulances and Garda and utility vehicles not being able to gain access to roads and laneways because of illegal parking.  An entire residential area is in effect gridlocked out of life when a major sports event takes place in Croke Park.  When visitors from other counties come to the stadium, they want parking but, since they do not know the area as well as the residents, they park anywhere there is a space.  They are becoming increasingly frustrated over not being allowed to park in estates and neighbourhoods in which they would have been allowed to park in the past.  They cannot do so any more because of the parking schemes and double yellow lines in place.</P>
        <P>The residents in the area have done great work in organising the local community to do something about the issue.  They launched a very successful and well-organised campaign with a view to asking Dublin City Council to put in place a plan for resident-only permit parking within a certain cordon and to have it coincide with the introduction of park-and-ride facilities.  It is a very sensible and well thought out plan on which there has been much debate.</P><Col N="289" />
        <P>I raise this matter because the people involved are not interested in displacing the problem.  They recognise the issue is not going away and is getting worse.  They have arrived at a pragmatic solution to address it, that is, not to allow people park within a certain area but to provide them with public transport alternatives.  This proposal is with Dublin City Council and, for a number of different reasons, it is unlikely to be implemented in the near future.  Given that the Department of Transport and the Dublin Transport Authority are to try to deliver co-ordinated strategies to respond to congestion problems in the city and the Dublin region, I implore them to take a leadership role regarding the issue and recognise that it is serious and affects residents&rsquo; quality of life.  There is no reason a sensible plan, if well implemented, could not make life a lot easier for them and the people visiting Croke Park to enjoy a great day out.  The kinds of problems we are creating for both the residents and visitors are intolerable given the kinds of steps we are able to take as a country.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending and I would appreciate his response.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Given that I live in an area not far from the one in question, I understand the problem.  The role of the Department of Transport is the setting and implementation of national transport policy.  We do not micromanage issues at local level.  I believe very strongly in local authorities managing their own affairs regarding these matters, subject to general policy directions from national Government.</P>
        <P>The Department received several requests to allow local councils to address the parking problems and congestion experienced on certain days by residents who reside on public roads in the environs of venues such as sports stadia.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, took action to address this issue in 2007.  As part of the Roads Acts 2007, he progressed an amendment to the Road Traffic Act 1994 providing a by-law making power for road authorities across the country to restrict or prohibit, in the interest of the safety of road users and preventing traffic congestion, the parking of vehicles on public roads in the vicinity of stadia or other venues when sports or entertainment events are being held therein.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A process is already in place with regard to newly constructed stadia whereby the promoters of large stadia, such as Lansdowne Road, when seeking planning permission to provide or upgrade a facility, must present both a transport impact assessment and, as has been the case more recently, a mobility management plan, MMP.  The MMP sets out the impact of travel generated by the provision of the facility on the surrounding transport network and general area.  On submission, it is the job of the relevant local authority to ensure that measures proposed to meet the demand for travel to and from the facility by various modes are implemented.</P>
        <P>For those facilities already in existence, such as Croke Park, where the process governing its enhancement did not require the provision of an MMP, it falls on the local authority to implement measures, such as parking controls, in the surrounding area to ensure that amenity and access to that area are maintained and enhanced for residents.  This is the basic position and the reply I have to hand outlines additional information.</P>
        <P>I remember being on Dublin City Council when councillors were clamouring for power to take steps such as that proposed by the Senator.  They got the power and it is up to them to reach agreement locally.  If the system is floundering at present, it may be because some people were over-ambitious.  It is up to the councillors, through management, to try to address the issues.  Councillors from other parts of the north-side or other parts of the city should have a greater understanding of the matter and should be capable of doing their business provided they can reach agreement.  It is not the intention of the Department to get involved and micromanage and hold the hands of the councillors.  The Department gave them powers under legislation and they should be able to work out the problem.</P>
        <P>Additional information on park-and-ride facilities, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s work on parking and the DTO study has been circulated.  However, what I stated provides the fundamental gist of <Col N="290" />the answer.  I may not have the correct information but believe the councillors who were promoting the proposal were over-ambitious.  The area does look very big on the map.  I will not pretend to be fully up to date on what is happening but it is up to the councillors to try to do the business.  They are all elected members of Dublin City Council and should have a greater understanding of the problem.  They are working in the area in question, or the adjoining area, and should be able to solve the problem for themselves using the legislative framework.  The ball is in their court.</P>
        <P>Councillors are always looking for extra power from various Departments.  They have it in this case and therefore one must ask why they cannot do the job.  I am sorry I cannot help the Senator.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  When the councillors appear unable to deliver a solution, as appears to be the case, it is incumbent on people like me to try to help in some way.  This is what this matter is all about.  I appreciate the response the Minister of State has given, which contains some helpful information regarding park-and-ride facilities.  Perhaps there will be a role for the Dublin Transport Authority when it is up and running.  I hope the problem is resolved by then.  If not, I will be approaching the authority.</P>
        <P>Given that there is nobody present other than the Minister of State and myself, will he give me an update on what is happening in respect of metro north?  Is the project still proceeding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Metro north is part of Transport 21 and, as far as I know, the Railway Procurement Agency applied for the railway order a few weeks ago.  It is a case of going full steam ahead and there is no change in that regard.  Four major groups have made their pitch and the Department of Finance will issue final approval when it sees the final tender price, which is quite reasonable.  From the point of view of the Department, I hope it will be a matter of going full steam ahead.  There are many rumours and suggestions about other matters but metro north is probably the main priority within the Department.</P>
        <P>On the Senator&rsquo;s reference to the issue being forwarded to the Dublin Transport Authority, if the Government or an agency were to say power should  be taken from the local authority with a view to making a decision itself, there would be uproar at local authority level.  I was there for long enough myself.  Local authority members clamour for power but when they get it, they cannot use it or cannot make a deal among themselves.</P>
        <P>My perception of the problem is that some councillors have tried to draw the lines too wide.  If that is the issue, they should try to draw them where the problem exists.  Everybody understands the effort to make appropriate no-parking zones for the areas closest to Croke Park, whether that is Iona Road, Clonliffe Road or otherwise.  I will not try to pretend to read the minds of councillors but the exclusion zone is so wide, many areas are included that would not normally have a problem.</P>
        <P>It is up to the councillors.  They have the power.  If they cannot do the business, they could all sign up and ask the Department to take back the power from them.  That would make many people who were involved in an earlier era, including the Senator and I, look very foolish but, having got them power, they cannot agree to implement it.  If they want to hand back the power, perhaps the Department would consider a formal request, if they all sign up to it.</P>
