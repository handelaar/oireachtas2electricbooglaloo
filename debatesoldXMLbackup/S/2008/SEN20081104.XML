	<P>I have notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to make a statement on the implications of the &euro;10 travel tax for Cork Airport and other regional airports.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate the exact position in relation to the development of a new school in Monreagh, County  Donegal, and the option that is currently being favoured.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on broadcasting standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy Leader&rsquo;s announcement was very brief, which raises the question as to why so little legislation is coming through from the Government to this House.  One must ask what is happening.  We know what is happening on the financial side, namely, that the EU is taking on the Government over the enormous rise in borrowing and criticising its entire approach and does not believe the figures that have been supplied to it.  The question must be put to the Deputy Leader as to why there is a dearth of legislation coming to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow for a debate on education today.  There are many outstanding issues on which we need information.  It would be good to have a debate on this subject, about which everyone is concerned.  Senator Dan Boyle may remember a video, produced by the Green Party, which was broadcast into every home in the country last year.  One of the children who featured in that video said:</P><Col N="934"/>
        <P LI="1">I can&rsquo;t vote but if I could vote there would be loads of things I would be asking the Government to do.  I&rsquo;d like there to be less kids in my class so the teacher could pay me more attention.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In that context, it must be very embarrassing for the Green Party that it agreed to the cutbacks in education in the budget.</P>
        <P>Teachers in Lucan have asked a number of questions of me, which I will put to the Deputy Leader.  This week I spoke to the principal of a school which has a number of foreign national students on its roll book.  Currently there are five language support teachers in the school, but this is due to drop to only two when the new cutbacks take effect.  The principal has had no direction on this matter and has not yet heard from the Department.  He wishes to know if special consideration will be given to schools which have a certain number of students in need of language support and if they will be exempt from the teaching post reductions announced in the budget.</P>
        <P>Another principal in the Lucan area told me that this year he has five junior infant classes to cope with demand from local families.  Next year there will again be demand for the provision of five such classes, in a rapidly growing area.  However, because of the cutbacks, he will only have the teaching resources to provide four junior infant classes.  Will the Government take into account areas with a growing population, such as Lucan, or will it apply the cutbacks indiscriminately across the board?</P>
        <P>School principals have told me that it is impossible for them to plan, given what they have been told to date and it is extremely destabilising for schools and school management.  Despite everything that has been said, schools will have less funding from the Government next year than this year, making the situation highly pressurised.</P>
        <P>There is a sense at present of death by a thousand cutbacks.  We have heard the Minister refer to cutbacks but where is the overall plan from the Government?  I ask the Deputy Leader to clarify whether the Government intends to introduce a supplementary budget, given the response from the EU on the scale of the problem here and the figures it believes are accurate, as opposed to those supplied by the Government.</P>
        <P>Can Senator Dan Boyle explain how the Green Party can stand by what is happening to the Human Rights Commission, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Equality Authority?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>How can a party that has long been concerned about human rights justify what is happening to these organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should lay off the Green Party.  She is being very unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden, please do not interrupt the speaker.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the disempowerment they are experiencing as a result of the cutbacks?  If the Senator is not familiar with what is happening to those organisations, I urge him to make it his business to find out about the difficulties they are facing because of the Government&rsquo;s action.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business so that the Minister for Education and Science can come to the House to answer some of the many questions which I suspect Senators from all sides of the House have been asked regarding the education cutbacks.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="935"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also ask the Deputy Leader to examine the issues surrounding human rights organisations.  It is something I intend to raise again when I have had a chance to study the cutbacks that have been implemented in that area. </P>
        <P>I ask that the Government do something sensible and creative with the budget.  There are measures within the budget which could be put to better purpose, a classic example of which is the air travel charge, which I note Senator Buttimer will raise on the Adjournment of the House tonight.  If the Government proceeds with the &euro;10 airport charge, it should not be applied to regional airports, namely, the airports in Donegal, Sligo, Knock, Galway, Shannon, Kerry, Cork and Waterford.  Such a measure would be a positive step to help the regions and to divert commerce outside the pale, and it would be politically attractive.  There would be very little money involved and the possibility should be examined.</P>
        <P>I second the proposal to amend the Order of Business.  It is amusing and entertaining to watch the Government squirm over the education cuts.  It has tried to encourage a debate on the issue of substitute teachers making fraudulent claims in some way.  If teachers are doing so, they should be charged with fraud and if they do something wrong action should be taken.  The latest discussion is on how we might sack the teachers and the answer is very simple.  If teachers act in a wrong or unprofessional way, of course they should be sacked.  They should get the same protection from the law as any other worker in the State.  They do not need, and should not get, any more protection.  This is not an issue for debate, it is a distraction from the issues raised by Senator Fitzgerald, the answers to which we cannot provide to schools.  This issue will grow and grow.  Members of the Government parties may believe that because there was a big protest outside the gates of the Houses last week that is the end of the matter, but it is not.  There will be bush fires in ever constituency in the country on the issue of schools losing out and not knowing what will happen to them.  My colleagues on the Government side should note that this has little to do with the teachers&rsquo; unions.  This is the view of parents, management, Vocational Educational Committees, Gaeltacht schools and every group to which I have listened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The only people with a different view on the matter are those in the Department of Education and Science.  There has been an attempt to use world surveys claiming to show North Korea has a better system of education, and that we might have the same if we increased our pupil-teacher ratio, however, such surveys have nothing to do with Ireland.  This is a nonsense and we should have a debate on the matter, which we asked for last week.  The previous week the Leader indicated we would have a debate on education.  However, this has not happened and, therefore, I second the proposal to amend the Order of Business.  We should allow such a debate and I do not see why the Deputy Leader could not facilitate it today.</P>
        <P>I suggest that for today&rsquo;s debate speaking times should be 12 minutes and eight minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand why we cannot have the debate for which Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole called.  Will the Deputy Leader indicate in his response to the House why we cannot have the debate this week?  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole correctly said, it was called for last week.  This is an urgent matter and if the House is to have any relevance it should debate the issues everyone else is discussing and debating.</P>
        <P>I refer to one of the taunts from the members on the Government side of the House.  The Deputy Leader will be glad to hear me say this was not simply a Green Party budget.  The principle and central responsibility for it lies with Fianna F&aacute;il, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  While the disposition of the Green Party before the election, evident from some of its statements, gives rise to some questions now, I do not spare the main Government party <Col N="936"/>from the criticisms we are entitled to level concerning the budget.  I support the call for a debate this week on the education cuts.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for a debate at the earliest possible opportunity on the question of the price of fuel?  There are extraordinary disparities between the price of diesel and petrol in parts of the country.  The overall price levels of diesel and petrol throughout the State are too high and in recent days and weeks the international price of oil has halved since its peak earlier in the Summer.  Will the relevant Minister explain this?  I have some sympathy with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s frustrations which he expressed in colourful terms in the D&aacute;il some months ago.  He demanded that the relevant people should be brought the D&aacute;il to deal with the matter.  However, the relevant Minister should be brought to this House to explain the reason for the extraordinary disparity in the price of petrol and diesel throughout the country and why it has remained so high, given the falling international price of fuel.  I call for a debate on this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>The eyes of the world are on the United States of America today and it is a momentous day for that country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I showed my Obama badge to some of my colleagues.  I was somewhat concerned after difficulties of a sartorial nature experienced by my colleague Senator Hannigan some weeks ago and I was afraid to wear my badge.  However, I have my Obama badge here today.  Clearly, the eyes of the world are on that election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will spare the Cathaoirleach the embarrassment of wearing the badge.  </P>
        <P>On a more serious note, it is right that the eyes of the world are on the US, but I hope when the election is over the eyes of the international community will fix, at least briefly, on the recent shocking reports by the BBC and Amnesty International in respect of the most horrific stoning, beating and murder of a young girl in Somalia in shocking circumstances.  She had been accused of adultery, which is in breach of Islamic law.  Her father and other sources had informed Amnesty International that she had been raped by three men and that she attempted to report this rape to the militia that controls the city in which she lives.  Amnesty International has done extraordinary work in the past few days to identify this story, pointing out that this 13 year old child suffered a horrendous death at the behest of the armed opposition groups that currently control Kismayo.  I ask the Deputy Leader to raise urgently with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Ireland should support immediately the setting up of an international commission of inquiry into this incident and similar incidents in Somalia.  If we are truly to begin a new era on the international scene, which I hope we will do tomorrow, this is precisely the kind of incident which the international community must not countenance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader if we can have a discussion on the air travel tax.  The budget was published earlier than usual this year, on 14 October, and most of the measures will not be implemented until next year.  We have an opportunity to make a case to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should make the case.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Members must speak through the Chair and they must respect the Senator who is speaking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il stands for flip flop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that Members of this House put forward reasoned arguments to the Minister in particular cases.  If the Government charges &euro;10 for everybody leaving Dublin Airport and &euro;2 for all other airports, it would bring in the same amount of money and would eliminate the anomaly between airports based on how close they are to England.  It is a simple suggestion and I believe the Minister will respond favourably to it.</P>
        <P>I commend the Opposition on raising the issue of the price of petrol and diesel, an issue which I raised last week.  The old Fine Gael website on rip-off Ireland is out of date and my advice is that it should be updated.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Senator to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I was delighted action was taken in this regard and that prices are falling.  I am glad the Opposition woke up to the issue, but I wish Fine Gael would update its website because it is about three years out of date and that is very unfair to the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>The contents of the website are not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris raised the issue of rendition flights and inspections will become a reality.  That will not be relevant after today when a new President is elected in the US.  I compliment Senator Boyle on being selected as his party&rsquo;s candidate for the south region in the European Parliament elections.  I also compliment Senator Alan Kelly and Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not &ldquo;What it says in the papers&rdquo; or something like that.  We are on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not in order to commend our colleagues?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Then in those circumstances, I thank the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is a momentous day in the US and we wish the people well in that country.  When the election is over in America, a major diplomatic offensive must be launched on the plight of the undocumented Irish.  There are 50,000 undocumented Irish living illegally in the US.  Their assets may be frozen at any time, they cannot come home for family funerals and they cannot visit relatives here.  They live as fugitives in America.  I ask the Deputy Leader to request the Government to undertake a new diplomatic offensive immediately after the presidential election to try to resolve this matter.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today reports that the number of deportations of undocumented Irish people from America has greatly increased in recent weeks.  Some 27 people have been deported this year, compared to 12 in 2006.  I will not go through all the statistics but there has been a great increase.  It is a major <Col N="938"/>issue for many families in this country and it should be dealt with.  I ask the Deputy Leader to bring it to the attention of the Government and to have the matter debated here.  </P>
        <P>I support the call by Senator Frances Fitzgerald and others concerning education cuts.  When the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, seeks to compare class sizes now with those in previous years, he omits that we now have multi-ethnic classes comprising a multitude of nationalities.  Some children cannot speak English in classes, while we also have people with disabilities so we are not comparing like with like.  What is proposed is a travesty of justice and an assault on our young people.  It is bad economics in the long term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have that debate if the Leader agrees.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to take this up.  I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole in saying that we should not allow diversionary tactics by the Government to distract us from this awful reality across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>During the lifetime of the last Seanad, I raised the issue of No. 16 Moore Street, Dublin, which is a building of major historical significance.  It is the building to which the leaders of the 1916 Rising retired to prepare the surrender plans, so it could be the equivalent of the Alamo.  As a result of publicity at that time, we were given to understand that the Government and the appropriate authority would accord full and proper national monument status to the building.  In recent times, however, I have seen suggestions that, as a result of a proposed commercial development in this area, that status may be diminished.  I notice that a grandson of James Connolly, one of the 1916 leaders, expressed his concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>In 2016, we will celebrate and commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising &mdash; I understand that plans are already being prepared for that occasion.  If the monument at No. 16 Moore Street is not accorded the status, which we understood it would be, we will feel ashamed to commemorate 1916.  I ask the appropriate Minister to assure us that, even with this proposed commercial development, there is no danger that No. 16 Moore Street and the adjoining buildings will be interfered with in any way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in seeking a debate on education.  As somebody who is on the board of trustees of over 100 voluntary schools, I am very concerned about the impact of cutbacks, particularly at second level.  Many teachers have contacted me because they are worried about the impact of the budget on substitution and supervision arrangements.  We talk about social capital and the importance of extra curricular activities in terms of giving students a rounded experience, but what will happen when teachers cannot get involved in sports, musicals and all the other very valuable things they do because it will not be possible to replace them during those hours?  This needs to be considered and changed.</P>
        <P>Last week, I asked the Leader for a debate on human embryonic stem cell research in light of UCC&rsquo;s controversial decision.  I understand the Leader is proposing that, in the context of a wider debate on health, the Minister for Health and Children will deal with that matter, but that is not good enough.  I point out to the Deputy Leader that whether we allow embryo-destructive research is, in the first instance, a matter of justice.  It is for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to come into this House and to relegate the issue of embryo research to just one issue among many to be discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>To destroy the embryos.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="939"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to replicate the media&rsquo;s total inaction in questioning what UCC has done.  There has been no media scrutiny of the lack of public consultation prior to the UCC decision.  We do not even know whether they published the results of their own internal survey and nobody is asking the hard questions.  I am not aware that anybody has even asked the Government what it thinks of the UCC decision.</P>
        <P>In light of all this, I want to withdraw my request for the debate because I intend instead to bring forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in this House for which I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be present, which will seek to prohibit any creation of embryos for the purposes of research or any research involving or deriving from the destruction of human embryos.  Given the great progress being made in the area of adult stem cell research, including induced pluripotent stem cell research, I hope I will have support from people on all sides of the House who must surely want a socially non-divisive solution to this very sensitive issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I ask also for a debate on Burma.  This was the subject of a previous debate but I recently received some very eloquent correspondence from a Brazilian person living in this country on foot of an article I wrote in the <i>Daily Mail </i>about the plight of oppressed people, particularly Christian communities who are being oppressed throughout the world.  The Chin people are being forgotten by the world community.  They are suffering as a result of a very unusual famine that only occurs about twice in every century when there is an excess of bamboo which causes a plague of rats with consequent infestation and damage and consumption of crops.  It is not the Burmese Government&rsquo;s intention to look after the plight of its own people in western Myanmar.  I ask the Deputy Leader for a response on what the Government proposes by way of a debate whereby we can look at what we should be doing and what the concerned citizens of the world should be doing to draw attention to the plight of these oppressed people, many thousands of whom are now suffering and are in danger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on education in which I ask the Minister to address one aspect, namely, the change in the allocation of pupil-teacher ratios in private secondary schools.  It seems to me that this is establishing a differential for which the reasons are not given nor the policy explained.  Is the Government setting itself against private education?  These private secondary schools, such as St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Blackrock College or CBC Monkstown in my area, invariably take on board themselves the capital investment required to upgrade their schools.  This relieves the State of so much expenditure that the case has not been made for this differential which, presumably, is the thin end of the wedge in that this Government is setting itself a course against private education.  What is the reason for this discrimination and what will be the effects on the schools concerned?  Is it the intention of the Minister to pursue a policy of discriminating further against private education in this regard?  It is either forcing an increase in fees in these schools or it is giving rise to a drop in the quality of the education which will be available.</P>
        <P>There are many misconceptions about private education.  I refer to a survey in <i>The Irish Times</i> of August this year which showed that many families are prepared to go into debt to fund their children&rsquo;s education.  I ask that the Minister would address this specific issue of private education and the discrimination which has been introduced in the budget in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity on the subject of buying Irish.  We are heading into the Christmas purchasing season and there are many products, including high ticket items such as laptops and computers which are manufactured in this country by American companies.  Given a choice and all things being <Col N="940"/>equal, it makes perfect sense for people to make a conscious effort to purchase Irish goods.  European Union regulations impose restrictions on the promotion of goods but this does not extend to the national Parliament making a strong case to the public in light of the slowdown in the economy.</P>
      
        <P>The reality is that we are trying to save jobs.  I am conscious that one of the major motor companies was considering closing a plant in one of its subsidiaries.  Its representatives went to the subsidiary where they were asked very strongly not to close the plant.  They then went to the car park where they found many cars, including many imported cars made by that company&rsquo;s cheaper competitors.</P>
        <P>We would make a great case for maintaining jobs in Ireland and show a great effort to achieve this if we continued to push strongly for products to have an Irish label on them, whether for computer games, which will be very popular this Christmas, electronic equipment or high ticket items.  These should be promoted very strongly.  We should have this debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an excellent idea from Senator Hanafin, with whom I totally agree.  Perhaps that debate could be inclusive of the whole issue of pricing which was raised earlier by Senator Alex White.  This is not just about fuel prices.  I had reason to recently examine prices of other goods.  Prices in the same supermarkets in the UK and Ireland, when one takes into account the currency differential, are approximately 25% higher here, and the same applies to prices in clothes stores and sandwich and burger bars.  Some sort of rip-off is taking place.  I would like a general debate on prices and buying Irish.</P>

	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House.  We are in the middle of an economic recession but I do not believe we have had the Minister to the House to address the very serious issue of the <Col N="941"/>emigration that has now begun.  Are the Government and the T&aacute;naiste aware that middle income fathers are emigrating, leaving their wives and young children behind?  They have no choice but to emigrate because of their commitments.  Their jobs are gone and they are faced with moving to places like the Middle East, for example, Abu Dhabi.</P>
        <P>This is the Ireland we did not want to see return.  It is fine when people are leaving in their twenties for adventure but this is more serious.  What hope can the Government offer families who are facing these decisions?  When will the Minister come to the House to have a serious debate on the fundamentals of our economy, particularly with a view to examining employment opportunities?</P>

I do not know what hope there is for that system or how it will manage.  I am worried that after Christmas schools will have to send children home for health and safety reasons.  There will be all-out revolution because the parents may not be at home to take the children.  First, their education rights will be infringed.  Second, which is the abuse the Government will bring on itself, principals and teachers may have to get sick certificates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I support Senator Frances Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the cutbacks in the Combat Poverty Agency and others.  I have been raising this for the past three weeks.  It is clear no savings will be made with these cuts.  It is just an attempt to muzzle the voice of the disadvantaged and a very cynical action, as is the Government&rsquo;s decision to reopen the question of extraordinary rendition at this stage.  The Government claims it will discuss the matter with the incoming US Administration.  It was not too keen on it when Bush was in saddle.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I want to tell my good friends in the Green Party not to be bought off with this little sop from the Administration to allow them to close the door after the horses have bolted.  A committee was established by this House to examine the issue which was then dissolved by the Government.  Now, there is another one which contradicts what the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said to Deputy Michael D. Higgins and myself.  It also contradicts what was said by the Garda at the time which I raised at a meeting on foot of complaint I made about extraordinary rendition.  The Greens ought to be very careful that they themselves are not renditioned.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader reassure the House of the progress of the Civil Partnership Bill in the light of the very strong comments by Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady?  I found it a strange priority for the archdiocese of Armagh, when it only has seven seminarians and 130 priests for 200,000 people, to take on the disadvantaged in a manner which, sadly, can only further alienate young people from the church.  To make a totem of marriage in the way that it has been done is nothing other than blasphemy.  I refer to the gospels of Jesus Christ when he was reprimanded by the pharisees for breaking the Sabbath.  He made the point that this was an institution made for man, not man for the institution.</P>

I thought we had put it behind us.  I wanted us to get on to issues such as extraordinary rendition, human rights and the Dublin metro.  Why are we dragged back into the 19th century in this shameful and disgraceful way?  I am very happy if Cardinal Brady has strong feelings about it; he is perfectly entitled to them.

	<P Just="Left">Last week I called for a debate on the Health Service Executive, in particular with regard to the roll-out of BreastCheck in the north west.  While I appreciate the Leader said at the time he would do his best to pursue that issue and, particularly some comments by the head of the national cancer screening service last week, I know he is away this week, so he is not in a position to respond.  However, I plan to raise this issue each week until we get conclusive information on when the roll-out will take place in the north west.  I find it sickening in the extreme to watch advertisements on the television asking the people of the country to come forward and avail of this free service.  It is a joke.  It is George Orwell-style equality.</P>

That is what we are all about here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>There is another report within the HSE at the moment which proposes to reduce from 47 to 17 the number of pathology laboratories throughout the country.  It may make sense to have some kind of consolidation, but I would like a debate to take place at this point so that we, as representatives of the people &mdash; or a form of representation &mdash; can ensure their wishes are taken into account.  In this way we will not simply be reacting to events and trying to retrospectively correct the actions of management consultants who are not representing anybody and have zero mandate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my party leader, Senator Fitzgerald, with regard to the schedule for this week and the past number of weeks, which has been very thin not just on legislation but also on general debates.  In the past few weeks the Leader has agreed on the Order of Business to a number of debates.  In particular, I do not see why we have not had a debate on education, which has been raised by a number of speakers this morning.  We should certainly have had it by now.  There are at least four Ministers of State in the Department of Education and Science and if the senior Minister cannot be here I do not see why one of the others cannot take his place.</P>
        <P>Last week a number of people mentioned the need for a debate on agriculture.  Again, it is not on the schedule for this week or on the Order Paper for today.  I ask the Deputy Leader to consider it as soon as possible.  Similarly, a debate on public finances in general has been sought for a couple of months but we have not had one.  Let us consider the number of discussions we are having every week.  Last week there were three items on the schedule for the two days we sat.  That is not appropriate at a time at which there is such outcry on a number of issues.</P><Col N="944"/>
        <P>I wish to join with colleagues who raised the issue of fuel prices in light of an EU survey, the results of which were published yesterday, which showed that in Ireland diesel prices are 20% higher on average than the rest of the EU and petrol prices are 11% higher.  I noted the statement of Ann Fitzgerald of the National Consumer Agency that we were not comparing like with like in the sense that the European figures were monthly while the Irish figures were weekly.  However, her own figures show that diesel prices are 9% higher than the European average and petrol prices are 1% higher.  It would be useful to have a debate on this issue as well as a general discussion on prices, as mentioned by Senator Hannigan.  I was interested in the comments of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on this subject.  His suggestion for dealing with the price differential between Ireland and the rest of Europe was to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  Admittedly, this is a perfectly laudable long-term objective, but for people who are sitting in traffic on their way to schools across the country to collect children it is not much of a consolation that the Government&rsquo;s policy is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.</P>

	<P>Last week I was one of the members of a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which visited Malawi.  It was heartening to see the contribution of Irish Aid in that country.  It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 60% of the population below the poverty line.  We saw at first hand the challenges facing the people of Malawi.  I commend the embassy and the non-governmental organisations on their work with these people and the programmes that give them some quality of life in their rural communities.  Because of the recent death of the father of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, this is probably not a suitable time to ask him to attend the Chamber for a debate.  However, will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister of State to come to the House for a discussion on Irish Aid and the work it is doing.  I was very heartened, particularly when we have experienced such a bad time in this country in the past few weeks, to see what happens out there.  It would be worthwhile to have a discussion on how Irish aid is administered and to show the taxpayer that the money is well spent and they are getting value for money.  This would be a worthwhile discussion when we have the opportunity to include it in the agenda.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>With my colleagues, I ask the Deputy Leader to bring the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, into the Chamber, regarding the shameful situation where, while &euro;2.4 million was allocated in the budget for 2006 for a sexual assault unit for Mullingar hospital and the regional hospital in Galway, nothing has happened.  Money was also allocated for Letterkenny but that unit is still closed.  If a woman has been traumatised and raped, there is nowhere for her to go, as a victim, other than to Dublin.</P>
        <P>I put myself in the shoes of an unfortunate woman who has been raped.  What must it be like to get into a car and travel to Dublin?  For her case to stand up she must be forensically examined.  What are we doing about it?  Where is the &euro;2.4 million that was allocated for this purpose?  Doctors and nurses have been forensically trained and I welcome that, but there is no reason this unit has not opened.  Everything is in place and it is poised to open.  The director of the Rape Crisis Centre, Ms Ellen O&rsquo;Malley-Dunlop, said she cannot explain it and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, could not give an answer.  Will the Deputy Leader find out why this unit has not opened?  He should bring the Minister in here to tell us when the centre will open so that women who have been so badly traumatised will not have to go through such a horrific experience?</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the Chamber to have a debate on eating disorders.  I was shocked to hear <Col N="945"/>a discussion on a radio programme this morning by two experts in the field, who will hold a public meeting tonight, which is free of charge, on obesity.  They said it is viewed almost as a norm as we have reached such high numbers and people are accepting it as a regular, ordinary, everyday condition.  We have the highest levels of obesity in Europe.</P>
        <P>I am no stranger to asking for a debate on the other eating disorder, anorexia nervosa.  I have asked, on several occasions, for a debate on the number of ring-fenced beds in the country.  There are only two, while there is none for paediatrics.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, or the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to facilitate us with a debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader for a debate on the Climate Protection Bill 2007, which I introduced to the House in October last year and which still has to resume on Second Stage.  In the justified uproar and protests over the dreadful budget, it may have missed the attention of those in government that last week the UK passed the first binding climate change law.  The new British Act sets a legally binding target for the UK to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050.  It has been welcomed by the majority of businesses there as setting an incentive for them to reduce their emissions and move to low carbon technologies.  </P>
        <P>In a week when the Green Party is seeking a debate on this issue, it would be appropriate to have a further debate on the Climate Protection Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that this Bill was not passed into law before the British Act was passed, but given that they have passed it, it shows that an argument against passing our Bill into law has been removed.  It is clearly possible and practical to pass legislation creating binding targets for reductions in carbon emissions.  It is becoming obvious that we have no option but to do so, or else we will never meet the modest Kyoto targets.  I ask the Deputy Leader for further time to debate Second Stage and, if necessary, to move on to the next Stage of the Climate Protection Bill.  It is vital that we do so, and there is a great deal of support across the parties in this House, and in the other House, for that.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader also for a debate on protections of listed buildings.  In recent weeks we have seen the destruction of two buildings &mdash; a 19th century Methodist church near Croke Park and a 19th century convent in Terenure, for which a developer was fined a derisory &euro;1,000 for illegally demolishing that convent.  There appears to be an absence of appropriate sanctions for developers who demolish buildings illegally and, with the Green Party in Government, it would be appropriate to debate that issue.</P>
        <P>There has been a good deal of misplaced concern expressed in this House about the protection of embryos in terms of embryonic stem cell research.  We might reflect on the real concern we should feel for people we know who have Parkinson&rsquo;s disease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the call for a debate on agriculture.  I accept that substantial progress has been made in the past two decades in the area of agriculture but in regard to the recent budget I have two concerns that I outlined to the Minister recently.  I ask the Deputy Leader for a debate on this important issue, particularly as it relates to the farm retirement scheme.  Currently there are approximately 300 participants nationwide, which is not a large number of people.  They have done their preparation.  Their sons or daughters have completed their education.  In many instances the parents have gone to their solicitor, the land has been transferred, the stamp duty has been paid and they were on the verge of getting paid.  I accept the scheme has only been suspended but a number of hard cases have arisen because perhaps only one third of those 300 farmers, be they male or female, have made their preparation.  Their position should be looked at sympathetically.  Where the sons or daughters have completed the two or three years&rsquo; college training and the parents have decided, in good faith, to transfer the land subject to certain conditions, those cases should be re-examined.</P>
        <P>On the same issue, some of the most severely disadvantaged farmers I represent, and this would apply to areas in the west and south of Kerry, were hit in the same way when the hectarage limit for the area aid payments was reduced from 45 to 34 hectares.  That issue should be re-examined.  It is a small amount of money but it is very important to the most disadvantaged.  I attended a meeting in the Beara Peninsula last night at which I met farmers who on occasion have to bring feedstuffs or other agricultural products from Cork, which is a distance of 100 miles.  Those people are out on a limb and, unfortunately, are the hardest hit.  They are severely disadvantaged, and that has been acknowledged not alone in Ireland for the past 40 years but also in Europe.  Some of these payments are EU backed.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine the cuts sympathetically.  I accept some of them have only been suspended but they are affecting young farmers who are ready to take over their parents&rsquo; farms.  There is a problem in rural Ireland in that young farmers, be they male or female, are walking away from the land.  They do not see a future in farming, and I ask that those who are prepared to take over should be given that chance.  In the past two years the trend has been bucked in that for the first time in the past decade there has been a huge increase in the numbers, both male and female, attending farming colleges.  That is encouraging and we should use that important initiative taken by the young people to try to keep them on the land and keep rural Ireland alive.</P>

        <P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Reilly in making a plea to the Deputy Leader.  I do so in light of the latter&rsquo;s place of birth and what is happening there today, namely, a presidential election.  There are thousands of undocumented Irish in the United States and many of them are under genuine pressure.  In recent days, for example, I received an e-mail from a person who could not return home for his brother&rsquo;s funeral.  The individual in question is not just a statistic.  We are dealing with real people.  In light of the fact that the American people will go to the polls in massive numbers today, I call for a debate on the undocumented Irish and for a renewed effort on the part of the Government, which has the support of those on this side of the House, in respect of them.</P>
        <P>A massive number of new people will be voting in the American presidential election and early voting has proven to be a success.  Will the Deputy Leader request that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to debate how we might transform our electoral system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A good debate on the economy with the Minister for Finance present would solve many of the problems.  It would enable us to examine if there is room within the budget&rsquo;s parameters &mdash; and we must stay within those parameters &mdash; to find savings.  If savings can be found in some budgets, that would be fine.  That is the way to go.  We must do this the right way and invite the Minister for Finance to the House first.  After that, we can invite the Minister for Education and Science to consider what can be done in that area.  That is the way to go.  I take on board what other Members have said but it is important we deal with it the right way, which is through the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the views of Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding 60 Moore Street.  It would be a shame if it was not preserved for the nation, given its historical relevance.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Geraldine Feeney&rsquo;s remarks on anorexia nervosa.  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the House.  It has a serious adverse impact on public health, especially among young people, although also, in some cases, among the not so young.  It is very important.  A number of units must be established throughout the country to treat this condition.</P>
        <P>The Senator also mentioned the obesity report.  Members will recall that a report on that matter was brought forward in the last Seanad.  Obesity is a condition that has particular relevance for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  As a Member of the previous Seanad, I spent two years calling for a debate on obesity and eventually a debate lasting an hour and a quarter was held.  The number of people with type 2 diabetes is phenomenal.  However, the screening for diabetes is not what we would wish.  The Diabetes Federation of Ireland, DFI, has held a number of information seminars throughout the country, including in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s home town of Tullamore and in Mullingar.  That practice should be continued.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to discuss derelict buildings and the dangerous buildings Act?  Many streets of our towns are speckled with buildings that have been left unattended and run down for years.  When the local authority puts pressure on the owners, they apply for planning permission but, regardless of whether they get that permission, they continue to do nothing, as they have for years.  This issue must be examined and an amendment made to the legislation.  I would be prepared to bring that forward but I wish to hear the views of the Minister, Deputy John Gormley.  I am aware that he, like all Members of the House, is concerned about the issue.</P>

	<P>With regard to the statements on broadcasting standards, I propose that the contributions of spokespersons should be 12 minutes and those of other Senators be eight minutes.</P>
        <P>Many Members have called for a debate on education.  The Leader&rsquo;s office endeavours to organise such debates as quickly as possible and to have the relevant Minister present to respond.  To date, there has not been an opportunity for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House.  Efforts are being made to secure the earliest date possible for the debate, and I will repeat the calls that were made today by Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Mullen, Regan, Healy Eames and Buttimer.  A response to the particular issues that were raised should properly wait for that debate.</P>
        <P>A slightly different point was made by Senator Regan regarding private education.  I am not aware of the Government taking a particular decision on private education.  Obviously the difficult decisions that have been made were about how the resources that exist might be used most efficiently.  I would not be opposed to a debate on private education in its own right as there are issues that must be discussed, such as the unintended consequences of universal free fees at third level and the resulting increase in the number of people paying fees for second level education.  One of the concerns that exists about the series of spending curbs in the budget is how education for minority interests might be affected and how that might be looked at again.  I am confident that reconsideration is being given in that area in particular.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald and other Senators, particularly Senator Phelan, asked about legislation in the House, especially with regard to this week&rsquo;s business.  There are two Bills on Committee Stage in the House at present, the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, which is proceeding on Thursday, and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  We will deal also with the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which traditionally follow the budget.  These are very detailed and will take much of our time between now and the Christmas recess.  The publication of the Government&rsquo;s programme for the next session will contain a number of Bills, some of which I am aware of and some of which were the subject of questions from Members on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Norris raised the issue of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.  My understanding is that despite large-scale curbs in both budgets, most of the curbs will result in a shared secretariat between the two organisations.</P>

	<P>The Combat Poverty Agency issue is something I personally consider unfortunate.

We must await events following that discussion.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Leyden raised the airport levy.

	<P>Senator Alex White, Senator Leyden and, to an extent, Senator Hannigan raised the issue of fuel pricing differentials.  Senator Hannigan spoke about the wider issue.  The question on fuel was on foot of the recently released European report which shows that Irish prices are higher than those in other European countries before taxes are applied.  However, Irish prices at the pump are still cheaper than those in other European countries because we apply less tax to our fuel than those countries.  That point should be taken into account.  That is a fact.</P>

Bush, who brought this policy into practice.  The transition of the new president who will be elected in the United States today will take place in January.  I agree that all the measures that have been agreed can only be a gesture, but it is a gesture that reflects large-scale concern about the practice of a policy with which many people in this country do not agree.  That is the reason the action is being taken.</P>

        <P>Senator Mullen withdrew his request for a debate on stem cell research on the basis that he intends to introduce a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill on the issue, which in itself will give rise to a debate.  We look forward to the Bill to be devised by the Senator.</P>

Indeed, several speakers raised issues in the foreign affairs arena, including the need for an international commission of inquiry in Somalia with regard to the recent Sharia law case concerning a 13 year old girl who was raped.  Senator Ormonde asked for a debate on Irish Aid, in the context of the recent visit by her and Senator Hannigan to Malawi.  These issues deserve to be discussed in this House.  We will speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at that Department to arrange a debate on these matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin raised the matter of buying Irish, which he pointed out is difficult to promote without falling foul of European law.  He also pointed out that using this House as a platform to speak about such matters raises awareness among people of the importance of buying Irish goods, particularly in these economically changed times when we need to improve our balance of payments.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy-Eames asked that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment be invited to the House to debate unemployment.  The issue of price differentials, as raised by Senator Hannigan, is also part of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s brief so we will make both requests to find out when the Minister might be able to come to the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the comments of Archbishop Brady today regarding the Civil Partnership Bill.  Archbishop Brady, as a religious leader, has every right to express his views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on what he sees as ideals in society.  However, the Civil Partnership Bill is very much a part of the programme for Government.  In itself, it is a compromise of the positions of both parties in government.  The Green Party&rsquo;s position on civil partnership is stronger than what is likely to be introduced in the Bill.  Nonetheless, it is a development in legislation that will deal with many people in our society who are in partnerships other than the predominant type, that is, religiously recognised relationships or heterosexual relationships.  There is a large number of people in our society for whom legislation must be introduced so that they are afforded equal treatment under law.  It is on that basis that a law will be enacted and I look forward to positive contributions to the debate on the Bill when it comes before the House.</P>

	<P>Senator MacSharry has consistently called for a debate on BreastCheck and, given the concerns about how the programme is operating in the north west, he is justified in continually raising the issue in the House.  The Senator will have an opportunity tomorrow, with the visit of the Minister for Health and Children to the House, although I accept it will not be the perfect opportunity, given that the Minister is due to speak on nursing homes and medical cards.  There were requests for a debate on eating disorders not only from Senator MacSharry but also from Senators Feeney and Glynn, while the latter also called for a debate on diabetes.  Given that the Minister for Health and Children is a frequent contributor to debates here and is always willing to come to this House, all these matters may be the subject of discussions with her at a future date.</P>
        <P>Senators Phelan and O&rsquo;Donovan asked for a debate on agriculture.  There are issues, on foot of the budget, that have caused ongoing concern and that require a response.  The Leader&rsquo;s office has attempted to organise a debate, but the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will be away on Government business next week.  Therefore, the earliest opportunity for such a debate will be the week after next.  As soon as a debate can be arranged, that will be done.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden, to whom I should have referred in the context of health debates, asked why health facilities in Mullingar, Galway and Letterkenny are not operational, which I suspect is due to staffing issues.  A similar situation pertained in an accident and emergency unit in Cork until recently.  The Senator&rsquo;s question deserves an answer but I do not know if the Minister will be in a position to provide one tomorrow.  Nevertheless, we will ask the question on the Senator&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked about the climate protection Bill.  The position of the Government is unchanged in this regard.  We want to see progress in the international debate in terms of the Copenhagen meeting and whether the EU position will be to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20%, as per the current agreement, or 30% if an international agreement is reached in Copenhagen.  It is good to see that the British Government has agreed a Bill, but it is one that is not without flaws.  For example, emissions from aviation and shipping are not covered by that Bill, which is a matter of great controversy.</P>

        <P>Senator Bacik also asked about the protection of listed buildings, which ties in with the request from Senator Glynn for a debate on legislation and regulations as they apply to derelict buildings.  I am aware that a comprehensive new planning and development Bill will come before the House early next year and I hope it will cover issues such as these and give Members of the House an opportunity to discuss how the system is operating.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer suggested that we take heed of what is happening in the United States at present with a view to revamping our electoral systems.  I know this is an issue in which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be very interested in responding to and we will invite him to the House to engage in a debate on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to engage with Senators in a debate on the important issue of broadcasting standards.  I am sure it is influenced by the public debate that has been ignited in recent weeks with regard to certain radio broadcasting events on the neighbouring island and in our own television broadcasting environment.  It is right and proper for us as politicians to review broadcasting standards.  In a sense, however, it is dangerous for politicians to veer into talking about comedy, which in itself is a serious business.  It is difficult to refer to it because, by its nature, comedy should be at the expense of politicians so we should take it lightly and enjoy the mockery or wit that might be applied to us.  However, we have an interest in the quality of <Col N="955"/>broadcasting in our country.  We also have an interest in supporting structures and standards that make comedy easier and that, while it might throw light and humour into our lives, does not cause harm or offence.  It is a difficult area because when one starts to lay down codes for what may be moral issues and defining exactly what is harmful, one is into difficult waters.</P>
        <P>Some of the great moral and religious leaders would have breached all the codes as they smashed up a temple full of money changers.  I am sure that would have gone against a code or two, so we have to be careful.  I am very much taken by Patrick Kavanagh&rsquo;s view of God and the devil.  He said that when he met God the Father in the street, the adjectives by which he described Him are:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">amusing, experimental, irresponsible about frivolous things.  He was not a man who would be appointed to a board, nor impress a bishop or a gathering of art lovers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As a Cavan man, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly will enjoy Kavanagh&rsquo;s description of meeting the devil, using the adjectives:</P>
        <P LI="1">solemn, boring, conservative.  He was a man the world would appoint to a board.  He would be on the list of invitees for a bishop&rsquo;s garden party.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When we delve into some of the issues concerning truth and humour, we should always take Kavanagh&rsquo;s descriptions to heart.</P>
        <P>Comedy is particularly different because, by its nature, it has to take risks and stretch the boundaries of people&rsquo;s credulity and understanding.  I am taken by a quote from Woody Allen who knows something about comedy.  In &ldquo;Crimes and Misdemeanours&rdquo;, he states: &ldquo;If it bends it&rsquo;s comedy and if it breaks it&rsquo;s tragedy.&rdquo;  That may be an interesting quote with which to start our debate.  It is difficult for us to define or set rules or codes as to what is or is not proper comedy.  I imagine that it is incredibly difficult for broadcasters to make such decisions on a day-to-day basis, but that is their task.  Rather than the first test being made on the basis of some legislative, legal or political code, it should probably be one of simple awareness &mdash; is that comedy funny or is it embarrassing?  That may be a simple test of whether comedy is working.</P>
        <P>I suppose broadcasters can only get to that stage when they have a sense of their own self-awareness and can reflect in a proper manner on what they are doing.  It is not done on the basis of a code or what the establishment or anyone else thinks, but a simple human test, asking whether the material is cringe-making or adding to humour and our understanding of life.  That is a difficult matter to legislate for or to proscribe, but it is real.  It is threatened in a range of instances in broadcasting by other instincts, which can get in the way of such simple self-awareness.  It can be distorted by commercialism where the instinct to make a profit through increased advertising might include using shock tactics to get an audience.</P>
        <P>In the end, however, one might not hold that audience if, based on human instinct, the dividing line is crossed between material that is amusing or that makes one cringe.  I imagine, however, that broadcasters must use self-awareness to separate themselves from that commercial instinct and the real quality of what they are doing.  They must separate themselves from a current culture &mdash; what Andy Warhol called &ldquo;everyone&rsquo;s 15 minutes of fame&rdquo; &mdash; and the desire to get on television or radio.  In modern circumstances, that culture could be used by a broadcaster, with such a widespread availability of technology, to use people on television.  While it might fulfil a short-term interest in being on radio or television, in the end it is cringe-making in the way it uses its subject for programming.</P>
        <P>Sometimes there can be mock outrage in our broadcasting system because it is easier to sell on a short-term basis, but it does not meet the self-awareness test that I believe any good <Col N="956"/>editorial team must apply in making programmes.  The real questions must be asked by editorial production teams, rather than by the up-front creative talent, including presenters.  It is they who provide the check against the natural fluctuations in quality of a performer or artist.  It is ultimately up to the broadcasting companies themselves to provide a further editorial check on the talent of a broadcaster.  I do not mean they should act as a censor before the event because broadcasters must be given the freedom to attack the establishment rather than attacking some other establishment that has had its day.  It is appropriate for us to allow those broadcasters act independently in the management of self-censorship on the basis of honest self-awareness rather than a board of any broadcasting authority trying to apply censorship in advance of an editorial decision being made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Structures are being strengthened.  The Broadcasting Authority Bill is a Seanad Bill which will establish a new broadcasting authority.  This new authority is the appropriate vehicle for the after-the-fact checks on broadcasting standards which we may wish to apply to broadcasting.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland was established in September 2001.  In January 2005 it introduced a code governing advertising aimed at children.  In March 2005 it introduced access codes which regulate access for people with disabilities such as audio or other sensory disabilities.  The advertising code was introduced in April 2007.  Crucially, the programme standards code was also introduced in April 2007 and it applies to all broadcasters in the State, both public and independent.  This code deals with a range of issues regarding the treatment of children, whether due care has been exercised in the production of programmes and what are commonly referred to as taste and decency issues which in the future will be referred to as harm and offence issues.  This code will arbitrate on whether a programme has been harmful or offensive to its audience and this audience perspective will be taken into account.  It deals with violence and a number of other issues which would fit appropriately under the programming standards codes.  These codes will be brought within the remit of the new broadcasting authority of Ireland.  We will be seeking new codes to apply to standards of impartiality in<?oasys _jy ?>news and current affairs, such as regulation of party political broadcasting.  Those standards and codes exist although they cannot ultimately provide the real day-to-day test and measure which any commissioning editor must apply as to whether a programme is truly adding to or detracting from our store of human wit and wisdom.  Structures are currently in place for recourse in the case of complaint about a broadcast.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission acts within the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  The public has the right to make complaints about specific programming and seek redress.  One of the advances set out in the Broadcasting Bill is the evolution of that system of complaint which will be managed by the compliance committee of the new authority.  I am trying to introduce real flexibility into the system.  Rather than a loss of broadcasting licence being a sanction against a breach of a code, we are looking for graded measures in conjunction with fines in order that the authority has an interim measure to apply rather than the revocation of a licence as a sanction against a breach of standards.</P>
        <P>I refer to the introduction in the new legislation of a right of reply scheme whereby the public will have the right to write to broadcasters requesting a right of reply should they have been damaged by a particular comment.  If this is not acceptable to the broadcaster, the compliance committee will adjudicate in that regard and make directions accordingly to the broadcaster.</P>
        <P>I believe the structures already in place will be able to ensure the highest quality programming for the Irish audience.  This system of programming standards must be flexible enough to allow a modern-day Paddy Kavanagh who offended many persons in his day around Baggot Street and wider, or to allow the comedian who is willing to say something that may outrage <Col N="957"/>some but presents a real truth which is badly needed to be told.  At the same time a regulatory system is needed to provide some sanction if broadcasters continually or systematically lose the trust of their audience.  In my view, no broadcaster benefits from being harmful and offensive to its audience.  The crucial aspect is a certain sense of self-awareness in a broadcaster as to whether something is either genuinely witty or else cringing.  The ultimate test must be based on a knowledge of the audience and that respect for the audience surely must be the fundamental basis upon which any quality broadcaster survives.  If a broadcaster loses that sense of understanding and respect for the audience, it will in the end lose that audience and this would be the final sanction which rightly should apply to any broadcaster.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his interesting thoughts on the issue, which were made ad lib as he is not relying on a script.  It is interesting to hear his thoughts and philosophical positions and attitudes.</P>
        <P>Discussion of broadcasting standards will obviously include an element of subjectivity and it is difficult to agree on objective standards.  However, we must take into account the classic example of what the reasonable person might consider as acceptable broadcasting standards.  It is fair to suggest that the reasonable person would seek avoidance of open incitement to hatred, violence, exploitative sexual material and graphic depictions of violence or sexual acts.  Those would be inimical to the reasonable person and this is as close to objectivity as we can get in this context.  It is important that when we reach that level of objectivity or we seek to arrive at standards that would be acceptable to the reasonable person, we do not engage in prudery, McCarthyism or such like.  We must be sensible and try to be objective.  I take what the Minister said in regard to broadcasters and entertainers having an internal set of standards and a sense of their audience.  However, there still must be an attempt at objective criteria.</P>
        <P>The broadcasters must give fair editorial treatment to subjects within the context of the freedom of the press.  I refer to the relatively recent &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme where our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, was wrongly pilloried for alleged queue jumping at an airport.  A statement was sent to RTE from the Fine Gael press office, but RTE omitted to broadcast the entire statement and selectively broadcast the statement to the detriment of Deputy Kenny.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission admitted as much in its vindication of Deputy Kenny.  This highlights the need for tighter editorial control and standards.</P>
        <P>I refer to the recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  A Senator on the other side of the House for whom I have great respect, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, raised this matter in the Seanad last week and I supported him.  By any objective criteria, and applying the reasonable person test, the material brought forward by Mr. Tommy Tiernan on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; was inappropriate.  I thought Gerry Ryan did a great job on that show and acquitted himself well.  However, he should have objected or shown a slight level of disapproval, or at least put forward another perspective when Mr. Tiernan make jokes at the expense of Down&rsquo;s syndrome people and Travellers, and about the crucifixion of Christ.</P>
        <P>Jokes about people who have Down&rsquo;s syndrome or about our Traveller community are not appropriate, even applying the Minister&rsquo;s criteria.  The comedian should have an internal checking system and a sense of an audience but in this case he did not use it.  I consider the material he used to be salacious, objectionable and inappropriate if he had any sense of audience in that this was a family show.  It was not a niche audience in a theatre where it might be acceptable &mdash; even that is a questionable proposition.</P>
        <P>The question of standards arises, which is a difficult area.  While policing this kind of thing, we must avoid prudery.  However, as the host of the show, Gerry Ryan would have had a role in at least indicating there is another view which says we should respect these people.  People <Col N="958"/>like Brendan Grace and a plethora of other comedians in this country are hugely successful nationally and internationally without doing that kind of thing.</P>
        <P>A point made by the Minister, which I intended to make myself, was that the Bill &mdash; I was privileged to be involved in its passage through the Seanad &mdash; in a very good way addresses a number of issues with regard to broadcasting standards.  In particular, it provides the right of reply.  Traditionally, an apology went onto a back page and was a postscript months after the event, following an arduous process.  There now will be an up-front right of reply for the offended party, which is important.</P>
        <P>The new broadcasting authority of Ireland will be a one-stop shop for complaints about standards, rather than having disparate agencies dealing with complaints.  This is to be welcomed.  It will be mandatory for the authority to bring forward a code for advertising and programming, which is also welcome.  Interestingly, sections 41 to 43, inclusive, suggest there must be objective and impartial standards in regard to current affairs and political events.</P>
        <P>There is a question around religious advertising which was discussed in the Seanad.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue on an ongoing basis, perhaps by means of a pilot.  I consider the Minister a particularly open and intellectual individual who is capable of recognising that there may be a case for doing something different or new.  For example, there may be merit in advertising events of religious groupings such as the Franciscans or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, perhaps social and cultural events or those that involve charity or good works, or even a call for vocations by a group like the Franciscans or any other religious group.  There is a case for considering the allowing of that kind of advertising and this should not be seen as offensive to objective good standards in advertising and to objective fair play.</P>
        <P>The whole question of religious advertising merits revisiting.  We should have an ongoing pilot examination of this and we should be open to change on these issues.  Once we are not offensive to decency and proper standards, it is worthy of consideration.  The show involving Tommy Tiernan was brought into focus by the issues surrounding Russell Brand, Jonathan Ross and that kind of activity.</P>
        <P>When we consider political objectivity and fair play in politics, it is an arguable and commonly-held view among objective commentators, and a strong view in my political party, that &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; broadcast on the eve of the last general election, which had a very tilted anti-Fine Gael-Labour Party and anti-alternative Government position, was inappropriate in the same sense that the <i>Irish Independent</i> articles on &ldquo;payback time&rdquo; in the 1997 context were an inappropriate abuse of a free press, although that was not a broadcasting issue.  Again, while no one would for a moment suggest the issue of hepatitis was not a critical issue that merited objective treatment and examination, the &ldquo;No Tears&rdquo; programme was calculated, at a particularly late stage, close to the elections, to be damaging to the Fine Gael leader at that time, Deputy Noonan, and to the Fine Gael party.  This kind of behaviour needs monitoring because any political party could become a victim at a given time.</P>
        <P>We must seek reasonable standards.  We must ensure that what we are doing will not distort a situation and give an unfair advantage to any one political party or to the Government.  The Bill in its present form by and large offers good methodology, good fora and a good method of establishing broadcasting standards in programming and in advertising.  This needs to be grasped and implemented.  However, we must be careful that nothing comes across our airwaves that is either objectively detrimental to good standards in our society or salacious in the sense of being discriminatory or prejudicial to the way people, for example, disabled people or ethnic minorities, will be perceived.</P><Col N="959"/>
        <P>My last word &mdash; it should be the last word for us all &mdash; is that we must ensure a free press and a free broadcasting service and ensure there is no political interference or inappropriate interference by sectional and interest groups with regard to the objectivity and fair play of the broadcaster.  At the same time, within the freedom of broadcasters to do their job, there must still be certain objective standards &mdash; the standards of the reasonable person &mdash; beyond which they cannot go.  Our broadcasters cannot be immune to good practice, nor can we as politicians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an Aire.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ag tarl&uacute;.  Lorg m&eacute; &eacute; an tseachtain seo caite.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabhail toisc go bhfuil s&eacute; ag tarl&uacute; chomh tapaidh sin.  I requested this debate last week and I thank the Leader for the expeditious manner in which he responded.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, we spoke on this issue on the Order of Business.  One of the difficulties of speaking on the Order of Business is that one has an eye on the Cathaoirleach all the time, wondering whether one can speak about some issue that is not on the Order of Business.  Very often, important items get lost.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has done a very fine job in endeavouring to instill balance in the debate and, in a nice, poetic way, he has challenged all our views.  This is exactly as it should be.  We are endeavouring to challenge the views of those people who have the power of broadcasting at their backs.</P>
        <P>I recall listening to radio and watching television on my first visits to the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  I found television exceptionally mundane in the States when Irish television was creative, exciting and challenging.  We were proud of that because people visiting from abroad saw it as a reflection of an ancient civilisation, of intellectual property, and it was underpinned by a sense of humanity.  At the same time, we were always conscious that the broadcasting medium was very strong in the hands of anyone because it entered every home.  For that reason, there has to be a degree of monitoring and accountability.  As the Minister rightly said, there is a legislative structure that has been much debated and one which most will agree creates a balance.  It also calls into account responsibility.</P>
        <P>RTE has done a fine job overall.  I do not believe we would have local radio were it not for RTE.  Local radio emerged when RTE sent its outside broadcasting unit around the country, training people in how to prepare radio programmes etc.  I had the opportunity to use that facility in Cashel for a whole week.  Subsequent to that local radio came on stream.  Local radio can be particularly proud of the service it provides.  It is held accountable in the same way as the national broadcasters.  It reflects the community that it serves and is conscious of the values which the community holds deeply.  It also provides an opportunity for people to engage with it almost instantaneously.</P>
        <P>Paddy Kavanagh, the poet, has been mentioned.  Anyone familiar with his life will realise he got short shrift for a long time from those who had the power to recognise the importance of his work.  I am glad he is now back in fashion.  He was very faithful to his own stony grey soil and the philosophy that came with it.  Kavanagh&rsquo;s poetry contained much philosophy.  The Minister was correct in selecting him as an example of comedy that may have crossed the line.  Brendan Behan could be selected as another.  A list of artistic figures could be drawn up who may have crossed the line.  However, they crossed it in a different way from what is being debated here.</P>
        <P>The Minister used two words &ldquo;cringing&rdquo; and &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo;.  I recall watching &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; when a particular comedian, whose name I will not mention, poked fun at the crucifixion of Christ and the nails that were driven into His hands.  It must be remembered the majority of people on this island subscribe to Christianity.  They have very deeply held views and they were hurt when they heard those jokes.  The same was the case with the recent jokes <Col N="960"/>about Down&rsquo;s syndrome children.  One does not have to have a Down&rsquo;s syndrome child to cringe and be embarrassed at jokes about people so vulnerable and helpless.  We must think of their families and how they feel.</P>
        <P>The Irish in Britain were the butt of jokes for decades.  These were not the Paddy Irishman, Paddy Scotsman and Paddy Englishman type of jokes but were malicious with a degree of national arrogance behind them because of the political background and the work situations.  It was embarrassing for the Irish in Britain to attend concerts and shows where these jokes were told.  It was nothing more than racism to typecast people in this manner.  The Irish won in the end because the media came in behind them, which eventually forced legislators to outlaw that type of racism.</P>
        <P>On &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; recently we did exactly the same to our immigrants who we have welcomed into our midst.  I have heard many debates here on how important it is to ensure racism does not prosper in this country.  In a letter in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, Alice Li states she is sick and tired of racism and the manner in which she is subjected to it in Ireland.  At least she was prepared to speak out whereas many immigrants will not do so for the simple reason they feel afraid they will be ostracised for expressing themselves.  To have such jokes on a popular programme such as &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The same happened on that programme in regard to Travellers.  We all know how vulnerable they are as a group and the efforts that are being made to integrate them into society.  To make jokes about Travellers is unacceptable.  This is not a matter for legislation or directives, it is a matter for common decency.  These jokes are not just happening on programmes that are not regarded as comedy.  The people who are making them should put themselves in the place of the recipients of that type of crude humour and see how they feel.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if the name at the end of the letter in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> is genuine, as the person may be afraid to speak out but the letter was certainly genuine.  There are also those of us in public life who are afraid to speak out about the media and the broadcasting service because we think we could be made pay later.  Anyone in the media who engages in such a practice is wrong because they are doing harm to their profession, their service and the loyalty of their viewers and listeners.</P>
        <P>As mentioned by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, under legislation religious advertising is not allowed, and I have raised that matter several times in the House.  I do not understand that as it will not cause offence to anyone.  In the main, it would be a vehicle for improving the quality of life because it is about justice and compassion.  On the other hand, the airwaves are used every day to attack the Catholic Church.  There could be a discussion on the weather, for example, and in some way the priests of the church will be dragged into it.  A balance has to be created which must take cognisance of all the people who are paying for a public broadcasting service.  If it were a private service, the same would apply.  I hope the Minister will rethink the issue of religious advertising because it would not be offensive.  An example of what we are talking about is the debate that took place over whether the Angelus at 6 p.m. should be removed.  The defender of the Angelus was the Church of Ireland, not the Catholic Church.  The point was made that there was nothing wrong with having a minute&rsquo;s silence for reflection at a given time of the day.  No offence was being given to our other churches.  It proved the point that those who start such debates within the media either have an agenda or want to create a controversy.</P>
        <P>I and other Senators know that by discussing this here we might add to the problem.  There is a very thin line between controversy and success in the world of entertainment and the media.  However, if one remains silent one is to some extent accepting what comes across.  If a <Col N="961"/>public representative feels strongly about something he or she should stand up in the right forum and make known those views.  I certainly hope that whatever might come out of a debate such as this and the comments we made on the Order of Business would not add to the controversy and thus contribute in some way to the profile or prominence of the people about whom we are speaking.</P>
        <P>I started my contribution by saying that standards have been exceptionally high.  We have a lot about which to be proud.  At the same time, however, we must be always conscious of the needs and rights of other people.</P>

He is naturally sensitive about matters to do with the Roman Catholic Church.  That is understandable, as he is a devout member.  I am a devout member of the Church of Ireland, and sometimes I feel a bit bruised when I hear the kind of gloating that goes on when some ghastly politicians such as Anne Widdecombe or John Gummer, or even that toothy little creature Blair, who is now so completely discredited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am not deviant in any sense.  I represent the plain people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>We all have little sensitivities, but I do not think broadcasting can be tailored to them.  However, I say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments about the Angelus.  I was one of those Church of Ireland people who objected strongly to being made a cat&rsquo;s paw of by disaffected Catholics who wanted to use us as a ruse to get rid of the Angelus.  I like things that are distinctive about this country and this culture.  The Angelus is part of that and I respect it.  If one is a believer one can stop and say a few prayers.  If one is not, it is only a couple of minutes before the news.  People can go to the lavatory or put on the kettle for cup of tea.  It can be regarded simply as a practical sos, as we call it in the Oireachtas.  I am certainly on message with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
        <P>The Senator also mentioned the impossible impact of this debate.  I can reassure him it will have absolutely no impact.</P>

	<P>This is what is known as a filler.  Since we came back we have had statements on this and that and the other.  Let us be frank about it.  This is in the aftermath of the Russell Brand &mdash; I forget the other fellow&rsquo;s name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was those two clowns who precipitated this debate.  It was a good idea for a filler.  Let us have a look at this incident.  There was an offence, and it was gross.  It was at the expense of that decent man Mr. Sachs, who played Manuel in &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo;.  It was a gross personal insult to him and it was nasty and treacherous &mdash; even if it had been only a private telephone call &mdash; to telephone a person and say in vulgar language that one had enjoyed &mdash; or experienced, as I do not know whether he enjoyed it &mdash; sexual relations with his grand-daughter.  What was the purpose of that except to hurt and to wound?  It was an editorial decision to broadcast this.  The presenters clowned around apparently on the basis that since this was an edited programme, the offensive material would be edited out before broadcast, but it was not.  However, the initial human offence remains, but is limited.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the structure within the BBC, because that is also a problem.  Privatisation and competition &mdash; all these things that have frequently militated against the interest of the ordinary citizen &mdash; come into play again.  Like our own RTE, the BBC has franchised out the making of programmes to independent companies.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The BBC was prepared to pay one of these performers &pound;18 million on a three-year contract.  That inevitably sparked some rivalry or jealousy, particularly in view of the fact that the BBC is slimming down its operations, including the BBC World Service, its foreign language operations and the range of its journalists.  It is looking for a popular market &mdash; the reality TV market.  There is a degradation of standards involved, and jealousy inspired by money.  Naturally, journalists, who are paid a small amount of money and are vulnerable to what our American cousins call downsizing, may have an interest in putting a snag in front of those who are put in such an eminent position.  Thus, there is an administrative broadcasting situation of which we would be well advised to take notice here.</P>
        <P>Those were the facts at the moment the broadcast was made, to be met by almost total silence.  I am not sure if anybody has actually mentioned this yet, but there were two complaints about the programme in the week or so following, and they had nothing whatever to do with the Andrew Sachs episode.  They were about the use of a one-word profanity by Mr. Jonathan Ross.  Enter that paragon of virtue and primness, the <i>Daily Mail</i> group.  The newspaper contacted the agent of Mr. Sachs and then published a large article which acted as a catalyst for all the pent-up indignation of the British middle classes.  It was an artificially created event in terms of the outrage involved &mdash; the kind of thing for which the <i>Daily Mail</i> group is hypocritically responsible all over the joint.  We must bear that in mind.  We must also remember that the BBC, for its own reasons, targets its audiences with particular kinds of material.  A survey was carried out afterwards which investigated the reactions to the programme of people queueing up to go into one of the young people&rsquo;s satirical programmes.  They did not have a bother about it.  The investigators then asked people going into a programme such as the &ldquo;Antiques Roadshow&rdquo; or &ldquo;Songs of Praise&rdquo; &mdash; the kind of thing I watch &mdash; and they were met by considerable indignation.  Thus, we have the problem of the targeted audience.  It was a very nasty thing to do on a human level.  However, the fuss and furore was caused by the <i>Daily Mail</i> and was almost entirely hypocritical.  I would not take too much out of it.  It was a media-created event.</P>
        <P>There are issues to do with language and attitudes.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> health supplement today there is  a very interesting article about the work of two American women scientists who investigated the impact on young teenagers of certain sexual elements in programmes such as &ldquo;Sex and the City&rdquo;, which I suppose is fairly mild, and others.  They appear to have discovered a correlation between a rise in unwanted pregnancy and the highly sexualised context of some <Col N="963"/>of these programmes.  I do not have expertise in this area and I only read an account of the research, but it would be interesting to consider whether there is actually such an effect.  I am not against sexual activity but only against the difficulties it presents to young people.  I do not want to place this in a negative context.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It also might be worth considering the endorsement of violence on certain programmes, particularly on American television, and the devaluation of decent impulses.  For example, let us consider sport.  I used to watch wrestling from Manchester with Kent Walton when the sport was populated by people such as Mick McManus and Giant Haystacks.  It was immense fun.  Then the World Wrestling Federation went to the United States and the ethos behind it was smash and grab, as much fouling as possible, injure one&rsquo;s opponent, deceitfully if possible, and win at all costs.  I was worried about that ethos.  It is the kind of ethos behind the war in Iraq, that might is right.  A message is given to young people.  I do not know how much effect that has, but I am sure it has some.</P>
        <P>There is the question of language and blasphemy.  It is right that certain time restrictions after which certain things can be broadcast.  I listened to a book at bedtime slot on RTE recently where a novel &mdash; I cannot remember the name of it &mdash; was read about life in Cuba.  It was a rich, wonderfully written, human document, was peppered with sexual ideas, profanities and obscenity, and was performed brilliantly by Mr. Frank Twomey from the Cork studio.  I wrote to the Director General of RTE to congratulate him and say this was superb broadcasting, but not something young schoolchildren should listen to.  I could understand the anxiety of parents if they heard it.  It was appropriate to broadcast it, it showed sophistication and humanity, and displayed great acting and production values on the part of RTE radio.  I am happy to endorse that kind of production.</P>
        <P>There is the question of the ways in which the complexities of society are reflected.  I am glad that on RTE radio recently there were a number of plays broadcast which dealt with the experience of the immigrant community.  We can all learn from this.  It was very helpful.  Approximately 18 months ago, I was delighted to hear a very sensitive play dealing with the experiences of a young, working class, gay man in Dublin.  These may be controversial matters, but it is good that they are aired.</P>
        <P>This debate will not be listened to, nobody will pay a blind bit of attention to it, it is plainly a filler but we can reflect on the situation.  It was prompted by Russell Brand and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>A comment was made on the usefulness of this debate.  It is worth noting this Chamber has a history of debating issues of public offence and censorship.  The most famous debate in this Chamber was on the publication of <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> in 1942, which had some of best contributions ever made in a Seanad debate and is a depressing account of Ireland as it was then as most of the contributions reflected an Ireland that was yet to mature.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><i>The Tailor and Ansty</i>, although written by an Englishman who was more Irish than the Irish themselves, is now an established part of our literary canon.  One would wonder how so much heat was caused by such an innocent publication.  The most risqu&eacute; thing in the book was an <Col N="964"/>account of Ansty refusing to have a bed that was bought in the local barracks because it contained a gunnery, which is a risky <i>double entendre</i> but is amusing in its own right.</P>
        <P>I like to think we have moved well beyond that, but we have moved very slowly.  The censorship Acts, which were reformed in the 1960s, had been used over the first 45 years of this country&rsquo;s existence to ban hundreds upon hundreds of books and films.  There was a furore in the 1970s about &ldquo;The Spike&rdquo;, which was not a very good television programme but it excited the nation at the time because there was a naked woman on Irish screens for the first time.</P>
        <P>Whenever my grandmother heard the holy name being mentioned she blessed herself, which is the want of many people who are religiously inclined.  It is a natural reflex.  If she was watching programmes today, like those with Mr. Gordon Ramsey, she would probably suffer from repetitive strain injury.  It is the nature of the world we now live in.</P>
        <P>We must note there have been positive developments.  The film censor has altered the name of his office to the Irish Film Classification Office, and this means we are not deciding what people should or should not see but advising them on the content.  It is necessary to have such controls in television.  We have the 9 o&rsquo;clock watershed and sometimes have a rating system as to whether something is general viewing or otherwise.  We live in a multimedia world where if there is potential for offence to be caused, people are warned in advance and have the option of not watching or switching off.</P>
        <P>I would not like to see the State broadcaster forced to carry certain types of broadcasts and not others.  There is a significant part of the Irish population that have a traditional outlook on life which they feel is not reflected in the programming of the State broadcaster.  That is a more relevant debate.  The issue it is not whether something is or is not broadcast, rather whether the balance achieved by our State broadcaster is reflective of Irish society as a whole.  That is a more real debate we should have.  I hope today&rsquo;s discussion would indicate the beginning of such a debate.  We have such an opportunity with the passage of the Broadcasting Bill 2008 that has already gone through this House, is being discussed in the other House and may return here for final amendments.  It will shape broadcasting policy for a number of years.</P>
        <P>We need to recognise that television, in particular, has become what radio used to be for those of my generation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It is not a matter of watching the one channel that started at 5.30 p.m. and finished at 11 p.m..  Hundreds of channels are available to most consumers and they broadcast to most houses across the country.  The options available are: fair warning of what the content of a programme should be, the ability of people to watch or not to watch television, and the ability of people to watch other television stations.  If those safeguards are in place, the risk of public offence is greatly lessened.</P>
        <P>That said, if we believe in a liberal society where the content for adults should be what they are willing to see and talk about, the real safeguards and controls are needed for children who are not of adult age and need to be protected in certain ways until they are able to make such decisions themselves.  This is another element of the debate that should be progressed.  There is no argument for basing broadcasting standards on the prejudice of anyone who is a mature adult.</P>
        <P>They only thing that should exist in a liberal society is the protection we have for those unable to make adult decisions.  If that is the level of our debate, we will reflect the society in which we live.  If not, we need to take into account certain considerations to put Ireland and Irish broadcasting in a 21st century context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity Senator Boyle is in government and not sitting on this side of the House because I concur with much of what he said.  I am glad we found common ground on that.</P><Col N="965"/>
        <P>With Senator Norris, and with respect to the Minister who has left the Chamber, I believe this debate is a filibuster by a Government that has little to boast about or bring forward to this House.  It is unfortunate that we are debating it in that context.  Nonetheless, the debate is timely.  It comes at a time when we, as a society, are at a crossroads.  We are a more pluralist, multi-ethnic society as against the old conservative, Catholic country in which we all grew up.  We have a choice regarding our outlook.  Do we become liberal or remain conservative?  That is the choice we must make.  The same applies to our broadcasting but, as many speakers said, balance in broadcasting is what we must strive for in a tolerant, modern country.</P>
        <P>An example to be welcomed in that regard is the change in the Irish Film Censor&rsquo;s office, which is now the Irish Film Classification Office.  That is a change for the better and is to be welcomed because censorship does not have a role in Irish society.  It is important that we have controls and accountability and regulation in terms of the Press Council of Ireland, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission or whatever, but as Senator Boyle said, we live in a multi-media world where people now have the ability to change channels and choose the programmes they want to watch.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Bill we debated in this House was important legislation that covered many aspects of broadcasting.  However, the one area where we are lax and over which we must introduce more control and regulation, although I am not sure how we should do that, is the Internet.  The Internet does not appear to be covered in depth in the Bill, although I am open to clarification on that.  As we can see with the reports on the American election today on YouTube or other such social networks, the Internet is shaping the way people receive information.  I am concerned about the way the Internet has been used to transmit various images, video clips or whatever.  Will we be playing catch-up in this area when we should be leading the charge?  Web casting, pod casting and YouTube have become part of the lexicon of my generation, and indeed all generations, but we must examine that and determine how we can better control it.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to religious broadcasting.  We must have respect for our religious tradition and as a member of the Catholic church, someone who goes to Mass and is a person of faith, it is nice to hear the Angelus at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the evening.  I say that as somebody who is a sinner.  I am not a holy Joe, but it is important that we have religious broadcasting.  The biggest mistake RTE made in radio was to move the Sunday morning religious programmes from FM to LW 252.  I do not understand why we could not have Mass on Sunday morning on RTE Radio 1 on the main 90 FM signal.</P>
        <P>I am someone who has respect for the religious traditions of all denominations and it is important that we continue that.  Having worked in local radio and on a voluntary basis in Cork University Hospital radio, I am aware that for many people the transmission of Mass and the rosary is a major part of their day.  It ill behoves us as politicians to condemn people who have that belief.  As Senator Norris said, it is important that we respect each other and are tolerant of others&rsquo; views.</P>
        <P>Tonight we will be able to view the results of the American election on different channels.  Some of us will watch MSNBC, CNN or RTE in comparison to Fox News, which claims to be balanced and fair.  Editorial content is important but competition drives what is happening on our broadcasting media.  That is a concern.  Viewers and listeners are important but I have a concern that franchising out some of the television programming leads to what I would call trashy television.  I cringe when I see some of the people appearing on &ldquo;The X Factor&rdquo;, &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Next Top Model&rdquo; or whatever.  That does not necessarily make good television.  It may be funny but it is degrading at times for the people involved.  It is important that we have a review of those programmes and discuss them.</P><Col N="966"/>
        <P>I wonder if we have gone overboard in trying to be politically correct.  If &ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s Pictorial Weekly&rdquo; was broadcast today, the Members opposite would be lampooning Frank Hall and having a field day against him in the way he pilloried Richie Ryan.  That satire is missing in television.  It is important that we have a good laugh.</P>

	<P>If the Minister of State wishes, we could have a debate on that as well.  It is important that we have a good laugh at ourselves at times.  I appreciate that the item on the programme to which Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and O&rsquo;Reilly referred, &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, on which Tommy Tiernan appeared, was insensitive and wrong.  Equally, what happened at the BBC was wrong, but we go overboard at times in our attempt to be politically correct.  As someone who likes a good laugh every now and again, I believe it is important that we do that but in a way that is tolerant and sensitive to the views of all people.</P>
        <P>I want to refer to the coverage of sport on television.  We are fortunate in this country to have a very good sports broadcasting unit in RTE and TV3.  It is important to pay tribute to people like Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, Ger Canning and Marty Morrissey, who are excellent commentators and who do not degrade players, but there are some analysts who do that.</P>
        <P>One of my bugbears is the new level of political commentator, the expert on the ditch, who comes into a studio and gives his tuppence worth about everything from A to Z in politics.  I have one person in mind but I will not name him because I do not want to give him credit.  He is against everything Fine Gael stands for.  Then there are the people who write columns in newspapers who are now shaping opinion.  They have become the new professors of life.  There are people writing columns in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> who believe they are God&rsquo;s gift to humanity and who try to shape public opinion on everything from the food we should eat, the drink we should consume and the way we should vote.  We must have fair editorial content.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to Joe Duffy.  &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; is one of the best programmes on RTE because it allows people to phone in and give a viewpoint.  Joe Duffy was blamed for the banking crisis, he was unfairly blamed for the liquidity problem and he will probably be blamed for the recession, but we need programmes like &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;.  Local radio has given people access to the airwaves and we should commend that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer has given me my cue because I react against political correctness, even though much of what I intend to say in dealing with this topic will sound like that.  There is much hypocrisy attached to many of the sacred cows that have been developed by certain sections in society who see it as their job to shape everybody&rsquo;s opinion.  I am often surprised at the people who would be self-proclaimed liberals with liberal views but they are far from liberal when it comes to taking on contrary views.  They are liberal while one agrees with them but when one does not, they lose that label of liberalism.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting is an important issue and it is recognised as such.  I listened to Senator Boyle espousing his liberal views on this area, but an &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; philosophy is not what is required.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are in place.  The former brought forward principles relating to broadcasting under the code of programme standards.  This code deals with many issues and shows there is a need for <Col N="967"/>certain standards to be maintained.  Under general community standards, the code states that programme material should not offend against commonly held standards considered acceptable in contemporary Irish society.  The latter brings an element of subjectivity into the debate.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The code of programme standards also states that broadcasters should exercise due care by taking measures to ensure viewers and listeners will be protected from undue offence and harm.  Everybody recognises the need to protect children.  In that context, the code states that broadcasters share a responsibility with parents and guardians in protecting children, that is, those under the age of 18, from exposure to inappropriate and harmful material when scheduling programme material, etc.  The code also outlines content rules to deal with issues such as violent programme material, coarse and offensive language and sexual conduct.  It states that broadcasters in general must have due regard to the appropriateness of and-or the justification for the inclusion of violent content in programme material, with detailed rules pertaining to each category.  We must recognise that broadcasting is influential in the context of shaping opinions and standards within society.  It can be a tremendous force for good or bad and its influence depends on the quality of the broadcaster.</P>
        <P>It was stated that the liberal approach to broadcasting must be confined by ensuring that standards are maintained.  It was also stated that said approach is usually qualified in respect of times when children watch television.  I contend, however, that not all standards are the same from the point of view of how sensible, intellectual or mature they might be.  Psychoanalysis has unearthed ample evidence which illustrates that overexposure to violence, explicit sexual content &mdash; particularly of a deviant nature  &mdash; and racism on television influences people in certain sectors of society.  The genesis of certain serious crimes lies in exposure on the part of those who commit such crimes to influences such as those to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I have not heard it stated for some time but when heavy metal music was extremely popular among young people, concerns were expressed that particular song lyrics influenced certain individuals to commit suicide.  We must be wary with regard to the impact of the influences to which people are exposed.  Such influences can have life-changing, severe and detrimental effects on individuals, on those around them and on society in general.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly made an extremely valid point, namely, that we live in a society where freedom of expression in the media is fundamental to the democratic process.  I subscribe to that view.  During our debates on the Defamation Bill, however, several Members stated that with freedom come certain obligations.  Such obligations are not always observed and in many instances they are abrogated.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer referred to &ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;, a programme which was extremely enjoyable for those of us who were in Opposition at the time but which also had some political influence on the 1977 general election.  Everyone used to listen to &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; each weekend.  It was an extremely funny programme but probably did not have the same political impact as &ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;.  While satire is perfectly acceptable and should be accepted, there should be some way to ensure it does not bring about a shift of the democratic process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The position must be monitored, regardless of who is in power.  After all, democracy can be a fairly tender flower.</P>
        <P>I will not say too much about &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; other than to remark upon the fact that when he appeared, Senator Harris succeeded in winning the debate.  Last week on RTE radio and television programmes, the Minister for Education and Science tried to make a number of good points regarding his position on the budget.  On two occasions, once on radio and later on television, the interviewers involved were more intent on getting their messages <Col N="968"/>across rather than listening to what the Minister had to say.  Is such behaviour appropriate for those employed by a national broadcaster?</P>
        <P>On the controversies that probably gave rise to this debate, there is an acid test as to whether television programme content is appropriate.  Last weekend, I changed channels following the end of a certain programme and came across the &ldquo;Podge and Rodge Show&rdquo;, which was not particularly funny and on which Lee Sharpe, a former Manchester United footballer, was being interviewed.  I rarely see the programme in question but I was shocked by the explicit nature of the content.  I asked someone, whose views I consider more liberal than mine, about the programme and was informed that they did not find it funny either.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to be prudish about this matter.  However, where profanities, expletives or explicitly sexual comments are made on programmes, people should ask themselves whether such remarks would be acceptable if they were at a family gathering or in mixed company.  There is a need to maintain standards.  In my opinion, such standards have been lowered to a significant extent.  The position is similar to that which obtains in respect of the print media, particularly in the context of competition from abroad.  When such competition arises and when standards in other jurisdictions fall, those in this country tend to follow suit.  In my view, the standards of our national broadcaster have fallen considerably.</P>
        <P>The failure in this area does not lie just with the broadcasting media, it also rests with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  When it is instituted, I hope the broadcasting authority of Ireland will address this matter and ensure there will be adherence to some level of standards in the area of broadcasting.  This will ensure the objectives contained in the codes laid down by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland &mdash; for which the broadcasting authority will in future be responsible &mdash; will finally be observed and valued.</P>

	<P>We must exercise great care in this debate.  There is a long tradition of politicians in chambers such as this and elsewhere repeatedly having a go at broadcasters and broadcasting.  We must be extremely careful regarding the way we proceed and not just for the reason outlined by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, namely, that many politicians cannot afford to be critical of the media because the day might come when those in the media might turn the tables and have a go at them.  I am more concerned about the issue of principle.</P>
        <P>Despite what we might like to think, we politicians occupy a privileged position.  What we say in the House is included in the Official Report, broadcast on television and published in the media, and people pay some attention to it. What we say can and often is broadcast, or at least we hope it will be.  Our words are also published in the media and people pay attention to them.  That is a privilege we ought not to abuse or take lightly.  We should resist the temptation, and I am not saying anybody has not done so during this debate, to grab the opportunity to engage in partisan or sometimes even personalised attacks on broadcasters, especially in the political field.</P>
        <P>I was struck by Senator Walsh&rsquo;s comments about liberals.  The word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; has been repeated many millions of times in recent weeks in America &mdash; who is a liberal, who is more liberal, if Senator Obama is liberal and what does &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; mean anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>What is a socialist?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  It is another of those words.  It is often used by people who are not socialist but they have a good view about what they think socialism is or should be and they indulge themselves in that.  To come back to the notion of liberal, Senator Walsh went on to speak about people who wish to shape public opinion on an issue.  Often when that point is made, it is a case of somebody saying: &ldquo;I do not like those people shaping opinions; I would <Col N="969"/>prefer opinions to be shaped by me or somebody who holds my viewpoint on an issue.&rdquo;  It is not an objection on principle but an objection to the person doing the opinion shaping.</P>
        <P>This issue struck me quite often during the debate on a slightly different subject.  It is an analogy worth drawing, although not many Members might agree with me.  During the debate on political censorship and section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, as a broadcaster I was strongly opposed to the section for reasons which Senator Walsh might describe as liberal in the sense that I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  I do not believe broadcasting should ever be permitted to be used for incitement, but we have legislation to prevent that.  However, in terms of the exclusion of views or the expression of views on radio and television, it is necessary to exercise considerable care that we do not leave ourselves open to the accusation that we are simply trying to exclude views with which we disagree from being broadcast.</P>
        <P>This debate is about standards but how do we set the standards?  More importantly, who sets the standards?  I certainly doubt there is a basis for anybody arguing that it should be the Members of this House who set the standards, or is that being suggested?   How does one set the standards beyond which we expect broadcasters not to stray?  That is where the debate is bubbling up at present with regard to the BBC and, indeed, an incident on RTE last week.  I did not hear what the Minister said but I heard some of the responses to his remarks.  It comes down to the question of where the line is drawn.</P>
        <P>Where should one draw the line?  Should the test be whether something that is said on a radio programme offends somebody or is likely to offend somebody?  That cannot be the test.  Very few things can be said that will not offend somebody.  The Cathaoirleach will be familiar with that from debate in this House; there will always be somebody who potentially will be offended by something that is said.  The remark might not be intended to offend but the unintended consequence of what is said, be it a political charge or the expression of an opinion, is that somebody somewhere will potentially be offended.  What is the test?  When one delves into this issue, it is enormously difficult, if not impossible, to decide where the line should be.  It is difficult to be prescriptive about a test.</P>
        <P>How does one ensure standards?  I agree with Senator Walsh that there must be standards; there is no question about that.  However, we must accept that we cannot be prescriptive about them.  There is no manual.  Previously, there were taste manuals for newspapers and broadcasters which one looked up to find out if something was or was not okay.  One looked up the index to find out whether one could say something, to take it to an absurd level.  We cannot do that either because it is absurd.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the only thing one can do, especially in public broadcasting, is ensure the people employed there can be trusted to make these decisions and judgments.  These everyday judgments have to be made on the hoof in live broadcasting and when listening to or viewing material with a view to deciding whether it should be broadcast.  It comes down to the quality of the people employed in broadcasting.  They are people in whom the community should be able to repose a high degree of trust.  It comes down to how one employs people, who one employs and their qualifications, how the culture within an organisation understands the question of standards and decency, and the history and record of that organisation in ensuring and upholding high standards and communicating that to people who come to work in the organisation.  That is the only way one can ensure ultimately that certain standards are set and implemented.</P>
        <P>I did not see the item on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; which, from what I have read about it, was very fairly criticised.  However, like everybody else I saw the clips shown in news programmes last week of the Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross broadcast.  This comes back to the issue of trust and standards.  The biggest problem in broadcasting at present is that a star culture has developed within it.  It is linked to the celebrity culture we have watched develop.  It involves having broadcasters, who are sometimes paid many millions of pounds or euro per year, pur<Col N="970"/>portedly being managed by young, inexperienced producers and researchers who are paid a fraction of their salary.  I am not suggesting this comes down to what people are paid but the dynamic of a relationship between Jonathan Ross or Russell Brand on the one hand and a 25 year old, rookie producer on the other, who is probably on a six, eight or 12-month contract without much sense of where he will be in a year or whether he will have a job, simply does not allow for a proper level of editorial management whereby the culture can be properly communicated to an individual producer and the producer can take on the presenter.</P>
        <P>I worked in broadcasting in this country for ten years.  It might surprise colleagues but there was always a strong culture of editorial management in RTE.  It was never the culture in RTE that the big stars such as Gay Byrne or Pat Kenny were the people who made the decisions and the judgment calls regarding what went on programmes.  When I was first employed by RTE, I vividly recall that one of the questions I and my colleagues were asked was how we saw ourselves dealing with the big stars of the day and whether we would be able tell Gay Byrne whether he could say something.  It is difficult to imagine that young producers would be able to do that but they were trained to do it.  They were trained to make those decisions, and the broadcasters understood this was the system in which they worked, regardless of what they were paid.  However, in the past ten to 15 years that system has broken down.  As a result, a culture has grown up based on the stars and the big names, and the broadcast organisations, most starkly the BBC in recent weeks, do not seem to have a way of coping with it any more.  They are dealing with the problem after it has occurred.</P>
        <P>This is the area on which we must focus.  Instead of thinking we can have a prescriptive approach, we must trust broadcasters and rely on their good sense and good judgment.  To do that, we must re-assert the importance of editorial line management in organisations, regardless of whether it is the BBC, RTE or private broadcasters.  That is the only way to ensure decent standards are upheld.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, it is not difficult to describe what we are discussing; it is common decency.  The problem is that one person&rsquo;s common decency is not necessarily always somebody else&rsquo;s.  How does one navigate this and find the right level?  It comes back to a culture and history of making sound judgments within an organisation.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh said it is a failure of the Department.  I do not agree with that because it should be a very small, if any, part of a Department&rsquo;s role to set itself up as some cultural commissars and tell people in RTE what can or cannot be broadcast.  That is not the role of Government or the Department.</P>
        <P>The standards are put in place and the legislation underpins them.  The Broadcasting Bill is good legislation, which I substantially supported in this House.  It strikes the right balance and has an understanding of the importance of public broadcasting and grants a high level of independence to broadcasters so that they can make the relevant judgments and decisions without Ministers, Department officials, Deputies or Senators breathing down their necks and telling them what they think on matters.  How are we, as Senators, any more qualified to determine what the standards should be?  We are no more qualified nor, with respect, is the Minister or the Minister of State.  The Minister of State has an important job to do and is well qualified to do it, but he is not a cultural or media commissar.</P>
        <P>We should not be too pessimistic about this issue.  An enormous amount can be learned from the standards that were originally put in place in organisations like the BBC and RTE.  The problem is not that there is no history of this being done properly but that it must be brought into the modern age and adopted accordingly.  People&rsquo;s views on what constitutes comedy have certainly changed but from what I know of both of the recent controversial incidents at the BBC and RTE, neither broadcast could be remotely regarded as funny or comedic.  The fundamental problem that the BBC had was that the material was pre-recorded, which is what makes the incident even more strange and unacceptable.  It was possible to listen to the material before <Col N="971"/>it was broadcast, which indicates that there was a major breakdown in decision making, editorial management and editorial judgment.</P>
        <P>This should not be a question of us setting ourselves up as commissars of taste, who lay down the law and decide what should be broadcast because we are users of the broadcast media.  We want to be able to broadcast and communicate our views.  We should not be allowed to be the people who determine the basis upon which different views or perspectives on life are aired.</P>
        <P>This is an interesting debate but we should not get too carried away with our own sense of importance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with some of the points made by Senator Alex White, particularly with regard to responsibility.  In any business, whether it be broadcasting or anything else, if one&rsquo;s name is over the door, one is responsible.  Those in charge in television or radio stations should have the necessary qualifications and should be of the required calibre to make decisions that are correct and proper at a particular time.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and O&rsquo;Reilly referred to religious broadcasting.  A number of years ago, United Christian Broadcasting, UCB, was beaming into this country.  It did a very good job and contributed to the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The company sought a licence but was refused.  I see nothing wrong with religious advertising or broadcasting of the Angelus.  Many people still believe that religion stabilises society and I am one such person.</P>
        <P>Many contributors referred to comedians and other entertainers appearing on television programmes and Senator Boyle made the point that adults should be able to make decisions on such programmes.  However, we all know that in most homes now there is a television in every room.  Children are often watching different programmes from the ones being watched by their parents.  Some time ago a comedian appeared on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and gave an explicit account of how he had performed sexually the previous night, including referring to putting chocolate on bodies and so forth.  Who wants to listen to that?  I do not see anything funny about that.</P>
        <P>RTE and TnaG do a good job, by and large, and the broadcasters we have are as good as one will get in any part of the world.  However, while I do not wish to cast aspersions on all broadcasters, I have had complaints from business people regarding the behaviour of some, particularly those who work for the national station.  Some such people have their own production companies and are selling television or radio programmes to the national broadcaster, which is not a good idea.  However, I am not saying they are doing anything wrong.</P>
        <P>In other situations, broadcasters do work outside their normal jobs, for example, opening shops or restaurants, for which they receive payment.  It has been pointed out to me by people in similar businesses that this is unfair and uncompetitive because they cannot afford to pay so-called appearance fees to such people.  Furthermore, the broadcasters often refer, at a later stage, to the beautiful restaurant or shop that they visited recently, thus providing such businesses with free publicity.  This is something that should be examined if we are to apply standards across the broadcasting arena.  There is potential here for a conflict of interest, although I stress I am not accusing anybody of same.</P>
        <P>Occasionally on radio programmes presenters refer to text or telephone messages received, but they do not give names or an indication of identity of the sender or caller.  In some instances, the contents of such messages could destroy people&rsquo;s characters or businesses and do a lot of damage.  This is something which must be examined because it is potentially very serious.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the sports department in RTE, which provides excellent sports coverage.  Two of our greatest sports people work in that department, namely Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh and Jimmy Magee.  The latter is a legend who has a great knowledge of all sports, includ<Col N="972"/>ing car racing, horse racing, boxing, polo, rowing and so forth.  His knowledge of sport is unbelievable and it is probably safe to say he is one of the best commentators in the world.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said that sometimes politicians are afraid to speak about the media and those involved in broadcasting because we believe if we speak in a negative way about them, they will come down on us, will not give us coverage or will do us damage.  I agree with that point because it has been said to me that one should watch what one says about RTE, Newstalk and so forth because they might not do one any favours in the future or might even dig up something on one.  I have been told to be very careful in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the issue of entertainers and comedians, to which I referred, it is outrageous that comedians insist on imitating people with disabilities, cripples and so forth.  It is not acceptable and it is not funny, particularly for those with disabilities and their families.  Senator Alex White made the point that what is offensive to one person might not be offensive to another, which is true.  I am not particularly sensitive and neither is a number of Senators, but the comedy to which I refer goes a step further than sensitivity.  It is degrading, demoralising and far more than simply offensive.  It is akin to what was said in Hitler&rsquo;s time, that anyone who has a disability should be shot, that they do not belong in this world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Having listened to the debate it seems it is difficult to get the balance right.  I do not pretend to know the answers concerning broadcasting standards.  There are certain types of programmes on the air of which I do not approve, but which I could not possibly ban.  For instance, I find it difficult to see rape portrayed on television.  Such portrayals contain a level of violence which I find hard to tolerate and I would not watch such programming.  However, that is not a standard which could be applied or used to prevent broadcasting such as programming.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Ryan, used the word &ldquo;appropriateness&rdquo; in his speech, and this raises an important issue.  Consider that there was a time when the Catholic church wanted jazz banned from the airwaves on the basis that it was the devil&rsquo;s music.  That was only some decades ago.  One must work through a person&rsquo;s point of view to find out how he or she forms a decision.  A significant benchmark for jokes is that they should be humorous.  It is appalling that people would make jokes about a person&rsquo;s disability as it goes against the spirit of legislation, but perhaps I am just old-fashioned.  It is like kicking a man when he is on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my view and there is no place for it in society.  I suggest not so much that such programming should be banned, but that it should be singled out as something which the community does not accept and that we should not make jokes about the weakest members of society or some disability with which such people are born or must cope.</P>
        <P>When it comes to the portrayal of sex and sexuality on the screen there seems to be different rules.  Paedophilia is outlawed and it is a crime to broadcast it.  However, pornography, which may not be quite as bad since it deals with adults, can involve exploiting, using and abusing men and women.  However, we appear to have no difficulty in addressing such matters.</P>
        <P>Several Senators spoke about the importance of satire and it is healthy to have it in society.  Reference was made to such programmes in the past as &ldquo;Ballymagash&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; which provided entertainment.  Satire is good and necessary and it is healthy for political life.  Political figures should accept it goes with the job.  However, accepting satire does not mean dropping all standards.  For example, the way in which some people in the media, public life and phone-in shows have spoken about political figures has made me cringe over the years.  I can provide many examples.  I recall advertisements in recent years that referred to Deputy <Col N="973"/>Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, for which Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary was responsible, and which were distasteful, to say the least.  On another occasion the images of the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform were presented as racist in newspapers.  Such advertising is appalling.  There were advertisements in which the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, was accused, among other things, of being racist.  She was publicly humiliated by what I believe was the incorrect portrayal of the treatment of her mother in hospital and jokes were made about her weight also.  A line must be drawn somewhere along the way.</P>
        <P>I dislike the use of the word &ldquo;taste&rdquo; which seems so precious and I do not use the word in that sense.  Public figures should be robust and should take, encourage, welcome and not object to robust criticism.  However, the way in which we allow for this is important.  The same applies to access radio.  I disagree fundamentally with the comments of many of the previous speakers about the merits of access radio, much of which is horrible.  It involves ordinary people phoning in and saying whatever they wish.  These comments go unchecked and unchallenged, without any requirement to back them up or name their source, which is not good for society.  While I am in favour of access to radio, if a person puts forward a point of view, the person on the other side has a responsibility to challenge that and make it stand up, which does not happen at the moment.  I do not listen much to phone-in shows anymore because the format allows people to run riot.</P>
        <P>Malicious or libellous comments or those which represent an incitement to hatred or discrimination or to break the law are easy to deal with and we are aware of the position in such cases, but the case of blasphemy is not so simple.  I would not normally make a case for the Catholic church but I believe, given the way in which western society has changed, it is more acceptable to blaspheme the Catholic church than Islamic beliefs.  There is no balance in the matter.  If people hold something precious it should be respected, whatever their religion.  The Catholic church has taken a hiding and a pounding and if this were done to other churches it would be unacceptable, which is worth examining.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not privy to how decisions are made in RTE.  I recently spoke to a survivor of the Miami Showband massacre.  We have all heard the story and seen the investigations.  I believe there was collusion involved and that the band was set up, but that is my view.  That case rocked Ireland 33 years ago.  In recent years there has been much discussion of the matter.  People tried to reopen the discussion and a book was published.  I spoke with some of the people involved in the case in recent times and they could not understand why they were refused access to &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  My instinctive response to that was to take the view that &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; is a different type of programme with its own remit that has proved capable over the years of opening up discussion on many issues which other programmes did not discuss.  It has pushed back the boundaries in many ways.  However, these people explained to me that they found it impossible to accept the refusal.</P>
        <P>Mr. Michael Stone killed people in Milltown graveyard many years ago.  In more recent times he came to prominence again by trying to attack people in Stormont.  He was an invited guest on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, which could not attain a balance on the matter and it is reasonable to ask the reason for that.  I am certain there are reasons for such decisions.  However, those people were confused and bewildered, because there was no coverage of something as close to the people as the massacre of the Miami Showband following the publication of a book on the matter, which is interesting.  I am not making a judgment on whether the show was right or wrong, but we must examine the matter.</P>
        <P>The question of how we treat opinion formers is important.  It is also important to be aware of a person&rsquo;s point of view and background.  I do not object to people with biased views appearing on panels.  It is in order as long as viewers or listeners understand such a person&rsquo;s background or point of view.  However, there are situations where people purport to be neutral <Col N="974"/>commentators, but come with a good deal of baggage on their shoulders.  Will the Minister consider that it is a question of balance which society should require?  It is not acceptable for a person to ring in to access radio and attack a person in public or private life without being challenged to back up assertions.  We must make space for satire, public comment and political criticism.  Any censorship must ensure that the media can educate, entertain, inform and, above all, be balanced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate relating to the standards in Irish broadcasting.  It is interesting to hear different viewpoints and angles.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The changing audiovisual media landscape makes this debate particularly pertinent at this juncture, not least because the Broadcasting Bill 2008 will be further debated in the House during the coming weeks.  On examination, we find society has changed.  What is acceptable today might not have been acceptable a few years ago.  The use of language changes and what is appropriate in this House or on television may not be appropriate in other situations.  A few years ago, I had the pleasure of visiting the Parliament in Australia.  Reading some of the debates there, I know that some of the language used would not be tolerated in this House.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>This is all about creating standards and there is a certain expectation of this.  I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1989 and in my first speech the Leas-Cheann Comhairle interrupted and said he believed that I was making my maiden speech in the House and that he wanted to wish me well.  I said that he was right, that I was about to lose my virginity.  When I read the record of the debate some time later, something completely different was written.  I obviously used language that was not seen as acceptable, even though I thought I was making my point quite clearly.</P>
        <P>Our expectation of what is appropriate on television is different from what it used to be.  The programme that most Irish families watched some years ago was &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  One of the highlights was the night that Benjy managed to kiss Maggie.  Everybody was talking about it because it was the big issue.  Kissing is very much part and parcel of television these days and it would only raise an eye when someone is kissing some woman that he should not be kissing.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting services, particularly public service broadcasting, have always been recognised as having a central role in society that justifies the application of specific rules to these services.  The broadcasting protocol to the Amsterdam treaty puts this succinctly when it states that public broadcasting is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of society and to the need to preserve media pluralism.  The recent audiovisual media services directive notes that audiovisual services are having a growing importance for democratic societies by ensuring freedom of information, diversity of opinion and media pluralism.</P>
        <P>That policy in the broadcasting sector must safeguard certain public interests, including the protection of minors, consumer protection and cultural policy.  I agree that there is a time and a place for everything and sometimes that time or place might not be on television.  That is why we have the codes and rules that take a fair and balanced view of what is and is not acceptable.  The codes and rules have been drawn up with considerable public input and they achieve balance and proportionality, ensuring that diversity is not curtailed and the right to information is not stifled and that media pluralism is respected.  As Senator White said, we are not in the best position to make judgments on what those rules should be.</P>
        <P>The protection of minors is very important.  Section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2001 gave the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland responsibility to develop a broadcasting advertising code and it specifically dealt with children&rsquo;s advertising.</P><Col N="975"/>
        <P>Mention was made of the importance of freedom of expression, but it is all about trying to strike a balance.  In recent times, coverage on the television has been all doom and gloom, so comedy is well received.   Comedy often pokes fun, exposes hypocrisy and confronts cultural taboos. This freedom of expression in the media is fundamental and we should not be hasty or reactionary in our response to issues that arise now and then and that can be satisfactorily resolved through the independent regulatory process that has been established for this purpose.  The process is best carried out independently, impartially and in the cold light of day, as is done by the mechanism that we have put in place and that will be continued under the Broadcasting Bill 2008.</P>
        <P>That is not to say that performers, presenters, editors and producers do not have to exercise good judgment, sensitivity, responsibility and perhaps a good helping of common sense in deciding what should be aired and indeed, in many instances, what might better be consigned to the editing floor.  The codes and rules developed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland provide for comprehensive guidance in these matters.</P>
        <P>The debate about what is acceptable in the broadcasting arena has concentrated on people who have caused offence on television recently.  However, we should acknowledge the tremendous talent we have produced in the entertainment industry in Ireland, especially those who provide great laughs and fun without having to resort to smut.  In years gone by, Maureen Potter was the best at doing that, and in recent years Brendan Grace has been able to strike a balance so that whether it is a grandmother or grandchild watching a programme, they can all enjoy the contributions made by those people.  The independent regulatory structures, already in place for the administration of these codes and rules, have served us well in the past and continue to work effectively in this regard, and they will be strengthened in the Broadcasting Bill 2008 which is currently before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the contention of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that it is not all about regulations and broadcasting standards, but rather is as much about broadcasters maintaining their moral compass.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly made the point that the Broadcasting Bill 2008 puts a balanced framework in place for the maintenance of broadcasting standards.  I acknowledge the Senator&rsquo;s contribution to the Bill&rsquo;s passage through this House.  Senator Boyle is correct when he states that public service broadcasters need to serve all audiences, which is the essence of good public service broadcasting.</P>
        <P>Senator White&rsquo;s contribution was very interesting, in light of his experience in broadcasting.  He referred to the phrase about common decency, but common decency, like common sense, is unfortunately not as common as people think.  I also thank Senator White for his support of the Bill and for his contribution.  Senator Buttimer referred to the regulation of the Internet.  This falls outside the scope of the Broadcasting Bill 2008.  It is a very complex issue.  How do we regulate the content contained in the computer server located outside the European Union?  The key issue is expectation.  People have very high expectations of broadcasters, but they do not have the same level of expectation of the content of websites.  Our effort is to ensure that broadcasters do not breach the trust of their audience.  I thank all Members for their contributions.  They were constructive in what they had to say.</P>
        <P>The new broadcasting authority of Ireland<b> </b>proposed under the Broadcasting Bill 2008 will consist of the authority itself and two independent statutory boards, which are the contracts award committee and the compliance committee.  The compliance committee will have the separate role of ensuring that all broadcasters, be they public or private, comply with their licence conditions and with the standards set out in the broadcasting codes and rules.  The Bill retains the structure of the existing broadcasting codes which were developed by the BCI.  These are the children&rsquo;s advertising code, the access code, the programme standards code and the advertising code.  The Bill also allows for the BAI to create additional broadcasting codes, particularly on objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs, and on privacy.</P><Col N="976"/>
        <P>I thank Senators for contributing to the debate on this important issue.  Many of the comments expressed were very interesting and have certainly given us food for thought as we proceed with the Broadcasting Bill.  We will continue to examine this issue in the context of the Broadcasting Bill.  If Members have further ideas, they will have ample opportunity to express them at a later stage.  I thank all Members for their contributions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leat, a Chathaoirligh.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter.  The budget has a habit of unearthing different issues, one of which is the imbalance in the taxation of air passengers in regions outside Dublin.  I am talking predominantly about Cork.  The budget undermines the aviation industry at a time when, as I hope the Minister of State realises, that industry and our airports are facing a difficult climate.  Airports have been graded separately in respect of the forthcoming travel tax.  This applies to Cork, Shannon, Knock, Dublin and other airports.  The yield from this tax does not justify the imposition of a levy on departing passengers, especially from Cork Airport.  I know the Minister of State does not like to use the terms &ldquo;U-turn&rdquo; or &ldquo;flip flop&rdquo;, although I heard him saying so on the radio last week.  I hope, however, the Government will acknowledge that Aer Lingus is in trouble with its unions and is trying to make money.</P>
        <P>In addition, Ryanair posted disappointing figures today.  Equally, the policy of separating Dublin and Cork airports has not happened, while the Cork Airport Authority has no chairperson and there are three vacancies on the board.  This unfair &euro;10 tax is a harsh imposition on all departing air passengers, especially the people of Cork.  People in Cork, Shannon and Knock are being told that they are different from people in Dublin, but is that right?  This ill thought-out tax is being imposed on the regions.  The Minister of State strongly supports his region so I find it hard to understand why we are telling people that Ireland ends at the Red Cow roundabout.   As a result of this tax, we are back to the Pale that we fought for so long to get rid of.</P>
        <P>Although it is not within the remit of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, I have serious concerns about the Government&rsquo;s general aviation policy and the way in which Cork Airport and the people of Cork are being victimised.  Why is there no such taxation on private airports?  Why is the Government jet not taxed, as well as the passengers using it?  If they are taxed, the Minister of State should say so here.  Are they taxed when they leave the country by air?</P>
        <P>This proposed levy adds to the woes of our airports at a time of economic recession.  We are penalising airports and passengers, which is a further harsh blow for our hard-pressed aviation industry.  I travel a lot by plane to Dublin, but one could have driven a bus through Cork Airport last week.   At times, one could land a jumbo jet on the concourse there.  Rather than trying to dumb down our airports, we should try to attract people here by marketing our airports better.  Why was this travel tax deemed to be necessary?  Why was Dublin given preferential treatment?  What can we deduce from this budgetary levy regarding our attitude to regional development?</P><Col N="977"/>
        <P>The Minister of State should announce a U-turn or a flip flop on this measure tonight.  On behalf of the people of Cork and other regions, I will accept whatever language he wishes to use.  It is a matter of principle to look after our own areas.  As the Minister of State knows, life does not begin and end at the Red Cow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who is very happy to use Cork Airport when I have the opportunity to do so, I pay tribute to its efficiency.  I am pleased to take this opportunity, as presented by Senator Buttimer, to clarify the introduction of an air travel tax that the Minister for Finance announced in the budget, which will come into force for passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance answered parliamentary questions on this issue recently.  As he stated previously, the general rate applying will be &euro;10 per passenger, with a lower rate of &euro;2 for shorter air journeys, that is, those not in excess of 300 kilometres.  The Minister decided that a relatively short air journey should reflect a lower charge.  It is not unusual for the price of fares for longer journeys to be higher than those for shorter journeys and the tax reflects that position.  The Minister was also conscious that the tax would apply to both the outward and the return journeys in respect of domestic flights.  In addition, the Minister was cognisant of the greater competition that exists from other forms of travel for that sector, relative to longer flights.</P>
        <P>The structure of the new air travel tax benefits regional airports that operate flights to Dublin, where a tax of only &euro;2 will apply.  The Senator might wish to note that this is particularly important to Cork.  For example, today, ten of the 31 departures of passenger aircraft were destined for Dublin.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in applying a tax on air travel.  Many countries worldwide, and indeed within the EU, apply similar taxes.  Our nearest neighbour, the UK, has applied a similar tax for over 20 years, at a rate of &pound;10, or &euro;12.65, for a standard ticket for any destination in the UK or Europe.  For all other destinations the rate is &pound;20, or &euro;25.30.  Both of these rates double for tickets other than economy class.</P>
        <P>A new Dutch aviation tax entered into force in July this year.  The tax is charged at &euro;11.50 for EU destinations and &euro;45 for other destinations.  In France the civil aviation tax is charged at approximately &euro;4 for EU destinations and &euro;7 for other destinations.  The Belgian Government recently announced its intention to introduce an air travel tax, but the details are not yet available.  Going further afield, Australia and New Zealand, which, like Ireland, are very dependent on air travel, also apply departure taxes.</P>
        <P>The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared with rates in other countries.  Taking the UK as an example, a person travelling within the UK will be liable to pay the UK air passenger duty of &pound;10, or &euro;12.65, on each leg of the journey.  A passenger departing from Manchester to London will be subject to the &pound;10 tax and on the return journey, departing from London to Manchester, that passenger will also be subject to the &pound;10 tax, giving a total tax liability of &pound;20, or approximately &euro;25.  In Ireland, a person travelling within the State will be liable to pay &euro;2 in tax on each leg of the journey, giving a total tax liability of &euro;4.  It is scarcely the cost of two hours&rsquo; parking in most city centres.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, both the UK and Dutch rates in respect of longer flights are over two and four times higher, respectively, than the Irish rate.</P>
        <P>The Government acknowledges that low cost travel has been good for Ireland.  The pioneers in this area deserve to be commended.  However, in analysing the new tax, we must not overplay its impact.  For illustration purposes the House may wish to note that at present a fare from Cork to London Stansted that is initially presented as &euro;5 with a similar &euro;5 return fare will cost <Col N="978"/>a passenger &euro;80 when all charges are included.  This assumes no luggage is checked in, which would cost more.  Included in the &euro;80 is a &euro;5 credit card handling fee per flight segment.  This latter practice has been the subject of much criticism by consumer bodies.  Assuming fares remained the same, the price of this trip would rise to &euro;90 on foot of the new tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person flying from London Stansted to Cork, or indeed from any airport in the UK to Ireland, already pays, through the airlines, &pound;10 or &euro;12.65, in air passenger duty to the UK Exchequer.  Airlines do not appear to have any difficulty in applying the UK air passenger duty.  I have seen no suggestion that they intend to curtail their services because of it.  I am not convinced that the new tax would have a dramatic effect on passenger levels and the suggestion by some that the tax would see fares double for prospective passengers does not present the full picture.  In any event, for visitors to Ireland the price of travelling to and from Ireland is only one of the costs they will consider before choosing their holiday destination.  General price levels and the availability of reasonably priced quality accommodation will be just as important.</P>
        <P>It is important to add that the recent spate of failures in the airline sector arose from the massive spike in oil prices.  Price pressures are subsiding and fuel costs, which had increased to as much as 50% of some airlines&rsquo; cost base, are falling dramatically.  Airlines benefit from an international tax exemption on jet fuel.  The extent of this benefit is illustrated by pointing out that tax as a percentage of the price of a litre of petrol is up to 60%.</P>
        <P>The new tax is estimated to yield &euro;95 million in 2009 and &euro;150 million in a full year.  In the context of the difficult fiscal position the Government now faces, this measure is necessary and not unreasonable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a brief supplementary question.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I am not convinced.  He stated that ten out of the 31 flights departing Cork are headed for Dublin, and he is correct, but many of those flights are going to onward destinations.</P>

    <Title>Schools Building Projects. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his forbearance in allowing me to raise this issue, which is important for a small number, relatively speaking, of students and parents in my area.  Monreagh national school outside Carrigans in County Donegal was established in 1852 and there are not too many schools like this still in existence.  It is a small, bungalow-type school sitting beside what would have been an old narrow country road but because of its geographical location on the border with County Derry it has become a very busy road.  Many Derry people have come to the area to build in the rates-free Donegal Border area.  There is a lot of traffic and activity on the road.  </P>
        <P>I have put down parliamentary questions since 1999, if not earlier, about the need for renovations to Monreagh school, never mind the development of a new school.  There have been questions as to whether Monreagh would be given a new school and a decision was taken in 2001 to build a new school, but that has not materialised.  To date, four sites have been explored and for one reason or other they have fallen through.  A site is currently being considered by the Department and I know that budgetary constraints will be a consideration.</P>
        <P>My reason for raising this matter in the House is that the future of the school depends on certainty.  We thought we had that certainty in 2001 when it was decided to build a new school on the site.  This is a tiny school with 20 to 23 students, some of whom are disabled, but generations of people have attended the school.  The uncertainty as to whether it would be amalgamated with another school or whether a new school would be built has caused many people who might have sent their children there not to have the confidence to do so.  I want to <Col N="979"/>deliver the message that the building of a new school on the site would lead to the school being regenerated.</P>
        <P>This is a little Protestant school in a rural area and the threat of it being amalgamated in another area would mean that the community would lose a certain ethos.  This school could be the foundation stone for uniting the new community in that rural area while maintaining the rural fabric of the area.  One of the difficulties is that it is a small, single storey school beside the road with a small car park which doubles as a playground.  However, it is neither a car park nor a playground because it is also the driveway into a farmhouse.  The reality is that because the school shares its only safe space, there are natural conflicts between what is suitable for children and the work of a farm.  A meeting was held a number of months ago in the school.  A health and safety audit was undertaken by a consultant, the results of which are blunt and bland and which show that the school site has the potential for serious trouble in the future.</P>
        <P>This is not a major building programme of an eight to ten-teacher school for 500 or 600 pupils.  It is a small project but it is very important and unique because of its smallness and special status.  We are trying to maintain and expand the rural fabric.  I refer to the policies of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the CL&Aacute;R programme to keep people in their own area.</P>
        <P>The principal teacher of the school, Evelyn Buchanan, may be near retirement.  She has driven the project and I know nobody would be more proud than she would be to see her children and the parents of those children whom she taught through the years getting a safe educational environment.  The standard of teaching is excellent in the school but the constraints under which they must work are not suitable for this day and age.  While it may hold a national record for being a school established in 1852 and while the teachers may not want to move from where they are, it is now 150 years later and this school is not suitable for 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the current position in regard to the specific difficulties and solutions for acquiring a site for Monreagh national school, Carrigans, County Donegal.</P>
        <P>At the outset, the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, would like me to clarify that modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme to almost &euro;600 million this year.  The expected completion in 2008 of 67 large scale projects at primary level and 19 projects at post-primary level will benefit more than 18,000 students, and construction work on 150 devolved projects will provide an additional 8,000 permanent places in existing primary schools.  The Senator also will be aware that in September the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, announced a further tranche of 24 large-scale projects to progress to tender and construction.  This year has also seen a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas, with the construction of 26 new schools under the fast track off-site construction programme.</P>
        <P>This is an enormous programme of work by any standards and, while there will continue to be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also deliver improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will continue to be on new schools and extensions to provide additionality in rapidly developing areas.  The programme will also enable the <Col N="980"/>purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the schools building programme but, again, with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>In regard to Monreagh national school, the Office of Public Works, which acts generally on behalf of the Department in regard to site acquisitions for schools, was requested to source a suitable site in June 2001.  The OPW advised the Department that on foot of advertising it had identified a number of sites which were inspected by its regional architect and four were eventually selected for further consideration.  One of these sites was identified as the preferred option and, in November 2004, the Department instructed the OPW to open negotiations on this site.  The acquisition of this site was almost complete in September 2006, when, however, the OPW advised my Department that the vendor could not offer good marketable title to the property.  Consequently, the Department instructed the OPW to re-advertise.</P>
        <P>The school authorities recently approached the Department with a proposal in regard to an alternative site.  The Department is currently arranging for a technical assessment of that site&rsquo;s suitability.  If the site is deemed to be suitable, the next step will be to acquire the site.  Clearly, closure of the acquisition of the site will be dependent on the availability of the necessary capital funds.  At this stage, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the acquisition of the site.  However, once a site has been acquired to construct a new school, the project will be considered for progression in line with the band rating assigned to the project and the availability of the necessary funds.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the site acquisition for Monreagh national school, Carrigans, County Donegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make two points.  As the Minister of State is aware given his statement, there is a history going back to 2004 with regard to the acquisition of this site.  I would ask, first, that the process be expedited and the site investigation undertaken.  The site was nearly purchased in 2004 but it is now nearly 2009.  The need is five years old or older.</P>
        <P>Second, this area could well be a developing area given that there are many new houses there.  I would guess that many of the children from those houses are using an address in Derry in order to go to school there.  While I stand to be corrected on that, there is a current issue with regard to &ldquo;grannying&rdquo;, on which there have been recent court cases.  Should the North determine that Donegal residents must send their children to Donegal schools, we could have an instant need and a rapidly developing area.  There are many houses in the area but the usual number of children is not coming forward for schooling.  If this is not happening now, there will be a number of children wishing to attend that school in the future.  While we are confident we have the numbers in any case, this is being prioritised as a developing area and we could reach that situation very quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving that additional information to the House.  I will ensure it is considered by the schools building section.</P>
