	<P>I have notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give final approval for the immediate construction of a new primary school at St. Mary&rsquo;s, Virginia, County Cavan as a necessary response to long-term chronic overcrowding of existing buildings and prefabs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the provision of a new second level school at Kinvara, County Galway and, in particular, the progress that has been made on site acquisition.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call on the Leader on today&rsquo;s Order of Business, there is a matter from the business of Tuesday, 22 April 2008 which I wish to dispose of before I commence today&rsquo;s proceedings.  Senator Jim Walsh has given me notice that he wishes to give a personal explanation.  Before I call the Senator, I want to make it clear that I will not allow debate on this matter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to my comments on the Order of Business on Tuesday, 22 April 2008, I wish to say that it was never my intention to offend anyone.  Indeed, as the words &ldquo;as shop stewards&rdquo; and &ldquo;extracting&rdquo; are deemed to cause offence, I am happy to withdraw them.  </P>
        <P>As a constitutional republican, I fully respect the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas and have done so for all of my political life.  However, this does not deprive me of a right to express fair and reasonable comment in the public interest.  The enormous cost of tribunals has been a concern of mine for many years.  My consistent criticisms are well-documented in this House and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I refer to an exchange of recent correspondence between myself and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which clearly substantiates my <Col N="354"/>serious concerns about this matter.  It is my intention to make available a copy of that correspondence to Senators so that they can better understand my position.</P>
        <P>I assure the Cathaoirleach and the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann that if I breached Standing Orders, it was not my intention to do so.  Lest I have given the impression to the contrary, I would like to clarify that I have absolutely no argument in accepting the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s impartiality in the manner in which he dealt with me on this matter.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on tourism and  No. 2, statement by the Taoiseach on the Good Friday Agreement and the Lisbon reform treaty.  It is proposed that No. 1 will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.20 p.m. and during which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes, Senators may share time by agreement of the House and the Minister shall be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons; and No. 2 to be taken at the conclusion of No.1 and to conclude not later than 2.45 p.m.  The business of the House will be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.  Item No. 2 will be the final visit to the House of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I ask all Senators who can be available to be in the House to acknowledge the contribution he has made to Irish public life for the past 31 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the matter to which Senator Walsh referred has been resolved by his statement here today.</P>
        <P>I want to raise two issues on the Order of Business.  The first concerns the social partnership talks which are commencing.  They will take place at a challenging time for our country and economy and the outcome of them is important for each and everyone of us.  The social partnership talks have always taken place outside the Oireachtas.  I have said for a long time that it is extremely important that there should a link back from those talks to the Oireachtas.  I hope that the next Minister for Finance will ensure there is a role for the Oireachtas in those ongoing talks.  Admittedly, sensitive matters are discussed at them, but there is a role for the Houses of the Oireachtas to have their voices heard on such an important topic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the comments of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, about pay restraint would be heard better by all involved if he took leadership on his own pay rise and led by example&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the call for pay restraint.  I ask the Leader of the House to invite the next Minister for Finance to the House to enable us to have a voice on these important matters that will come before the social partners in the next few weeks and months.  The outcome of these talks is critical for everyone in this country given the soaring unemployment rates and high inflation.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another financial matter, which also points to a need for the next Minister for Finance to come to this House.  I refer to the disturbing report from the Financial Services Ombudsman regarding the sale of financial products to elderly people.  Some disgraceful examples are documented in his report published in recent days.  Mr. Joe Meade has accused the banks and insurance companies of having a systemic problem with the sale of inappropriate <Col N="355"/>products to older people.  He gave some shocking examples of products being sold to elderly people who were not aware of the consequences of buying them.  We must register our disgust at what is happening.  It is a case of preying on older people.  Many concerns have been expressed in this House about the conduct of certain institutions.  We need to debate this issue here and to ensure there is better practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the clarification and withdrawal of that comment of Senator Walsh&rsquo;s.  It is welcome it has been dealt with.</P>
        <P>I must gently disagree with my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, on the matter of the Government pay increase.  It was properly processed and dealt with and the figure was given by an independent body.  I have said this here previously and I have been a single voice on this issue.  Nobody opposite would dare to say what I am saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We will support the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, Members on this side have to say something on this.  The Government members are entitled to their pay increase.  However, I agree with the points Senator Fitzgerald made about the national wage agreement.  I have been saying here for the past 20 years that these Houses should take an interest in national wage agreements.  I have asked for debates on this issue here three times in the past six months.  The fact is nobody is interested in these matters until the talks start.  I guarantee that if we had a meeting here every week on this issue, in which I would be happy to participate, Members would lose interest in it because it is dry, dull material.  The social partners will be talking about national economic indicators for the next three weeks.  I would certainly be very interested in listening to what they have to say.</P>
        <P>The report of the Seanad reform group indicated that one of the issues it was intended this House could deal with is the issue raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered the possibility of setting up a select committee of the Seanad to parallel, focus, deal with, respond to or provide a forum for the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  That is a very good idea.  I am not sure how much support there would be for it.  It was raised by Senator MacSharry last month and Senator Boyle expressed an interest in it previously.  The nature of the work of such a committee would be dry and dull but I would be fully supportive of it.</P>
        <P>We need to discuss the matter of the report on alcohol sales.  I would like to hear more about two issues related to it.  One is the proposal to reduce the duty on drinks containing lower levels of alcohol, such as beers with an alcohol content of 3%.  The other issue on which we need to hear more is the impact of reducing the drink driving limit from a blood-alcohol level of 80 milligrams to 50 milligrams.  Are there statistics to prove that reducing the limit from 80 milligrams to 50 milligrams would make a significant impact on reducing the number of road deaths or injuries suffered in road traffic accidents?  I have not seen those figures.  I have asked for them previously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand this is a political issue.  I do not want us to rush into a political decision that will cause further chaos in rural Ireland unless we have to.  If we have to do it, then we should, but we should have the figures.  Usually when figures are produced on the number of people involved in accidents involving drink driving, the blood-alcohol level of those involved is much higher than 80 milligrams.  The effort, money and time being put into reducing the level from 80 milligrams to 50 milligrams might result in the saving of many more lives if it was put into BreastCheck or increasing the availability of other cancer diagnostic elements throughout the country.</P>
<Col N="356"/>
        <P>I would like to have a full, honest and balanced debate on this issue.  If we have to reduce the drink driving limit, I will support it, but I want to see the figures to back up the case for doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Senator Walsh&rsquo;s statement of clarification.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald regarding the pay talks.  There is merit in having a parallel process in the Oireachtas that would consider this issue, assess the debate and comment on what is happening.  That would be welcome because there appears to be a democratic deficit to a degree in this respect.</P>
        <P>I welcome many of the comments made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  We need a debate on living in rural Ireland in the near future.  Many people I meet on a regular basis believe that rural Ireland is under attack or, at the very least, that a malaise is setting in regarding living conditions there.  Communities are affected by the shops closing, post offices have closed and pharmacists in certain areas are saying they will not be able to make a living under the new conditions in their contracts.  Even some churches have closed.  It is a real concern.  There is also the issue of the role of pubs.  Irrespective of whether we like it, in rural Ireland the pub was the centre of the community, but that is gradually being eroded and nothing has filled the vacuum.</P>
        <P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s view regarding a debate on the drink diving limit.  We need to see the data on this issue to ascertain their value.  I am not expressing my view but I have heard from many people in rural Ireland, as I am sure have other Members, that they believe that what is proposed is a cosmetic exercise rather than something that will result in a large decrease in the number of rural deaths, which would be welcome.  These people are not convinced of that argument.  If what is proposed is the right thing to do, we will support it.  It is something that should be supported, but the data on this issue are necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the rural transport initiative is an excellent scheme it is underfunded.  The budget is expected to be &euro;90 million over the lifetime of the national development plan.  Unfortunately, at the rate at which it is increasing &mdash; the budget is only &euro;11 million this year &mdash; it will not reach that target.  I hope that will be examined because the scheme is providing a great service to the elderly and those who are isolated.  Two clinical reports were published recently which indicate that rates of depression are lower among elderly people in those rural areas where the rural transport initiative is in operation.</P>
        <P>The scheme should be extended.  Operators should be allowed not only to do point-to-point trips but also one-off trips, which they are barred from doing at the moment.  In addition, the Departments of Health and Children and Transport together should devise a medical appointments scheme.  I understand they have met but failed to reach agreement.  Senators may not be aware that a number of community nursing and doctor&rsquo;s medical appointments are being missed by elderly people because of a lack of transport.  A scheme could be put in place whereby the Health Service Executive would contract the local rural transport scheme providers to provide a medical transport service.  That would be an excellent addition and I urge the Leader to use his powers of persuasion to convince the relevant Departments to examine that possibility.</P>
        <P>I wish the Taoiseach the best of luck in his upcoming appointment in Washington.  I know he has a job to do in representing this country and it is a great honour for him but it also affords him a unique opportunity to help the undocumented Irish in the United States and I hope he will use the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the statement by Senator Jim Walsh.  The absolute privilege we enjoy in this House allows us to express our strongly held opinions in a way that is not <Col N="357"/>available to other citizens in this State.  We should always be aware of the context in which we use that privilege.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that there is a need for a debate on the report of the alcohol advisory group.  The Minister has stated he intends to introduce legislation on intoxicating liquor and public order but in advance of such a Bill being published, it would serve this House well to discuss the recommendations of the advisory group.</P>
        <P>I believe long-awaited decisions on the gateways innovation fund are imminent.  This fund is for the development of hubs of population centres outside the Dublin area and is especially important <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the national spatial strategy.  If we can anticipate the making of those decisions and schedule a debate on the national spatial strategy itself and the impact of the gateways innovation fund, public debate will be well served.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I raised the issue of the legal protection of embryos in this country.  We are in an unbelievable position in this country with regard to embryonic stem cell research in that there is no legal protection for embryos.  This is a medical issue which relates to <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation, IVF.  There is no legal protection for mothers who wish to go through IVF to conceive.  That is a ridiculous position for this country to be in, especially given that the commission on assisted human reproduction reported on the issue four years ago.  We still have no legislation to protect mothers who wish to use IVF to conceive.</P>
        <P>I would also like the issue of pre-implantation genetic testing to be examined in the context of any proposed legislation.  I do not support such testing so that mothers can decide to have a blue eyed or blonde haired child.  Rather, I support it because there are a number of serious genetic conditions which can only be detected through such testing.  There is no protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ethical problems with that as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ethical problems with IVF, pre-implantation genetic testing and embryonic stem cell research but there is no legislation governing any of these areas.  A person could conduct embryonic stem cell research in this country with no legal obligations whatsoever, except if the person is a doctor and thereby subject to the ethical rules of the Medical Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to the calls for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss the announcement he made yesterday on the regulation of the sale of alcohol.  Some time between Christmas and Easter I asked that we would debate the report of the alcohol advisory group as soon as it was published.</P>
        <P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to initiatives such as &ldquo;Banned&rdquo; in Bangor, County Down, which involves the banning of people involved in anti-social behaviour from the town.  The aim is to protect the commercial life of the town and ensure people feel it is a safe place in which to drink and socialise.  It appears to be working well and perhaps we should examine it further.  I heard of another scheme on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, called &ldquo;Club Cork&rdquo; which we also should examine.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to indicate when the Student Support Bill will be before the House.  This morning the USI stated it would be difficult to bring forward the date of application for grants to 1 May because most students are in the middle of exams at that time.  I suggested the application for grants should be made at the same time as the application for admission to college or university, which would be in February.  However, the USI pointed out that information is not being released from the Department early enough.  We should have a debate on issues such as that and examine whether it would be possible to amalgamate the applications <Col N="358"/>for grants with the applications for entry to colleges so that students receive their grants as early as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald has pointed out that on many pressing economic and social matters the Oireachtas, and the Seanad in particular, is either silent or does not have the ability to discuss such issues.  An important element in the background to this problem, which has been touched on many times in this Chamber, is that there have been huge increases in the amount of money spent on the delivery of public services.  However, there has not been a corresponding improvement in the quality of our public services.  I am struck by the fact that once again, both items to be discussed on the Adjournment today relate to schools and education, which were also discussed last night on Private Members' time.  When the Adjournment debate begins, I have no doubt Government representatives will refer to the enormous increases in funding for education but there are still outstanding issues that are raised every day by Members on both sides of the House.</P>
        <P>A report is due to be published by the OECD on public service reform in Ireland.  It will examine how we can ensure money for public services is better spent.  I ask the Leader to ensure when the report is published that rather than it being debated in the pages of our newspapers, we are given an opportunity to discuss it in the House with the Minister for Finance.  We must focus on how we can ensure proper accountability is in place all the time, especially to elected representatives.  This point has been raised with regard to the Health Service Executive and last night, for example, to the Dublin transport authority.  We must focus also on ensuring the pupil, patient and passenger is always at the centre, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>new money being spent and services provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the role the Leader has played in ensuring additional time will be available to discuss the Dublin Transport Authority Bill to ensure it can be debated properly and amendments aimed at improving it can be tabled.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to advise the House where smear test analyses will be carried out.  I understand that public hospital laboratories have been turned down for reporting on smear tests to be taken under the national cancer screening programme.  That information should set alarm bells ringing.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has serious reservations about the outsourcing of smear test analysis, which would have many negative consequences for patients and future pathology training.  Will the Leader clarify this issue?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It was with regret that I learned of the death of a cyclist on the Navan Road, Cabra, Dublin yesterday.  I have been concerned for a considerable time about the provision of dedicated cycle tracks in close proximity to fast moving or speeding vehicles, large and small.  Alterations are proposed on the Clontarf Road in my constituency.  Families in houses Nos. 385 to 396 will be impacted and the quality of life of residents will be affected should the proposed cycle track proceed.  The safety of cyclists on such a busy stretch of road is also a serious issue as they merge with motor vehicles.  Will the Leader find out what is the proposal for this area?  What is policy and strategy regarding consultation with residents prior to the development of such cycle tracks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on alcohol abuse.  I welcome the introduction of legislation in this area but I agree with the leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, which called it &ldquo;a weak alcohol bill&rdquo;.  It is not good enough.  We know perfectly well that alcohol is responsive to two triggers.  It is price sensitive and it is sensitive to pressure on advertising.  Nothing is being done about this.  Excise duty on spirits has not increased in the past six budgets while the tax on beer has not increased over the past ten or <Col N="359"/>11 budgets.  This efficient instrument is being ignored and nothing is being done about advertising.  Drinks advertising is all over television and drinks companies are using sports and sports personalities-based advertising.  There is a little rebalancing in the direction of the pub because of worries about people drinking at home.  However, this is a pathetically weak response.</P>
        <P>A discussion in the House could urge the Minister to for the first time honestly address a situation that is a disaster for this country.  This is an epidemic and I would welcome such a debate.  It is suggested some of these issues should be referred to the District Court but this is a waste of time.  I have reported to the House during similar debates previously that I have witnessed many times in the District Court a licence being granted in defiance of the expressed views of the local community, the Garda and the city authorities.  What use is it doing that?  I do not blame the judges because, we, as legislators are at fault.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of the Business, &ldquo;That No. 18, motion No. 3 be taken before No. 1&rdquo;.  The motion is in the names of myself and Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Bacik.  I am sure others will agree with this but they have not signed the motion yet.  I propose this in light of statements by UNRRA earlier.  It will not be able to continue providing basic food requirements to almost 750,000 people in the Gaza Strip.  This is a response to the rocket attacks on Israel, which I deplore, but it is completely wrong to affect the most basic issues of life such as sewerage, water, refuse collection and hospitals by cutting off fuel supplies.  This is collective punishment, which is illegal under international law, and the Israelis are only getting away with it because the United States has used its veto at the United Nations.</P>
        <P>A protocol on human rights is attached to the Lisbon treaty.  If we believe in anything to do with human rights, we must do something about this.  I do not even suggest a ban on Israeli goods or something similar but the least we can do, because this human rights protocol exists, is establish a monitoring body.  Let us know how this legal instrument is being affected, otherwise let us forget the pretence that we have any interest in human rights or the welfare of 750,000 people who are illegally subjected to collective punishment by the Israeli Government under the patronage of the Bush Administration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Irish Council for Bioethics called for legislation to provide for embryonic stem cell research, which they described as the gold standard.  There is no instance of such research being successful.  The researchers are like the alchemists of old trying to turn base metal into gold.  Stem cell research is not that difficult.  It is logical that an embryo, which must grow at a certain rate in a short time to become a baby and then a child, naturally has a built-in capacity to multiply at a fast rate.  Therefore, to make the adult cell, the researchers must stop that growth.  In doing so, they can do nothing but cause cancerous cells instead of taking the harder but productive route of adult stem cells, for which a clinic is open in Europe, which has had successes.  They are right that there is a totipotent nature to embryonic cells but it is there for the very need of that embryo to grow quickly.  There has been no success from Korea to western Europe to the Americas.  It is like the child looking at the emperor with no clothes saying, &ldquo;This has not worked&rdquo;.  Billions have been spent without success.</P>
        <P>Embryonic stem cell research may also infringe on our Constitution.  Article 43.3 is quite clear.  The X case does not affect this, as there is no possibility of suicide of an embryo.  We have taken a very wrong road.  The day life is taken and diminished in any way affects us all in different ways.  If that Rubicon is crossed, one will not go back.  It will only lead to further calls for life to be diminished.  It is our duty to protect life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise in advance for my inability to be present later for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit.  I wish him well in his retirement.  I recognise his service to the country and <Col N="360"/>he can be proud of his legacy on economic, social and political developments and Northern Ireland issues.</P>
        <P>I support the call by Senators Fitzgerald, Donohoe and O&rsquo;Toole regarding the economic climate facing the country.  When the social partners enter economic negotiations, Oireachtas Members are excluded from the process.  It would be helpful if we debated the various economic issues facing the country and inflation, in particular, in the near future.  A number of years ago my party was the subject of derision following its Rip Off Ireland campaign.  However, it was effective, as it brought home to consumers the astronomical rate of increase in prices and the fact that many retailers were taking advantage of them.</P>
        <P>A national campaign against inflation is needed.  Wage increases are of little use to workers if they are wiped out by inflation.  A major element of the Government&rsquo;s economic campaign over the next 12 months must be an attack on inflation and its causes to root it out.  Inflation presents the same political challenge it did in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Perhaps this issue can be debated along with what is happening between the social partners and various Ministers.  It is important the Houses of the Oireachtas have their say.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader try to reschedule as soon as possible the debate on the World Trade Organisation talks postponed from last week?  The May deadline is fast approaching and the future of Irish agriculture and 50,000 to 100,000 jobs are at risk.  We need a strong political response from the Oireachtas and I ask to have the matter put back on the agenda of the Seanad for next week, if possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the matter of the situation in Gaza where an Irishman, John Ging, heads the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, operation there.  It is incumbent on us in this House and on Ireland to do anything we can to support UNRWA and the people of Palestine who are, effectively, living in the open prison of Gaza.</P>
        <P>The week before last I spoke about the effects of mobile phones and phone masts and asked the Leader to organise a debate on the issue.  A new report by the Russian national committee on non-ionising radiation protection, Children and Handsets: Future Generations&rsquo; Health is Under Threat, was issued recently.  The report discusses the threat of mobile phone handsets to children&rsquo;s health.  The threat is significant because of the early developmental stage of children&rsquo;s brains.  The absorption of electromagnetic waves in children is more sensitive than that of adolescents or adults and can cause everything from attention deficit to cancer and possibly Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  The report states that mobile phone handsets should only be used by children in emergency situations.  Given that mobile phone companies are targeting children and teenagers, I seek an urgent debate on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support and second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s departure from standard political correctness this morning to say that we should not introduce the lowering of alcohol levels without the empirical evidence to support it.  Will the Leader request the Minister to bring the supporting data before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Should the data produce the compelling evidence that a reduction in the limits would make a material difference to the saving of lives, that is a fair reason to introduce the change, but we need to see the data and evidence.  The circumstantial evidence of which we are aware is that speeding is an issue, especially by young people late at night who often have consumed large amounts of alcohol.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Kelly on the rural transport scheme.  Both issues contribute to the significant problem of isolation, particularly in rural Ireland.  People are prisoners in their own homes.  The social fabric of society has changed to the detriment of a specific section of the population who now have no social outlet.  This issue needs to be debated in this House.  We <Col N="361"/>should consider asking CIE to introduce feeder buses to main routes in rural areas.  For example, feeder buses should operate from catchment areas to the main bus routes such as the N2 or N3 at least twice a day to improve quality of life in rural areas.</P>
        <P>This week a compelling case was made by Mr. Begg in the context of the debate on inflation for the necessity of curbing executive salaries, including political and ministerial salaries.  We cannot and must not on moral, ethical or practical grounds approach low-paid workers and ask them for wage restraint while we have uncontrolled salary inflation in other sectors.  The issue must be addressed.  This House has particular responsibility in that sphere and it is imperative we call for wage restraint at the top echelons of society.  I also join others in the request to the Leader to provide a specific date for a debate on the World Trade Organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Reference was made to the pay talks and I too support the good wishes made in that respect.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly touched on an important aspect of the talks.  I listened with interest to David Begg&rsquo;s interview in which he spoke about the excessive salaries of executives in many private companies.  I suggest to the Leader that it would be useful to have a debate on the regulation of plcs.  Shareholders in plcs have very little control over salary levels set for directors and senior executives as these are usually set by a remuneration committee.  I have no difficulty where people in the private sector add considerable value to a company for shareholders.  It is only right that they would benefit as a consequence.  However, the benefit should be directly related to the improvement in the performance of the company, but that is not always the case.  We should debate the matter so that shareholders are more empowered at annual and extraordinary general meetings to effect some control in that area.  This is not as easy or justifiable in closed companies where people have invested their own moneys.  It is the return on that investment that gives an entrepreneurial flair and development for the country.  There is a need for strong restraint in the public service.  All of us in the public service have done exceptionally well in recent years.  It would be of tremendous benefit to the economy if we saw 12 to 18 months of a pay pause for all of the public service.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Kelly and O&rsquo;Reilly about the proposed reduction in alcohol level limits.  This should only be done if there is clear compelling evidence from statistical data that illustrates serious accidents are occurring within the current level.  We do not have that information.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Kelly and Bradford in paying tribute to our Taoiseach.  Today is a nostalgic day for us as it is his last day of service in the House and the end of an era.  While it has not been a golden era, his selfless contribution to all of Ireland will benefit generations to come.  It was a privilege to serve under his inspired leadership for the past 11 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with previous speakers on the issue of the pay talks.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly probably put it best when he spoke about the issue raised by Mr. Begg and the spiralling level of incomes of some senior executives.  This has a knock-on effect when it comes to politicians and Members of the Government.  I am interested in hearing the views of the incoming Taoiseach on this issue.  Previously I called on him to come to the House as Minister for Finance on a number of occasions to outline the position.</P>
        <P>I am also interested in the incoming Taoiseach&rsquo;s view on the patronage of the Taoiseach after the previous general election, whereby he increased the numbers of Ministers of State and the number of committees of the Oireachtas.  Does the incoming Taoiseach share the view that we need so many Ministers of State and Oireachtas committees?  I do not think we do and many Members are of a similar view.</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole with regard to alcohol policy and the announcements made yesterday.  Senator Norris is correct in referring to price and advertising.  I have <Col N="362"/>long been an advocate of the banning of advertising.  This would be a problem for many sporting organisations but it is a nettle we must grasp.  Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement is an astounding reversal of what has been Government policy for ten years, namely, the liberal availability of alcohol.  We now seem to be putting the engines in reverse ten years too late.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the sentiments of previous speakers, including Senator Walsh, with regard to the prospect of reducing the limit from 80 milligrams to 50 milligrams.  The proper implementation of the 80 milligrams level would be of much more benefit than paying lip-service to the provision by reducing the overall level.  I am interested in seeing the empirical evidence that supports a reduction.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader speak on the pharmacy review group established by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney?  My understanding is the group is still chaired by Mr. Se&aacute;n Dorgan, a very capable individual.  However, he was recently appointed as chairman of Tesco Ireland.  My understanding is that it is the avowed position of Tesco Ireland that it will become involved in the pharmacy market in Ireland.  It is currently involved in pharmacies in Britain.  Does the Leader agree that it would be an obvious conflict of interest if he remained in the position of chairman of the review group of pharmacies while taking up the position of chairman of Tesco Ireland which has an avowed policy to enter the pharmacy market here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is usually a cause for celebration when a country holds a record in an area of activity.  We have had many reasons to celebrate in the past, but we hold one record now which is more of a cause for shame than celebration, namely, alcohol abuse.  We hold a number of European records at present.  It does not make good reading to know that 54% of Irish adults engage in binge drinking on a weekly basis.  Alcohol abuse harms the people directly involved, but it also has tremendous effects on others.  We all know the connection between alcohol abuse and killings, crime, traffic accidents, anti-social behaviour where old people are terrorised, family break-ups and so on.</P>
        <P>Legislation will help but it will not solve the problem.  History has taught us that the reason we had a tradition for alcohol abuse was poverty, yet today we are told it is because we are affluent.  We know that neither poverty nor affluence is the cause.  Yesterday, in the Select Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs the visiting delegation included two consultants from Cluain Mhuire who made one very telling point.  They said it is like turning on a tap, where the water flows until it becomes a waterfall and we are at the end trying to catch the water in buckets.  That is what we are trying to do to solve the problems of alcohol abuse.  The consultants said it was far more important to go to the source and turn off the tap.</P>

	<P>Unless we consider the mindset and culture which is causing this problem, those of us in the Seanad &mdash; probably not myself but the younger Members &mdash; in ten or 20 years&rsquo;  time will be discussing this issue, but at different level.  I would like an all-day debate, and not only on the level of alcohol intake permitted for driving or pub closing hours.  We will always look for scapegoats, but let us look into our hearts on this issue and do something about it.</P>
        <P>I join my colleagues and pay tribute to An Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I have been overawed and inspired by the man, as long as I have known him, by the leadership he has provided and his common touch.  He will be always remembered for one thing, which is that he was an ordinary man who gave extraordinary service to this State.  I regard him as one of the greatest political leaders in the history of Ireland, and not just of his generation.  I  wish him <Col N="363"/>well.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh rath D&eacute; air i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus go mbeidh s&eacute; f&oacute;s againn chun treoir agus dea-shampla a thabhairt.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with some of my colleagues who have questioned the lowering of the alcohol limit for drink driving.  I believe this is necessary and the legislation should come before the House as soon as possible.  It has already happened in many countries throughout the European Union.  Ireland received an exemption some years ago and was not required to lower the alcohol limit to 50 milligrams.  We need to stamp out the culture where it is possible to leave a pub having consumed alcohol and get behind the wheel of a car.  The campaigns running throughout the State suggests that we should not drink and drive, but the law allows for it.  I welcome the pending legislation in this area and I hope it is passed without delay.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns raised by some Senators on the fuel blockade in Israel.  This House needs to do everything in its power to ensure the blockade is lifted.  There are 650,000 people suffering at present and the United Nations will not be able to reach these people with food supplies from next week.  I appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to engage directly with the Israeli authorities to try to influence the lifting of that blockade immediately.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the issue of a group of employees who are being paid below the minimum wage, a group of employees who do not have access to pensions rights, PRSA, sick leave schemes or promotional opportunities.  The rights and entitlements of these people are being abused. Senators may think these employees are being hired by an unscrupulous agency &mdash; we previously had a debate about agency workers in this House &mdash; but that is not the case.  I refer to employees working in our primary and secondary schools, namely, caretakers and school secretaries.  Some are paid as little as &euro;6.02 per hour.  They are paid indirectly by the Department of Education and Science with the Minister&rsquo;s full knowledge that such people are being paid below the minimum wage.  One school secretary is being paid &euro;6.02 per hour, another is paid &euro;7.70 and another little more than &euro;8 per hour.  It is appalling that the Minister and the Department of Education and Science allow Irish workers to be abused in this way.  I call for an urgent debate on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the debate that will take place today between 2 p.m and 2.45 p.m. &mdash; if it is a debate &mdash; where An Taoiseach will address this House on the Good Friday Agreement and the Lisbon treaty, is it proposed that this will be the only debate on the Good Friday Agreement?  I have called time and again for a debate on this matter as there are serious issues that we need to address.  The Good Friday Agreement is not the endgame; there are many outstanding issues that need to be addressed.  Allowing 45 minutes does not do justice to the topic.  I ask for the Good Friday Agreement debate to be scheduled as a matter of urgency.  It should not be coupled with the Lisbon treaty debate as they are separate issues, each of national importance.  It is right and fitting that An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in his last days in that role should address the House on these two issues.  However I ask the Leader for a guarantee that the Good Friday Agreement debate will take place and I urge him to accept my request that we invite Dr. Ian Paisley, as the First Minister, and the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland here for that debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by other Senators for an urgent debate on the report of the alcohol advisory group given the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced his intention to bring legislation on alcohol misuse before the Houses of the <Col N="364"/>Oireachtas and to have it enacted by the summer.  We need to acquaint ourselves fully with the wide-ranging recommendations of the alcohol advisory group.</P>
        <P>Several Senators raised the issue of advertising of alcohol and I echo the points made.  In the programme for Government there is a clear commitment to phase out the sponsorship of sporting events by the alcohol industry.  A rather softly, softly approach has been adopted to date where we have allowed the drinks industry to draw up voluntary compliance schemes and codes of conduct which are not working.  By allowing the widespread advertising of sporting events by the alcohol industry we glamorise the consumption of alcohol and we inextricably link the two in the minds of young people. Most people involved in sporting events are young people and we link the sport and the celebration of sporting success with the consumption of alcohol.  This is not good and we must cut that link.  When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduces the Bill we should examine this issue and remain mindful of the commitment that is in the programme for Government to end such sponsorship.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Kelly, Bradford, O&rsquo;Reilly, Walsh, asked for a debate on the national pay talks and for a role for the Oireachtas in the talks so that Members&rsquo; voices can be heard.  I support this suggestion and I will invite the new Minister for Finance to come to the House at the earliest opportunity in the next four or five weeks to hear the views of Senators on the difficult challenge ahead.  Staying competitive is the biggest challenge facing the economy, the Government and the country.  Everyone must take responsibility for holding on to whatever jobs exist.  We must work together in the interest of our families and of our country.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has much experience in the area of pay talks and he has been of great assistance to the Seanad over the past 20 years on the subject of pay talks.  The Taoiseach will give his last address in the Oireachtas in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  One of his great successes has been the national understandings, dating back to 1987, which have practically eliminated strikes.  We are an example to the world and all parties in the Oireachtas can take great credit for our responsible actions when our backs were to the wall and when the country had very little going for it.  The challenge now is possibly not quite as serious as in 1987 but the next three to four years will be serious for the economy and for our young people.</P>
        <P>On the point raised about the sale of products to older people, I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  Many Senators expressed strong views on the new report on alcohol.  My views on alcohol would be very well known to the House.  I can assure Members that we will have an all-day debate on this subject at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senators Kelly and O&rsquo;Reilly asked for a debate on the challenges facing rural Ireland because of changing lifestyles.  I have given a commitment to the House to hold such a debate.  Senator Boyle informed the House that the gateway innovation funding, which is of crucial importance to the success of the hub towns in the national spatial strategy, will be announced in the next three to four weeks.  I welcome that announcement by the Deputy Leader of the House and I look forward to a speedy implementation because the towns are depending on it.  If funding is not provided to the national spatial strategy areas then the strategy will not happen; it is as simple as that.</P>
<Col N="365"/>
        <P>Senators Twomey and Hanafin expressed strong views on stem cell research which I will pass on to the Minister.  Both contributions were excellent and they noted there is no legislation prohibiting stem cell research or anything like that.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney asked when the Student Support Bill will be before the House.  The Bill is currently on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The Student Support Bill proposes to place all student support schemes on a statutory footing, to designate VECs as awarding authorities, to provide for a system of appeals and penalties for fraudulent applicants for grants and to repeal the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 and 1992.  The Bill will be taken in the Seanad as soon as it is available.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe asked for a debate on the high cost of the public service.  When the OECD report is published we can allow time for such a debate with the new Minister for Finance and which would include discussion on the economy and the challenges facing the social partners.</P>
        <P>In reply to the questions asked by Senator Callely, I will contact the Minister&rsquo;s office with his inquiry and I will reply to the Senator directly on those two matters.  Senator Norris proposed an amendment to the Order of Business which was seconded by Senator Mullen.  If the Senator would leave this matter until the next sitting of the House on next Wednesday, I hope to take it then if that is agreeable to the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford and O&rsquo;Reilly asked about the rescheduling of the WTO debate.  I am endeavouring to have the debate take place but I do not have a timeframe.  I hope to have that information on Wednesday or Thursday of next week.  Senator Daly outlined to the House the dangers to the health of children posed by hand-held mobile phones.  I will allow time for a debate.  Senator John Paul Phelan made a very worthwhile point about the position of chairman of the review group of pharmacies.  I will allow time for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty raised the issue of the minimum wage for school secretaries and caretaking staff.  This is a serious allegation and state of affairs and I will allow time for it to be discussed.  I was not aware of this situation and I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will make a statement in the House today on the Lisbon reform treaty and the Good Friday Agreement.  I afforded the Taoiseach this opportunity to speak about his part in the Good Friday Agreement and to acknowledge what has happened.  There will be a debate or expression of views on the Good Friday Agreement for as much time as Senators require at another time.  If any Senator wishes to propose persons to be invited to address the House, I ask that the request be made in writing to the Cathaoirleach who will discuss it at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the current situation in the tourism industry.  I also look forward to hearing Senators&rsquo; contributions as I highly value the role and expertise of this House in economic debate.  It is <Col N="366"/>timely to review the tourism industry in its entirety given recent developments in the global economic outlook.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have been developing our economy under a framework of partnership for many years.  This partnership model is also a core tenet of tourism policy.  That is why, since taking up my appointment last June, I have had extensive consultations with tourism interest groups and have reviewed developments with staff in my Department and the key tourism State agencies.  The Government&rsquo;s general strategy to sustain the medium and long-term growth of the sector is set out in our agreed programme for Government.  I will energetically pursue the 20 individual tourism action points set out in that programme.</P>
        <P>Tourism is an important and dynamic growth industry worldwide.  According to the World Tourism Organisation, there were almost 900 million international tourist arrivals in 2007.  The industry has grown by 6.5% per year between 1950 and 2007.  Tourism revenue worldwide is valued at &euro;462 billion annually or slightly more than &euro;1.25 billion per day.  The industry represents more than a third of the world&rsquo;s exports of services.  Most importantly, the industry is expected to continue on its upward growth path, with a predicted 1.6 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide by 2020.</P>
        <P>The economic importance of tourism to the State cannot be overstated.  Tourism expenditure doubled during the 1990s and some &euro;4.3 billion was invested in tourism capital stock, supported by a significant allocation of EU Structural Funds and Government grants and incentives.  The tourism policy review group, of which I will speak later, has rightly concluded that Irish tourism is the most important sector of Irish-owned enterprise since the foundation of the State.  The statistics speak for themselves.  The tourism and hospitality industry provides direct employment for almost 250,000 workers throughout the State and its effect is seen in virtually every parish.  It is probably the largest employer in the State at this stage, just ahead of the construction industry.</P>
        <P>In 1990, overseas visitor numbers to Ireland were slightly more than 3 million.  This has more than doubled to 8 million visitors in 2007.  Revenue earnings from these visitors have also grown steadily.  In 1990, foreign visitors spent a little more than &euro;1 billion in the State, and this had grown to almost &euro;5 billion in 2007.  Despite our increasing national propensity for foreign travel, domestic tourism has also been buoyant.  In 1990, domestic tourism contributed &euro;0.5 billion, increasing to an estimated &euro;1.6 billion in 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, visitor numbers from most of Ireland&rsquo;s key source markets showed good growth levels in 2007 despite the increasingly competitive nature of the industry.  Overseas visitor numbers in 2007 grew by 4% to an all time high of more than 8 million and overseas revenue grew by 4.5% to almost &euro;5 billion.  Last year was the sixth consecutive year of growth and a record year for tourism in terms of total visitors and earnings.  In 2007, Ireland topped the Lonely Planet Blue List survey as the world&rsquo;s friendliest destination.  Recent detailed consumer research undertaken by Tourism Ireland endorses the findings of this survey.</P>
        <P>Tourism targets for 2008, which were set during the second half of 2007, are to achieve growth in overseas visitor numbers and foreign revenue receipts of 5.2% and 7.7%, respectively.  However, financial volatility, adverse exchange rates and weaker economic growth have become features of some of our key source markets in recent months.  In these circumstances, the targets may be overly ambitious.</P>
        <P>On 8 November 2007, I had the pleasure of meeting my Northern Ireland counterpart, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Mr. Nigel Dodds, MP, at the first North-South Ministerial Council meeting in tourism sectoral format since the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.  It was a productive meeting.  In the context of a North-South <Col N="367"/>co-operative approach, we approved Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s business plan for 2008 and its corporate plan for the period 2008-2010.  These plans set ambitious targets for the continued growth of tourism to the island of Ireland.  If achieved, they will result in up to 10.6 million visitors to the island by 2010, with an associated &euro;16 billion in tourism revenues in that three-year period.</P>
        <P>I remain optimistic about our future prospects.  The tourism industry is a resilient one and is well placed to maintain its strong performance in the medium term.  However, recent international instability will pose a major challenge to sustaining overseas growth and, in particular, revenue growth this year.  The ability to meet these challenges is reinforced by a clear and dynamic policy framework in support of the industry.  That policy approach has been developed and implemented in a close partnership with the sector.</P>
        <P>The agreed programme for Government provides for sustained support and investment for the industry in the coming years.  This includes investment in product development and innovation, marketing, human resources and training and transport infrastructure.  These objectives are reflected in my Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2008-10, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>It worthwhile to refer to several other documents which comprise the framework for the promotion and development of tourism policy.  The detailed strategy which drives investment in the industry is set out in the 2003 report of the tourism policy review group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism &mdash; An Agenda for Action, as well as the subsequent reports of the tourism action plan implementation group.  The New Horizons report set out a strategy for the period 2003-2012, both industry-led and Government-led, for the further sustainable development of tourism.  It identified a detailed list of recommendations and actions to be undertaken by the industry and the public sector to give effect to the strategy.</P>
        <P>Following the report&rsquo;s publication, the tourism action plan implementation group was appointed to monitor implementation of the recommendations of the report.  That group has to date presented three progress reports.  I expect its successor group, the tourism strategy implementation group, to produce a fourth and final report in the coming weeks.  The report will include an assessment of progress since the publication of the New Horizons report and recommendations for a strategic mid-term review.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013, Transforming Ireland, includes the largest ever Government investment programme for the development of tourism.  The programme includes an international marketing sub-programme which provides &euro;335 million to promote the island of Ireland in key international markets.  The key objective in the seven-year period will be to increase tourism revenue and visitor yield and to achieve a wider regional and seasonal distribution of business.  The investment programme also involves a product development and infrastructure sub-programme which provides &euro;317 million to upgrade and supplement tourism attractions and activities throughout the State and to deliver a national conference centre in Dublin.  Also included in the national development plan investment programme is a training and human resource development sub-programme which will invest &euro;148 million in the education and training of the tourism workforce, both domestic and international, as well as sustaining structured educational opportunities in third level colleges and institutes of technology throughout the State.  This sub-programme will also provide for the continuation of initiatives aimed at improving management capability and networking in small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and micro-enterprises at regional level.</P>
        <P>In addition to direct investment through the tourism development programme, the new national development plan includes a range of complementary programmes that will greatly benefit the future development of tourism.  These relate not only to the major planned capital investment in transport, energy and environmental services but also to the proposed investment <Col N="368"/>of more than &euro;900 million in cultural infrastructure and &euro;990 million in sport infrastructure under my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  There is great potential to develop synergies within my Department&rsquo;s portfolio.  Since becoming Minister, I have actively pursued such an agenda with a view to enhancing our tourism product offering and promoting cultural and sports tourism.</P>
        <P>The national development plan also provides for construction of a national conference centre in Dublin.  The contract was awarded in April 2007.  Construction of the centre is under way and it is on schedule to be operational in 2010.  In the meantime, the operators are working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Dublin Convention Bureau to market the venue.</P>
        <P>In line with the national development plan, the 2008 budget provided for the largest ever Exchequer allocation for tourism services of &euro;170 million, an increase of 10% on the 2007 outturn.  Capital funding of &euro;15.7 million has been provided to support investment in key tourism infrastructure, attractions and visitor activity facilities.  The allocation of &euro;83 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland includes funding to secure an Irish stopover in Galway of the Volvo Ocean Race in 2009 and the Solheim Cup in Killeen Castle, County Meath, in 2011.  The provision of an extra &euro;5 million for the tourism marketing fund, which represents an increase of 11% on last year&rsquo;s sum, brings the fund to &euro;50 million.  This includes funding dedicated to the marketing overseas of the wider Shannon catchment area to meet the challenges posed by the introduction of open skies agreement.  Provision has also been made for the renewal of the super regions and the air access marketing initiative.  Support is being given to the further development of the Irish tourism brand in 2008, building on the extensive research work done by Tourism Ireland last year.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, the tourism industry has a role in virtually every parish in Ireland.  I am conscious of the positive role it can play in promoting balanced regional development.  As I have said, the tourism development programme, which is being pursued under the national development plan, provides for Exchequer investment in tourism of &euro;800 million over the life of the plan.</P>
        <P>One of the fundamental objectives of the programme is the stimulation of regional development.  It will be supported by the recent establishment of five regional tourism development boards, one each in the south east, the south west, the west, the midlands-east and the north west.  Shannon Development has created a separate regional board to reflect these structures.  Dublin Tourism has also been reconstituted.  Detailed development plans for each tourism region have been produced and published.  The Shannon plan will be available in May.  The plans serve as an important framework and resource for the various spending agencies in optimising the tourism benefits of investment under the national development plan, thereby adding to the local social and economic impact of such expenditure.</P>
        <P>The ambitions of the regional boards will be supported by Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The two agencies have been resourced to work in partnership with the industry and the regions to face up to the challenges the year will present.  It is important for the industry to do what it can to sustain our competitiveness and offer good value for money in the marketplace to entice potential visitors.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland will continue to deliver world-class marketing programmes in 2008 to ensure the island of Ireland stands out competitively in key markets, notwithstanding the challenges facing the industry.  Co-operative marketing opportunities will be offered to industry partners to allow them to work with Tourism Ireland overseas.  This is important if we are to help convert consumer interest to action &mdash; to close the sale, so to speak.  There will also be an emphasis on innovative product offerings and competitive pricing.  Our core target markets will <Col N="369"/>remain Great Britain, mainland Europe and North America, although new and developing markets will present significant opportunities in the longer term.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to support capital investment and innovation, raise quality standards and support the development of businesses through e-business support and network-based learning.  It will continue to provide its excellent training programmes, which concentrate on block release, and new models of training, which allow for accelerated progress to final assessment and accreditation.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also focus on delivering the new regional tourism development strategies.  It will continue to promote home holidays through innovative marketing programmes in consultation with the industry.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have set out my assessment of our recent tourism performance, outlined my views on the 2008 season and indicated the broad policy objectives which guide my work as Minister in line with the Government&rsquo;s agreed programme and the national development plan.  I intend to continue to consult widely with the industry, the tourism agencies and other experts to guide that work.  While I accept the industry is facing genuine difficulties with this year being especially challenging, I believe it has the resilience and the potential to overcome the current obstacles and maintain sustained growth in the medium term.  Tourism is a sector of enormous economic importance and with a wide regional impact.  As Minister, I will do my utmost to support and develop it.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators about the many challenges faced by the tourism sector.  I know from previous debates that the Members of this House are well informed about the industry.  It is important to develop an all-island tourism product, which is not something we had an opportunity to do in the past when two approaches were taken on this island.  We need to maintain competitiveness in this area.  The input of non-nationals living in Ireland, which is a new factor in this regard, should be maximised.  Approximately 30% of those who work in the tourism sector in this country are non-nationals.  We should give more attention to the development of tourism in the various regions.  We have to look again at the synergy involved in tourism.  We need to pull together the artistic and sporting environments, for example, under the big tent of tourism.  We have to develop 21st century products which feed into the world of tourism.  I thank the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to the House.  I acknowledge the help he has given me in the many Ministries he has held since I became a Member of this House.  In particular, I thank him for the assistance he provided when he was in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As the Minister said, we face many challenges in 2008.  Tourism is one of the sectors of the economy that has grown consistently and thrived on the basis of this country&rsquo;s worldwide reputation.  I do not doubt that 2007 was a record year for tourism in this country.  Approximately 9.1 million people visited this country last year, bringing an estimated &euro;4.6 billion to the economy.</P>
        <P>The tourism industry faces one of its most challenging years as a result of a number of issues which have arisen.  I refer to the weakening of sterling and the US dollar against the euro, for example, and the slowdown in the growth in the Irish economy.  Those operating in the tourism sector have been affected by the continuous increase in the cost of doing business in Ireland.  The tourism industry employs more than 150,000 people and benefits every parish in this country.  The Government needs to put in place a strategy to ensure such levels of employment can be sustained.</P>
        <P>The Minister alluded to the fact that the situation in the west has been further complicated by the termination of the air service between Shannon and Heathrow airports and the challenges posed by the open skies agreement between the EU and the US in respect of transatlantic flights.  I ask the Minister to ensure the amount of money provided to market the Irish <Col N="370"/>tourism sector overseas is augmented by a special fund to support initiatives in the US dollar and sterling areas.  Such funding would be available to airlines, sea carriers and accommodation providers that take currency risks by making tourism packages available in sterling or US dollar prices.  I accept that some carriers and accommodation providers have been proactive in offering attractive prices to people in overseas markets.  However, other product providers, such as signature golf courses, etc. should be conscious of the difficulties created by the strong euro, especially in the US.  They should accommodate people in relation to green fees, for example.  As this country&rsquo;s signature golf courses fly the flag of quality and add to Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination, I suggest that they should be considered for qualification under the business expansion schemes.</P>
      
        <P>It is clear that 2008 will be a most difficult year.  All sectors of the tourism industry should be encouraged to be creative and to take some risks to ensure the industry will benefit immediately from any upturn in the economies of our main markets, particularly Britain and the US.  Given that tourism contributes &euro;2.8 billion to the Exchequer it would not be unreasonable to suggest that an additional &euro;5 million be made available for specific marketing activities to attempt to counteract the weaknesses in the US dollar and sterling.</P>
        <P>Tourism, and in particular the hospitality sector, is a major employer throughout the country.  The hospitality sector has an extremely high cost base and the cost of labour now exceeds 40% of turnover.  Continuing increases in local authority rates and charges are a major burden for hotels and guesthouses.  The Commission on Taxation should consider in depth how the inequitable system of local authority rates can be replaced with a more equitable system of local taxation.</P>
        <P>Overseas employees make up 30% of employment in the hotel sector.  They make an enormous contribution to Irish hospitality.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland in conjunction with the industry should put in place an effective customer relation training programme to ensure employees who come in contact with members of the public are aware of local attractions and can communicate to customers the areas of interest in the locality which would make their stay more enjoyable.</P>
        <P>Marketing and promotion should be constant and not confined to the periods during which it has traditionally taken place.  All marketing resources should be channelled into maintaining and improving the quality of the product we have.  The expansion in the number of flights was discussed and it is great to see so many air routes.  We have seen an explosion in the number of air routes during recent years.  This has changed travel patterns and cities and regions with airports have benefited.  It is suggested that they are beneficial to people described as cash rich and time poor.</P>
        <P>We must also make reference to carriers by sea.  After duty free was abolished, car ferry companies experienced grave difficulties.  However, they are fighting back and their marketing theme is that they are low-cost carriers.  This is being pushed hard and is effective.  It is proved that people bringing their cars stay longer and are more valuable from a tourism point of view.  This area should be vigorously marketed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have difficulties with competitiveness.  Recently, Dublin was ranked the most expensive of 71 global cities by Swiss banking giant, UBS.  In a survey carried out this year, Dublin moved from being the 13th most expensive city surveyed to being ranked fourth, just ahead of Zurich.  This should set alarm bells ringing.  The most recent CSO figures show an annual rate of inflation of 5%, rising to 9.3% in food and alcoholic beverages.  This is another problem we face and it must be tackled.</P>
        <P>With regard to transport, we have a deficit which must be addressed if we are to attract tourists.  Traffic gridlock is the norm in our cities but also in regional and rural areas.  Cars play <Col N="371"/>an essential role in getting around.  To date, Transport 21 has failed to deliver adequate rail links, bus services and transport services in regional areas in particular.  This is vital in areas surrounding regional airports.  The economic and tourism development plan for the Shannon region, which was published recently, contains minimal funding commitments to enhance transport links in the region.  At a time when competition for airline passengers is fierce we must ensure local infrastructure is of world-class standard.</P>
        <P>As I am discussing transport and travelling, anybody who took part in the Seanad election can testify that we still have major problems with regard to signage throughout the country.  It is often mentioned in the context of tourism.  I hope it is addressed.  We have been assured it will be but it must be given a great deal of consideration.</P>
        <P>Aside from the clear obstacles which the tourism industry must overcome, issues such as changing consumer behaviour must also be taken into consideration.  Tourists are taking shorter and more frequent breaks, often opting for urban holidays rather than rural trips.  The increasing importance of environmental issues must also be considered.</P>
        <P>Another problem to be addressed is the fact that we are missing out on the key area of business tourism.  The delay in delivering a national conference centre in Dublin means we are missing out on an estimated &euro;25 million to &euro;50 million a year.  It is estimated that 870 conferences take place in Europe each year and the global conference market is estimated to be worth more than &euro;40 billion.  A national conference centre is required without further delay.  I could say a great deal more but I will conclude my remarks.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments to be made at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit as Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism.  We have all had the privilege of dealing with him as a Minister.  The Minister and I arrived to this House together on our first day as Members of the Oireachtas.  We will not say how long ago it was.</P>
        <P>The progress overall in the Irish tourism industry has been phenomenal during the past ten or 15 years.  Prior to this, 15 or 20 years ago, Irish tourism consisted of a few English anglers and many first and second generation Americans coming to find their roots.  This was the basis of our tourism.</P>
        <P>At present, our tourism is probably more broadly based than tourism in any other country in the world.  The Mediterranean countries sell sun tourism and nothing else.  Irish tourism sells a number of products, some of them unique.  We sell heritage products and other specialist products such as cruising.  We have also moved into adventure holidays.  These are areas mainly used by people with considerable disposable income.  Most of the people going on sun holidays are on extremely low, tight budgets and are not in a position to make the enormous contribution to the economy made by many tourists coming here.</P>
        <P>Proof of this is the development throughout the country during the past ten or 15 years of restaurants which are of the highest quality.  They have helped to make a contribution not only towards providing jobs but also encouraging people to come to Ireland.  The quality of the food in these restaurants, and of Irish food in general, is first class and cannot be surpassed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have also seen a major increase in the number of hotel beds available, particularly in Dublin city.  We now have multiples of what was available ten years ago.  Many of them are small hotels which provide a level of service one would not get in some of the five star hotels around the world.  They provide excellent quality and value and should be supported.  Many of them have been supported by means of tax breaks and other incentives and they have delivered to the State in terms of VAT and other revenues and in the number of jobs they have provided.</P>
<Col N="372"/>
        <P>I refer to the first major tourism initiative in a long time.  The Shannon-Erne waterway was opened in the early 1990s and at the time people said it would be a white elephant and it was given all the usual tags associated with such projects.  However, it has proved to be an enormous success not only in building links North and South of the Border but because the number of boats using the waterway has increased each year.  People might not be aware of this but there were 1,000 extra cruisers or boats on our waterways last year.  The main problem will be finding accommodation for them in the off season.  The people who avail of this tourism product have large disposable incomes.  They spend money in the towns and villages in which they moor at night and make an enormous contribution to their economies.</P>
        <P>I also compliment the Governments, North and South, on their decision in regard to the Ulster Canal.  It will mean we will have a joined up waterway which is very important for the future development of our cruiser industry.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the national conference centre and it is imperative that it progresses.  Like the outgoing Taoiseach, I regret we do not have a national stadium because if we had one, it would become another major tourist attraction.  Senator Jerry Buttimer would probably prefer if it were located in Cork but we cannot have everything.  It is a long way for me to travel to Cork.  Dublin is at least more accessible.</P>
        <P>The national conference centre will bring much business to Dublin and will result in maximum use of hotel beds.  At present there is very high occupancy from Friday to Sunday but we need to increase occupancy from Sunday to Thursday.  Much conference business is early to mid-week so the national conference centre will be of enormous benefit to this city.</P>
        <P>We talk about access to this country for tourists.  As far as tourism is concerned, the biggest thing to happen was low air fares.  Lower air fares have made a greater contribution to people coming here than anything else.  Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann offer flights at a price which is very attractive to tourists to come here for short breaks.  Much of our tourism business is short breaks.  The world has changed so much that people no longer go on holidays for two to three weeks.  The number of Irish people spending a lot of money on weekend breaks is increasing.  That is very important when we look at our overall tourism product.  I compliment Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann on what they have done.</P>
        <P>However, all this has not come about by accident.  Tax breaks and grant incentives were put in place over the years which encouraged people to invest in tourism.  Perhaps we should continue them but focus them on specific developments which would become national and international attractions rather than on some of the smaller projects, although I am not saying they should not be funded.</P>
        <P>The best tourism marketing was done last year when the international rally came to the north west.  Every hotel bed within a 50-mile radius of Sligo town was occupied for four or five days.  People only began to realise what was available.  The international groups were so impressed that they have decided to come in January 2009 for another round of the international rally, which is important.  We should put in place a national rally team which would market our tourism industry around the world.  We have put money into other projects but we should consider putting together a national rally team to sell Ireland everywhere a round of the international rally is held.  I ask the Minister to consider that, although I compliment him and North West Tourism on the funding provided so far.</P>
        <P>We do not get enough international publicity for many of the products we have to sell.  Tourism will become more important because other sectors of our economy are finding it tough.  International exchange rates are beginning to affect our tourism business.  The strength of the euro <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the US dollar and sterling is starting to cause problems for tourism oper<Col N="373"/>ators.  I hope we will be able to meet some of the shortfall in terms of the spending capability.  I do not believe the State can make it up and tourism operators will be forced to become more competitive to stay in the market.</P>
        <P>The outlook is very good.  The increase in the number of visitors and in the amount of money they spend has been phenomenal.  However, we must maintain the standard of the products we provide to tourists.</P>
        <P>There is a regional imbalance in that the majority of tourists end up south of the line from Dublin to Galway.  That is something we need to rectify.  There is a historic reason for that but it no longer exists.  The fact we will now promote tourism on an all-Ireland basis will make an enormous contribution.  We should sell an all-island product rather than a North-South or an east-west one.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of minor criticisms.  Some heritage sites are not being promoted, although I do not wish to see them promoted to such an extent that they will be vandalised.  Most heritage sites have reasonably good facilities but the smaller ones, which in some cases are more attractive to people going on heritage holidays than the larger ones, should be marketed on a county or a regional basis.</P>
        <P>A considerable sum of money is being provided in the national development plan.  However, the majority of the money must go into product development and promotion.  Without that, we will not go anywhere.  We must continue to promote the fact this is a green, clean island with fresh air.  Perhaps there is a little too much water and rain at times but people do not come to Ireland for a sun holiday but for a holiday which is different.  The Minister outlined how Ireland is classed as a friendly destination.  We must maintain the standards, initiatives and incentives.  If we do so, we will have a very bright future in tourism.  We have put in place the infrastructure required to deliver sustainable jobs.  It is important we have sustainable tourism and that people do not take one look at us and decide not to come back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I wish him and his officials, whom I know, well.  When it comes to speaking about tourism, I am effectively an insider trader in that I left F&aacute;ilte Ireland to become a Senator.  I worked in tourism for more than nine years with Bord F&aacute;ilte and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  From that point of view, my comments are based on my beliefs as regards where tourism needs to go and the areas that need to be addressed.  I do so based on the knowledge I gained during those years and from a perspective which may be a little different from others.</P>
        <P>I am the Labour Party spokesperson on tourism and from a policy point of view I am supportive of anything the Minister may do based on comments made here today.  The Minister will not be challenged by me for making difficult choices and putting in place policies that will assist in the promotion of tourism in the future.  It is worth noting that tourism is an important part of our economy.  I will not list all the relevant figures as the Minister has already done so.  Tourism hits the tentacles of all-Ireland in cultural, regional and integration terms in respect of services and the employment of 250,000 people.  It also assists people from a cultural point of view to adopt to a more modern Ireland and Europe, which is important.  Tourism is a &euro;6 billion industry which provides huge economic benefits for Ireland.  It is important to point this out.</P>
        <P>However, it is an industry which faces many challenges that need to be addressed.  While there was an increase in visitor numbers to Ireland last year there was no actual increase in international revenue, which is a concern.  It is a greater concern now given the position of the US dollar.  An opening exists for us to enter the eastern European market which has experienced huge progress during the past number of years.</P>
<Col N="374"/>
        <P>Senator Ellis referred to short breaks.  Short breaks is the way to go; they are what is pushing the market along.  More investment in this area is necessary particularly in respect of the eastern European market.  The most important aspect of Irish tourism is ensuring the Irish experience is maintained.  It is as simple as that.  It is the core defining factor and we must do all we can to protect it.  Competitiveness is a key issue from a value for money point of view.  Some 34% of people surveyed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland were not happy with our services, an increase of 10% during the past couple of years.  We all know what is happening.  How we address the issue is the problem.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister should encourage the relevant agencies to work with marketing groups, in particular, the Irish Hotels Federation, to ensure they do not view as negative having to sell their perishable goods at a reduced rate before they go out of date.  They should consider this a positive step.  I have been told they would rather offer bed nights for free than drop their prices.  They could learn a little from the airline industry.  There is value to be had in hotels.  However, the sector as a whole needs to be looked at.  A little bit of encouragement in this regard would not go astray.</P>
        <P>A key issue in respect of tourism is that of regionalism.  The regions are not getting the bang for their buck from tourism; it is as simple as that.  Dublin Tourism&rsquo;s share of the market increased by 32% from 1990 to 2008.  The agency is doing a good job and fair play to it.  However, Shannon and the mid-west region lost 7% of its share during the same period.  That is a significant issue.  The east coast and midlands area had no growth last year in terms of visitor numbers to the region and the mid-west region was down 5% in this regard.  Issues in regard to Shannon aside, this is significant.</P>
        <P>We have a hole in the doughnut effect in respect of tourism, namely, the southwest does well, as does the eastern corridor of Dublin, the southeast and Galway but, the middle of Ireland, the spine of the country, is not getting its bang for its buck.  We need policies that will encourage more people to visit that region.</P>
        <P>On the question of productivity and product marketing, I am fully supportive of incentive schemes such as the Shannon corridor scheme, be they tax orientated or otherwise, that would promote the mobilisation and marketing of products that will encourage tourists to visit the spine of Ireland.  It is important the Minister does this.</P>
        <P>People need to realise that domestic tourism is far more important to the middle of Ireland than is international tourism.  Some 70% of people who visit counties Offaly, Tipperary and so on are domestic tourists.  We need policies that will support this trend.  Mr. John Concannon is doing a fine job.  I appreciate what he is doing in terms of spreading marketing value over the whole year.  Also, I admire his campaign which seeks to show people the difference between travelling abroad and holidaying in Ireland.  I believe we need to make short breaks longer by extending them by one day either side.  This will help to create more share for the region.</P>
        <P>I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views in regard to the role of organisations.  There has been considerable change in organisational roles in respect of tourism in Ireland.  We now have F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  At a number of conferences I attended I heard the joke about the two Irishmen who went into a room to set up a tourism agency and came out having set up three agencies.  We were supposed to create an all-Ireland tourism agency.  We now have three agencies.  I ask that the Minister examine this issue while accepting it will have to be considered in co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  It is necessary that we have only one tourism agency.</P>
        <P>There is an overlap between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in terms of central services and marketing.  For instance, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is responsible for marketing golf in America while <Col N="375"/>Tourism Ireland is responsible for implementing it.  Also, marketing Ireland in America is the responsibility of Tourism Ireland.  That does not make sense.  The chief executive of Tourism Ireland agrees with me in this regard.  This issue needs to be addressed quickly.  There are overlaps in other areas also when it comes to issues such as event management and so on.  I do not believe this is acceptable in this day and age.</P>
        <P>Dublin Tourism should come under the umbrella of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I never understood how the campaign to keep it separate was successful.  I understand Dublin is a destination in its own right but I do not believe it should be dealt with by a separate agency.  I accept Dublin Tourism is doing an excellent job for Dublin.  However, it has a larger remit given Dublin is the main gateway to Ireland.  There is no way we will increase tourism levels in the east coast and regions to the required levels if Dublin Tourism does not facilitate people spending an extra night in the midlands rather than in Dublin.  This is not happening and will not happen unless the structure is changed.  I say that with regret because I admire what Dublin Tourism does for Dublin.  However, it must change if tourism in the rest of Ireland is to be successful.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development is effectively the mid-west tourism agency in all but name.  I can understand the need for an interim measure and accept Shannon Development has a property portfolio.  Will a change be made in this area in the future?  It has two boards which is confusing.  I ask the Minister to examine this.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has three offices in Dublin, one of which has been vacant for a year.  I do not know how much rent is paid for it but is it necessary to maintain it?  What is it being used for?  That is a concern.</P>
        <P>There are many other issues I wish to draw to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and perhaps as spokesperson I will get the opportunity to sit down with him to discuss these on another occasion.  I will, however, touch on two or three.  The agencies concerned cannot do the amount of work they wish to simply because tourism touches so many different departments.  I welcome what the tourism review has done and I  encourage the Minister to keep it going.  Often executives cannot achieve what they wish because there is not enough cohesion between Government agencies and Departments.  Blockage of communication in this area should be prevented.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister to maintain funding for secondary events throughout the country because they have a considerable impact.  The deregulation of self-catering was a mistake.  The decision was not favoured by executives and it will have an impact in rural Ireland where the accommodation bank has been cut by three-quarters in some areas.  If one goes to the Discover Ireland website, despite whatever anybody claims, one will not always be able to get the accommodation one wants in rural areas.  That is a negative and retrograde step which I hope the Minister can rectify.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Ellis regarding the area of heritage.  Formerly we had policies or strategies that were successful in the areas of events and sports.  Although Rally Ireland was excellent I am not sure that we get the bang for buck for the golf events that are brought into the country.</P>

	<P>Rally Ireland is a fantastic event.  If that money were pushed towards heritage, which is a product in itself and forms part of the broader Ireland experience, it would be more worthwhile.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on his achievements in this brief in the ten months since the Cabinet was established.  He has brought with him the experience of his previous briefs, which number four or five, and has achieved <Col N="376"/>much in each of the respective areas, arts, sports and tourism.  The statements he made today doubtless outline the need to re-examine  the dangers that accompany the requirement for a proper policy in tourism, particularly because of international economic adjustment, the appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling, and the need to have a tourism product that represents true value for money.  </P>
        <P>The elements of a tourism policy are simple.  We want to bring more people into the country and to encourage more Irish people to take their holidays within Ireland.  While we were going through a period of affluence, tourism was not perhaps as successful as we might have wished.  The most recent statistics, for February, admittedly not high tourist season in this country, show 70,000 more trips out of the country than came in.  Because we do not have a weather-related tourist industry we should strive to have an all-year-round tourist product.  We should aim to attract more people to the country and to enjoy what it has to offer at all times of the year.  The challenge for the Minister is to achieve that.</P>
        <P>The marketing of tourism on an all-island basis is welcome and we will reap rewards for it.  With regard to a consumer driven marketing drive, we may need to go further in the brand identification of particular tourist establishments.  In the past Bord F&aacute;ilte had its shamrock as did bed and breakfasts.  There is concern and ongoing debate about value for money as it applies to various destinations and, in this country in particular, to hotels.  Now that the euro will make it more expensive for people coming into the country perhaps we should initiate something similar to the old shamrock scheme whereby particular establishments are clearly identified as offering the best value for money.</P>
        <P>There are other ways for hotels and tourist establishments to identify themselves as being consumer oriented.  I took part in a conference yesterday organised by the Green F&aacute;ilte group, an organisation that gives accreditation to hotels for their environmental practice.  This might be for their waste and energy management, and for offering a service to customers that highlights environmentally friendly practice at the best possible level.  Under this scheme accreditation has been given to dozens of hotels across the country, mainly in the Cork area because that is where the scheme originated.  It has the potential to acquire international recognition for the type of quality tourist product we can offer.  It signifies that our hotels and tourist establishments are striving to achieve different standards that will appeal to a certain type of consumer.  The whole idea of green tourism has gone beyond the notion of the backpacker and the &euro;5 a day spending allowance, especially when we include what is called third age tourism, aimed at people who are retiring earlier and who want to travel.  In this regard, we could offer a tourist product that we probably are not yet exploiting to the greatest possible extent.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly mentioned areas in the country that appear to benefit most from tourism and he noted the south west in particular.  An argument can be made that even in those areas to which high numbers of tourists are attracted, within those areas dispersement does not take place. Cork, in particular, has to strive very hard to keep people within the city area.  We seem to have a short hand when it comes to tourism.  Tourists are encouraged to think of Blarney Castle and Killarney and are not being offered all that is on offer within particular regions.  That is also true of the spine of Ireland, the midlands region.  We must be more open in making those areas attractive.  Cork city works particularly hard to maintain its status as a festival city.  There is not a month during which there is not a dedicated festival in the city and most of them are very successful.   It hosts the film, folk, choral &mdash; which is on next week &mdash; and the midsummer festivals.  This is something other regions might try to emulate.</P>
        <P>The tourist industry has had the benefit of employing many non-nationals in recent years.  That has been to the advantage of the industry because the levels of helpfulness and courtesy shown by many non-nationals are raising standards in the industry that might have been some<Col N="377"/>what neglected.  Despite our reputation for being a friendly nation, in some of our tourist establishments those levels of courtesy have not always been what they should.  That has improved in recent years.  There are difficulties, however.  Language skills must be worked upon and if the tourist industry employs more such persons it must ensure that communications skills are improved, to accompany the diligence and the courtesy.  There have been some minor problems in this area.  The Department and tourism agencies should address this.</P>
        <P>As we are in a period of economic adjustment, emphasis must be placed on realising the potential of tourism as an economic constant.  If it is properly supported and reaches its potential, it can help us over this period of economic adjustment in a way that reliance on the construction industry would not because it is subject to fluctuations.  If we had an all-year-round tourism industry that would attract large numbers of people to the country, much of the uncertainty that exists now might disappear.  We need to reach that level and are making moves to do that.  The marketing of the island on an all-island basis is a move in that direction.  However, even the Minister would accept that there is a journey ahead and, while realising the potential of the Irish tourism industry, I am sure he would accept it needs a great deal more effort to get to where we want it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  This debate is important and timely given that we are about to head into the peak summer season of Irish and international tourism.  Senator Boyle spoke about the pillars of tourism.  If we think about it, it is about bringing in people, encouraging them to stay, having an enjoyable experience and, hopefully, having people come back while, at the same time, giving them value for money.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the work that has been done.  I note from his speech that we topped the Lonely Planet list as the world&rsquo;s friendliest destination.  I wonder about that at times.  In fairness to the people involved in the tourism industry at whatever level, they are committed to selling and promoting Ireland.  Those of who us who have done the Seanad tour, having encountered every county in this country, know that one will see great local tourist attractions and the beauty of Ireland.  We have stayed at many hotels and bed and breakfast establishments and appreciate and understand the importance of tourism in each area.</P>
        <P>It is important we continue to market in a strategic manner.  Senator Kelly rightly pointed out that there has been no increase in international revenue, which is a source of concern.  We have seen a decade of growth.  Senator Boyle referred to the fact that we are heading into a different economic period.  The importance of the Irish welcome, the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, should not be lost and hidden.  I may be wrong and am open to correction but I do not share the view that the new migrant workers have added to the Irish experience in many cases.  Sometimes I think we need to have a real cultural experience and inculcate in our new workers a sense of what it means to be Irish.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned that we are pricing ourselves out of the market.  An article in one of the Sunday newspapers addressed the different price structures of bed and breakfast establishments, evening meals, having a few pints and playing a round of golf in different countries.  We were ranked way behind Thailand in terms of prices.  We can blame outside market forces such as the pound versus the dollar, the slowing down of the economy or the costs of various things.  However, we must put things in context.  People now have only a small amount of resources that they use to go on holidays or short breaks.  I would like to hear a definitive answer regarding the pricing of Ireland as a holiday destination.</P>
        <P>We did not get value for money from our investment in the Ryder Cup, which was a wonderful occasion.  This was perhaps partly due to the fact it was on pay per view television.  I wonder why we did not get that.  That was a wonderful event and I commend the Minister and the <Col N="378"/>Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism on the role they played in the promotion of the Ryder Cup.  Why did we not get value for money as a consequence of it?</P>
        <P>The rally in Sligo should be used as a model and promoted throughout the rest of the country.  The former circuit of Ireland car rally brought people to places all over Ireland.  I remember as a young fellow heading to Killarney or parts of north Cork when Billy Coleman was there.  I am sure Senator MacSharry will refer to it in his remarks.  The importance of that rally and rallying should be a vehicle we can use again to promote Ireland.</P>
        <P>Coming from Cork, I believe it is important we acknowledge the role of Cork and Kerry as probably being the tourism capital of the country.  This has not come about by chance.  Figures reveal that there were 2.4 million visitors to the region last year.  The importance of Cork can be seen in the fact that the port of Cork and Cobh have embraced cruise liners with a new footfall of passengers to Cork city and beyond.  However, it is important we map Cork and promote it as a tourism region because it is a festival city.  There is, as Senator Boyle said, a substantial number of festivals and opportunities for people to come and visit Cork.  I ask the Minister to promote Cork in that regard.</P>
        <P>The tourism plans for the south west, which were announced recently by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, speak about the importance of expanding air access to Cork and Kerry and maintaining sea access to Cork.  If I can be a bit parochial, which I do not mind being, a commitment was given by the Minister to make Cork Airport debt free.  His successor in the Department of Transport has reneged on that plan.  We now have a situation where the airport in Cork is in a bit of a quandary.  The airport is important to the region surrounding Cork and for the promotion of tourism.  It is disappointing that Cork Airport has been left in the position it is in.</P>
        <P>Equally, we now have a situation where there is no sea access given what has happened to the Cork-Swansea ferry.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response regarding the different negotiations between the stakeholders in respect of the Cork-Swansea ferry.  We need to have sustainable growth in the south-west region of the country.  To do that, we need to have a vibrant airport and successful sea access between there and Great Britain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know the city manager in Cork and commend him and Howard Holdings on their proposal for Cork docklands.  Senator Ellis referred to the national conference centre.  I want to see a convention centre in Cork.  Cork has lost out to Dublin and Killarney in respect of the ability to hold conferences, including business conferences.  In fairness to Cork City Council, it has a tourism bureau and a tourism element to its campaign.  It has been built upon a very successful experience as European capital of culture.  Liz Meaney is a very vibrant arts officer in Cork City Council who is always probing and producing new and innovative ideas such as the Bealtaine festival, which is happening throughout the country, the Cork Midsummer Festival, the Cork Folk Festival; and the very important jazz festival.  I noticed that there is a new jazz festival in Ballydehob on the May bank holiday weekend, which adds a different string to the festivals in west Cork.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about tourism, I ask the Minister to look at attracting young people to Ireland.  Perhaps we could look at the concept of a Eurodisney, such as that which exists in France, or Alton Towers, which exists in England.  I believe there is a market for that and we could include it as part of the new tourism strategy by directly involving  more young people coming to Ireland by giving them a new experience in the guise of theme parks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire freisin.  Senator Buttimer made a great case for Cork as the tourism capital of Ireland.  An important thing to remember is that <Col N="379"/>possibly every parish could make the same claim.  That was the point the Minister was making in his address.</P>
        <P>I live in Cashel and can look out right across the Rock of Cashel.  For me, it symbolises our great heritage and indicates the respect for that heritage in the minds of discerning tourists who come to Ireland.  The best way to sell one&rsquo;s country is to bring what one has and others do not have to the attention of people.  If one has something that is exclusive, there is a very good possibility that one will be able to compete in what has become a very competitive market in every sense of the word.</P>
        <P>It might be no harm to look back on the development of tourism in Ireland.  Dr. Brendan O&rsquo;Regan, who was a great tourist advocate and activist, died recently.  I remember meeting him in the context of Shannon development, Bunratty Castle and all the development at that particular time.  He had a fantastic vision but was able to put it into action at a time when tourism was not centre stage anywhere in the world.  The work done by Bord F&aacute;ilte back in those days was exceptional because the same resources did not exist as perhaps exist today.  However, it showed great enthusiasm and commitment.  Every official of Bord F&aacute;ilte one would meet when he or she travelled to one&rsquo;s area would inspire one to reflect on the strength of one&rsquo;s region and what was required to promote it in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are doing an excellent job.  The point was made about Tourism Ireland marketing the whole island.  I recall meeting people during my visits to America at the height of the Troubles who were not familiar with Ireland or its geography.  We might have been in the middle of a big tourism marketing campaign when an incident occurred in the North which derailed that campaign.  Many people there did not know the difference between the North and the South.  They thought Ireland was a war-torn island.  Despite that, Bord F&aacute;ilte was able to maintain the vibrancy of our tourism industry.</P>
        <P>We are living in a new era now and the whole island is being marketed.  It did not make sense to market a part of the island and for the rest of the island not to be part of our focus.  When I was in New York in the past three weeks I had a chat with Mr. Joe Byrne in the Tourism Ireland office.  I was inspired by his confidence about the industry, even for this year.  There is great confidence about it among people there.  I can understand the reason for that.  The Minister said that the last major global survey places Ireland on top when it comes to friendliness and friendship.  I always thought that was our strength.  I knew the necessary infrastructure was required but I always believed that the fuel in the engine was our friendliness.  When one talks to people who have visited Ireland, they all comment on the friendliness of the Irish people.  That is possibly in some ways exclusive to ourselves or if not, it is certainly very much part of what we have to offer.  I hope that will never change and I genuinely do not believe it will.  It is characteristic of us to want to be with people.  Hospitality is inherent in our nature.  If that hospitality exists as well as the commercial side of tourism, we will do well.</P>
        <P>We get the name sometimes of pricing ourselves out of the market, but people often do not compare like with like.  People will sometimes compare the price of a meal in McDonald&rsquo;s in New York with that of one in a five star restaurant in Ireland.  If one were to go for a meal to a five star restaurant in America or any other country, one would realise what one would have to pay for it.  If there is unnecessary overcharging, it should be examined.  However, I would not like there to be a lowering of standards here.  Our standards today, be they in hotels, restaurants or pubs, are exceptional.  In many ways other countries cannot compare with them.</P>
        <P>I have one sad commentary to make about tourist accommodation, namely, the future of bed and breakfast accommodation.  They were ideal in the smaller areas where there were no hotels or other such infrastructure.  They accommodated people who wished to visit attractions in those areas.  Unfortunately, given the increase in bureaucracy, overheads and health and <Col N="380"/>safety issues &mdash; I am not saying this in a critical manner &mdash; bed and breakfast establishments find it difficult to cope.   While I do not have statistics on this, I would be surprised if not more than a third of them have gone out of business in recent years.  That is a shame because I believe the wheel will come full circle again.  Even the hotels are beginning to compete in price with bed and breakfast establishments, which makes it difficult for those establishments.  However, they still offer the attraction of interaction with a community.  Some people will still want to visit in Ireland, stay in a bed and breakfast establishment, have time to talk at the breakfast table and visit the local attractions.</P>
        <P>If we lose that accommodation infrastructure, namely, if bed and breakfast establishments cease to operate and a good association ceases to represent them, I am certain this type of infrastructure will not be set up in future.  When they came into existence initially, it was not only for commercial reasons.  There was a sense of hospitality and people who ran them wanted to meet people and give of their time to them.</P>
        <P>The owners of bed and breakfast establishments might be assisted in some respects.  Would it not be helpful if they could apply for a special licence to enable them to serve a drink in these establishments?  I do not know how that might be done.  One of the attractions for people is to be able to have a drink when they say in a hotel.  If they cannot have one in a bed and breakfast establishment, they will stay elsewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The point was made earlier that tourism is possibly the largest employer in Ireland.  I accept that.  It is important the industry is spread throughout the country.  There has been a greater focus on tourism in Dublin in the past seven to nine years.  Perhaps that is due to the tour operators who find it easier to do that.  It might also be related to the changing nature of Shannon Airport some years ago.  I remember a time when the numbers visiting Shannon, Tipperary and Galway were much greater.  Those in the tourism industry or the Department cannot tell visitors where to go but some mechanism might be found to encourage people to visit areas not currently being visited by tourists.  Dublin is becoming a little over-organised.  The experience of visiting Dublin in the past was that of a friendly, cohesive city that one could easily get around, but that has changed.  We need to review that aspect radically.</P>
        <P>I am convinced we can compete with whatever challenges are posed by other destinations in the world.  I envisage that China will become a great tourist destination, especially because of the antiquity of its heritage, but we can compete with that.  We can talk of our heritage dating back thousands rather than hundreds of years.  The discerning tourist will still want to experience that.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well.  In any Ministry he has held, he has been accessible and very much on top of the job, something to which Senator Cummins alluded.  I wish him well.  I have no doubt in my mind that the mere fact he was here for the full debate and did not have a Minister of State substitute for him after half and hour or an hour into the debate indicates his accessibility.  I wish him well and thank him for the encouragement he has given us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in this job.  I hope he will retain his portfolio because I have no doubt he will do a great job in the tourism portfolio, as he has done in the previous portfolios he has held.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt, as referred to by previous speakers, that the tourism industry is doing well in Dublin but poorly in the regions.  One must ask the reason for that.  If one stays in a hotel in Dublin, one need only ask tourists what regions will they visit.  They will tell one that they will visit a particular region.  If one asks them why they want to go to that region, they will tell one that they read about it in an international guide or that a porter in the hotel told them that this would be a good route to go.  The Minister must ensure all the regions have an <Col N="381"/>even share of the industry to enable them all to prosper and so that some do not get preferential treatment or a better write-up than other regions in international magazines.  That area should be addressed.</P>
        <P>One wonders why tourists travel here.  They do not come for the sun because we get more rain than sun.  It must be due to our hospitality and our friendliness.  Many people left our shores many years ago and often some of their relations or offspring like to come here to where their relatives came from.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is much we can do to promote tourist activities other than golf, although golf has been good to us.  The holding of the Ryder Cup here was probably not as good for tourism as it could have been as the weather on that occasion was pretty poor.  We have been pricing ourselves out of the market in recent years.  Services in the country have become expensive.  As one who is involved in the catering business, I appreciate the difficulties faced by hotel proprietors, owners of bed and breakfast establishments and those in the catering business, providing tourist accommodation or working in the service industry.  What with bills for electricity, refuse, water, insurance and wages, it is an expensive market in which to trade and many people are experiencing grave difficulties.</P>
        <P>There are one or two activities that are not being exploited at all.  Water sports, particularly sea sports, is one such activity.  The north Sligo coast is a renowned surfing area which should be further developed.  Hill walking and mountaineering are other activities that should be exploited.  In that context, I compliment Councillor Paddy McGuinness of Mayo County Council, who has been a great advocate of walking and mountaineering.  He has initiated a plan at county council level and the council has put in place funding to designate walking routes within County Mayo.  Those routes will be signposted and upgraded, with proper stiles and so forth.  He has received excellent co-operation from the county manager, the other councillors and officials.  There are a number of recognised and unrecognised routes in County Mayo and I presume it is the same for every other county in the country.  Much could be done in this area.  The Civil Defence could have an important role in this regard.</P>
        <P>If marketed properly, walking, hill walking and mountaineering could lead to a great expansion in the tourist industry.  This, coupled with the promotion of water sports, should be given more attention.  Golfing has become very expensive in this country.  Fishing, and particularly deep-sea fishing, could also be exploited more but additional funding is required.  Some of the boats that are being taken out of the fishing fleet could be redeployed for tourism initiatives.  Grants could be given to boat owners to provide sea-fishing services for tourists, which has enormous potential.</P>
        <P>I feel very sad for the bed and breakfast sector.  Bed and breakfast as an accommodation option is fast becoming a thing of the past.  Most people stay in hotels now when they go on holidays.  This is particularly true of family groups.  There has been a massive expansion in the number of hotels in the country in the past few years, through business expansion schemes, grants and tax breaks.  We have seen enormous growth in the hotel industry.  We now have more hotels in this country, per head of population, than anywhere else in the world which is an excellent sign.  I presume hotels engage in a lot of independent marketing, as well as benefitting from that done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The bed and breakfast sector is under severe pressure and the Department should provide it with every possible assistance.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to examine the possibility of developing hill walking and water sports as they are areas in which considerable expansion is possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is fantastic to see him here and I am particularly pleased he has not nominated a substitute for part of the debate, as so often happens with other Ministers.  </P>
<Col N="382"/>
        <P>I join with others in celebrating the fact we have come so far.  As the Minister indicated in his speech, tourist numbers in 1990 were approximately 3 million and grew to 8 million in 2007.  Revenue has risen in the same period from &euro;1 billion to &euro;5 billion.   Domestic tourism was worth &euro;0.5 billion in 1990 and is now worth &euro;1.6 billion.  There is no question that we have come a long way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I come from the regions, that is where my focus will lie today.  The new regional set-up within F&aacute;ilte Ireland is good.  I live in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland north-west area and it would be remiss of me not to pass on my good wishes to the Chairman of that body, the former Senator, Mr. Paschal Mooney.  I wish him and the chairmen of all the various regional tourism authorities success in their endeavours.</P>
        <P>Enormous challenges face our tourism industry.  Senators have referred to the cost of coming to Ireland.  As Seanad finance spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, I ask the Minister to use his good offices at Cabinet to determine if anything can be done to counteract the current situation whereby the cost for an American tourist to come here, because of the current exchange rates, is 100% more than it was a number of years ago.  As I said in the House previously, people from Derry who used to go to Letterkenny for a night out are now paying between 10% and 15% more.  That is a significant issue which must be taken on board.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Burke that we must diversify our expectations of what can grow tourism and we must play to our natural strengths. In that context, sports tourism is very important.  Senator Burke mentioned water sports.  Surfing is one of the fastest growing sports in the world and is growing rapidly in the west.  These days one cannot go to places like Easkey, Strandhill, Bundoran or Rossnowlagh without bumping into surfers from New Zealand, Hawaii and other parts of the world.  Such activities deserve our attention.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on Rally Ireland, in which I have been involved since it was the embryo of an idea.  Obviously, the real heroes are the promoters and the many volunteers who have made it happen.  However, on the political front, I would have pursued it from the very beginning.  It was an enormous success but, as Senator Kelly said, we may not realise how successful it was.  I am not sure we fully acknowledge how big an event it is and how great its contribution.  I fear that because it is not the chosen sport of the gin and tonic belt, like golf, tennis and so forth, it is not given the funding or focus it deserves.  It merits more attention from officials in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and other bodies, although some have been excellent and have supported the event.  I suggest, however, that we should front-load the event a little more and be more positive about it.  We must find ways to increase the State&rsquo;s involvement in promoting Rally Ireland.</P>
        <P>To put the event in context, the Cathaoirleach might allow me to mention a few figures.  The independent research carried out by the University of Ulster shows that 125,000 people attended Rally Ireland, which is an excellent figure for its first year.  We can expect up to 250,000 people to attend in the future.  The event was proven to generate between &euro;38 million and &euro;60 million.  The total investment from the State was &euro;1.5 million.  A grant of &euro;1.5 million was also provided by the Government in Northern Ireland.  This is a very positive aspect of the event &mdash; it brought the North and the Republic together to bid for a national event which was a tremendous success.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The television coverage exposed the north-west counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and parts of Northern Ireland &mdash; the next event plans to take in Mayo and Roscommon &mdash; to a potential audience of 816 million.  Of the 16 WRC events internationally, the Irish viewership was the greatest.  A total of 62 million viewers watched Rally Ireland.  To put that figure in context, an estimated 61 million watched the rugby world cup final, while <Col N="383"/>approximately 58 million watched the men&rsquo;s singles final at Wimbledon.  I wonder how much those events cost to stage.  Rally Ireland cost our Government only &euro;1.5 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows of the tremendous success of Rally Ireland.  On its first attempt, it came second out of 15 events held all over the world &mdash; second only to Finland which has been staging such events since the 1950s.  So impressed were the WRC adjudicators that they decided we would replace Monte Carlo, the most prestigious of the events, as the launching event of the 2009 rally season.  The rally will take place in January and in a region that is difficult to market at any time of the year we can expect to fill every single bed night in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Cavan and Mayo.  These are the facts but there is an attempt by some in certain quarters to devalue, talk down and underestimate the value of the event.  I hasten to point out I am not referring to the Minister or to many officials in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and particularly in F&aacute;ilte Ireland north-west.  I have spoken to the Minister about my frustrations in this regard and I am seriously concerned that in focusing more on the minutiae of administrative bureaucracy, we are putting at risk the largest sporting event held in the British Isles last year.  Because Rally Ireland was held north of a line between Dublin and Galway, as Senator Ellis said, the focus on it was not the same as it would have been if it were held in Clonliffe College or Tullamore, as we embark on a new regime.</P>
        <P>The investment in the event and the proven benefits in revenue and tourist numbers should be examined because the figures do not lie.  The University of Ulster conducted independent research into the impact of the rally, although officials in F&aacute;ilte Ireland were not happy with the figures.  They sought a different set of results from the University of Sheffield but its results were also positive.  The officials questioned whether the number of people who travelled to Ireland for the event was as high as the University of Ulster found.  However, the study proved the event provided value for the taxpayer&rsquo;s money.  How could it be anything else when an allocation of &euro;1.5 million returned &euro;50 million and exposure to 816 million people worldwide, which was more than the rugby World Cup final and the Wimbledon men&rsquo;s tennis final?</P>
        <P Just="Left">While many people in the Department, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, particularly in the north west, and Tourism Ireland are doing a fantastic job, the Minister must provide leadership.  I appeal to him to take an interest in this event to ensure we do not lose the greatest tourism asset that has ever come the way of the north west, apart from its natural attributes.  The rally is not weather dependent and it is tailor-made for us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for this fine debate and for their thoughtfulness.  I have taken a careful note of the issues raised as I may be unable to respond to all of them.  However, significant themes emerged.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Transport and access to the island is important, as Senator Cummins stated.  A successful tourism industry cannot be developed unless safe access to and from the island at a reasonable price is available.  That is the case increasingly and the advent of low-cost airlines has made that possible.  Many Members will recall paying &pound;200 to travel to London.  Everybody sat at the front of the airplane because companies were the only ones buying seats, as the ordinary consumer could not.  Those were different days and there has been a sea-change in this regard.  The advent of low fares has been a major factor.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis referred to sun holidays and the number of hotel bedrooms available in Ireland.  He advocated the development of this aspect of the industry.  I agree with him that the product base must be maintained, which means ensuring the number of hotel rooms remains at a sensible level.  We do not need to go overboard in this regard.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Kelly for his thoughtful remarks, which I intend to study further, and, in particular, his analysis of the relationship between Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the <Col N="384"/>Northern Ireland Tourist Board and how that feeds into Dublin Tourism and Shannon Development.  It is not a pretty picture and the question is whether the structure is practical and does the job.  When one considers the job that must be done, all these organisations hit the spot when the political situation is taken into account.  If one were  dealing only with commercial considerations, the structure would not be designed this way but when forced in the broader context of the Good Friday Agreement to design a political structure, the current model makes sense because it delivers a structure that otherwise may not be delivered.  Any structure is better than none but I intend to keep an eye on this to see if we can make it work better.  It works well currently in that Tourism Ireland, in particular, has a mandate to market the island of Ireland and nobody had such a mandate previously.  The Northern Ireland Tourism Board and Bord F&aacute;ilte did not do this in a formal sense.  For the first time since the Agreement was reached, an organisation is in place, which is active in 22 markets with the job of marketing the entire island.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle stated the number of people travelling abroad on holiday is more than the number of tourists coming in, which is a new phenomenon we must address.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer asked about the revenue generated by the Ryder Cup.  According to one consultant, the economic benefit of holding the event amounted to &euro;143 million, which was significant.  I thank Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for tracing the history of aspects of tourism, which we should all remember.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also thank Senator MacSharry for his comments about Rally Ireland.  I will examine this issue.  The rally was a major success and I pay tribute to everybody who took part.  The next event also will be a success.  It is an all-island production and anything of this nature deserves our full support because it has benefits far beyond the economics involved.  I will take a close look at that.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke referred to the importance of activity holidays while Senator Coghlan commented on the need for improved competitiveness.  He acknowledged that tourism is a competitive business, as we all know.  It was not always the case.  At one time visitors travelled to Ireland only from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day onwards.  However, we compete with other countries for every passenger to Ireland and must invest in this regard.  I confirm that the mid-Shannon tourism infrastructure investment scheme, which the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Cowen, and I will announce shortly, clears the way for us to put in place the formal commencement of the relevant legislative provision.  This is a tax scheme the Minister for Finance announced for eligible developments to improve water sports, training and adventure sport facilities, education, tourism, visitor attractions, etc. in the mid-Shannon region.  We will move ahead with that in the near future.</P>
        <P>This has been a good debate.  I have not gone into every aspect of it but there are a number of clear messages, one of which is that for the first time we must market the island of Ireland as an all-island product.  We no longer have the luxury to develop our tourism industry as two separate products.  We must understand that competitiveness is what it is about &mdash; prices, tax breaks and so on &mdash; and be able to compete with and beat other nations in these areas.  We must learn also to understand and handle in a caring, sensible way the significant and increasing number of non-nationals working in the industry.  We must deal with tourism on a regional basis rather than concentrate on the capital city.  The convention centre is coming on and it is important to get it up and running as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>We need also to understand the importance of synergy.  We must market the whole island of Ireland and win business such as the Ryder Cup, Rally Ireland and other national recreational, film, environmental or sport events that can be run on an all-island basis, thereby bringing <Col N="385"/>revenue to the island.  We must continue to develop products on an all-island basis.  The River Shannon is a sleeping giant which requires further investment.  I hope to ensure it gets that investment and continues to grow as a major product.</P>
        <P>The importance of access and low prices is paramount.  Access to and from the island must be maintained at a sensible price level.  If we follow that overall plan and drive it hard, we will stay close to the top of the world&rsquo;s tourism success league.  I thank the Chair and all Senators for their participation in today&rsquo;s discussion.</P>

	<P>Senator Ellis mentioned we should consider having a world rally team from Ireland.  We do, namely, World Rally Team Ireland, which is competing in Jordan as we speak.  It is supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Paul O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s Tourism Ireland.  The team won the world rookie championship last year and is competing in the world junior event this year, which I predict it will win.  However, it will need a greater level of financial support than it is getting this year if it is to continue.  This is something we should keep in mind.  Investment in the area is well spent considering the number of viewers involved, especially when they can see World Rally Team Ireland participating in these events.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och daoibh as ucht an deis seo labhairt libh inniu.  Tugann s&eacute; seans dom a r&aacute; ar&iacute;s go bhfuil meas f&eacute; leith agam ar an dTeach seo.</P>
        <P>My respect for this House and its Members derives from my long experience in dealing with the Houses while in public office and the contribution which is made by the Members of the Seanad by virtue of their diverse experiences, skills and talents.  Over the years I have always found this House to be immensely important in the democratic process.  As a sponsoring Minister, I especially recall the high quality of the debate on legislation in this House and the many improvements which were made as a result of debate and reflection in the generally calmer atmosphere that prevails here, relative to the other place.  Speaking in the Upper House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is an appropriate occasion on which to reflect on the importance of the democratic process, of confidence in representative structures and of the need for legitimate and respected fora in which grievances can be aired, contrasting policies debated and proper direction be given to the apparatus of the State.  Ultimately, that can happen and succeed only through the will of the people and their confidence in those who represent them and in the institutional framework within which those representatives carry out their duties.</P>
        <P>It is all too easy to forget the long struggle to create the political institutions in which we have the privilege to serve and which meet the test of public confidence and legitimacy.  This is not to be taken for granted.  On the contrary, we must be constantly attentive to ways of ensuring that our people understand and support the ways in which we do business on their behalf.  It is for that reason, that I have been supportive of the reflections of this House on ways in which Seanad &Eacute;ireann can play an even more active and strategic role in the public life of the State.  In particular, I believe that the capacity of this House to engage with longer-term issues and deeper challenges than generally constitute the day-to-day business of the Lower House should be used to the full.  I wish the House well in its continuing reflections on how its particular mission within the democratic process can evolve and develop in the years ahead.</P>
<Col N="386"/>
        <P>The absence of democratic institutions which commanded the confidence and engagement of the population was at the heart of the devastating conflict in Northern Ireland, towards the resolution of which I have dedicated a large part of my period as Taoiseach.  It was always my firm conviction that we could build a new relationship between the traditions on this island, and that we could move on in a new spirit of friendship, based on open dialogue and mutual respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad to say that, in the past year, we have seen remarkable progress in Northern Ireland, in relations on this island and relations between these islands.  This is taking a practical form through the important progress we are making in areas like transport and education, agriculture and the environment, tourism and energy.  I have no doubt we can make an enduring resounding success of our all-island economy.  We are committed to completing the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Executive, as we continue to implement the St. Andrews Agreement in full.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased that North-South co-operation is developing on a very practical level through the national development plan, including joint investment in strategic projects of mutual benefit to both jurisdictions.  I am especially pleased that the Government is contributing &euro;60 million to an exciting new joint innovation fund over the next four years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a political level, I was honoured last week to address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The establishment of the committee is an expression of the new political reality on this island.  At that meeting, we had representatives from North and South engaging on a matter of significance for the whole island.  It was regrettable but understandable that many Unionist representatives felt unable to attend.  I hope that one day public representatives from all traditions will feel able to engage together on issues that affect us all.  It is my belief that it makes eminent sense for all of us on this island to work together, for the benefit of all our people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My confidence in the future is increased by events like the one to which I am looking forward on Tuesday, 6 May when together with the Northern Ireland First Minister, Dr. Paisley, I will officially open the site of the Battle of the Boyne.  The opening of this new site and its impressive visitor centre will be a recognition of the significance of the battle in the history of Ireland and Europe.  It is also a symbol of how far we have travelled and of our desire for reconciliation between the great traditions that share this island.  Real and genuine reconciliation will enable all of us to move beyond the conflicts of the past and the legacy of history.</P>
        <P>A more thoughtful approach to the history of conflict on this island leads us to realise that we can best understand our history in the context of wider issues and forces which operated across Europe.  Long before we became one of the world&rsquo;s most open trading nations, we formed part of an international network.  At all stages of our history, from early trading contacts, through waves of migration across Europe, and from the early monks who set forth to preach the gospel in Europe, to the network of Irish colleges which remain part of our European heritage, Ireland and her people have been an integral part of a wider European identity.  Our membership of the European Community, and the development of the institutions and policies of the Union in the context of our shared values, are the modern expression of that identity.</P>
        <P>On 13 December 2007, I signed the reform treaty in Lisbon.  The treaty is designed to enable the European Union to manage 21st century challenges which, increasingly, are global in nature &mdash; such as climate change, energy demand, cross border crime and, of course, the global economy.  At the same time, the treaty rationalises the European Union&rsquo;s institutional arrangements so that the Union can function in a fair, efficient and effective manner.  It also brings into force <Col N="387"/>the Charter of Fundamental Rights to reflect the Union&rsquo;s values and to underpin the rights of the individual across the Union.</P>
        <P>An extensive information campaign is being conducted by the Government to ensure the public are well informed in advance of the referendum.  It is clearly desirable that the maximum possible number of citizens are encouraged to cast their vote.  I regret that so far, part of the public debate on the reform treaty has been based on issues which are not related to the text in any credible way.  An international treaty of this kind is inevitably a rather complex document but the substance to which it gives rise is clear and easily understood.  I regret that some have sought to use the necessary complexity of form and language to camouflage their true feelings about Europe and the European Union, or otherwise to create mischief.</P>
        <P>I welcome the efforts being made by the National Forum on Europe, by the political parties and by other concerned groups to ensure that the true facts are made known.  I acknowledge there can be legitimate differences about policy and institutional matters affecting Europe.  However, we must ensure these differences are grounded in reality and fully respect the right of the people to have accurate information and arguments put before them before they exercise their solemn duty under the Constitution.  I have no doubt that the Referendum Commission will be highly professional in its mission to encourage the maximum possible number of voters to participate on the day of the referendum.</P>
        <P>My advice to the Irish people is to maintain a clear focus on the core question of our relationship with Europe.  The record since our accession is very clear; whenever we have associated ourselves with the evolution of the European project, it has worked to our benefit both economically and socially.  Our European identity, apart from being rooted in history, has also been a critical element in shaping the context within which peace and reconciliation on this island have been developing since the wider European context and the Union&rsquo;s engagement with countries, regions and communities has enabled us all to rethink issues that are so important to us.  Ratification of the treaty will therefore provide a solemn basis for the continuation of that positive European engagement for Ireland, while enabling Europe as a Union to serve its citizens more effectively in the important and urgent areas where they look for effective support and leadership.</P>
        <P>I have never seen any conflict or even tension between my sense of being an Irish Nationalist in the republican tradition while at the same time being a European citizen.  On the contrary, I have seen the effective sovereignty of our country enhanced and deepened by our participation in Europe.</P>
        <P>In the same way as it has benefited relations on this island, European membership and the European context have also benefited the development of a more mature and friendly engagement with our nearest neighbours.  The European social model is a distinct contribution to political and social life.  By contrast with the prevailing philosophy in other parts of the globe, it is a model of which we can be proud and to which we have contributed our own distinctive experience.  The appropriate balance between national self-determination and collective action through pooling of sovereign authority is not just a matter of rules of subsidiarity, it is also a matter of mutual respect between the national and the European levels.  The enhanced role for national parliaments provided for in the reform treaty is an important expression of that respect.</P>
        <P>It is with the concept of respect that I wish to conclude my remarks.  My respect is not just for this House as an institution but for the work which Senators undertake for the common good.  I respect in particular the seriousness of purpose with which Members of this House go about their business as law makers.  This is true both of those large personalities who are national figures with a deserved public profile, as well as of those whose reputations are centred <Col N="388"/>on this building for the care and expertise which they bring to their work.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and all of the Members for the kindness and courtesy which you have shown to me in all my visits to this House over a long number of years.  I wish you all well for the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an historic day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As Leader of the House on behalf of all the Members I welcome our Taoiseach.  He has been very supportive over the years and his continued support has been much appreciated.  We are honoured to have him here in our presence today.  We welcome him as Taoiseach of Ireland and as someone who has shown wholehearted commitment to peace and reconciliation among the people on this island.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It must be a matter of great pride for the Taoiseach as he stands down from office to know that he was one of the prime movers in bringing lasting peace to our country.  Although there were many involved in the success that is now a peace in Northern Ireland and all of Ireland, he was the prime architect of this peace.  When many would have lost patience, he never gave up.  He remained focused on his goal, displaying extraordinary courage and wisdom.  The challenges posed were enormous, to remove the causes of conflict, of which there were many, overcome the legacy of history and heal the deep divisions of the past.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach recognised that for an agreement to be acceptable to all involved, it must take into account the various traditions on this island and encourage tolerance, equality and mutual respect.  This could only be achieved by bringing all parties together and encouraging a consensus on the way forward.  This is one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s strongest talents.  No one else that I know has had the same success in pulling people together from all parts of the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>When Fianna F&aacute;il went into Government in 1997 with our partners the Progressive Democrats, many people on the island said the Government did not have a chance of survival.  Time has proved them wrong.  It not only survived but was extremely successful.  Those of us who have been around for quite a long time as Members of this House and of the other House, can say this was the most successful time in our country&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>The survival and success came about because of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s personal qualities, his great ability to focus on the task at hand and his capacity to understand and accept other viewpoints and traditions.  This is the reason that Government survived and the reason he was elected successfully and consecutively three times by the people of Ireland.  This has only been achieved by one other Taoiseach in the history of our country.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ahern was also the Taoiseach that gave us the five-year term, a great relief for Senators. When I started out as a Member of this House in 1982, there were three general elections and three Seanad elections held in the space of 17 months.  One can imagine the difficulties and the amount of work done by any Member of Parliament in that period.</P>
        <P>This country has been a much better place because of Deputy Ahern&rsquo;s stewardship as Taoiseach over the past 11 years.  So much has been achieved.  Ireland under his leadership has experienced unprecedented economic prosperity.  A sign of this prosperity is that one third of all income earners are outside the tax net compared with a little more than one quarter in 1997.  In 1997 and 1998, 384,000 earners were exempt from tax and today, thankfully, the number of earners outside the tax net is 878,000.  The social welfare budget has trebled since 1997 and this prosperity has also enabled the Government to place special emphasis on the need to develop Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure, which is seeing an investment of &euro;10 million per day.</P>
<Col N="389"/>
        <P>Our economic growth averaged 7% over the past ten years, compared to 3% of our EU partners.  This has contributed to unemployment being cut from 11% to 5%, a significant achievement for a country with a history of soaring emigration and high unemployment.  The Taoiseach will remember the difficulties experienced in 1987 when he was Minister for Labour, with high emigration and unemployment.</P>
        <P>Our prosperity is a direct result of the diligence and commitment shown by Deputy Ahern as Taoiseach and leader of the Government.  He planned and implemented an economic, social and political course for this country during the past 11 years.  It is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s political judgment, determination and conciliatory manner that enabled him and his Government to shape the Ireland we live in today and to use our membership of the European Union to assist the transformation of our economy.  History will rightly remember the Taoiseach for the way in which he has led the State&rsquo;s economic transformation, for his achievements during Ireland&rsquo;s successful EU presidency in 2004, for the outreach of the Government to the Irish community in Britain and beyond and, above all, for the skills and tenacity with which he has driven forward the peace process.</P>
        <P>Whether in the United States of America, China, India &mdash; where he so successfully led the trade mission as part of which I had the honour and privilege of representing this House &mdash; Brussels, Northern Ireland, the Houses of the Oireachtas or anywhere in the State, it has been our privilege and pleasure to observe the unrivalled standards of statesmanship and political skill that have made the Taoiseach one of the most highly respected statesmen in the world.  It has been a pleasure and honour to work with him.  On my behalf, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in this House and on behalf of my colleagues on all sides of the House, I wish him a long life, happiness and success.  It is a privilege to have served under his inspired leadership.  Go raibh maith agat, a Thaoisigh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House and thank him for the honour he is bestowing on the Seanad in delivering his last Oireachtas address as Taoiseach in this Chamber.  It is an important occasion on which we put attack politics to one side.  There will be no arguments and nothing grudging.  Observers of our political system are more used to adversarial politics, the politics of debate and discourse which involve an Opposition holding the Government to account.  Today, however, is not a day for that.  While my party disagrees with the Taoiseach on many issues, including the health service, education, tackling crime and managing public services, it is apt that his statement centres on two issues, both of great importance to this nation, on which we have worked and continue to work with him.  These are the Good Friday Agreement and the peace it has brought to this island, North and South, and the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>The leader of the Fine Gael Party spoke yesterday about the traits that have allowed the Taoiseach to make his mark as a unique contributor to Irish political life.  Deputy Kenny referred in particular to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s diligence.  This means more than getting up early in the morning and working until late at night.  It means the grace under the pressure the Taoiseach displayed the week of his mother&rsquo;s death.  No one would have reproached him had he removed himself from the peace process negotiations that Holy Week.  Everyone would have accepted and understood that someone who had always been so close to his mother, who had never paraded but never concealed his great love and admiration for her, might need privacy and peace in which to grieve.  However, the Taoiseach had a broader commitment to the many families deeply grieved over many years by the carnage in Northern Ireland.  His commitment was to the ending of a cruel conflict if it could be ended.  He went to the North that Holy Week and worked day and night in the interests of peace.  It was a much sought after <Col N="390"/>peace, a peace worked for by his predecessors of all political hues.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s actions were those of a politician with a sense of duty to the future.</P>
        <P>That sense of duty to the future has also been shown in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to the idea of a union of European nations.  He steered a successful European presidency in 2004, which demonstrated his deal-making capacities and illustrated the role Ireland can play at the heart of Europe.  As we face into a referendum on the future of Europe, we have worked with the Taoiseach towards the passage of the Lisbon treaty which will ensure Ireland&rsquo;s continued position at the core of the European Union.  Our country has gained enormously from its membership of the EU.  The State has a competence and confidence it would never have had without that membership.  The Taoiseach will agree the European Union has the same roots as the Good Friday Agreement.  It is rooted in the belief that war is preventable, life is precious and concentrated, diligent work towards co-operation within a wider Europe will make the EU a profoundly effective means of ensuring peace in our time and for our children.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s work for peace is arguably the single most important task he has undertaken in all his years in politics and should be a source of continuing pride to him in his retirement.  His legendary work rate and ability to work effectively with others is known to all.  Today is a day when we thank the Taoiseach for his service, efforts and commitment.  We also thank his family and friends because we know that politics takes its toll on personal time with loved ones.  We thank the Taoiseach for his public service to this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s presence today allows us to acknowledge his ongoing public service on behalf of the State.  He has spoken on two issues that are important for the future success of the country, and his role in both must be acknowledged.  It is for the electorate to adjudicate on the Lisbon reform treaty.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s role, under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, in securing agreement on a draft constitutional treaty of Europe requires special acknowledgment.  It is something to which the EU may yet return.  Much of the confusion that still exists about the functions and structures of the EU could have been dealt with more adequately by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s work in producing a single document that was easily understood than via subsequent developments.  I am certain the European Union will return to that work.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s success in developing the Northern Ireland peace process deserves repeated acknowledgement in terms of the political history of the State.  That it was done at great personal cost in terms of family life adds to the debt the country owes him.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach deserves great credit too for his work on the social partnership process.  Several partnership agreements have been devised through his skills in conciliation and his brokerage.  Several important social documents have been produced which brought about greater cohesion and economic success.  The Taoiseach has perfected a model that all in public life must seek to emulate if we are to ensure this State&rsquo;s continued success.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach showed his political skills too in developing his party as a party of Government and in ensuring Government was about compromises and working with others to agree programmes for Government that were in the best interests of the State.  In 2007, the Taoiseach made the decision to bring my party into negotiations with his party to form a new Government.  He has undertaken the same process in respect of other political parties in this Chamber.  It is another of his notable political achievements that future Governments will be built upon that consensus model.  The State can only operate effectively by achieving that level of agreement.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has had an impressive political tenure with more than 30 years as a Deputy, several years as a Minister and 11 years as Head of Government.  He was remarkably young when he became involved in politics.  I was 12 years old when he entered Dublin Corporation and 14 years old when he was first elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Despite this, our political lives have <Col N="391"/>seemed to intersect at significant times in the life of this State.  Before I had the honour of being a Member of either House, the Taoiseach gave me the honour, through the social partnership process, of being appointed to and serving for several years on the National Economic and Social Council.  That honour was added to when he appointed my colleague, Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, and me to serve in this House as the first representatives of our party.  I would like to highlight that the decision to bring the Green Party into government had to have been made by the Taoiseach, as an individual, based on the further needs of this country and the need to build on political co-operation and consensus.  I may be selfish in thinking it might be seen to be the highest of his political achievements.  There are many more to come.  He is still a relatively young man, especially in political terms.  I am certain he will continue to have a public service role on behalf of this country, perhaps in the international arena where he has gathered so much experience.  That experience must be put to the best use for this country.  Thank you, Taoiseach.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach, whom I welcome to the House, understands better than most that the Independent group does not have a leader.  I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues, particularly the father of the House, Senator Ross.  We wish to be associated with the remarks that have been made so far.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment and success in a number of areas, including his constituency, the State, the island and Europe.  It all needs to be looked at.  I have been aware of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency work since I got involved in public life, just after he was elected.  At that time, we were trying to deal with a difficult group of young teachers in a school in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency.  They had a particularly difficult leader, who is now making life difficult for the Taoiseach from the backbenches of the D&aacute;il, where he is known as Deputy Finian McGrath.  I remember the Taoiseach talking to me about Deputy McGrath in the late 1970s or early 1980s when he was looking for an extra teacher for the school in which he was teaching at the time.  The Taoiseach has always had a great concern for his constituency.  In those days, he was trying to get something moving in the area of school disadvantage.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach for leading the way in his party in terms of getting recognition for educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>It is poignant that today marks the first time that talks on a national agreement are taking place without my involvement or that of the Taoiseach.  We hope they can carry on without us.  I know they can do without me, but I am not sure they can do without the Taoiseach.  I hope his wisdom will be available to them.</P>
        <P>The key to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s character has been the trust he inspires in people and shows in them.  I can think of many occasions on which he had to take a leap of faith.  He had to accept the word of people like me.  He did not mind having to make hard calls in various situations.  I recognise his skill as a negotiator.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the commitment and involvement you showed during your two terms as Minister for Labour.  I recall talking to you on Leinster Lawn in 1989 as the then Taoiseach prepared to announce his new Cabinet.  You intimated to me that you would not mind a move from the then Department of Labour.  I said I would be quite happy if you stayed in that Department, which you did on that occasion.  You were accessible at all times as you revised this country&rsquo;s policy in the labour area.</P>
        <P>Many tributes have been paid to the Taoiseach over recent weeks.

There is no point in me adding to such comments other than to recog<Col N="392"/>nise, as Senator Fitzgerald did, the skills shown by the Taoiseach during the negotiations which took place when Ireland held the EU Presidency.  We all took pride in what the Taoiseach did during that high point in his career.</P>
        <P>In paying tribute to the Taoiseach, it is worthwhile to mention that there are ups and downs in all political lives.  I can say without hesitation or fear of contradiction that when the balance sheet is drawn up to reflect the course of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s political life, I have no doubt that what is on the credit side will far outweigh anything that might appear on the debit side.</P>

	<P>I will conclude by taking issue, in a marginal way, with a line that appeared in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech, in which he described himself as &ldquo;an Irish Nationalist in the republican tradition&rdquo;.  I think he is selling himself short.  I see him as a republican in the true and purest sense &mdash; a Tone republican with a vision of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter together in a country with a fair and equal society.  That is how I have seen the Taoiseach in the years in which I have known him.  It is for that I pay tribute to him today.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; leat &mdash; I wish you well.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  I extend my best wishes and the best wishes of my party to him as he spends his last few days in office.  As Taoiseach, he has used his unique and extraordinary political ability for the great benefit of our country.  His political skill, dedication and hard work have delivered historic and permanent political agreement and peace to the island of Ireland.  It is most appropriate that one of the final events he will attend will be the opening of the new Boyne centre.  Five years ago, few people would have thought such an event could take place.  The Taoiseach has been central to the process which has brought us to the point at which it is possible.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cassidy mentioned, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s political skill delivered 11 years of stable partnership Government.  The stability of the coalition has brought about an unsurpassed economic performance and a higher standing for Ireland in the EU and internationally.  I intend to maintain the strong, stable and fruitful relationship that has been built between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il in recent years.  The achievements of the Taoiseach, which I have mentioned, will be his permanent and lasting legacy.</P>
        <P>All of us in this House entered public life in the hope of delivering improvements for the people in our communities.  Few, if any, public representatives complete their public service with anything like the scale of the achievements attained on behalf of the people of Ireland by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The Taoiseach, along with his family and his many friends and supporters, can be very proud of his service to this country.  I wish him well in whatever role he chooses to adopt as he sees out his contribution to Irish and international politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Taoiseach to the Seanad this afternoon.  I assure the Taoiseach that the atmosphere in this House is not always as calm as it may seem today.  We have had our less peaceful moments here, even in recent weeks.  We welcome the Taoiseach here and take this opportunity to wish him well in the future.</P>
        <P>When I was trying to reflect on when I first heard the name &ldquo;Bertie Ahern&rdquo;, I was brought back to my youth.  Like Senator Boyle, I was 12 or 13 when I became aware of the man who was to become the Taoiseach.  At the time when I was growing up, not too far from where the Taoiseach grew up, I had a keen interest in politics and current affairs.  As young lads do, I used to have arguments about such matters with some of my friends who lived on the same road.  I was a strong supporter of the Labour Party, even in those days.  There was one guy who <Col N="393"/>was fairly quiet, but with whom I could not get any measure of agreement.  He would murmur something when we were having our initial discussions, before coming back to me the following day armed with many arguments illustrating why I was wrong and he was right.  After this had happened three or four times, I decided to ask him where he was getting his inspiration from, 24 hours later.  He told me he used to consult a friend of his in Drumcondra, Bertie Ahern, with whom he used to play football and do some work for Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is obvious that the Taoiseach inspired many young guys during that time.  Some of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s leadership qualities and managerial skills, which have been much remarked upon over recent weeks, were probably honed in those years when he managed the All Hamptons team.</P>
        <P>I am honoured to wish the Taoiseach well on behalf of the Labour Party in this House.  His career has been an enormously successful one, without parallel in this country in the modern era.  Other Senators have made points about his contribution to the Lisbon treaty and the North.  I will come back to the North in a minute.  Politicians in other parties, and perhaps in Fianna F&aacute;il, can only marvel at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s incredible attention to detail.  He seems to manage to be in many places at the same time.  When I ran in Dublin South in last year&rsquo;s general election, my brother rang me from down town one Saturday morning to ask me the time at which we were going out canvassing.  When I suggested that we should go out at<?oasys _jy ?>11 a.m., on the basis that Saturday morning tends to be quite slow, he asked me if I was joking.  He said he would call over to me immediately to get started because the Taoiseach had already called to his door, even though it was just 9.10 a.m.  His ability to canvass and have his finger on the pulse locally while at the same time being involved in momentous national and international political events is truly astonishing.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s style was also commented on.  Again, one can only stand back and wonder at his ability to turn adversity to his own advantage.  I find it extraordinary.</P>
        <P>I do not want to introduce any note of adversity into the debate but I believe it was Deputy Pat Rabbitte who stated that politics in this country may have reached the stage where the only central issue is who will dance with Fianna F&aacute;il.  It seems to be in the minds of some commentators.  It is a pity if it is the case and I state that with all generosity to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and my friends in Fianna F&aacute;il.  No country can afford to have its politics defined solely and forever by one political party.  We as a society and a community need to understand this.</P>
        <P>In response, the Taoiseach might state it is up to the Opposition parties to come up with a coherent alternative set of ideas, policies and proposals for the Irish people.  This is right and I agree with it.  It is what democracy is all about.  No opposition can expect to remove a government simply because it has been there for so long.  This is not a good enough basis for putting any government out of power.  I freely accept this.  However, I have a difficulty with big church politics or, if I may say so, big tent politics.  I do not believe it will serve well the democracy the Taoiseach believes in so much.</P>
        <P>I will finish my remarks by discussing the peace process because nobody can take from Bertie Ahern the extraordinary achievement for which he is responsible in respect of the North.  The image of the bodies in the ditch announced on the nine o&rsquo;clock news every night of the week when I was a young lad 20 or 30 years ago is gone from our public life.  It is not an exaggeration but it is a bit of a clich&eacute; which must be repeated that there are people alive today who would not otherwise be were it not for the work of Bertie Ahern and others who brought the peace process to the stage it reached.  It is important we reflect on this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of more unpleasant aspects of the 1990s was the fact that politicians such as Bertie Ahern, Dick Spring, Albert Reynolds and John Bruton had to withstand a major level of attack from some quarters for what they were doing.  Sometimes they were told they were na&iuml;ve for <Col N="394"/>talking to Sinn F&eacute;in and that they were crossing a line they should not have crossed.  They stood up for what they were doing and kept calm.  They spoke to people to whom perhaps they did not rejoice in speaking.  However, they did so because in the words of Fergus Finlay, they knew the principle of the penny candle applied.  This meant the peace process talks were not worth a penny candle without the involvement of Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>During recent days I have been reminded of this stance while observing what Jimmy Carter is doing in the Middle East.  He stated precisely the same about Hamas.  Talks are not worth anything without Hamas whether we like it or not and many of us do not like it given what was perpetrated.  Those talks will not come to a successful conclusion until someone some day talks to Hamas.  We could have stated 15 years ago that the talks on the North would not come to fruition and be successful unless someone spoke to Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is what was done and we all owe a large debt to the Taoiseach for the major success which flowed from it.  Others were involved also but this is an important occasion on which to honour the Taoiseach&rsquo;s achievement.</P>
        <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in his address to the Houses of Congress in the United States next week.  I also wish him well on a personal level.  I extend heartfelt best wishes to him and his family on his retirement from his current position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also join in the tributes to the Taoiseach as he steps down from office.  He has made an enormous contribution to Irish political life and governance in his long career as a councillor, Deputy, Minister and Taoiseach.  Who knows what further high office he may hold on a future date.  Essentially, the Taoiseach is a man of the people but also a true statesman not only on the national front but also on the European and international stages.  His negotiation skills were evident at an early stage in his career, especially as Minister for Labour during times of industrial unrest.  Those skills also led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and ultimately to peace on our island.</P>
        <P>His dedication, hard work and leadership qualities produced exceptional electoral success which gave rise to three consecutive terms in Government.  On a personal note, I thank him for the honour bestowed on me in August 2002 when he included me as one of his 11 nominees to the 22nd Seanad.  I wish the Taoiseach well, good health and fortitude in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>St. Mary&rsquo;s primary school in Virginia has an enrolment of 355 students.  The school was originally built to cater for 150 students.  Since being built, St. Mary&rsquo;s has never had an upgrade.  The school uses ten portakabins, two of which were paid for by the parents <Col N="395"/>in the parish at a cost of &euro;58,000.  The total cumulative cost of the rent of the portakabins to date is &euro;98,473.  I have itemised the details on this and can supply them to the Minister.  The total cost of installation of portakabins to date is &euro;65,638.  The grand total of the cost of portakabins to date is &euro;222,111.  Another portakabin for the staff is due for installation for the 2008-09 school year.</P>
        <P>Based on the projected demographic profile of the area, we expect that further portakabins will be required in 2010 and 2012.  Based on current spending and the new costs associated with these projected requirements, we calculate that the total outlay for installation and rent will have risen to approximately &euro;1 million by 2014.  The 2006 census showed the population in the school catchment area was 3,188.  This is an increase of 34.5% from 2002.  It is projected to exceed 4,000 by 2010.  A total of 633 residential units have been constructed in the area since 1 January 1999.  As of 30 June 2007, a total of 108 residential units were under construction and 403 planning permissions were outstanding.</P>
        <P>After a meeting of the parents&rsquo; association in December 2006, St. Mary&rsquo;s national school was placed on a list for future school development to have 16 classrooms with ancillary rooms.  This meant ten classrooms would be added to the existing six classrooms.  That was followed by a ministerial announcement on 5 April 2007.  On 22 May 2007, a technical team from the Department of Education and Science visited and inspected the school.</P>
        <P>On 11 June 2007, there was a meeting in the Department outlining the steps to build the extension which will take approximately 30 months to complete.  Between September and November 2007, there were weekly telephone calls and at the end of November, the project progressed up to another stage.  On 26 November 2007, e-tenders opened for statements of interest from architects, quantity surveyors and engineers for 30 days.  On 26 December 2007, the Department extended the e-tender process to 7 January 2008.  There were 95 applicants.  The matter was to be progressed as quickly as possible in order to keep things moving.  A committee was appointed to provide a short-list of professionals and letters were sent to unsuccessful candidates.  On the day those letters were sent to unsuccessful candidates, the committee was told to contact the Department of Education and Science and seek documentation for the next stage &mdash; the awarding stage, narrowing the candidates down to one professional in each field.</P>
        <P>Despite several telephone calls, the Department of Education and Science will not forward the required information to progress to the next stage.  The school has been told the project is on hold.  At what stage is St. Mary&rsquo;s national school?  What does it need to do to move to the next stage?  When does the Minister envisage it will achieve that?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school&rsquo;s electrical system requires upgrading due to the extra cabins.  The water system does not have the required capacity and also requires upgrading.  Children have reported that portakabin classrooms are cold during winter.  As a member of the teaching profession for many years, the Minister will appreciate my next point.  Play areas have been reduced due to the cabins.  Children are not allowed to play on grassy areas during wet weather which means 355 children now play on greatly curtailed tarmac areas and they are not allowed to run.</P>
        <P>During the last general election campaign, the parents were told the building was imminent, so there is some local anxiety at the present situation.  I look forward to a positive answer from the Minister.  Will she indicate how the school might progress to the next stage?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for sharing his time.  There is an urgent need to appoint a design team to progress the provision of permanent accommodation for St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Virginia, County Cavan.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly <Col N="396"/>pointed out, St. Mary&rsquo;s currently has 350 students enrolled in the school which was originally built to cater for 150 students.  There have been no upgrades to the school since it was initially built.  I understand there are ten portakabins in use, two of which were paid for by the parents and the parish.  Another portakabin is due for installation this September.</P>
        <P>The population of Virginia in the 2006 census was 3,188 &mdash; an increase of 34.5% from the 2002 census.  It is projected to exceed 4,000 by 2010.  The status of residential units in Virginia as at 30 June last year was as follows: constructed since 1 January 1999, 633 units; under construction, 108 units; and outstanding permission, 403 units.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is aware, our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, has made ongoing representations to her and the Department of Education and Science in an attempt to speed up the provision of this very urgent project.  Councillor Shane P. O&rsquo;Reilly and members of the board of management of St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, in particular, Mr. Sean Dowd, have been in constant contact with me in regard to this issue.  There is frustration among the parents of the children attending the school and I urge the Minister to progress this urgent request as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Reilly and Senator Wilson for raising this issue.  I am very conscious of the story in regard to St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Virginia because of the enormous expansion in the numbers in the school and the development of the area around Virginia.  It is for that reason we indicated last year that we would appoint a design team.</P>
        <P>The Senators will know &euro;4.5 billion has been allocated specifically for fast developing areas and for the school building programme generally.  It is in that context we are trying to undertake as many refurbishments, extensions, replacements of school buildings, etc.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the need of St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, I can confirm the process of appointing the design team has commenced.  The appointment of the team will enable the school to progress.  That process has now started so I do not anticipate much further delay in that regard.</P>
        <P>Moving through the system must always be done in the context of whatever money is available.  However, I recognise St. Mary&rsquo;s has considerable need and it has been drawn to my attention not only by the two Senators here but particularly by the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith.  It is our intention to give the school top quality accommodation as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister is more than aware of the serious requirement in south Galway for the provision of a new second level facility.  A very active and committed group of parents and staff in Seamount College has spent almost two years gathering an irrefutable raft of evidence which certainly makes a very strong case for such a facility.  Her officials and staff have agreed that is very much the case.</P>
        <P>Only a few months ago, the Minister kindly gave a commitment to provide such a facility in the environs of Kinvara in recognition that it was the right place to locate it and of the strong and proud tradition of second level education there.  With that commitment, the Sisters of Mercy have agreed to once again begin an intake of students into Seamount College and we hope it will continue.</P>
<Col N="397"/>
        <P>The commitment is that the school will be operational by 2012.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would bring us up to date.  What progress is being made in regard to the acquisition of a site for the school in Kinvara?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cannon for raising the issue of the need for a second level school in Kinvara which has been ongoing for the past year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of increases in population in the south Galway area and the decision of the Sisters of Mercy to close Seamount College, Kinvara, on a phased basis, the Department determined that a new post-primary school would be required in the south Galway area.  Accordingly, the commission on school accommodation was requested to conduct a survey of school accommodation in the area to determine the location of the proposed post-primary school and to identify other locations where additional school places may be required over the next five to ten years.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The survey, which facilitates proactive planning, is based on a transparent process of consultation with interested parties from the area.  A total of 25 submissions were received from trustees, boards of management, principals, teachers, staff and parent groups as well as others with an interest in educational provision in south Galway.  The survey also involved analysis of key factors such as demography and population, house building, Galway County Council local area plans, enrolment trends at both primary and post-primary levels and visits by members of the technical group to schools.</P>
        <P>The commission published its report in January 2008.  The report&rsquo;s recommendation for Kinvara state:</P>
        <P LI="1">[That] a co-educational post primary school for [around] 800 students should be provided in the northern environs of Kinvara.  This school should cater for the Kinvara catchment area including traditional areas of North Clare, Ballinderreen and Kilcolgan, and should also cater for students from Clarinbridge and Oranmore for whom it may not be possible to make provision at St. Calasanctius Secondary School, Oranmore.  Steps should be taken by the Department of Education and Science to identify and acquire a site.  This school will be required for the 2012-13 school year, to coincide with the closure of Seamount College.  The detailed implementation of this recommendation will invariably involve the amendment of perhaps several catchment areas in the South Galway area. The Department of Education and Science will need to address this issue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Details of the survey and recommendations may be viewed on the Department of Education and Science website<i> www.education.ie.</i>  The survey also deals with the accommodation needs in the areas of Aranmore-Clarinbridge, Claregalway, Athenry and Gort-Ardrahan.</P>
        <P>When a new school has been approved a number of procedures and processes must be undertaken and these can take some time to complete.  The main stages are the identification and acquisition of a suitable site, design of the building, application for and granting of planning permission, invitation to seek tenders and construction.</P>
      
        <P>The property management section of the Office of Public Works, OPW, which acts on behalf of the Department in regard to site acquisitions generally is being requested to source a suitable site for the school in question.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  The project in Kinvara will be obviously considered in that context.  There is a commitment to <Col N="398"/>ensure that, following agreement with the Sisters of Mercy and the closure of Seamount College, Kinvara, the new school will be in place for the 2012-13 school year.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator Cannon that my Department is committed to providing high quality accommodation for the Kinvara area at the earliest possible date.</P>
