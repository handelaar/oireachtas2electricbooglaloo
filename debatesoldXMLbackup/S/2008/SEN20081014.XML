	<P>I have received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the funding he is providing for the clean-up of the polluted Lough Corrib, the original source of Galway city and county water.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide school transport for the children living on the Quivvy Road, Belturbet, County Cavan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the standards in place for dental surgeries and the audit, if any, that occurs to ensure standards, given the ongoing concerns in relation to bugs such as MRSA.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to improve services for cyclists in Dublin city centre.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the retention and enhancement of the colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide additional accommodation at Dromahane national school, Mallow, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Healy Eames, O&rsquo;Reilly and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   The remaining Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the important role of volunteering in Irish society, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 3 p.m., with spokespersons having 12 minutes and all other Senators seven minutes, and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons or group leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In last year&rsquo;s Budget Statement, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The fundamentals of our economy are still good &mdash; a point often lost by some. . . . Overall economic and budgetary parameters . . . will ensure that Ireland maintains a sound and sensible fiscal policy, fully in line with the provisions of the EU&rsquo;s Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am sure the current Minister for Finance is wondering today what country the Taoiseach was speaking about last year.  Public finances are in a shambles and we are facing one of the most difficult budgets the country will ever have.  It emerged last week that the Government spent more than &euro;14 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on hiring private firms to administer the scheme to reimburse those affected by illegal nursing home charges.  This is the type of waste that has been ongoing in this Government and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments over the last ten years.  This type of waste will have to be cut out today.  We will support the cutting out of waste such as this, but it should have been done over the last ten years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ensure that No. 22 on the Order Paper, the Civil Liability (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2008, is dealt with.  In addition, I ask the Leader when the credit institutions scheme will be put before us.  We spent some time discussing the banks.  The urgency of it was stressed a number of weeks ago, but we still have not seen the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well on this critical day in his career and in the life of the country.  This is not a time for smart-ass, partisan politicking.  The circumstances are far too serious.  We have had the largest stock-market crash since 1929 and we are probably heading into a slump.  This has been triggered by the criminal greed and irresponsibility of the Bush-Cheney Administration.  It is significant that the $700 billion that will be necessary to plug the hole in the banks is precisely the amount the Iraq war adventure has cost.  We should take note of the fact that the so-called war on terror was used to mask a massive attack on civil liberties and human rights.  I hope this economic crisis will not be used in a similar manner to mask an attack on the most vulnerable sections of our society.  These are the people who need to be protected most.</P>
        <P>I wish to flag concern &mdash; it is appropriate that it would come from this House &mdash; at reports from yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers that in the justice area a series of agencies are to be merged, including the National Disability Authority, which is in the middle of preparing the national disability strategy.  This is not the time to be fiddling with it.  Also included are the Equality Tribunal and the Equality Authority.  In the past the Government has overridden that authority&rsquo;s recommendations and so it must not be further weakened.  Also included is the Irish Human Rights Commission, which was established statutorily.  It is required to be an exact parallel to that existing north of the Border.  This should not be tampered with.  It is also proposed to assume the Combat Poverty Agency into the Department of Social and Family Affairs&rsquo; office for social inclusion.  This will simply make it an arm of Government and will <Col N="427"/>prevent it from independent research and reporting and being positively critical of Government policy.</P>
        <P>We in this House must play a role in safeguarding the rights and welfare of the most vulnerable people in our society.  In the past year I have regularly raised the issue of the increase in the number of home repossessions of people getting into difficulty.  This increase is gathering speed.  The courts had a series of repossession orders on which the judges have commented.  It is significant that now every institution, including all the financial institutions that are being baled out, is applying for repossession.  This is not tolerable.  I agree with Senator Obama in the United States who called for a moratorium on repossessions for three months, which we also need in this country.  I am calling today for precisely that kind of moratorium.</P>
        <P>We are in the middle of a global situation.  However, we have played our own role through incompetence and lack of supervision.  I heard this morning that in the health service, for every front-line person engaged, there have been two managers.  That is madness.  We played our own provincial role in this economic tragedy and it seems as if the Executive&rsquo;s snout was rarely raised from a trough that was regularly replenished with luxurious swill at the expense of the taxpayer.  That must also stop.  We all need to buckle down in this critical situation.  The most important thing we can do is to support any reasonable Government policy in this difficult time, but in so doing we must ensure nothing is contained therein that constitutes an attack on the most vulnerable, marginalised and poor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Cummins on a point of order to clarify something he said earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have referred to No. 23 on the Order Paper and not No. 22.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a general air of expectation about the House in respect of the budget announcements this afternoon.  I do not know whether this morning&rsquo;s unrelenting rain is a signal of what we can expect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government might abolish Met &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or at least a harbinger of what is to come.  It certainly sets the mood for what we have been told to expect.  We will see.  I understand it is planned to have a debate on the budget in this House tomorrow.  I hope that in the coming days and weeks, not just in one debate, we do not just see the budget as a bookkeeping measure to balance the books.  I hope the Minister also does not see it as such.  The Government needs to do that in the initial sense and ensure what it proposes to spend is matched by the income and funds it has.  It presents a much bigger opportunity to those in these Houses to consider what our priorities should be in the present economic climate.  I really hope this House can have that kind of wider debate in coming days and months.</P>
        <P>Other parliaments&rsquo; upper houses have shown that they can contribute to a very considerable extent to that kind of wider debate and really scrutinise their governments.  In that context, I am delighted with last night&rsquo;s decision by the House of Lords to reject the British Government&rsquo;s proposal to introduce an extension to the period during which suspects may be held to 42 days.  That was an independent move and I hope we, as Members of this House and Parliament, can show our independence in how we approach the debate on the budget in the coming months.</P>
        <P>In an article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole makes the compelling point that one can plan to spend less in the context of economic difficulties and cutbacks and, in some circumstances, achieve more.  The example he cites is child care, an issue the House has debated <Col N="428"/>and should revisit.  The reasonable and costed proposals of the National Economic and Social Forum, which were supported by my party, set out a universal system of early child care, which would cost less than the combination of funds currently dedicated to child care through the early child care supplement and the subvention scheme.  Senator Mary White and others have raised this issue in the past.  We could be innovative and adopt a child care system that would require less investment while achieving something real and substantial for our children.  We need to bring such thinking to bear on the budget in the coming days.  I hope we will do that and discharge our responsibility as a Parliament in doing so.</P>
        <P>I join with Senator Cummins in asking the Leader to confirm in respect of the banking crisis the scheme and regulations to be introduced.  The Minister has promised the scheme will be laid before the Houses.  Consensus among economic commentators has increased in recent days that the question of capitalisation of banks cannot be avoided in the context of Irish banks because it is being addressed internationally.  Will that form part of the scheme because it does not seem it could as currently indicated?  When will we have the debate on the scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with those who have extended best wishes to the Minister for Finance.  Come the moment, come the man.  No man is better equipped politically to deal with the situation and I wish him well with the budget.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the Army&rsquo;s presence in Chad?  An Post cannot deliver Christmas supplies from their families to the troops in Chad because there is no infrastructure there.  PDFORRA has asked the Army to ensure supplies are delivered to the troops on the ground.  I am confident Lieutenant General Dermot Earley, Chief of Staff of the Army, will ensure our troops are provided with Christmas gifts from their families and <i>vice versa</i>.  We must give support to these troops who are in a dangerous situation in Chad and I hope the Leader will arrange a debate on the future of the mission there, which is set to conclude in March but which could be extended.  I wish our troops every success and I hope the budget will not adversely affect them or the barracks at home.</P>
        <P>I also hope the budget will ensure that where contracts have been signed and sites acquired under the decentralisation programme, the projects will proceed because they are important for the development of the regions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can raise that during the budget debate tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>For instance, a contract has been signed for a site in Roscommon but planning permission has not been granted.  A total of 83 staff are working in conditions, which would be improved if they were housed in new buildings.  It is economically beneficial to transfer people from the city to the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Army barracks issue.  Serious rumours circulated last weekend about the closure of barracks in the Longford-Westmeath area.  Attention was paid to the closure of the barracks in Longford.  I will formally warn the Government that closing the barracks in Longford town on the grounds of collecting money from the sale of real estate, the price of which is at an all-time low, would be a foolhardy and fire brigade action.  Will the Minister for Defence appear in the House to discuss his proposals on barracks and their closure?  The Mullingar and Longford economies would be severely affected were their barracks to be downgraded or closed.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to discuss this serious issue?  Athlone&rsquo;s economy depends entirely on its Army barracks.</P><Col N="429"/>
        <P>I join Senator Leyden in asking that the State intervene and look after soldiers in Chad this Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join speakers in wishing the Minister for Finance well today.  There is no doubt but that he has a major task in hand.  We are prepared for it, given our debates and the media coverage.  The Minister has the mettle to handle the matter, as he proved through his intervention in guaranteeing the financial institutions.  The House played a significant role in that respect and won much kudos, not that we were looking for such, thanks to our all-night session in response to an urgent requirement.</P>
        <P>I take a certain amount of solace and guidance from the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the effect that we should not be consumed by fear.  There is no doubt that the budget will be difficult in its own right, but I have been especially impressed in recent weeks by the tone of the media coverage.  Members of the media have been showing a realistic approach in responding to this crisis, which they well know is not just a domestic crisis.  We are in a competitive field and feel the wind of what is occurring elsewhere in the world.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Norris&rsquo;s point, which I have raised previously, that we must look after the most vulnerable members of society.  To do so, the rest of us must feel some pain.  If we do not, it will be most unfair because many of the people in question have not benefited from the Celtic tiger to the same extent as many of the rest of us.</P>
        <P>If we take the media&rsquo;s cue and work in a united fashion to take responsibility in a non-partisan way, we can get out of this problem relatively quickly.  No one can predict how long it will take and none of us will prejudge today&rsquo;s budget, but we have an inkling of certain cuts and savings thanks to some of the available information.  The message we seem to be getting is that the most vulnerable will be protected.  Only one Department will not be interfered with, namely, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which provides help to people who need it.</P>
        <P>We should not be contemplating a fire brigade action.  We must think long-term.  We must maintain confidence in business, tourism and the construction industry.  We all have an obligation to act positively in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House to discuss current medical services, in particular, community medical services and the insurance of independent midwives?  Such a debate would be timely now rather than later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is a watershed for the country.  A new realism is striking home and we will see that reflected in the budget to be announced later today.  It is a watershed financially and socially.  All public representatives agree that there is a new climate that is tough and difficult.  I refer to middle Ireland as those with good working jobs who are now under pressure and under threat.  They have real concerns as to the viability of their futures in their homes and families.</P>
        <P>We discussed the Housing Bill last week.  Housing policies must be adapted and revised on a constant basis to respond to the new climate.  With house repossessions on the increase, other Senators have referred to concerns regarding good jobs being lost.  People are concerned about how they will retain their houses and keep them viable as family units.  We must all respond to that challenge.  I include all Government agencies and local authorities, which have traditional ways and methods of dealing with their housing obligations to people.  They must revise their policies and I ask the Leader to make provision for a debate on this.</P><Col N="430"/>
        <P>For example, where planning permission is granted for a rural house there is a condition whereby a family must live in the house for seven years.  With the change in climate, I know of families who have lost jobs and may intend to emigrate.  This clause is seriously restricting them in selling their house or moving on.  Real issues affect real families and housing agencies must respond to this.  I ask the Leader to bring these issues to the attention of the Minister.  We will listen with interest to what budgetary measures will be taken but we must all respond, including Government agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what was said by Senator Coffey regarding a debate on housing and planning.  I noted with satisfaction last week the report from the EU indicating that the rule on local use, only applied by some local authorities, may be deemed illegal.  This would be of great advantage to those of us who advocate the entitlement to build and live in rural Ireland.  I look forward to the debate and a response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  If the Minister had his way, the people of this country would live in single, high-rise apartment blocks.  That is the policy of his party and I do not want it to have an impact on planning guidelines across the country.  We urgently need a debate on planning with a view to providing strong support for rural people&rsquo;s entitlement to live in their communities.</P>
        <P>I repeat the question I asked last week and perhaps the Leader will avail of the opportunity to answer it on this occasion.  The long-awaited Bill containing the fair deal proposal was published by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  We can debate the pros and cons of it but we have awaited the legislation, as thousands of people are awaiting its implementation.  The political story from the other House is that the Bill will not be debated for months.  Given how this House has proved its political worth in recent weeks, can the Leader ask the Minister to reprint the Bill as a Seanad Bill to get the debate under way in this House before Christmas?  It is the ideal House to debate such contentious, interesting and futuristic legislation.  We could consider it in great detail, giving it the type of debate it would not get in the other House.  I ask the Leader to show the worth of this House by requesting that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill be debated before Christmas because it requires serious consideration and a lengthy debate.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is the ideal place to get the work done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not often I defend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, but it is unfair to criticise him on the issue of one-off housing in rural areas.  Many of us come from rural areas and are aware of the pressures young families face in trying to get planning permission for one-off homes.  Some parts of Ireland are suffering from rural depopulation.  As a result shops are closing down and children are not enrolling in schools.  There are other parts of rural Ireland, however, that are under pressure from urbanisation.  Many parts of my own County Meath, and County Kildare suffer because too many houses are being built in the countryside.  It is very important that we adopt a sensible rather than a populist approach.  I would welcome a debate on this issue but it is fair to look at it intelligently and not merely to assume that it is all right to give <i>carte blanche</i> planning permission for rural housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This is budget day and I believe the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, has very important decisions to make.  Our economy is in deep financial crisis due to collusion between big developers and the banks, supported by the Government, all for their own benefit.  These people will now be allowed write off their own losses at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense and at the expense of PAYE workers and young families who now face 100% plus <Col N="431"/>mortgages and 40-year life commitments.  These are the victims of reckless practice by company directors and reckless lending by banks.  Although hard to say, it must be pointed out that Government greed and irresponsibility have allowed this. </P>
        <P>What will the Minister for Finance do today for the committed mortgage holder who is now in difficulty and who, as Senator Coffey said, is now facing repossession of his or her home?  We saw this happening in the High Court yesterday.  This is a very serious situation and it is not the first time it has happened.  New buyers need help and we will help them by letting the market fall.  It is the committed mortgage holder, however, who needs assistance.</P>
        <P>We should spare a thought today for the Health Service Executive and hope it will start to listen and to learn.  We heard today that the HSE issued a press release noting that its contract with pharmacists was illegally breached.  Now they will be reimbursed.  When will the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the HSE start to listen and learn?  Time and money have been wasted.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with some comments made in regard to planning and development.  I ask the Leader if he might arrange a debate on that topic reasonably soon because it is important.  In the changed economic circumstances in which we find ourselves it is important to re-focus on some of the issues that have evolved over a number of years.  At the time it was introduced, Part V of the Planning and Development Act was necessary because of the escalating price of houses.  Whether it is still justified in the current climate is something to be examined.  There are issues such as rural housing development, mentioned by Senator Hannigan, which also deserve scrutiny.</P>
        <P>There are questions concerning An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In recent years a tendency has emerged for large businesses and retailers to use An Bord Plean&aacute;la in order to obstruct development for their own competitive gain and protection.  That must be examined.  It always struck me that if we require our planning authorities, the county and city councils, to operate within time limits a similar constraint should operate with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  People should be entitled to get a decision within a reasonable amount of time.  I know it is difficult but there should be some way of examining whether if vexatious and wrongly motivated objections can be sidelined at an early stage within the process.</P>
        <P>There was some comment on the budget and we must all await the outcome.  I commend what has been said by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, and also by some of the leading Opposition spokespersons, of whom I single out Deputies Richard Bruton and Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  Deputy Quinn was particularly good on radio the other day.  Politicians must now act in the national interest rather than in parochial, sectional or party interests.  This country and many other countries face a challenge.  Only a collective, unified approach can successfully overcome this challenge and build on the gains of the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, extend good wishes to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Driving up to Dublin this morning, I thought the grey, dark, terrible weather <Col N="432"/>is probably in keeping with what will take place in the other House this afternoon.  As other speakers noted, people across the spectrum will feel pain as a result of the budget.  I hope, however, that the most vulnerable will feel less pain than those at the top end of society.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s call for a debate on home births and independent domiciliary midwives.  I concur with the Senator that such a debate is long overdue.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, before the House on another day to debate the issue of obesity and eating disorders such as anorexia.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Cummins, Norris, Alex White, Leyden, McFadden, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Coffey, Bradford, Healy-Eames, Walsh and Feeney expressed diverse views on the budget.  I offer the best wishes of the House to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on his first budget.  The Minister is a man of great ability, as Senators will have noted during his appearances before the House, including his contributions on the debate marking the 70th anniversary of the Constitution and legislation on the banking issue which was discussed during an all-night session.  All those present a fortnight ago for the latter debate admired his great ability. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Like Senator Leyden and the Cathaoirleach, I have long been associated with the Minister&rsquo;s family, having canvassed with both his father and grandfather over the past 40 years.  The Lenihan family has for decades shown great dedication to the betterment of society, none more so than the former Leader of the House, Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, who has been my colleague for many years.  The Deputy and I have always done our best to serve the interests of our country, party and county.</P>
        <P>Today is a momentous occasion for the Minister for Finance and I wish him well on behalf of the House.  We will support him in every way possible as he sets out to address the difficulties currently being experienced worldwide.  We must also make some domestic corrections arising from changes in recent times.  I hope the budget will lay the foundation stone for part three of the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>For the past ten years, Ireland&rsquo;s growth rate has averaged an unbelievable 7%.  The country has been held up to the ten new member states of the European Union as a shining example of what a nation can achieve in 20 years from humble origins.  This has been done under all parties in Government.</P>

	<P>As Senators will be aware, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. tomorrow, Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time will be devoted to statements on the budget.  I also intend to propose on the Order of Business on Thursday morning that the House take the legislation, whether schemes or regulations, required to address the issue of the banks on Friday at 10 a.m.   I thank the other leaders for their support and understanding on this matter.</P>
        <P>I agree with the amendment to the Order of Business regarding No. 23, Civil Liability (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2008 &mdash; First Stage, proposed by Senator Cummins.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden and McFadden expressed concerns regarding Army personnel.  Senator Leyden was concerned to ensure the Army personnel in Chad would have supplies delivered for the troops on the ground in time for Christmas.  I extend our best wishes to the Chief of Staff, Dermot Earley, whom we all have admired down through the years and who has been such a wonderful ambassador for the Army.  Regarding the sentiments expressed by Senator McFadden about the closure of Army barracks, we must wait and see what is in the budget.  I support her sentiments.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Leyden&rsquo;s concern about decentralisation, I hope, as everyone else does, that projects, in respect of which sites have been purchased, planning permissions granted and tender documents agreed, will be allowed to proceed, given that substantial allocations of staff expect such decentralisation to take place and are looking forward to returning to work in the place of their birth.  It would be a huge bonus to all the areas proposed that this would be allowed happen.  It is a godsend that the Prison Service offices are up and running in Longford town.  I look forward to the day that Roscommon, Mullingar, Portlaoise and those areas in the midlands &mdash; which so badly need it now more than at any other time &mdash; will get their fair share of investment and fair return from Government employment.</P>
        <P>Senators Prendergast and Feeney called for the Minister to come to the House for a debate on independent midwifery and home births.  As one who is privileged to have been born at home, I fully support this request and will arrange for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Coffey, Bradford, Hannigan and Walsh called for a debate on housing, planning, rural development and everything pertaining to the challenge facing us all in the 21st century.  The call for this debate is timely and I will arrange for such a debate to take place in the next three or four weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford suggested that the Minister, Deputy Harney, allow the Fair Deal proposal, the nursing home Bill, to be published as a Seanad Bill in the interest of assisting her, the Government and the Department to process it quickly.  I will bring that proposal to the attention of the Minister to establish if that can be done.  It is a worthwhile and sensible proposal and I will do everything I can to have that Bill initiated in the Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, and call on him to address the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  This is an important and interesting topic for budget day, and I have prepared a few notes accordingly.  It is important that we acknowledge the real role that volunteering has played in our society for a very long time. </P>
        <P>I am pleased to be able to address the Seanad on the important role of volunteering in Irish society.  I shall use this as an opportunity to say a few words about the wider community and voluntary sector, before addressing the specific ways in which the Government encourages volunteering and active citizenship in Irish society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The community and voluntary sector in Ireland has a long and interesting record that accurately reflects the economic, political and social history of the country.  The past 50 years, in particular, have witnessed enormous changes in Irish society, which one can easily track as regards the development of the sector.  Irish society today is modern and professional in its outlook and the community and voluntary sector is equally so.  The sector often acts on behalf of the State and engages successfully with it on many fronts.  It would not be possible to do so without a high level of expertise, professionalism and dedication.  Ireland can be proud of its strong tradition of volunteer activity, which existed before the growth of any formal voluntary sector.  It has its roots in our Christian tradition and its history and development parallels that of the country.  Until relatively recent times the meitheal, or co-operative working in communities, was a standard feature of Irish life.  We have retained this tradition of people helping each other, of coming together and pooling resources and skills when a task needs to be done.  People who come together to work on school committees or on community activities probably do not even think of themselves as volunteers.  Ultimately, the sum of their individual efforts invariably brings a value which is immeasurably more than the simple tally of their individual and unselfish acts.</P>
        <P>Volunteering is central to the ideals of democracy, social inclusion and active citizenship.  It is also an expression of the individual&rsquo;s involvement in their community.  The giving of time for others strengthens the fabric of our societies and defines the communities in which we live.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the Government has sought to encourage the dynamism of the voluntary sector and has prioritised significant new resources in support of this.  New research being finalised on behalf of the Department estimates that the State now provides in excess of &euro;5.4 billion per annum to the wider non-profit sector in Ireland.  This funding is to support the essential services that community and voluntary groups provide to Irish society on a not-for-profit basis.  These services include social care, child care, elder care, health services, education, environmental, sport, cultural, advocacy, artistic and countless other activities.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P>The important role of the non-profit sector in our society has been reflected in the development of relations between the Government, the public authorities in general and the community and voluntary sector.  Nowhere is that better displayed than in the evolution of social partnership to include the sector as a full partner over recent years.  It is right that organisations with direct, personal experience of the circumstances and problems of those who might otherwise be almost voiceless in Irish society should be heard at the table of social partnership.  It is also right that the participants in that process &mdash; including the Government &mdash; should be required to take on board and reflect, in policies and actions, the needs and aspirations of communities and interests served by voluntary organisations.  It is right, too, that the sector should be aware of the concerns and constraints of the other social partners, and of the public authorities, through a respectful continuing dialogue.</P>
        <P>Successive reports on the Irish community and voluntary sector have emphasised the need for an enabling environment for the voluntary sector and experience from other countries have reinforced this view.  Such an infrastructure is becoming increasingly important in the context of key objectives under social partnership regarding social inclusion, lifelong learning and the promotion of active citizenship.</P>
        <P>In September 2000, the Government published the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector.  The White Paper was designed to establish a policy of support for community and voluntary groups and a framework of support for the sector across Government Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the Towards 2016 partnership agreement the Government identified the importance of voluntary activity emerging organically from communities and the responsibility of providing an enabling framework to support this.  Towards 2016 described the Government&rsquo;s approach to engaging with the community and voluntary sector as combining light regulation with proper accountability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years, the Government has been pursuing the policies developed under Towards 2016 and the White Paper.  I will briefly mention some specific measures introduced by my Department to develop an enabling environment for the overall sector.  One measure is the introduction of charities legislation.  The Charities Bill, which it is anticipated will go to Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the current D&aacute;il session, provides for the dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  The Bill further proposes that a new charities regulatory authority will take over the functions of the commissioners, as well as assuming a broader regulatory role for charities operating in Ireland, so as to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud, thus enhancing public confidence in the charities sector.</P>
        <P>The Department provides funding to the community and voluntary sector for training on capacity building in governance and compliance, strategic development, and service to communities.  The local development programme also provides training and education grants for community development capacity building, IT training, or any other training priorities identified by local voluntary groups.</P>
        <P>The community development programme provides community premises, development workers and a capacity building project to disadvantaged communities in over 150 locations throughout the country.  They play a significant role in building community infrastructure and enhancing the capacity of the voluntary groups within the communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Against the background of the Task Force on Active Citizenship, the Government noted the establishment of a forum on philanthropy to deepen and strengthen a culture of philanthropy in Ireland.  Developments since the establishment of the forum include Government approval <Col N="436"/>of flagship projects with the private sector to the value of &euro;51 million, publication of Philanthropy Ireland&rsquo;s Guide to Giving, the endorsement of increased philanthropic activity by the Task Force on Active Citizenship and the establishment of the Social Finance Foundation.  The work of the forum is ongoing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I turn now to the lifeblood of the voluntary sector, the volunteers themselves, who, from every walk of life, offer their time and skills in the service of their community.  Since taking over my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for drugs and community affairs, I have become acutely aware of the vital work that is carried out by volunteers the length and breath of Ireland.  I have witnessed the sense of optimism and altruism that permeates many communities.  There is, however, a paradox.  While in this country we pride ourselves on our ingrained tradition of voluntary commitment, there are also increasing numbers of citizens who feel little connection or sense of duty to their neighbours and their wider community.  There are ongoing pressures which mitigate against volunteering and civic engagement.  Some of these relate to lifestyle and the pressures of combining working life with home and family commitments.</P>
        <P>Against the background of the task force on active citizenship, the Government noted the establishment of a forum on philanthropy to deepen and strengthen a culture of philanthropy in Ireland.

The work of the forum is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the lifeblood of the voluntary sector, the volunteers themselves, who, from every walk of life, offer their time and skills in the service of their community.  Since taking over my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for drugs and community affairs, I have become acutely aware of the vital work carried out by volunteers the length and breadth of Ireland.  I have witnessed the sense of optimism and altruism that permeates many communities.  Here though is the paradox.  While we in this country pride ourselves on our ingrained tradition of voluntary commitment, there are also increasing numbers of citizens who feel little connection or sense of duty to their neighbours and their wider community.</P>
        <P>There are ongoing pressures which militate against volunteering and civic engagement.  Some of these relate to lifestyle and the pressures of combining working life with home and family commitments.  This is especially the case in the context of more extensive commuting.  Some people are put off by the accountability which can arise from engagement in organised activities, old and new.  Others still can be discouraged by criticism or by the indifference of those who stand back and leave the effort to others.</P>
        <P>In our hectic modern world one can understand why people might opt out but it is vital that they are encouraged to make that commitment to society.  The quality of life in Irish society and the ultimate health of our communities, depends on the willingness of people to become involved and active on their own behalf and that of their families, communities and the more vulnerable members of society.  In short, a vibrant civic society, which is so essential to a balanced and, ultimately, happy community, requires us to support engagement and to counter disengagement.</P>
        <P>Our policies on volunteering must go to the very heart of our vision of how society should develop over the coming years.  Unless volunteering can be promoted and strengthened, we run the risk of seeing an increasing number of communities where people do not come together as neighbours, parents and fellow citizens to work together and address common interests and <Col N="437"/>to enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.  The ultimate outcome of a policy on volunteering is to inspire people to participate in the development of their communities and, by putting the necessary supports in place, to turn that inspiration into action.</P>
        <P>Much progress has been made in recent years in developing the State&rsquo;s thinking on its interface with volunteers and volunteering groups and in providing State support in this area.  My Department has had the benefit of a number of reports in this regard.  I already mentioned the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity published in September 2000 and the Towards 2016 partnership agreement.  Another important document was the 2005 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which recommended the development of the existing volunteering infrastructure and that a functioning volunteering infrastructure was required.</P>
        <P>These recommendations translated to a package of measures, amounting to almost &euro;2 million, announced by my Department in March 2005 to support volunteering, which included providing core funding for the then eight local volunteer centres in existence and core funding for Volunteering Centres Ireland as a national organisation to play a proactive central role in facilitating and supporting the development of the network of local volunteer centres.</P>
        <P>The task force on active citizenship report also made a number of recommendations, including that my Department fund a network of volunteer centres throughout the country.  The Department now provides annual funding of almost &euro;2.5 million to 20 such centres located throughout the country.  So far this year, these volunteer centres have registered more than 5,660 volunteers and in excess of 800 volunteer-involving organisations.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that 56% of registered volunteers had never volunteered before and 70% were aged 35 years and under.  To date, 2,300 volunteers have been placed by the volunteer centres, which will generate more than 151,000 volunteering hours this year alone.  This is the equivalent of 82 full-time workers over a 12-month period.</P>
        <P>In addition, the network of volunteer centres is complemented by a range of practical activities to encourage greater active citizenship.  Some of these include the young social innovators initiative which involves transition year students at secondary school level from throughout Ireland in identifying social needs and developing strategies to address them, requiring their engagement with local, community and statutory organisations.  The key objective is to develop volunteering among young people and grow a cadre of volunteers for the future.</P>
        <P>At third level, the DIT community learning programme is an example of a teaching method called service-learning which works by integrating classroom learning in any subject with suitable volunteering activity.  The programme has been in development in DIT for a number of years and students have carried out a wide variety of volunteering projects.</P>
        <P>Another initiative is a project with Focus Ireland to support the placement of social science graduates within the organisation who wish to gain experience and to develop skills in working with people who are marginalised.  Another initiative is support for Boardmatch, an organisation which aims to support the development of the voluntary and community sector in Ireland by strengthening boards of management and management committees of non-profit organisations.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that this week my Department has entered into a cross-Border volunteering initiative with the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland. The project involves three groups &mdash; the GAA, Voluntary Arts Ireland and the Church of Ireland &mdash; and the aim of the initiative is to pilot action research into how recruitment of volunteers can be encouraged and also to consider how volunteers recruited within different spheres can provide the catalyst for wider community involvement and the development of active communities.</P><Col N="438"/>
        <P>Through its funding to voluntary and community groups, my Department supports a growing variety of opportunities for citizens to get involved in a task or organisation that appeals to them.  I recently attended a number of Give It A Swirl Day events, an initiative promoted by Volunteer Centres Ireland through its members throughout the country, and it is a great example of an innovative approach to encouraging people of all ages and from all walks of life &mdash; individuals, families, community groups and businesses &mdash; to get involved for just a few hours in a hands-on volunteer project in their local community.  The events countrywide included activities such as community clean-ups, tree planting, decorating homes for the elderly and painting murals.  Other initiatives assist sporting organisations such as the GAA to develop opportunities for volunteers in local clubs and to engage with other voluntary groups to achieve wider community objectives.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to develop an enabling environment to encourage volunteering and active citizenship.  There is an ongoing need to ensure resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that we are constantly subjecting our activities to critical appraisal, especially in light of the current economic climate.  In that way, we can continue to ensure those we work to assist will receive the maximum benefit.  For instance, we are undertaking a review of our support to the volunteer centres throughout the country to ensure our support is focused where it is most needed.</P>
        <P>Modern society faces complex problems that cannot be addressed simply by channelling more funds, although funding is important.  They require innovative thinking and flexible responses by all the relevant actors at national and local level.  However, I believe that this is where the vision, the dedication and the tireless efforts of individuals in the community can make a major difference.</P>
        <P>The changed circumstances in which we live today require a sharpening of focus for us all in terms of addressing the nature of the problems which now present themselves.  In response to the changing context in which disadvantage is being experienced, my Department is reaffirming the concentration of the focus of its resources on communities where disadvantage and isolation still prevail.  Effective support at local and community level is the constant we seek in a rapidly changing society.</P>
        <P>There is a huge diversity of organisations within the community and voluntary sector.  Their areas of expertise vary.  Their target groups, objectives and goals are different.  However, there is a commonality in many of their needs.  It makes good sense that groups with so much in common should work together to achieve shared ambitions.  We must identify ways of promoting cohesion between all organisations, whether community, voluntary or statutory.  We look towards the day when all individuals and communities in our society benefit and prosper as they should.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is a topic we understand and support and in which we are all involved to some degree.  When I say volunteering should be voluntary, I mean we do not need over-prescription or legislation.  Neither do we need a plethora of groups and organisations that prescribe how to be a volunteer.  Volunteering and voluntary work should come from the heart and soul.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that we are having this discussion on the day the Minister for Finance must produce in the D&aacute;il a financial response to what in the eyes of many would be seen as the excess of the Celtic tiger.  Part of the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility is to encourage restraint and a sense of responsibility, something which has gone out the door.  Over the past 20 years, we have lived in a country awash with money where there was a price on everything but a value <Col N="439"/>on nothing.  Volunteerism and voluntary work are the opposite.  People value voluntary work and in the majority of cases do not put a price on the work they do.</P>
        <P>I am sure colleagues on the Government side, including Senator Butler, have played their part in the voluntary sector.  I am sure that before Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; became an official of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, he spent years working voluntarily with the organisation changing the lives of people throughout the country.  I do not know Senator Cannon as well, but I am aware of his work with handicapped people and invalids.  This is the type of voluntary work that comes from the heart.  Legislation, grants for volunteering bodies and prescribing how people can become volunteers do not always produce the results we would like.  Therefore, when I say volunteering should be voluntary, the House will understand what I mean.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about the ethos and culture of the people, which stems in most cases from their Christian ethos.  Volunteering, voluntary work and neighbourliness were at their height when the country was at its lowest economically.  Society changed, mostly for the good, but the idea of voluntary work, helping neighbours and involving oneself in one&rsquo;s community went out the door.  This is regrettable and is something we must try to address.  The question is how to address it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke of the Government continuing to develop an enabling environment to encourage volunteering and active citizenship.  While this is a valid aspiration, it may not work.  It is artificial to instruct people to volunteer and tell them how to become volunteers.  We must start in the home, in families and in communities.  Schools too have a role to play, although it sometimes appears we believe all society&rsquo;s problems can be solved at transition year level and that these pupils can carry out all sorts of projects.  At second level, where the focus is geared towards gaining points, we should try to involve students in voluntary work.  Older primary school pupils could also be involved.  Residents in hundreds of nursing homes and patients in dozens of hospitals never have visitors.  The thousands of pupils within walking distance of most of these homes and hospitals should be encouraged to visit these people.  This small step would be practical volunteering and would produce a positive result for the elderly and the lonely.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, the elderly were looked after in their homes and benefited from significant amounts of voluntary work, not just on the part of their sons, daughters and grandchildren, but from neighbours dropping in and bringing them the news of the community.  This was genuine voluntary work.  Nowadays, people who call to a neighbour&rsquo;s house are seen as nosey.  This practice is no longer deemed acceptable, another excess of the Celtic tiger, but it is to be hoped we can redress this.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned a community and voluntary forum.  I saw an advertisement in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today advising groups to register as community and voluntary bodies.  While this may be necessary from an administrative perspective, it demonstrates how volunteerism and voluntary work are almost being turned into an agency, department or quango.  This should not be the case.  Volunteering should be something natural and should not require all these rules and regulations.  However, I welcome those groups that have come together in a formal structure.  While that may be necessary, we must try to reach beyond the formality.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Government is investing funds in the area, although the Minister of State is restrained with regard to the amount.  I read about some of the initiatives such as Give it a Swirl Day and similar projects.  While these are welcome, they should not be seen as the total solution.  That must come from homes, families and communities.  We must spread the message that people must look after their neighbours.  They must be made aware that they, <Col N="440"/>their neighbours and parish are all part of the one community and that they should involve themselves at that level.</P>
        <P>Recently, I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs made a presentation on Leader and community funding.  During his presentation he made an interesting point about the success of the GAA, which stems not from money but from the parish ethos working at its best and people looking after their clubs and parishes.  The majority are involved without ever receiving a grant or a penny from anyone.  We do not have Croke Park in every parish, but we have volunteer workers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  The GAA is a typical organisation where the code of voluntary work is at its best and strongest and produces enormous benefits for the community.  This is the sort of volunteerism we must try to support and encourage.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the difficulty caused to clubs, communities, sporting organisations and small community hall projects with regard to the public liability insurance fund.  There are many occasions when people are willing to provide home help, bring elderly people to the local community hall or provide meals and entertainment, but the issue of public liability insurance rears its ugly head.  We cannot ignore this issue because it has a negative impact on volunteerism.  The public liability issue is part of a wider debate, but it needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the Charities Bill and I look forward to the debate on that.  Funding is an issue for all organisations because so many groups seek funding and some  degree of regulation is required in the area.  It is to be hoped the Bill will impact positively on voluntary work and volunteerism.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer briefly to social insurance contributions.  There may be a role for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in considering much of the work being done on an almost full-time basis by unpaid volunteers, not that they are seeking payment.  I commended the Government on its tackling of the issue of the lack of social insurance contributions via a measure introduced to allow for social insurance recognition for people whose spouses. usually wives, remained at home looking after family members or elderly people and who received no PRSI recognition for doing so.  The Minister might consider the possibility of having some degree of social insurance recognition for people who are doing voluntary work on an almost full-time basis.  As I said, they receive no pay but are doing it from the bottom of their hearts in the most positive way possible.  It would be helpful if something could be done in this regard.</P>
        <P>We all welcome volunteerism and voluntary work.  Sadly, the International Year of Volunteers passed us by without anyone taking any particular notice.  To my shame, I am not sure whether it was last year or the previous year.  It was not one of the more successful UN international years.  Perhaps in this country we should set aside a month every year in which we try to put volunteerism and voluntary workers at the top of our agenda and recognise their contributions.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister well in his endeavours.  I do not disagree with anything he said in his speech.  However, it is not a question of laws, rules and regulations or prescription, but one of ethos and making an effort to get back a little of what we have lost over the past 20 years.  It is about removing a bit of greed from society and replacing it with generosity, goodwill and a philosophy of looking after one&rsquo;s neighbour, which has sadly gone out of fashion but, it is to be hoped, may come back into favour in these lesser economic times.</P>

	<P>I was going to say that one.  The Senator got there first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  His contribution was the best I have heard in my 11 years in the Seanad.  That is saying a lot.  It was human, real and full of heart.  I am talking about the part that came before the figures.  I would go so far as to recommend to the Minister of State that he make that part of his contribution available to a wider public because it captures exactly what volunteerism is about.  First, he goes back to its traditional and historical foundation, which is vital because volunteering is in our genes.  It is inherent in us as a race to give voluntary service in different ways.  This has been the case historically because of the difficult times our nation has come through.  Even in the most difficult times, such as the Famine, when food was scarce and people were dying, we still looked out for each other and tried to share as far as possible.  With each difficulty we met in history, we did likewise.  We now see this replicated in each local community.</P>
        <P>There are 40 organisations in my home town.  One can go down through the list and see sporting bodies, religious groups, charitable bodies, Meals on Wheels and so on.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, speaking last week on volunteerism, said that if the State had to pay for what is being done by volunteers, the cost would be astronomical and probably impossible to meet.  We all know this is true.  However, the volunteers do not want payment.  The Taoiseach is right to focus on the importance of volunteerism.  Ten years ago we were not actually using the terms &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; and &ldquo;volunteering&rdquo;.  No title was given to these people.  In fact, even to mention it was to distract from the ethos and the significance of volunteering.  To some extent today we feel a little uncomfortable talking about it because it is part of the hidden Ireland.  It happens in a community.  One does not say what one has done or point it out.  However, one does look out to see in what way one can help.</P>
        <P>People did not confine themselves to the island of Ireland; they looked abroad as well.  Whenever help was needed we rallied, putting funds together and sending them abroad.  I believe that <i>per capita</i>, we possibly lead all the other countries in this regard.  Nothing will change even in the present economic climate.  It is part of us.  We will still look out for each other.</P>
        <P>There are broader issues involved as well.  One might ask what volunteering has to do with North-South relations, for example, and the difficulties we had in Northern Ireland.  I suggest that the greatest progress in terms of bridging traditions, bringing people together and respecting others&rsquo; backgrounds and traditions happened in voluntary groups.  Here, people were meeting, not in a political sense but getting to know each other and becoming able to measure each other&rsquo;s concerns while at the same time trying to explain their positions, which were often not understood because we were dealing largely with megaphone diplomacy, headlines of a tragic <Col N="442"/>nature, and letters to the newspapers.  This is a case in which the volunteer movement played its role when it came to history.</P>
        <P>During the week, one political commentator, talking about how we might make savings in the upcoming budget, suggested the abolition of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  This was not tongue-in-cheek.  He is a highly respected political correspondent in one of our national newspapers.  I was not angry; I was sad that he was so lacking in knowledge about what was happening in the country.  I would have said to him that of all Departments, this is the very one that has played a role in getting value for money.</P>
        <P>When representatives of the State met volunteers and their groups, as they have done in recent years, the contribution they made was not a reward or an acknowledgement but an opportunity to expand what existed locally already and to position ourselves to deal with a changing society.  We have seen how affluence does this by its very nature.  We all know of the greed that exists; we have discussed it in this House.  We also know that those who are vulnerable in society often get caught in the stampede of those who want to increase their bank balances.  Very often these are the silent people and they need groups to speak on their behalf.  The bodies that existed needed assistance to use professionalism to support what was already happening locally.  In the main, it did not minimise, dilute or distract from the voluntary effort.  I certainly hope this will continue into the future.</P>
        <P>We must bear in mind the diversity of groups that exist.  They all do different things and, to some extent, specialise in different aspects of work.  Reference has been made, for example, to the GAA.  One could add to that a variety of groups, such as the ICA, farmers&rsquo; groups, youth groups, cultural groups and so on all doing their own thing.  Wherever there is a coming together of volunteers, it has to help.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile; unity is strength.  There have to be meeting points for these groups because a certain interaction is required.  There might even be an overlap.</P>
        <P>One thing among many others for which I give credit to the Department is its anxiety, in planning its funding, to ensure it did not undermine in some way the voluntary effort it was trying to help.  That was vital.  On many of the schemes we have discussed here we have gone through these items in detail and made our points and had the opportunities.  They have been listened to and in many ways they have also been built into the legislation.</P>
        <P>I also pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, as I have done in the past.  He has travelled extensively throughout the country and has met small, big and diverse groups.  He has listened to them and invariably he has brought back the benefit of that.  With the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, we are proving once again that there is no rural-urban divide.  Volunteerism does not end with Dublin city.  Volunteerism is everywhere one goes.  Regarding tradition, one can pick out Connemara in rural Ireland or the Liberties in Dublin.  There is no difference in the focus which applies in all those cases.</P>
        <P>However, there is an opportunity for the media to play a role in this regard.  I am not going in for media bashing.  All I ever look for is some balance.  Every day the newspapers portray a tiny number of people from the entertainment world as representative of the entire population, as if they were the only heroes and heroines.  There are times when we should acknowledge the unsung heroes and heroines who are beavering away not for their own advancement but for the good of the community at large.  I am not saying that a certain amount of that does not already happen, nor am I saying that volunteers even want it.  However, it would help to enhance the role they play.  When they are looking for role models there are times when they should go away from the glitter and tinsel, and get down to the heart of the community and recognise these people for what they are.  I meet them every day of the week.</P><Col N="443"/>
        <P>Senator Bradford made a great presentation and also reflected what I am saying about the whole ethos of volunteering.  He picked up one example of a nursing home.  I visited a nursing home in my area last night.  Some of the people were quite elderly and ill.  There are opportunities for young people in particular.  Older people love meeting younger people and have time to talk to them.  Younger people have much to learn in that regard.  We should always seek those opportunities.  Regarding the record of the Department, I agree that volunteer centres were necessary.  I have no doubt the contribution those 20 centres are making is vital.  An investment of &euro;2.5 million is considerable and I am sure more could be required.</P>
        <P>The Charities Bill is going through the Houses at the moment.  It was necessary to have a more focused regulation in this regard because if one charity comes under the spotlight, all charities come under it.  While it might be the wrong day or even the wrong couple of weeks for making this suggestion, I know people with money in the bank, who would be prepared to give a loan to sporting bodies and other charities for a small interest that would be much smaller than the banks charge.  I understand that in the past charities were allowed to take loans and pay interest.  I suggest that interest should be tax-free.  If the money is left lying in the current account it is dead.  If that money were lent with a small interest, how much might charities that are borrowing at full commercial rates save?</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I have no doubt that he has the finger on the pulse in this regard.  I compliment him on his contribution and I hope a major part of that could be circulated more widely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on his speech in which he hit a number of the right notes which I would like to develop.  Although it is part of the Christian tradition to help out one&rsquo;s neighbours, it is not exclusively so.  We are far too self-congratulatory and insular if we think we are so wonderful as a Christian country.  I have worked with a number of voluntary organisations, Irish and other, here and abroad.  Including in a number of the organisations that are specifically Christian, many of their excellent volunteers were devout atheists.  However, it did not impact on their capacity to contribute.  It is a human trait and not simply a sectional Christian one, although as a Christian, I like to think it is part of our obligation to live out the gospel in this way.</P>
        <P>Like many other Senators I have had experience in the voluntary area.  Very often it was simply because the authorities were not doing anything at all.  Particularly in the area of gay rights, I was involved in the gay rights movement, the National Lesbian and Gay Federation of Ireland and the Hirschfeld Centre.  My experience there makes me understand that it is very important for the Government to recognise the value of voluntary input, but not to use it as an excuse to do nothing.  We often used to get complimented on what we did with regard to AIDS.  The Government simply relaxed with the attitude that we were looking after it ourselves.  We did not get a single ha&rsquo;penny in support and yet we reversed the usual profile of the AIDS infection in this country, which was quite different from what happened in other countries.  Wonderful people contributed voluntarily.</P>
        <P>All our colleagues here will remember Tom Hyland, an unemployed bus driver from Ballyfermot, who took up the cause of East Timor.  He organised ETISC, the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, from his little corporation house in Ballyfermot.  He affected Irish and European policy.  He was able to see half the world as his neighbours.  I will never forget the day I heard Professor Peter Carey of Oxford saying in his cut-glass tones: &ldquo;Of course when one considers the downfall of Suharto in Indonesia, one must acknowledge the role played by Tom Hyland of Ballyfermot in Dublin&rdquo;.  That is a real David and Goliath story that gives the answer to anybody who says, &ldquo;Oh, the situation is dreadful, but I can&rsquo;t do anything about it&rdquo;.  Of course one can.</P><Col N="444"/>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to pay tribute to Volunteering Ireland, which is a remarkable organisation, and Voluntary Service Overseas.  I must declare an interest as I have recently been appointed to the board of that body.  It is a very fine body as is Volunteering Ireland.  At least two Members of this House have recently returned, one from Africa and the other from Mongolia - Senator Mark Daly of Fianna F&aacute;il and Senator Dominic Hannigan of the Labour Party.  These young people have gone abroad to experience at first hand what it means for Irish volunteers to be able to contribute to and learn from the societies in which they find themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In an age when we are told we are not living in a society anymore &mdash; society has been abolished and it is just an economy &mdash; it is very important to realise there is such a thing as social capital and we need to build it up through the voluntary sector through mutual aid, self-help and people with shared problems.  A problem shared is a problem halved by people working together to address these difficulties.  Philanthropy is the service to others.  In the brief I got from Volunteering Ireland I came across a new word, &ldquo;philantherapy&rdquo;, which I love.  There is a therapeutic quotient to getting involved.  I have felt it myself, that when one puts something in one gets it back.  Since I have suggested it is not just Christians, I should return to my roots and quote the bible &ldquo;cast your bread upon the waters and it shall return to you an hundredfold&rdquo;.  In other words one gets a return, a quantifiable bounce in one&rsquo;s self-esteem, one&rsquo;s feeling of well being and one&rsquo;s feeling of connection to one&rsquo;s community.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and some of my colleagues mentioned the Irish tradition.  We are living in the protection of each other&rsquo;s shadow.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; quoted that wonderful Irish proverb.  He referred to the meitheal and the community gathering around.  I live in the north inner city and I have witnessed that.  It has not faded even with the arrival of new communities.  Such participation is important and it helps with many emerging problems such as the integration of new communities into our society because these people are often locked into their own ghettos and one way to integrate them into our society is to encourage them to become involved in voluntarism.</P>
        <P>Volunteers learn many skills, including advocacy and campaigning, which benefit not only the community but the individuals themselves.  I like to pin down the value of voluntarism in economic and social terms.  A report on volunteering in Ireland published in 2006 highlighted that 37.1% or 1,570,408 people volunteer for 465,624 hours per year, which is the equivalent of 96,454 full-time workers.  I like grand, global figures and, therefore, 1.5 million people volunteer for 500,000 hours, which is the equivalent of 100,000 full-time workers.  The financial benefit equates to between &euro;200 million and &euro;600 million.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned an Iar-Taoiseach, Parthal&aacute;n &Oacute; hEachthairn, who pointed out we would be hard put to afford all the work done by volunteers and, therefore, we should be sensitive when dealing with groups such as the Carers Association.  The investment is well worth it.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned the meals on wheels scheme.  How many people would be swept over if that did not exist?</P>
        <P>This concept has been adopted in a tiny community in the Troodos Mountains in Cyprus.  Many members of the community are elderly and they have a community centre.  A meal is given to them four days a week and this also provides them with a social outlet.</P>
        <P>For every &euro;1.50 invested, a return of between &euro;4.50 and &euro;12 is achieved, which makes economic sense.  A total of 72% of people feel volunteers offer something.  For example, in the Dublin area alone, 52,000 adults are involved in the organisation of underage football.  The GAA is hugely resourced but I do not object to that because it is a voluntary organisation at its core.  Mr. Robert Putnam, an American sociologist wrote an interesting book entitled <i>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community</i>.  He demonstrated that, as a result of the decline in social capital, people are less trusting and less connected with each <Col N="445"/>other, leading to a lack of interest and trust in politics.  It is, therefore, in our interest as well.  People do not vote because they feel powerless, disenfranchised and cut off and this leads to a lack of civic involvement.  They can be empowered through volunteering and by supporting voluntary organisations.  However, such support must be clear.  It is well worth doing so in the context of the benefits to society.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on mentioning the White Paper published in 2000.  I would like the Government to revisit it and audit the recommendations to ascertain how much has been done by Government; to ensure the voluntary sector is recognised and the support provided to the sector is examined; to ensure joined up thinking and initiatives will create the conditions for civic participation; to mainstream volunteering in Government policy; and to support all volunteering initiatives and consult widely with key stakeholders in the area.</P>
        <P>I refer to the my own experience with the Hirschfeld Centre, the Joyce Centre and the North Great Georges Street Preservation Society.  The voluntary sector must not be left on its own.  Constructive interaction is needed because it is easy for us in public life to be lazy and when something wonderful is done by organisations such as Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, which also gets a fair wallop of cash, we need to make sure we do not relax and say everything is all right and such organisations are looking after it.  We must support them, particularly in the current economic climate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to address voluntarism and the important role volunteers play in their communities.  I welcome the Minister of State who is doing tremendous work in his portfolio.  Organisational ability is needed to move volunteers in the right direction and he has a major role to play in this regard, which can be constructive.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the tremendous voluntary activity associated with the GAA, rugby and soccer.  We could not buy the organisational structure the umbrella organisations have implemented through their volunteers.  The Special Olympics were held in Ireland a few years ago and every county was asked to provide 5,000 volunteers.  This was a major task but the organisation of this structure was second to none.  It proved we were able to compete on a world stage.  The games were staged entirely through the voluntary sector.  This is why we must financially support, where possible, those engaged in this wonderful work.</P>
        <P>Residents and tidy towns associations and other voluntary organisations in our towns and villages play a major role in delivering services the State cannot afford to buy.  Events take place in community centres and they are organised by wonderful people who give of their time.  They make the community vibrant and their skills, leadership and support are brought to the fore.  The most important aspect of being a volunteer is the humanity involved.  We should have consideration, for example, for our neighbours.  When I was growing up in my community, my mother often asked me to check on our neighbours when she had not seen them for a few hours.</P>
        <P>This is an important day in the history of the country, as a budget is being introduced, which will impinge on most of the community but our volunteerism is solid.  If our volunteers stick with us and we pull together in tough times, such as now, we will come out the other end successfully.  For example, the Wexford Opera Festival is run by a voluntary organisation.  The volunteers ensure the festival occurs every year.  The Meals on Wheels programme and the Simon Community night-time soup run are voluntary.  Many of us do not realise that, while we are sleeping in bed, such people are working to deliver a badly needed service on behalf of our community, State and Government.  It is important that the House recognise and salute the people in question because they play a vital role.</P>
        <P>I have not mentioned one of the best groups, namely, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which does significant work, finds out where the problems are and deals with them quietly. <Col N="446"/> The society is a wonderful group.  Where would our Olympic team have been if not for our athletics, boxing and swimming bodies?  They are voluntary organisations of people who pull athletes together, coach them and ensure their fitness to represent Ireland on the world stage.</P>
        <P>In terms of volunteerism, it is important that we deliver skills, leadership, support, care and humanity.  I wish the Minister of State well.  I will not go through the figures, as he has already done so.  He is moving in the right direction.  The Minister of State with responsibility for older people is leading in that regard and other Ministers of State are beginning to get on top of their leagues.  They are dealing with the issues that matter in life.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; succinctly mentioned that to forget about our rural and other communities would be a considerable mistake.  It will not occur on our watch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this subject and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As the Labour Party&rsquo;s Seanad spokesperson on community affairs, I am aware of the real and positive benefits of volunteerism to the community.  I have also done some voluntary work at home and overseas, which has given me a perspective on the benefits of volunteerism.</P>
        <P>Our country traditionally has been seen as one that produces volunteers for organisations at home and abroad.  In recent years, however, questions have been asked as to whether we are maintaining the same levels of volunteerism.  For this reason among others, the Task Force on Active Citizenship was established in early 2007.</P>
        <P>A study shows that the Irish rate of volunteerism is, more or less, at the European average.  Approximately 30% of people volunteer regularly.  While one in three Irish people volunteer, two in three Americans volunteer regularly.  There is room for improvement.  Using the results of the last census to determine who volunteers, why, and from where they come, there are interesting disparities across groups.  While 25% of people between the ages of 45 and 54 years volunteer, the figure drops to one in nine among those aged 15-24 years of age.  Regarding socio-economic groups, one in every five employers and managers volunteers, but only one in every ten unskilled workers volunteers.</P>
        <P>It appears there are two pools of people in which the level of volunteerism could be improved, namely, younger people and the less skilled.  We must ask why this is the case.  Do they believe they do not have sufficient skills, is it an issue of confidence, do they lack the time or is there another reason?  We must consider the reasons and try to work on them.</P>
        <P>The benefits of involving young people are immense.  Recently, I read a study showing that volunteering makes young people more tolerant, matures them more quickly and gives them a clear sense of what type of career path they should follow.  These are benefits not only for young people, but for society as a whole.  Given that involving them and those from less advantaged communities is difficult, we must focus on how to improve the rates.</P>
        <P>We must determine how people start volunteering.  An interesting statistic shows that 60% of current volunteers were originally asked whether they would mind helping.  Only one in three volunteers starts by offering his or her services.  If we are asking people, perhaps we should ask more.  Two thirds of people who do not volunteer stated that they would be willing to do so.  The Government could start a media awareness programme to encourage more people to become involved in their communities and to volunteer among local groups.  The programme could be aimed at people from less advantaged communities and young people to try to increase the relevant rates.</P>
        <P>I recognise that there are limits on the number of volunteers.  Recently, I carried out a survey in the commuter belt to determine how people were doing, what quality of life they had and <Col N="447"/>so on.  I will make a copy available to the Minister of State.  When asked whether people were involved in their local communities, 50% replied that they did not have the time.  They spend so long travelling to and from work that, when they get home, they spend the rest of their time with their families.  The Government could consider the issue of transport links between the capital and peri-urban communities and the question of encouraging more jobs investment in communities surrounding the capital, such as in counties Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, to ensure that people could have more time to spend at home and making an input in their communities&rsquo; lives.</P>
        <P>The Government may be able to help in respect of other issues relating to voluntary work.  We need people to become involved in running communities and estates in our towns and villages because they ensure that works, such as grass-cutting, fun days and so on, are undertaken.  However, people are frightened about getting involved in their estates because of concerns about their liabilities for insurance costs or if the management companies running the estates go bust.  The Government should examine these issues.</P>
        <P>To illustrate the insurance matter, I will give a specific example of an area in County Meath.  The residents of Broomfield and Starinagh, forming a small community group in a rural area, got together to set up a community council.  Working together and through their dedication, they have been able to access funds from a variety of sources and build a community centre.  Those communities and others in County Meath and elsewhere are concerned about the level of insurance they must pay if they arrange a fun day or a summer fair.  Will the Government consider an all-encompassing insurance policy to cover the whole of the country in order that any local group that sets up in its estate need not worry about getting insurance or being sued if someone breaks an arm?</P>
        <P>Turning to the subject of volunteering overseas, Ireland has historically been great at sending people to the new world.  Other countries have sent some of us as well, but we will not go into that.  It is a fantastic experience for our volunteers and gives them a significant sense of achievement.  One can see the results of one&rsquo;s efforts on the ground and one knows that good is being done.  It also provides an opportunity to meet new people and to experience different cultures. Three out of every five young people would be very happy to get involved in a voluntary organisation in the Third World.  Senator Norris referred to the opportunity I had to volunteer on the 50th anniversary of the VSO, along with seven other parliamentarians from Leinster House, to improve the knowledge of parliamentarians in volunteering.  Deputy Varadkar and I spent three weeks in Mongolia learning about Mongolia, taking part in local activities and trying to help in reforming, in my case, the health service.</P>
        <P>I naively expected all the participants to be young people like me but there was a range of people there.  The VSO accepts people up to the age of 75 and some Members of this House may wish to volunteer.  The voluntary organisations benefit greatly from having experienced, well-skilled people assisting them.  It is also of great benefit to the individuals.</P>
        <P>I refer to one area in which the Minister of State could assist.  Organisations such as the VSO get much goodwill from people in the real world who give up their time but they need money from the Government.  I recognise that we support such organisations through seed funding but we must ensure that funding is not cut and, where possible, improved so that it can give the experience to even more people.</P>
        <P>The spirit of volunteering is alive and doing very well in Ireland.  I welcome the statement of the Minister of State.  I do not criticise but seek to make suggestions.  We could examine the issue of insurance and ensure we support organisations such as the VSO.  We could also make it easier for people to get involved in volunteering through a media awareness campaign.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State who has a serious grasp of the value of the voluntary sector, the challenges facing it and how we should address these.  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the important role of volunteerism in the life of our country and how Government can proactively support and encourage the many people who generously give of their time in the service of others.  We are now at a time when this most valuable aspect of Irish life needs new life and impetus breathed into it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There has been a long tradition of volunteerism in this country and this was most apparent to me growing up in rural east Galway in the 1970s where the tradition of the meitheal was still alive and well.  A sense of belonging as well as self-sufficiency and reliance were generated when a community helped its own to save the hay, foot the turf and bring in the harvest.  I recall summer evenings when people appeared out of nowhere to save the hay.  People coming together to help each other in times of difficulty was the beauty of the meitheal.  Volunteering, at an informal, non-organisational level, was the key to maintaining and sustaining rural communities while also providing the encouragement to individual farmers to keep going in difficult times.  With the increased mechanisation of agriculture, that tradition slowly died out but the spirit of the meitheal is alive and well to this day in rural and urban Ireland.</P>
        <P>My belief in the value of volunteerism was further enhanced by my involvement with the Irish Pilgrimage Trust, a national charity caring for young people with special needs.  It has grown from a small group of seven volunteers in 1972 to a vibrant national organisation of many thousands of volunteers who give generously of their time and commitment to those who benefit from their support and friendship.</P>
        <P>While my experience of volunteerism would lead me to believe it has a bright future, surveys detailing the continued decline in the numbers of those involved in voluntary activity give me serious cause for concern.  The most recent of these surveys was conducted by the National Economic and Social Forum in 2002.  They found that 17% of all adults questioned were &ldquo;taking a regular part in any type of unpaid voluntary activity or service outside the home or workplace&rdquo;.  Applying this percentage to the adult population as measured by the 2002 census gives us an estimated figure of 492,000.  We should compare this with a figure of 926,000 for the year 1992 and we see a decline of 46% in the numbers of those involved in voluntary activity.</P>
        <P>There are a number of factors that have led to this decrease and some are not easily addressed by Government.  Senator Bradford referred to international research that has shown that increased wealth leads to a decrease in voluntary activity and there is no doubt our Celtic tiger has led to people becoming more self-obsessed and unwilling to get involved in voluntary activity.</P>
        <P>Those who are willing to remain involved need to be encouraged and supported in the work they do.  In these stringent economic times in which we live, it is necessary to try to advance economic arguments for Exchequer support for the voluntary sector.  This argument was successfully made in an excellent document entitled Volunteers and Volunteering in Ireland produced by the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in January 2005, chaired by our colleague, Senator Cecelia Keaveney.  While that report concludes that there are insufficient data available to establish exactly how many volunteers we have in this country, it is possible to estimate that the economic value of their contribution is somewhere in the region of &euro;500 million per annum.</P>
        <P>The report also concluded that there is no need to set up another costly quango to foster and nurture volunteerism.  The supports provided by Volunteering Ireland and existing volunteering centres should be supported and granted long-term funding as an alternative to an additional layer of bureaucracy in the form of a new statutory body.</P><Col N="449"/>
        <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the conclusion of the report in respect of State funding.  It has been my experience in working with a number of voluntary organisations that there is a plethora of <i>ad hoc</i> and multi-agency funding streams available to such groups.  I have advocated for a number of years, at local and national government levels, that all funding for voluntary organisations and volunteering should be channelled exclusively through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  This would improve efficiency and transparency and make the job of securing funding less difficult for voluntary groups.  Funding commitments could be entered into over a number of years and in this way the monitoring of State expenditure would also be facilitated.  With a long-term and guaranteed funding stream available to voluntary groups, they would be able to formulate long-term plans rather than working on an intermittent and piecemeal basis dictated by sporadic injections of funding.  Creating a single funding stream administered through one Department would also lead to reductions in administration costs and these savings in turn could form part of this single funding stream.</P>
        <P>At a time when we are challenged to deliver world-class public services, it is interesting to note that recent research carried out by the University of Wales concluded that using volunteers to deliver some public sector services is good for the nation&rsquo;s health.  Senator Norris referred to this earlier when he mentioned philanthropy.  The study shows that volunteering can mean people live longer and is good for their health and well-being and for the people they help.  It also found that volunteering had a positive effect on people&rsquo;s self-esteem, led to a reduction in hospital visits and could even combat depression, stress and pain.  We need to explore further the possibilities of forging strong links between our public service and the voluntary sector.  There are potential synergies in it that could benefit us all.</P>
        <P>From the citizen training the local under-8 hurling team to the citizen caring for the 80 year old with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, the spirit of volunteerism is at the very heart of Irish life.  It is a flame of selfless generosity that has burned long and bright for generations and it was apparent to us all when we hosted the Special Olympics in 2003.  That event gave us a glimpse of the potential that we have as a people to work together in achieving a common goal.  It is now time for Government to acknowledge that potential, to fan that flame in a meaningful way and to offer the kind of supports our people need to continue doing the very valuable work they do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I acknowledge that this important matter is being debated here, as I hope it will be at a future date in the lower House.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise the value of volunteerism in society and it might be helpful to remind all levels of officialdom that they also should value it.  People can become smug in their jobs and can forget the workload and time that volunteers commit in the various activities in which they are involved around the country, in both rural and urban settings.</P>
        <P>Volunteerism comes from the heart.  It is a passion and a sense of belonging, and comes from the family or the community of those who participate.  It is about pride and for that reason we often hear of competitions managed by local authorities, which are most welcome.  What does that phrase &ldquo;pride of place&rdquo; mean?  It means people living in their communities, having a sense of the environment in which they live, wanting to do something on a voluntary basis to improve that environment.  Such pride of place is seen also in the involvement of organisations such as the Tidy Towns committees who do endless hours of work and give untold commitment to improving the environment of their towns and villages.  We must acknowledge that at all levels.  It is vital to have good interaction with voluntary organisations in order that when they deal with officialdom, whether the local area engineer on a council, or the relevant Department,  the response they get is flexible, responsive and timely and that they are not frustrated.  After all, these are volunteers and are not paid.  They cannot wait all day at the end of a telephone line <Col N="450"/>or wait for weeks for a letter of response.  Responsiveness to volunteerism should come from the bottom up and the top down and I hope the Minister for State will take on board that point.</P>
        <P>The great traditional organisations such as the GAA and the ICA were mentioned and I acknowledge the role they have played, especially in rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland can become isolated and disconnected without those organisations, the parish committees and so on.  Their activities and initiatives keep rural Ireland together and weld the social and cultural fabric of our society.  That should be encouraged at all stages and all times.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the individual volunteer.  Time is the most important resource and it is a very scarce commodity in people&rsquo;s lives nowadays.  Time is the essence and the blood of the volunteer.  One might have the passion and the pride but if one does not have the time one cannot give it.  Some people might love to give their time but due to the constraints of modern living they can no longer do so.  Both parents in a family might be working, or might be working away from home.  Time is the valuable commodity that must be acknowledged and all State agencies must respond and adapt to that.</P>
        <P>School management boards around the country are comprised mainly of volunteers.  I am aware of one school board of management that has had three resignations from a total of eight members.  The three resigned in the past few weeks because of time constraints.  That is an almost unbearable loss to the school and the whole community.  These are people who bring valuable skills on a voluntary basis to a board of management for the benefit and general good of the pupils in that school and that community.  We cannot neglect this matter and turn a blind eye to it.  I see this instance as an alarm bell ringing.  Good able people with valuable skill sets are resigning because they do not have time.  We see the same happening in politics in the number of councillors who resign because they feel they do not have time to commit.  There are messages here for all of us.  The alarm bells are ringing and we must be able to respond in such a way that we can help people take on the workload, give their contributions and take full value of the skill sets they offer.</P>
        <P>Volunteers on boards of management may experience frustration in their interactions with the Department of Education and Science.  How many times might they be required to ring the Department in order to get a simple response?  Sometimes it might take months to get a response and we must eliminate that type of frustration.  The Minister of State has a responsibility and an obligation in his role to highlight this matter to the relevant Minister and Department and I hope he will hear this.  We can lighten the load for the volunteers whom we value so much.</P>
        <P>Why do individuals volunteer?  What inspires them?  Some people mentioned the tradition that might belong in an area.  Unfortunately, we cannot rely on that any more.  We all know towns and villages where there are many new residents but they do not engage with the cultural and social fabric of that village and so the tradition is dying out.  Volunteers get involved for various reasons, often positive ones such as the pride they have in their place.  They want to progress the district or the organisation to which they belong or they wish to develop their youth or the society or the circles in which they live.  There are also negative reasons why volunteers come on board.  It must be remembered that Government is obliged to provide for many areas of service.  Unfortunately, in many of these, such as health and counselling services, or hospice work, people who find themselves in harsh predicaments end up volunteering to raise funds for services in their areas not supplied by Government.  In my own constituency, the Waterford Hospice Association is out day and night fundraising to provide basic dignity for people who are ill.  I believe the Government should help such people at every possible level.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>What do volunteers seek?  They look for very little and all they want is the satisfaction of having done something for their communities.  They must be acknowledged and that is what we were doing here today.  This should happen at every level because volunteers need support and assistance and they need delivery.  When a well-thought out plan of a voluntary organisation is put in place the organisation needs help to deliver the plan.  The most worthwhile thing for any volunteer is a sense of satisfaction and worth for having done something to benefit the community.  We cannot underestimate and must never take for granted the time of the volunteer.  We must never allow the burden to be left to the few or permit the willing horse to take most of the workload.  Unfortunately, if one talks to people in any voluntary organisation or committee, they will often say that they are willing but that there are very few to help them.  Renewal, recruitment, support and assistance are required from all levels.  I ask the Minister of State to note that point.</P>
        <P>Voluntary organisations support health initiatives.  In my constituency, the South East Cancer Foundation offers a holistic counselling service for cancer patients.  Its members fundraise and volunteer their time to help the patients and they need the assistance of the State.  We must never forget the people on the front line in the rescue services, such as the Irish Red Cross, the Order of Malta, the part-time fire services and the Civil Defence.  All those organisations have a voluntary element, including the mountain rescue groups and the sea and river rescue services.  They all provide valuable contributions to their communities.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will take away some of these messages.  We can all play a role in supporting our volunteers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the important role of volunteering in Irish society.  We cannot emphasise often enough the importance of the volunteer.  I came across an interesting definition of volunteering which captures its spirit.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Volunteering is the commitment of time and energy for the benefit of society, local communities, individuals outside the immediate family, the environment or other causes.  Voluntary activities are undertaken of a person&rsquo;s own free will without payment except for the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Volunteering can cover many different activities, including visiting the elderly or sick, giving blood, doing a sponsored walk, getting involved in local scouting or guiding clubs, assisting a charity with its finances, helping someone to read or write, planting trees and so on.  In his presentation, the Minister of State talked about the essential services provided by volunteers, such as social care, child care, elder care, health services, environment, sport and cultural activities, etc.  When we consider the range of services provided on a voluntary basis and noted by the Minister of State as &ldquo;essential&rdquo;, the State should be grateful.  In taking these services the State has certain responsibilities.  It is important that we do not put undue responsibilities on volunteers which probably should be those of the State.  We must always keep an eye on what voluntary organisations provide in order that their burden of responsibility is not too great.</P>
        <P>We also need to ensure voluntary services continue to be professional and modern.  Voluntary services have undergone dramatic change in the past decade or two and a good support infrastructure is in place.  The Minister of State referred to the local development and community development programmes, both of which provide the support structures and training required by voluntary services.</P>
        <P>Training is extremely important.  If we are to have volunteers providing essential services in critical areas such as child care services and care of the elderly, we must be willing to ensure certain standards are upheld.  The role of the State is to provide the training and investment in <Col N="452"/>infrastructure that voluntary organisations require to carry out their work.  The Minister of State indicated the State spends approximately &euro;5.4 billion on the not-for-profit sector.  Given the wide range of services being provided by voluntary organisations, I hope this substantial level of expenditure will be maintained.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the role the Government could play in encouraging philanthropy.  The United States has a long tradition of businesses engaging in philanthropy.  To achieve an increased level of corporate philanthropy here, we need to encourage a similar philanthropic outlook by businesses.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State cited a number of specific voluntary initiatives, including the young social innovators, on which I will focus.  Having been involved in this important programme, I am impressed by the manner in which it reaches young people, primarily those in secondary school who are unlikely to have become involved in community groups or local causes, and raises awareness among them of the importance of participation in civic life.</P>
        <P>According to the most recent statistics, the level of volunteering is good.  A 2006 national survey on volunteering carried out by Volunteering Ireland and entitled The Hidden Landscape indicated that Ireland has more than 1.5 million volunteers, of whom almost 9% are not based in the country.  As such, 37.1% of the population is involved in volunteering, a healthy level.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to learn that male volunteers outnumber female volunteers by a ratio of more than three to one in the case of Ireland based volunteers.  This is an interesting statistic as I would have expected the position to be the reverse.  The survey also found that between 17% and 33% of the adult population volunteered on a regular basis, giving on average five to 12 hours per month.  The range was, however, wider with some volunteers giving less than one hour, while others gave more than 50 hours.</P>
        <P>The estimates on the in kind revenue from volunteering range from &euro;200 million to &euro;600 million per annum.  As compared to other European countries, Ireland&rsquo;s volunteering rate was considered to be average and citizens&rsquo; membership of community and voluntary associations above average, with both rates on the increase, which is good news.</P>
        <P>One of the interesting statistics to emerge from the report was that 58% of people get involved in voluntary work because they are asked to do so, while 36% offer their services.  The State should become more proactive in supporting voluntary organisations.  In the case of the VSI, it is already doing this by engaging in outreach and suggesting to people that they could get involved in voluntary activity.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of volunteering and congratulate the Minister of State on the work his Department does in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important topic.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, to the House.  I agree with his comment that volunteering is central to ideals of democracy, social inclusion and active citizenship and support for volunteering is essential to ensure a vibrant civic society.  Like Senator Norris, I stress that volunteering is not exclusive to the Christian tradition, an issue raised by the Minister of State, and much of it has its origins in secular tradition or the traditions of other religions.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that all Senators should pay tribute to the long and proud history of volunteering in Ireland, irrespective of whether its source is religious or secular.  However, to refer to the importance of volunteering and pay tribute to those who engage in voluntary work is like apple pie and motherhood in that no one will disagree.  For this reason, I wish to inject a more challenging, if not controversial, view on volunteering.  Let us be a little more forensic in <Col N="453"/>our investigation of the role of volunteering in society, particularly as certain aspects of this role deserve critical comment.  To do so is not in any sense to do disservice to the many generations of volunteers who have done enormous work on behalf of society for the common good.  While I do not mean in any way to disparage, discredit or undermine the role of volunteering, we need to examine the issue in a more critical light and ascertain how we, as a society, engage with volunteering and voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>There has been a long tradition in Ireland of voluntary organisations taking on roles which the State should perform.  In so doing, they have tended to absolve the State from responsibility.  This has not always been a healthy tradition.  I speak, in particular, of the highly influential role the Catholic church has played and continues to play in the provision of services such as education, health care, social supports and residential child care.  The extent to which the church took on this role, particularly in the early years of the State, resulted in it being referred to by some academics as a shadow welfare state.  However, in taking on a role neglected by the State the church became in effect a provider of services that were provided by the authorities in other states.  In a sense, this development prevented and obstructed the emergence of a proper welfare state, with unhealthy consequences for the state of our democracy and social services.</P>
        <P>We have seen the dreadful abuses which took place in institutions run by voluntary organisations, including religious orders.  I do not suggest abuse was exclusive to any religion or religious order because dreadful abuses were perpetrated in a variety of institutions run by many bodies.  That for a long time the State was not directly responsible for providing care to the most vulnerable children allowed it to step back and take less of a regulatory role than it should have done in terms of controlling the manner in which children were cared for in institutions.  This should be a cause of shame.  As a result of the continuing lack of regulation of the voluntary sector, we have a lack of accountability.</P>
        <P>Many voluntary groups argue for greater regulation.  The long awaited Charities Bill will be an important part of the regulatory system.  I welcome the establishment of a charities regulatory authority and a more formal structure for the recognition of charities and non-governmental organisations.  It has been unfortunate for NGOs and those for whom they provide services that the legislation has been so long coming.</P>
        <P>Some NGOs did things other than provide services the State should have provided and many of them continue to challenge the State and ask hard questions of Ministers.  In doing so, they carry out a function the State sector is not able to perform.  The NGOs must continue to play a vital role in this area.  Groups in which I am involved include the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which routinely challenges the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on conditions in our prisons and penal justice and criminal justice policies, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which asks hard questions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  These activities cannot be carried out by the State and must be done by organisations established by volunteers in constructive engagement with the State.  Similarly, Friends of the Earth, in which I declare an interest, has been asking challenging questions of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance about what will be done in the budget to protect the environment and reduce our carbon emissions.  This is a task which must be carried out by a voluntary organisation as it cannot be performed by the State.   It is not something the State can do.</P>
        <P>In recent years the role of the State and that of voluntary groups has merged to an even greater extent than occurred previously, to which the Minister of State referred.  This is happening through State funding of voluntary groups such as, for example, housing charities.  These groups provide services, by way of State funding, to homeless persons or people with inadequate housing.  They have become what are known as NNGOs, non non-governmental organ<Col N="454"/>isations, to use a term that has been coined elsewhere.  They are essentially part of the State structures, the State having recognised that they deserve funding because they provide essential services.  A question of regulation arises in this context.  There is nothing wrong with this practice being the way in which we provide our services, once we can be sure services are provided in a way that is accountable and not abusive.  That has been the difficulty in the past, namely, there has been a lack of accountability and of direct democratic answerability for the institutions that provide services.</P>
        <P>We debated the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last week.  A good example of such accountability was covered in the debate on the housing Bill.  Housing charities are seeking regulation.  They want to be included within the framework envisaged in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, under which criteria will be specified whereby those providing housing services will allocate housing to people based on objective criteria of need and so on.  There is a lesson there for us in terms of NGOs and voluntary activity.  Such work is vital to the functioning of our democracy, but it should be done in a transparent and accountable way and through a regulated system of NGOs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to briefly contribute to this important topic.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Many of the points I wish to raise probably have been already raised.  </P>
        <P>When we think of volunteerism we tend to think of the GAA, one of the greatest volunteering organisations that has been in place in Ireland for the past 130 years.  I admire people who are involved in all sports, whether it be rowing, soccer, athletics or boxing.  A great level of volunteerism occurs across the board.</P>
        <P>I also recognise the work done by the ICA and one tends to think of it as a professional body.  However, one of the strongest organisations involved in farming is the IFA and most of the people involved in it at local level are volunteers.  That contribution should be recognised.</P>
        <P>Coming from a coastal area in west Cork, I must single out for particular mention the Coast and Cliff Rescue, the RNLI and other such organisations.  When the appalling tragedy occurred last January 12 months where three fishing trawlers were lost at sea for several weeks, many people from as far away as Kerry, west Cork, Kinsale, Waterford, Dunmore East, Wexford and east Cork gave voluntarily of their time over several days to search, under supervision, for the bodies of the crew members who might have been washed ashore.  In the face of that appalling sea tragedy, these people put their shoulder to the wheel and offered encouragement.  It was very well received by the unfortunate people who suffered personal losses and by the coastal community.</P>
        <P>Also deserving of mention are organisations in my home area, namely the Bantry inshore rescue team, the local fire station and the Red Cross, the members of which do tremendous work.</P>
        <P>The tidy towns associations play a phenomenal role from an environmental perspective in terms of improvements to towns and villages, a role I greatly encourage.  Amazing successes have been achieved in west Cork in towns such as Kinsale and Clonakilty, which won international awards.</P>
        <P>A previous speaker mentioned the role of school boards, but we should also consider the contribution made by the members of harbour boards.  Many people are of the view that people appointed to a harbour board get paid for their contributions.  To the best of my knowledge, there are 11 members on the Kinsale Harbour Board, Bantry Harbour Board and Baltimore Harbour Board.  They meet, at a minimum, once or twice a month if there is an important issue <Col N="455"/>to be considered.  These members do not receive any funding for attending these meetings.  When I was a member of Bantry Harbour Board, I recall members were offered the measly sum of &euro;40 per month but, for the sake of the community and other projects in the area, the board decided to decline such funding.  Some people believe that people are members of boards, be it a harbour board or any other board, for what they can make of it.  People travel to these meetings, which can often continue for two or three hours, and their contributions should be recognised as another form of volunteerism.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik mentioned volunteerism within religious organisations.  There is no doubt that the amount of work done by religious organisations not only in Ireland but internationally over the centuries has never been properly recognised.  One hears of the abuse by some members of religious organisations, but if we were to separate the chaff from the grain, we would acknowledge the tremendous successes of those organisations not measured by decades but by centuries of hard work.  As a nation, we should be proud that we were once the island of saints and scholars.  Our missionaries did tremendous work throughout the world.  I am not referring only to the Roman Catholic Church but to other church denominations and the contributions of ministers of the Eucharist and other volunteers.  I recently attended a fete in my home parish in which a number of volunteers were involved in a annual fundraising event for the local Church of Ireland.  It gave a tremendous boost to the local community and great work was done.</P>
        <P>I should also mention the great work done by the Kerry Mountain Rescue Team, the Coast and Cliff Rescue organisation in my area and the Coast Guard service in difficult and adverse circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should not forget another element of volunteerism, illustrated by the largest attempted smuggling into west Cork of &euro;500 million worth of cocaine in July 2007.  I spoke to the coxswain of the Baltimore lifeboat service subsequently and he was not sure whether it was appropriate to do so but they were asked to bring on board the big bales of cocaine potentially worth a great deal of money.  They did that.  There is a serious side to this issue.  In the context of the volume of drugs being smuggled into this country, we often take for granted the vigilance of local people involved in groups such as Community Alert or Neighbourhood Watch.  They do great work in their local areas.  The great community spirit in west Cork was evident at the time of that incident when those involved were observed going through a farmer&rsquo;s yard and eventually some of them were apprehended and are now serving long prison sentences.  A great deal of good work is done by these community organisations.</P>
        <P>There are also organisations that do great work behind the scenes.  I refer to the work done by Alcoholic Anonymous and services such as Meals on Wheels and so on.</P>
        <P>Volunteerism is alive and well.  We have several examples of the great work done by volunteers.  I acknowledge, however, that society has changed.  When I grew up in rural Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s, we had thrashings, meitheals for cutting the turf and farmers and neighbours worked together to bring in the hay.  Now that we all have such busy lives, we hardly have time to talk to each other.  A lot of work has been done.  I welcome the Minister of State and I am sure a lot more will be done.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik said she was surprised that the number of male volunteers outnumbered female volunteers by 3:1.  In that respect, we have to be mindful of the words of the song, &ldquo;Girls just wanna have fun&rdquo;.  I will finish on that note.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on highlighting this important issue, the important role of volunteering in Irish society.  Many points have been made that I had intended making and, therefore, I will make a few brief points. </P>
        <P>In my experience volunteerism is the lifeblood of local communities.  I live in Oranmore, a burgeoning area of population growth.  It is the largest growth area in County Galway.  When I was elected as a councillor in 2004, I became aware of the many people volunteering and, might I say, they were burnt out from it.  They have been continually giving and while many new people were moving into the area they were not necessarily volunteering.  I am amazed by the numbers of people mentioned in the House today, as being involved in volunteering because in areas of new population growth, I see the opposite.</P>
        <P>I shall give an example of how important this was for me and my local community.  After I was elected a benevolent gentleman in the community offered me a donation for any worthy cause.  I reflected that hurling enthusiasts would be upset if I gave it to the soccer people, as would some other group if I gave it to drama.  I decided not to make any decision until I knew a little more, and eventually decided to set up a volunteers award programme.  However, the donation was not adequate and so the benevolent gentleman agreed to triple it and two years ago we started the Oranmore volunteer awards programme.</P>
        <P>We decided not to run it every year because we wanted new people to come forward and have a chance to volunteer.  There were two aims, to acknowledge and award the wonderful effort of people who had been volunteering for years, and were suffering from burn out, as well as to encourage new people to come forward.  The outcome was tremendous and everyone gained in the sense that it was spread very wide, and lasted almost a year.  We sought guidance from the community regarding whom it was thought should be rewarded under special categories, from special needs to mental health, sport, young people involved in democracy, older people, etc.  I do not have the categories off the top of my head.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is in an ideal position to acknowledge such awards programmes and encourage them.  He should find unique methods of encouraging volunteerism to continue.  He should also look at PRSI, because this is an issue that has arisen for voluntary groups, since it can prevent them continuing some of their great work.  I have seen examples of what I am talking about, throughout Galway city and county, whether as the mayor&rsquo;s awards or all those volunteering within development associations, boards of management and especially sporting organisations.  When we might have been ashamed, at times, of the church, the Government and traditional leadership, the volunteers have been our heroes.  It is time to give volunteerism a new status.</P>
        <P>I recently visited libraries and tourism offices in Australia where I saw people wearing a pin, which said &ldquo;Volunteer&rdquo;. I asked what that meant and was told the pin was to show the wearer was a volunteer.  I thought it was a good idea.  People are sent on training courses and do a set number of hours in particular organisations, which is reflected on their <i>curricula vitae</i>.  My final point &mdash; I want to push this one in the area of education &mdash; is that we should be making voluntary service a requirement of graduation, either at secondary or third level.  It is a real virtue, an exercise in democracy, social inclusion, innovation and active citizenship.  I should like to explore that further, and perhaps the Minister of State could think about it as well.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for sharing her time and I shall be brief because I know other speakers want to come in. </P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on this.  There is a long and proud tradition of volunteering in Ireland, and I believe the Minister of State is encouraging that today.  Senator Healy <Col N="457"/>Eames talked about being in Australia or somewhere.  I was in Beijing last month at the end of the Olympics and there were something like 1.3 million volunteers, 70,000 each day, working with such pride.  They were saying they were happy to volunteer and proud to do this.  I do not recall whether they were wearing badges, but they were a long way from the action.  It is understandable when people are recognised and the pride they have in their effort.  We must find a way to encourage people to do something, without there necessarily being a reward, because of the satisfaction involved.  Remember the saying, giving is more rewarding than receiving.  It is something we must encourage people to do and I believe it may happen at the individual level.</P>
        <P>Many Irish institutions have their roots in voluntary work, whether church, school credit unions or whatever.  It comes down to individual people.  I was coming out of La Guardia Airport in the United States on one occasion and looking for White Plains.  I asked directions from a man picking up a rental car.  I could not follow his directions so he said he would show me.  When we passed a toll booth, I was told that the guy in front had paid for me.  The same happened at the next toll booth.  The benefit I got from that one little gesture has encouraged me to do something similar as I travel around.</P>
        <P>If it can manage to encourage citizens to contribute in little ways like this, then when it comes to the bigger issues, whether credit unions, church or sport, the country will be a better place from all the volunteerism it is possible to achieve.</P>

	<P>Citizenship of the Republic of Ireland bestows rights as well as responsibilities on all its people.  We, as citizens, have obligations to our country, our communities and fellow citizens.  These responsibilities were heard in the words of former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, when he said, &ldquo;Patriotism, as I understand it, is a combination of love of country, pride in its history, traditions and culture, and a determination to add to its prestige and achievements&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>Some would believe patriotism is a cause and a word from a bygone era, where responsibility and obligation to the nation involve fighting for it and freedom of its people.  Patriotism or love of country today no longer requires the sacrifice or volunteerism that Lemass would have known.  However, it requires a new type of sacrifice, commitment and volunteerism.  This new volunteerism requires all citizens to play an active part in their country&rsquo;s future.</P>
        <P>Last week I met Alan Kearns, the inter-county hurler from Galway, who happens to be Ireland&rsquo;s Person of the Year 2006.  Being an inter-county star means people will recognise one.  It also means a strict diet, no drinking and ten months of social inactivity.  People admire the commitment and sacrifice and it also means that one is recognised and respected.  However, Alan Kearns is also recognised and respected in a small town in western Zambia called Mongu, for a different reason to his fame in Ireland.   Since 2005 he has travelled there every year to lend a hand to one of the poorest communities on earth.  From that time he has highlighted the story of the people of Mongu and linked it with his own village, Clarinbridge, in Galway.  Through his work he has created a link between two communities, 6,000 miles apart.  The story of that Zambian town has travelled down the line, like two children talking into cups linked by a piece of string.  The people have responded to this story and so far have raised more than &euro;1 million for Sr. Cathy and the children of the Cheshire Home and the town of Mongu, so that they may have a better life.  This golden threat has strengthened the tie between the two communities.</P>
        <P>Throughout this country there are thousands of people who get involved in charities such as this.  This volunteerism is the force and the catalyst that can bond communities together.  The Alan Kearns story shows what can be achieved when a sense of community and volunteerism are harnessed.  Community is the only cure for the ills of modern living.  It is the common <Col N="458"/>denominator, the solution to loneliness, isolation, anti-social behaviour and social breakdown.  No doubt, in today&rsquo;s Ireland these threads have become frayed as communities have atomised over the last few years, with people increasingly seeking fulfilment from consumer products and services on an individual level.  When one hears of an old person who has been found dead, whose body had not been discovered for days, one knows that thread is broken.  When one hears that depression has increased 100% since the 1980s one knows the thread is broken.  It is broken where individualism and consumerism replace community as a source of belonging and fulfilment for people.  The economic boom of the last few years demonstrates clearly that happiness does not necessarily follow wealth.  In his first address to the D&aacute;il as Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The challenge we face to day is to temper a rising tendency towards individualism within Irish society.  This individualism can sap the energy from our sense of community, which is still strong and visible in so many ways.  What we must prioritise is to turn the benefits of individual flair to the benefit of the community and the nation as a whole.  Our responsibility is to fuel the engine of community &mdash; to lead the change away from the promotion of exclusive self-interest towards a superior value of wider community interest.  The pre-eminence of community and country and active citizenship over self promotes social harmony and a better quality of life for all.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are those who say that in this century the world will not allow time for the fulfilment of obligations to this generation or the next.  If one seeks excuses one will surely find them, but those who are too busy today will not be aware that this generation has more free time than any previous generation.  Those who pursue happiness through continued self-indulgence through continuous consumerism would not be aware of studies such as Robert Putnam&rsquo;s <i>Bowling Alone</i>, which have proved that the more one gives, the more one receives in return.</P>
        <P>The endless pursuit of riches by some who seek to achieve the ultimate accolade of being the richest person in the graveyard would do well to remember the words of Thomas Jefferson.  When he was berated by his mother for spending too much time on politics and in public service to the neglect of his business, he wrote to his mother, &ldquo;I would rather have it said that he lived usefully than he died rich&rdquo;.  If a person does not volunteer in his community or if there is no community to contribute to then we build, one person at a time, an increasingly unequal society as wealth grows.</P>
        <P>There is one force that cements a community in the lives of people, and that is active citizenship.  Deputy Bertie Ahern, in his time as Taoiseach, advocated active citizenship in his speech of 30 September 2006, when he said, &ldquo;I believe that the quality of life in society and the ultimate health of our communities depends on the willingness of people to become involved and active, active on behalf of themselves and their families, their communities and the more vulnerable members of society.  Happy the society that has people who act, rather than lament, who organise rather than complain, who accept a personal responsibility rather than walk by on the other side&rdquo;.  He set up the Taskforce on Active Citizenship.</P>
        <P>Education is the key to creating the next generation of active citizens.  I am happy to hear the NCCA will introduce a new subject in the autumn called politics and society.  If, as a society, we believe we can send children to school, not teach them French for 14 years, and then expect them to speak French that is a fool&rsquo;s paradise.  If we send them to school and do not teach them how to be active citizens, how to vote and volunteer, they will not be active citizens.</P>
        <P>It is often easier to believe we cannot affect change and cannot make a difference, but think of a Galway jersey in a southern African town and the golden thread connecting Clarinbridge <Col N="459"/>to Mongu.  Think of the words of Mahatma Gandhi, &ldquo;be the change in the world one wants to see and the rest will follow&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for the opportunity to present some views and hear the opinions put forward.  Senator Quinn said we have a long and proud tradition of volunteering in Ireland, and every speaker reflected that point of view.  Shortly before I was promoted in May of this year, I was with the Committee of Public Accounts in Zambia in South Africa.   We did the official part, and in our free time we had a private itinerary.  We visited some of the Irish there who were involved in charitable works.  In many cases they were from religious organisations.  They were there in small numbers, but the impact they had was huge.  They still had ties and contact with Ireland, and many of them received support because they were religious organisations.  One example was the Silesians.  There were two Silesian fathers involved in a homeless project.  They ran a school, accommodation and a hostel outside Capetown in a deprived part of the town.  They were in contact with the Silesian College in Celbridge, and there were funds and school items sent over.  The impact they were having, even though there were small numbers and resources, was unbelievable.  Everyone who spoke on that recognised that there is something in us as a race that wants to give, to participate and volunteer.</P>
        <P>Any time we are faced with a challenge, people at a national or global level rise to the challenge, whether it is a global disaster such as a tsunami, the Special Olympics or in our own community rise to the challenge time and again.  The important aspect of volunteering is not to make volunteers but to create the capacity and opportunity for people to volunteer.  I will not address all the comments made, but I have taken them and I will reflect on them.</P>
        <P>Some of the figures were right.  People do not volunteer because they are not asked.  Many of us volunteer because we are parents.  We become involved in organisations and societies because of our children.  They join the football club and we go with them.  One comment made was that it is important to engage with young people and students.  They are the volunteers of the future and the way they learn in school is the way they will continue.  Having an informal chat or a pint with people here, I have found almost every member of all parties of both Houses have come from backgrounds where they have been involved in their local communities, initially as volunteers.  Many remain so to this day.</P>
        <P>I became involved in the board of management of a school approximately 11 years ago when my eldest child started school.  It was easier to get on the board of management than off it.  I am still on the same board even though all three children had passed through the school.  There is something in us all that wants to give.</P>
        <P>When people move house, for example from rural Ireland to Dublin, if we do not create the opportunities and facilities for people to volunteer it may not be easy for them.  We have established the volunteer centres; they are relatively new and there are 20 of them.  Rather than roll out more and let them go off at a tangent, we are now doing a review to find out what they are doing, how they are doing it and make sure we have best practice.  We want to roll out the 20 volunteer centres we have on a national basis.  We need to know their precise role and that they meet specific criteria.  A number of people have come to the volunteer centres; they have recruited and asked people to volunteer and have matched them with a range of organisations.</P>
        <P>Many people spoke on the GAA.  Those of my age, and older and younger, will know when we grew up volunteering was very different.  Even the GAA has changed today.  When I grew up, the GAA I knew in my area was a completely voluntary organisation.  Now there are development officers assisting and working alongside volunteers.  It is important to acknowl<Col N="460"/>edge we still have large volunteering groups, but we must assist them.  Times have changed, but not for the worse.  We have changed for the better.  We have standards and criteria, and they are for the good of the population at large.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The legislation on charities will insure against fraud and misappropriation.  The regulations we are introducing are not intended to make things more complicated, but for the good of all.  The Government has made significant progress in implementing the objectives of volunteering and active citizenship agreed under Towards 2016, and in the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity. Through its involvement in social partnership, the community and voluntary sector has put the issue of active citizenship to the forefront of the Government&rsquo;s thinking.  Initiatives such as the Taskforce on Active Citizenship have further underlined the need to continue to develop opportunities for our citizens to get involved in a meaningful way with their communities.  Financial support for the community and voluntary sector, and for volunteering, has grown in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to active citizenship.  In addition to the &euro;6 million allocated for supports to volunteering, more than &euro;300 million of my Department&rsquo;s budget is channelled to voluntary and community groups, most of whom rely on volunteers to carry out their services.  It includes funding for community premises and development workers.  It also includes additional capacity for the most disadvantaged communities in more than 150 locations throughout the country.  My Department now supports a network of 20 volunteer centres which are under review.  It is important we adopt best practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, by supporting key initiatives at second and third levels, the Government is assisting the next generation to take up the challenge of active citizenship and to make a difference.  My Department is also encouraging initiatives to encourage a culture of philanthropy at every level in society from schools to the boardrooms of our most successful companies.</P>
        <P>I listened to all the comments and a number of issues arose, including insurance for community groups, which we need to look at to ensure we facilitate them.  We spoke about community awards.  My local authority, South Dublin County Council, has a scheme that gives recognition to small voluntary groups which, without those awards, would largely go unnoticed.   It gives them a huge boost, a sense of well-being and status within the community.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate.  There are too many comments for me to go through but I will take them back to the office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, a fellow county person.  I wish to raise the pollution of Lough Corrib which, as the Minister of State knows, is the source of Galway&rsquo;s drinking water and the effects of that pollution.</P>
        <P>Last Friday I heard a news report on the official Environmental Protection Agency results which said that Lough Corrib is a polluted lake which is the source of drinking water for Galway county and city.  An experienced angler who is passionate about the water quality of Lough Corrib stated that on the Headford side of the lake, water quality has been deteriorating <Col N="461"/>consistently for the past 30 years owing mainly raw sewage being deposited into the Headford river and into Mountross Bay from an overloaded sewerage plant which was incapable of treating the effluent.  While that plant is now capable of treating the sewage efficiently, the damage has been done and it will take 20 years for the lake to recover.  The water, which used to be clear to the bed of the lake, is now murky and the recent presence of zebra mussels, African weed and blue-green algae, which inhibits water flow, is a testament to how badly the lake has been polluted.  Fish stocks are also affected and anglers report that very few trout were caught this year.  However, that is only on the Headford side.  There are other sides which are in a far worse state.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I wish to speak about Oughterard, Clonbur, which is the home of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and other areas.  The Carra Mask Corrib group, which is really interested in the life of Lough Corrib, has said that raw effluent continues to be discharged into the water which affects the water quality.  In particular, areas such as Oughterard, Clonbur, Claregalway, Corofin and Dunmore, some of which are in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency, are badly affected, very polluted and need permanent treatment facilities which they do not have.</P>
        <P>For example, in Oughterard, two private samples were taken by RTEs &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and by the<i> Mail on Sunday</i>.  These two separate tests revealed there was 50 times the allowable limit of cryptosporidium going into the Corrib.  The allowable limit is nil.  Has this been checked by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister?  What are the levels now?  Is that water safe?  I do not think so.</P>
        <P>We must remember that the Corrib is the source of water for Galway city and county and it must be safe.  Equally, detergents are going into our water and there is evidence of 30% phosphorous in our water.  Germany does not allow any phosphorous in its water while Switzerland and Italy allow only 1%.  We are falling down there.</P>
        <P>There is a clear link between county water and city water and the Minister of State knows as well as I do the serious problems we have experienced in Galway city.  The county may be the source but the city has been mainly affected as well as parts of my area of Headford and Oranmore.  It is widely felt that the problem is with the Clare river.  Cryptosporidium and other bugs like e.coli are carried around the county and city by this river.  The cryptosporidium outbreak last year was caused by human effluent in the water.  This is definitely due to the lack of adequate tertiary treatment facilities for raw effluent.  It is quite simply poison.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to outline his plans and the timeframe for the treatment systems for Oughterard, Clonbur and Claregalway, in particular.  As the Minister of State knows, cryptosporidium destroyed public confidence in the public water supply.  It was followed by e.coli and now lead contamination.  The fall-out from all this means that not only tourism has suffered but also the home owner who must buy bottled water.  We have had one mess after another.  Sickness has ensued and health has been threatened but, thankfully, there have been no fatalities so far.</P>
        <P>Last week I was really disappointed when the Cathaoirleach refused to allow my Adjournment matter on lead contamination for which the Minister of State must answer.  The reason it was rejected was that it was described as a repetitive motion because the matter was raised in respect of Mallow the previous week.  I refute that completely.  I looked at the response given by the Minister.  It was appalling and there was no comparison.  As the Minister of State knows, Mallow has a totally different council, different budgets, the problem was on a lesser scale and it is not a city.  Dismissing my Adjournment matter relating to Galway as out of order was a lazy approach taken by a Minister.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>I have walked around the areas where people are affected.  They are worried about the cost of water and the weight of bottled water for older people and the cost of blood tests and water tests.  Why do councils and the Health Service Executive continue to aggravate the public?  I listened to the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, on the evening my leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, was in Galway about two weeks ago and he said resources were not an issue when it came to water quality.  What assurance can the Minister of State give that Galway drinking water is safe?  What resources are being provided and what measures are being taken to clean up Lough Corrib which is the ultimate source of this water?  It is extraordinary that those who discharge effluent into water, such as the council in the case of Mutton Island, are given licences by the Environmental Protection Agency and that towns like Oughterard and Clifden are so badly affected.  I look forward to hearing about the measures the Minister of State is implementing and resourcing in the two areas I mentioned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fidelma Healy-Eames for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline how my Department is working to improve water services infrastructure and water quality in the Corrib catchment and in Galway generally.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2007-09 includes more than 50 major water and sewerage schemes with a value of more than &euro;464 million for County Galway.  There are a further eight schemes worth in excess of &euro;114 million for Galway city.  A significant share of the sewerage schemes in the programme are in the Corrib catchment.  They will play a major role in preserving and improving water quality in the river and lake.  They include Headford, which is substantially completed, Dunmore, Tuam, Oughterard, where I attended a meeting a month ago with the local committee, Claregalway, Milltown and Corofin.  Galway County Council is also providing a new scheme at Clonbur under the devolved rural water programme which is part funded by my Department.</P>
        <P>Sewerage schemes already in place within the Corrib catchment with the aid of departmental funding include Tuam &mdash; phase one, Moycullen, Cong, Ballyhaunis, Ballinrobe and Claremorris.  Where schemes have yet to begin, I assure the House that my Department is anxious to facilitate progress as quickly as possible and is in ongoing contact in that regard with Galway County Council.  All these schemes will help protect the Corrib, the main source of Galway city&rsquo;s water supply.</P>
        <P>New drinking water treatment facilities will be provided under the Galway city water supply scheme to be funded under the water services investment programme at a cost of &euro;22.1 million.  The Minister has approved Galway City Council&rsquo;s proposals for a &euro;3.6 million advance element of the scheme to upgrade the Terryland water treatment plant to cater for the city&rsquo;s medium-term needs.  I understand Galway City Council has received tenders and hopes to begin work shortly.</P>
        <P>With regard to water quality in Lough Corrib, the Environmental Protection Agency monitoring for the period 2004 to 2006 shows that the upper section was classified as being in a mesotrophic category, indicative of a low level of pollution, and the lower section was classified as being oligotrophic, suggesting a very low level of pollution.  Both these classifications were consistent with satisfactory water quality conditions and were based on the level of total phosphorous and chlorophyll measured on at least 12 occasions in each of these years.</P>
        <P>Since December 2006, a new monitoring programme has been in place to meet water framework directive requirements.  Based on data collected in 2007 using this programme, a generally <Col N="463"/>positive interim assessment of status for Lough Corrib upper and lower has been determined.  The classification systems used to determine status have been approved at EU level.</P>
        <P>There is ongoing liaison between my Department and relevant State agencies on the co-ordination of policies and actions for water management in all areas.  The nitrates regulations, which came into effect in 2006, were developed in close consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Teagasc and are supported by an enhanced package of financial supports for farmers and cross-compliance systems operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The regulations provide a statutory basis for a range of measures to protect waters such as Lough Corrib from pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources.</P>
        <P>Overall, I confirm that a wide-ranging and comprehensive range of measures is being implemented to preserve and protect Lough Corrib.  These are backed up by substantial public funding and a commitment to continued improvement in the quality of our rivers and lakes and our drinking water supplies.</P>

We have been hearing about the water services investment programme for years and all these sewerage schemes have been on Galway County Council plans for years.

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  The issue of the school bus for the school on the Quivvy Road in Belturbet, County Cavan, is one that could be resolved as a consequence of this debate.  It could be resolved without cost to the Exchequer and bring a favourable result to the parents and children of the area.</P>
        <P>Twelve children eligible for school transport live on the Quivvy Road.  They deserve and need a bus to pick them up on that road.  The children have been requested to go to a central pick-up point at the end of the road.  The distance from home to the pick-up point is two miles for some children and three to four miles for others.  Therefore, it would be as logical for the parents to take the children straight to school as to the pick-up point.</P>
        <P>The pick-up point is not physically safe for the children.  They would have to cross the busy Clones-Belturbet road to the far side of the junction to get the bus and would have to stand where there is no bus shelter or infrastructure.  It is a health and safety risk to require 12 children to stand at such a point.  Visibility is not good at the junction and it is unsafe to have cars and children congregating at the pick-up point.</P>
        <P>The Quivvy Road is negotiable, but perhaps the Minister of State has been told otherwise.  There is a marina at the end of the road and cars towing boats negotiate the road.  Lorries also drive on the road.  A number of houses have been constructed on the road and the cement lorries have driven in and out.  There are also a number of lay-bys on the road.  Therefore, a bus could easily negotiate the road and other traffic could pass the bus.  Up to a few years ago there was a school bus on the road.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P>Another issue is that many of the families on the road only have one car and the owner may very well leave home early to drive to work in other towns.  One mother on the road has a child-minding service and minds other children as well as her own.  She can hardly leave those children alone while she goes off to take her child to school.  Many of the families have preschool children which makes it difficult for them to take other children to the pick-up point and in some families both parents may be working.  There is already traffic congestion at the school and there is no logic in adding to that.</P>
        <P>The more the Minister hears about the situation, the greater the need, he will realise, to revise the file.  The information he has received may be wrong.  The situation is nonsensical.  It is unsafe to walk or cycle on the road because of the volume of traffic, including lorries and cars pulling boats.  It is unsafe for children to walk or cycle to the pick-up point.  If a parent was to take children to the pick-up point, it would more logical to take them to the school.</P>
        <P>There is a new road off the Quivvy Road on which a family called the Tanners live.  This road too is negotiable by buses and lorries.  This family lives quite far from both the pick-up point and the school and constitutes a special case.  An incredible offer has been made to solve the dilemma for this family.  It has been offered &euro;2 a day to cover the cost of getting over the difficulty and towards the cost of arranging private transport.  This is bizarre in itself.  I suggest not much more would go a long way towards sending the bus up and down the Quivvy Road.  The situation seems to me to be the result of a local turf war of some description, but it affects real people and must be addressed.  It is a problem for the victims and causes major difficulty in their lives.</P>
        <P>Looking at the situation from the outside, it appears bizarre.  That the Department has said if parents pay for an extended service, it will provide it is an admission the road is negotiable.  The Minister of State may well have been told in memos that a school bus could not go that road, but the same Department staff are sending messages to the parents that if they pay up, the bus will pick up on the road.  The road is negotiable, therefore.  Otherwise, they are making an irresponsible offer.</P>
        <P>Parents were to receive clarification on the safety of the pick-up point but that has not been forthcoming.  The pick-up point is on the Clones-Belturbet road.  Some 12 children from the Quivvy Road need transport.  While there are approximately eight car owners on the road, many of those cars are used for going to work.  I suggest that at virtually no cost the humane sensible solution could be offered in this situation.  The children can be picked up and everyone can be happy.  It is an affirmation of good parenting and of the children.  It would also provide an opportunity for the parents to work and do other things.  I appeal to the Minister of State to apply logic to this.  Sometimes these things are considered based on a theoretical model that does not fit the real-life circumstances.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply with interest and I know he will see the sensible option.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding school transport for the children living on the Quivvy Road who attend national schools in Belturbet, County Cavan.  By way of general comment, one of the main objectives of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from schools and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>Approximately 136,000 primary and post-primary pupils use the school transport scheme on a regular basis.  The allocation for school transport in 2008 is &euro;175.2 million.  Around 25% of the allocation will be expended this year on transport costs and grant aid for children with special needs, who represent about 6% of the overall number of children carried each day.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, pupils who are attending their nearest suitable national school and reside 3.2 km or more from the school are determined by the Department to be eligible for free school transport.  Primary school transport routes are generally planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 km to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport service on behalf of the Department, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of school bus services.  Bus routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable level of service while at the same time ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  Routes are determined on the basis of numbers of eligible pupils in particular areas, road networks, distance guidelines and other operational factors.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the families residing in the Quivvy Road area are being accommodated within guidelines, with pick-up points between 1.77 and 2.4 km from their homes.  In the circumstances, the Department is not prepared to approve an extension of a service where it is satisfied that children have a level of service within the school transport guidelines.  However, parents of eligible children may, where feasible and subject to certain conditions, pay for an extension to an existing transport route.  Accordingly, the parents in this case may, should they so wish, consult with the local Bus &Eacute;ireann office regarding the feasibility of a payable extension to the current service.  I thank the Senator once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in this regard.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his courteous reply and, indeed, his courtesy at all times.  While I take the point that there is no home pick-up service, and I fully accept that could not be the case, this is a distinct set of circumstances in that we are speaking of a negotiable route involving minimal extra travel &mdash; it is only a matter of the bus taking a different route to accommodate the children &mdash; and the pick-up point is an exercise in hardship.  I am conscious of the time of the Cathaoirleach and of the next Senator, but I ask the Minister of State to revisit the file in light of humane considerations.  If the Minister would agree to look personally at the case I would be happy.  There is no logic to the existing situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes; I will look at the file again and talk to Bus &Eacute;ireann about the suggestions made by the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this most important issue.  I raise the issue of MRSA not to indict hospitals or, in this case, dentists, but just to flag the issue and request some information.  I do it with no intention other than this.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, for being here to respond.</P><Col N="466"/>
        <P>Coinciding with my decision to ask about MRSA auditing in dentists, we went through quite a traumatic experience locally in Donegal in which babies were diagnosed with MRSA in Letterkenny General Hospital.  This links to what I was going to say.  It can be seen that a number of measures were taken, including specialist cleaning followed by testing of areas within the unit to ensure they were free of MRSA, and screening of patients and staff in the maternity unit in Letterkenny to prevent further cases.  However, the mother of one of the infected babies, who also has three other children, wondered whether the control measures had been put in place as a result of the cases and whether they could have been introduced sooner.  That is the main reason I have raised this matter.</P>
        <P>We all know that MRSA is a difficult name to pronounce: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  I prefer to call it the superbug.  The bacterium is responsible for difficult-to-treat infections in humans and is especially troublesome in hospital-associated infections.  It is resistant to some antibiotics but not all drugs.  The greatest risk is to patients with open wounds or weakened immune systems or who have been fitted with invasive devices.  Improper sanitary procedures may transfer bacteria from patient to patient.  These are facts with which most people are familiar at this point.  I am interested in prevention strategies, which include patient screening upon hospital admission; surface sanitisation and the use of appropriate disinfectants; the use of personal protective clothing such as gloves, surgical masks and eye protection; the isolation of MRSA-positive patients; hand washing and alcohol-based hand rubs, and the availability of adequate facilities and supplies that encourage workers to practice good hygiene.  These are aspects of what we are familiar with in terms of the hospital location.</P>
        <P>However, the difficulty with MRSA is that is it not confined to hospitals but is found in every community.  In this instance I wish to draw attention to its presence in dentists&rsquo; surgeries, outpatient settings and health care facilities &mdash; anywhere a high degree of hygiene is necessary.  That is why I am raising this.  Some people are concerned about whether aerosols and spatter generated during dental treatment can spread MRSA, and whether dentists are provided with the same resources as hospitals to allow them to institute infection control procedures.  Some issues of simple hygiene are mentioned quite often in the Seanad; for example, do dentists wear their uniforms outside the dentist&rsquo;s office?  What about other people working within the system?</P>
        <P>The Dental Council of Ireland has a code of practice for infection control in dentistry, which states: &ldquo;If recommended infection control procedures are followed and accidental inoculation by sharps is avoided, there is minimum risk of transmission of serious infectious diseases during dental treatment&rdquo;.  Are we pursuing guidelines similar to those which operate in the USA under the American Dental Association?  In 2003, these guidelines included educating and protecting dental health care personnel; preventing transmission of blood-borne pathogens; hand hygiene; personal protective equipment; attention to contact dermatitis and latex hypersensitivity; sterilisation and disinfection of patient care items; environmental infection control; attention to dental unit water lines, biofilms and water quality; and other special considerations, such as the use of dental hand-pieces and other devices, radiology, parenteral medications, oral surgical procedures, and dental laboratories.</P>
        <P>We currently have audits for hygiene in hospitals.  These are keeping our hospitals under pressure to ensure the best standards.  We do have an issue with MRSA and other superbugs.  If we know how to minimise the potential for the spread of this disease, has the HSE started or does it intends to open up audit facilities for dentists?  I know it intends to introduce them for nursing homes and so on.  This is not in any way an attack on any individual dentist.  I am talking about the implementation of standard procedures and hygiene quality assurance so <Col N="467"/>people can have the confidence in other health professionals that they should have in their local hospitals.</P>
        <P>Returning to the original point I made, I trust that those who have contracted MRSA in recent times in any of our hospitals will be given personal follow-up in their cases to try to get them over it.  I also trust that we will minimise the number of people in the future who might contract such a dangerous and invasive super bug.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am happy to have the opportunity to address the important issues raised by Senator Keaveney.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that it is the job of each and every member of the dental team, whether in a public or private dental surgery, to play a role in implementing safe and realistic infection control procedures.  I wish to reassure Senator Keaveney that the issue of controlling infection is a high priority within the dental surgeries of the public dental service of the Health Service Executive.  Within the public dental service, there are four principal dental surgeons who have lead responsibility for quality and audit, health and safety and dental radiology.  Under this remit, their work involves continually updating the knowledge within the public dental service of emerging issues, research and other relevant advancements in terms of infection control.  They are also responsible for monitoring and enforcing overall health and safety standards in keeping with Dental Council of Ireland code of practice, and health and safety legislation.  They and their other principal dental surgeon colleagues throughout the public dental service actively follow best practice in the prevention of infection.</P>
        <P>While the responsibility to prevent infection lies, in the first instance, with each individual staff member, the Health Information and Quality Authority has the right to externally review the dental services provided in the public dental services under the Health (Amendment) Act 2007.</P>
        <P>The Dental Council of Ireland takes a strong interest in conditions pertaining in private dental surgeries.  The Dental Council of Ireland has developed a code of practice relating to infection control in dentistry which it issues to all registered dentists.  This code of practice is updated by the Dental Council of Ireland based on expert opinion as necessary.  Under this code dentists have a duty to take appropriate precautions to protect their patients and their staff from the risk of cross-infection.  In addition, it also advises them that failure to provide and use adequate decontamination, disinfection and sterilisation facilities may lead to proceedings for professional misconduct before the fitness to practice committee of the Dental Council of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, employers have a legal responsibility to ensure that all their employees are appropriately trained and proficient in the procedures necessary for working safely.  All dental practices are required to display a safety statement and all staff should be familiar with this statement.  Employers also have a responsibility to protect staff, patients and others attending their practices.  While at work, employees are required by the Act to take reasonable care for their own and others&rsquo; health and safety and to comply with the health and safety requirements of their employers.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to inform the House of an important related development initiated by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who announced last year that she plans to bring forward a new national oral health policy.  This new oral health policy, the first such policy in 13 years, is being undertaken by the Department of Health and Children, in <Col N="468"/>conjunction with the HSE.  The development of this new policy will allow a critical examination of the many challenges and issues currently facing the dental sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As part of this process of policy development, the Department of Health and Children have been examining the regulatory regime which governs the dental sector in Ireland.  This examination will include consideration of a strengthening of the legal mechanisms which can be put in place to improve inspection of dental premises and ensure compliance with standards across a wide range of issues, including infection control.  The development of the national oral health report will also consider the recommendations of the recent report of the commission on patient safety and quality assurance.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Dental School and Hospital is one of only seven institutions in Ireland which has been accredited by HIQA as demonstrating excellence in patient health and safety.  The dental hospital also has an innovative water-line sterilisation unit which ensures that water used during patient treatment is of the highest quality in international terms.  Finally, the Department of Health and Children is committed to developing and maintaining a culture of vigilance in regard to preventing infection and to create the conditions whereby all dental surgeries are operated in line with best international practice in preventing infection.</P>
