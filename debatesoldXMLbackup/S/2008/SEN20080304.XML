	<P>The headline over one of the letters in <i>The Irish Times</i> today is &ldquo;RTE&rsquo;s coverage of tribunal&rdquo;.  I am respectful of the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s guide with regard to tribunal business but this is an issue of the freedom of the media.  I note the writer, John Cregan T.D., states he writes as Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  He writes that RTE&rsquo;s continued obsession with the Mahon tribunal is a matter of extreme concern to him and to many fellow Members of the Oireachtas.  Does the Deputy Leader support what is stated in this letter?  Did the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have discussions on sending this letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>?  I am concerned it is an interference in the freedom of the media.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;telling our national broadcaster how to respond to issues of the day and making such critical comments.  Is there any other western democracy where the chairman of a communications committee would write this type of letter to a national newspaper?  Will the Deputy Leader respond to my points on this issue?  Does he support the view of the writer with regard to the coverage on RTE being unfair?  It is a disturbing letter to be sent from the Chair<Col N="1415"/>man of the committee to <i>The Irish Times</i> undermining RTE&rsquo;s reporting on the tribunal.  I look forward to hearing what the Deputy Leader has to state on it.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the matter of the underfunding of primary education and a letter many of us received.  Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Healy-Eames and Alex White raised this matter last week.  We have now received a letter signed by the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education Schools, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, Gaelscoileanna, Educate Together, the Islamic Board of Education and the Catholic Primary Schools Managers Association.  They are extremely concerned about the lack of realistic capitation and ancillary grants which means almost all schools will be sustained only by their community fundraising efforts.</P>
        <P>It is time we had the Minister for Education and Science here to discuss this specific matter in view of the letter signed by so many people and sectors in education who are extremely concerned about funding.  Parents up and down the country know about this because they do so much fundraising themselves.  It is time for a realistic examination of primary school education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the committee referred to by Senator Fitzgerald, I am a solid supporter of its Chairman, Deputy Cregan and will defend his right to the death to say what he has to say.  However, the letter does not represent the views of the committee and this should be corrected.  The committee should not be drawn into the personal views he is entitled to hold and the criticisms he is entitled to lay and deal with like any other Member of the House.  I certainly feel uncomfortable about this.  I tend to keep away from this discussion in the House.  It is time for a broader and more general debate on tribunals.  We debated the matter previously when the new terms of reference for the tribunal were established.  It should be examined again to see how it is working.</P>
        <P>I do not know if Senators have heard but Cement Roadstone Holdings pre-tax profits for this year are down to a mere &euro;2 billion.  This worry for me has added to my sleeplessness over the past few nights.  For some time now, I have been extraordinarily concerned for the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  We should give some thought for and show some solidarity with that hard-pressed group of people, the builders of Ireland.</P>

	<P>How they are doing is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious issue.  With the costs of maintaining helicopters and changing planes, one must have some level of sympathy for them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Tom Parlon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious issue, particularly with the recent demand from the CIF that construction workers should take a 30% drop in salary and agree to a pay-freeze for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>We should give this serious consideration because the workers in the construction industry, ungrateful wretches that they are, have shown little consideration for the hardship reduced profits have forced upon the builders of Ireland.  If construction workers were to show any sense of fair play, they would agree to work for nothing for the next several years to keep the builders of Ireland in the comfort to which they are used.</P>
        <P>I believe we should go further and that churches, mosques, temples and other places of worship might consider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The construction industry is an issue.  Over the past five years the Seanad has debated difficulties with the construction industry, first-time buyers being screwed and their parents being oppressed, suppressed and being taken advantage of by profiteering, greedy and grasping builders.</P>
        <P>The builders now have the cheek to tell us that the people working for them should take a reduction in salary.  It is appalling they can do so with a straight face.  I would welcome a debate on the matter.  Maybe we should have a national collection to support the building industry profiteers who have taken every cent out of our pockets for the past ten years.  I would welcome a serious discussion on the construction industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>A Chathaoirligh, I thought you were a little hard on Senator O&rsquo;Toole as he was doing very well with his comments on the construction industry, with which I agree.  He also dealt well with Deputy Cregan&rsquo;s letter that Senator Fitzgerald raised.  This would not be the first letter or article in a newspaper which was of a politically partisan nature, dressed up as a concern for balance in the media.  The Deputy&rsquo;s letter is another example of that.  He was entitled to write the letter but we are entitled to have our views on it.</P>
        <P>I have previously raised, perhaps to the point of tedium, the issue of the taking of Committee Stage debates.  Second Stage of the Passports Bill will be taken tomorrow with Committee Stage to be taken on Thursday.  It is unsatisfactory to take Committee Stage of any Bill, irrespective of how technical it is, the day after Second Stage.</P>
        <P>Second Stage is a general debate on the philosophy of a Bill with the toing and froing between Members and the Minister.  All involved need to absorb those general principles from the debate <Col N="1417"/>and prepare for whatever amendments they wish to bring forward.  In the case of the Passports Bill, Committee Stage amendments must be in before Second Stage, which is unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the operation of the refugee appeals system.  This morning&rsquo;s newspapers contained extraordinary reports about two senior members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The Cathaoirleach will be happy it is not the other tribunal which Members so often raise on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Kennedy, a former Minister and Member of both Houses, and Mr. Eamonn Barnes, a former director of public prosecutions, indicated an intent to go to the High Court to challenge a statement of the chairman of the tribunal.  It was in respect of the record of one particular member of the tribunal, which was challenged in the High Court and has been raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and other Members.  The chairman stated the man&rsquo;s record was not at variance with the records of other members of the tribunal.  We now discover this statement is entirely false and other senior members of the tribunal were prepared to go so far as to appear in court, separately from their chairman, to challenge it.  They have said that their records, and those of other members of the tribunal, were significantly at variance with the record of the man in question, which was challenged in the High Court and subsequently settled.</P>
        <P>The House will soon debate the immigration Bill but this issue cannot wait until then.  Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to explain an unprecedented situation that has arisen in respect of this body in which we should have full confidence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of that tribunal are prepared to challenge their own chairman.  Given what we have heard today, there is a serious question mark over the chairman of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the integrity of that body.  The Minister must come to the House to explain his views and state whether he agrees with me that there is now a serious question about the operation of the refugee appeals system in this country.  We should have this debate urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Alex White&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the Chamber to discuss the reports in the newspapers today that certain senior members of the Refugee Appeals Authority have taken a divergent position from the chairman of the tribunal.  It is a serious issue that requires clarification.  Under the new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill the chairperson of the tribunal, which is to be abolished, will become the chairperson of the new Protec<Col N="1418"/>tion Review Tribunal.  It is important that there be absolute confidence in the integrity of both this body and the office of chairperson.  The House needs clarification on this.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to address the issue of testing for radon gas in homes across the country.  There is a report in today&rsquo;s newspapers that levels 45 times the acceptable limit were found in a house in Ballyporeen, County Tipperary.  The head of the Radiological Protection Institute has estimated that 91,000 homes in Ireland have high radon levels but only 4,000 of those have been identified so far.  It is possible to have homes tested for radon, which is a naturally occurring cancer-causing gas.  Because radon is colourless, odourless and tasteless, people often do not realise their homes may contain high levels of it.  It is important that the Department encourage and facilitate people in carrying out this test.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to explain what his Department is doing to help householders to measure radon levels in their own homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with either the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, whoever would be more appropriate, on the issue of genetically modified feedstuffs and food.  I do so in view of the fact that we almost had a Private Members&rsquo; debate on this matter, which would have clarified various points.  We discussed the matter previously with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent.</P>
        <P>There is some indication in the programme for Government of an all-Ireland approach on GM foods and feedstuffs.  However, when I and the other members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food met yesterday with our colleagues from the Northern Ireland Assembly agriculture committee, they seemed blissfully unaware of an all-island approach.  In his capacity as a member of the Green Party and the Acting Leader, I ask Senator Boyle to let me know what exactly is the Government&rsquo;s current policy in this area.  Is it simply window-dressing in a document or is there a realistic policy?  Perhaps the Government could arrange that the members of the Northern Ireland agriculture committee be made aware of the Government&rsquo;s interest, if any, in having an all-Ireland approach.  As I said, when the members of the Oireachtas joint committee met with our counterparts in Belfast they seemed unaware of any such proposals from the Irish Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Acting Leader to arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come to the House for a debate on the conflict in the Middle East.  In <Col N="1419"/>the past week, 100 Palestinians have been slaughtered and three Israelis have been killed as well.  A senior Israeli Minister said that the Palestinians would bring a holocaust upon themselves.  By firing long-range missiles into Ashkelon, which is 10 km north of Gaza, Hamas is tempting fate by putting it up to the Israelis despite the Israelis&rsquo; superior firepower.  Condoleezza Rice was to arrive there today and it is to be hoped she will help to resolve the situation.  The Americans have taken little interest in the past seven years but it is important that this House should have an opportunity to debate the issue again.  Mahmoud Abbas, president of the West Bank region of Palestine, has called off discussions with the Israelis, although the Israelis are still prepared to talk.  It is a very complex issue but, as convenor of the Friends of Palestine in the Oireachtas, it is incumbent on me to raise it.  I also welcome the fact that members of the foreign affairs committee are in the region at present.  I hope they will assist in promoting dialogue between all the parties in that troubled region.  However, I condemn the activities of the Israeli Government and Ehud Olmert in the slaughter of the innocents in Palestine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Alex White raised the Refugee Appeals Tribunal; I have been raising it over a considerable period.  I concur with the Senator&rsquo;s remarks.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must come to the House, urgently, to answer a series of question on it.  In the Nyembo case, in which three refugees sought redress in the courts, there was a judgment from the Supreme Court.  In that judgment, Miss Justice Denham said that a statement from the chairman of the tribunal had stated, &ldquo;The record of the second-named respondent [Mr. Nicholson] is not at variance with other members of the first-named respondent [the tribunal].  However,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;there is no evidence in the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents vindicating [this] assertion.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>We now know that the members of the tribunal protested vigorously to the chairman and requested a meeting with him, which was denied.  They then had a meeting themselves at which a letter was composed.  The House should take seriously what was in the letter, which stated, &ldquo;The legal strategy being adopted in these proceedings conveys the impression that the tribunal needs to hide and conceal the manner in which it does its business.  The tribunal also continues to proceed in this manner without any consultation with its members, without seeking their approval, and without even affording the courtesy of an explanation to them as to why this course of action is being relentlessly pursued.&rdquo;  It continued that there was &ldquo;a widespread and increasingly public perception that cases have been allocated to members of the tribunal&rdquo; with a track record of refusing refugee applicants.  This letter is from <Col N="1420"/>members of the tribunal and was written by, among others, a former Member of this House who is also a former senior Cabinet Minister, member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and a former Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>The most serious aspect of this is the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which is due to come before the House.  Section 137 of that Bill proposes that the current chairman of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal should automatically become the chairman of the next tribunal.  That is astonishing.  We must demand an explanation.  This is somebody whose statement to the Supreme Court has been shown to be wrong, the implication from the judgment clearly being that it was deliberately wrong.  That is perjury, and we are discussing automatically re-appointing a person in this position who does not have the confidence of the serving members.  The House is entitled to an explanation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposed debate on the pharmacy issue later today.  I do not wish to trespass on that time but I wish to bring a constituency matter to the attention of the Acting Leader.  I have been contacted by the School of Pharmacy on an aspect of the dispute that might get lost in the debate.  Graduates of the School of Pharmacy in Trinity College, and presumably of the other colleges, are required to do a type of intern course for six months in community pharmacies.  Due to the delay and the legal action, it appears unlikely that this year&rsquo;s cohort will be able to do this and, as a result, will not be in a position to become fully qualified.  We will be short a complete cohort of pharmacists in 2009 and graduates will be unable to take up positions.  That is a serious matter.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments.  I could not believe that an Israeli Minister would use the word <i>shoah</i> and threaten to visit it upon the Palestinian people.  Another Minister said that Israel was using the army to deliver a message to Hamas.  It is shameful to use it.  Among the 120 Palestinian victims, as opposed to the three victims on the Israeli side which we all regret, four were small children playing football.  That is not the way to deliver a message in a civilised community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>The remarks made about the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are unfounded.  I read the letter.  It is a very calm letter and it sets out, in some detail, to query the wisdom of 18 RTE reporters interviewing, in many cases, each other about the tribunal.  It is very hard to argue that this should not more properly be the business of RTE internal editorial committees, which clearly have not been doing their duty.  There is no argument to sustain that on that particular week the fairly minor affairs of St. Luke&rsquo;s constituency office were of more importance than anything else that was happening in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that 18 RTE reporters should be deployed on it.  RTE senior personnel were very quick to query and express their unease at my appearance on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  However, none of them mentioned, nor did anyone on the Oireachtas committee, to be fair, that on the previous week&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, there had been great criticism of the Government and the week before that there had been a complete panel attack on the Government.   I would regard my appearance as merely balancing the books.</P>

        <P>We need a debate on the operation of tribunals in this country, as a general proposition because there is a new symbiotic relationship between all tribunals and the media.  It is not a good thing that tribunal daily bulletins can be parsed and analysed by the media.  Imagine if that was the case in the current criminal murder trial going on.  What would happen if there were daily bulletins?  How could one have any due process?</P>

I am surprised that Fine Gael and the Labour Party do not understand the dangers inherent in allowing a Taoiseach to be tormented without due process because nobody is safe in Fine Gael and the Labour Party from this new symbiosis of a media chasing circulation in cahoots with tribunals.

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

	<P>I agree with the remarks of Senators Alex White, D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca and David Norris on the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  We have suspected fishy business, so to speak, for quite a while and a number of decisions seemed rather questionable.  Senator Norris has been strong on this matter and I have agreed with him.  I support today&rsquo;s call for a debate on the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I hope the Deputy Leader can arrange it.</P><Col N="1424"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is appropriate that the Deputy Leader is taking questions today because I have one that I know he will be able to answer fully.  What is the rationale behind the recent decision, if it is a decision, on Part V of the Planning and Development Act dealing with social and affordable housing, as amended in 2002?  I understood that as a result of the amendment a builder or developer could give money or land in lieu of setting aside 20% of a development for social and affordable housing or provide houses elsewhere.  There has been comment on this recently.  I believe it will lead to segregation, something the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s party opposed in the past.  If a developer provides money in lieu, it takes a local authority time to find suitable land on which to spend it, hence frequent long delays in the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
        <P>I wrote about this matter recently and am concerned that a country as small as ours can see such unevenness in the application of the rules in various local authorities.  I have great faith in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and I know he means well with respect to many issues in my home county, not least Killarney House and sea eagles.  I am concerned about this issue however, and know there is no better man than Senator Boyle to explain the rationale behind what is going on and where the matter is headed.</P>

	<P>I share the views of Senators calling for a debate on the Middle East situation.  Iran is fighting a proxy war with Israel by supplying Hamas with missiles that have the capacity to reach into the state of Israel in the knowledge that there will be retaliation.  Sadly, this has escalated to the point that an Israeli minister has, as mentioned by Senator Norris, used the term &ldquo;Shoah&rdquo;, an entirely inappropriate word.  It is saddening that any Israeli minister could say that this could be visited on another nation.  It is entirely appropriate that we all hope such a means of destroying people is never again visited upon the world.  Israel&rsquo;s response to the rocket attacks, murdering so many people, is entirely inappropriate, as are the rocket attacks.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, I am a strong supporter of Israel in its right to exist, survive and thrive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Recent reports have criticised both Houses of the Oireachtas for not passing many laws and I do not believe many Bills have come to this House lately.  I was sur<Col N="1425"/>prised last week, therefore, to come across a survey of 49 countries by the University of Jerusalem that found Ireland regulated more than all the others.  Ireland has 215 organisations with statutory powers and 52 bodies dedicated to regulation.  In 1989 we regulated in only two areas but now we seem to have become the world&rsquo;s greatest nanny state.  I am as guilty as others because we all have called on the Government to introduce various new regulations and laws.  We are in serious danger of making our country very unattractive to investors, whether indigenous or foreign.  If we continue to regulate and put in stipulations and regulations in regard to everything, we will make ourselves quite unattractive in the future.</P>
        <P>One of the first things President Barroso did when he came to power in Europe three years ago was to make Europe more attractive for competitors in the future by abolishing 70 different regulations he considered were no longer needed.  I ask the Deputy Leader to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that we are now excessively regulated to such an extent that we make ourselves very unattractive to investors, both indigenous and foreign.  I suggest we look again at the possibility of getting rid of some of these regulations to make Ireland less of a nanny state than it has become.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the Middle East because it seems to have gone off the radar for some considerable time.  I recall a few years ago that the plight of the Palestinians would be discussed in the House regularly.  We need to reactivate our concern in this regard.  One of the reasons the Seanad always has had an interest in helping those in other countries less fortunate than ourselves has been that we so often ourselves have looked to the world to come and support us, particularly in regard to the Northern conflict, and we always found countries prepared to come forward and to help.  We can see the result of that help in the peace which prevails on this island at present.</P>
        <P>I can recall when some of the major powers in the world called for constitutional means to be used in the Middle East conflict and Hamas was prepared to do that.  It came forward and contested the elections and won.  As the result did not suit certain powers, they started to meddle again.  I knew at the time when I saw the Americans coming back on stream and meddling in the aftermath of the elections that we were starting a whole cycle of violence all over again.</P>
        <P>One thing is certain: there is no way the horrific events of recent days would be carried out with impunity by Israel were it not for the fact that it knows it has the support of other countries to do that.  I have heard very little outcry about the innocent babies who were slaughtered in the recent attacks.  When any minister in a civilised government threatens a holocaust on what is basi<Col N="1426"/>cally a very weak nation there should be an outcry.</P>
        <P>We all have received correspondence from the Palestinian organisations in this country and have been in touch and have discussed the issues with them.  The only hope they have to avoid this terrible horror is that nations such as Ireland that have been so fortunate to have had such global support when it has been needed and that are in a stronger position would speak out and support them in their hour of need.</P>

	<P>I call for a debate on the Private Residential Tenancies Board in light of the fact that it has changed premises and no longer has a public office.  Given that many of us live in highly residential areas where properties are rented, it would be appropriate to have a debate on that matter.</P>
        <P>I attended a function in Cork the aim of which was to highlight prostate cancer.  It is estimated that one in 14 men will become infected.  Will the Deputy Leader facilitate a debate on that issue?  We also need a debate on mental health, especially men&rsquo;s health.  Women and the feminist movement rightly speak about the role of women and women&rsquo;s issues but it is important to raise the issue of men&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>I wish to enlighten Senator Harris that no Fine Gael cumann has &euro;63,000 at its disposal.  That is a point he should note.</P>

It has been a long tradition that we have a debate on the Six Counties and I am aware that one will be facilitated this year.  Does the Deputy Leader know when that debate will take place, especially given that a number of events are being organised internationally and at home to mark the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations?  I ask that Senators support a request I have made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that as part of the debate in the Seanad we would invite the First Minister, Mr. Ian Paisley, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, to address the House.  Many Senators will note&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There is ongoing debate in the media as to whether Ian Paisley will be First Minister next year.  It would be apt that <Col N="1427"/>this would happen given it is ten years since the Agreement.</P>
        <P>I agree with the call to have the Minister for Education and Science come to the House to debate the issue of funding for primary level education.  This State is at crisis point with regard to primary education.  The matter needs to be addressed and deserves a full one or two-day debate.  The issue of water charges is a scandal.  Charging our children to flush their toilets last year was only a symptom of the underfunding of the primary school network.  I ask that the Deputy Leader would facilitate this debate as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I have called for a debate on the west on numerous occasions but we have not yet had an opportunity to have it, despite the fact that as we adjourned last Thursday, three businesses closed down, one in my home town of Gweedore with the loss of 34 jobs, one in Achill with the loss of 36 jobs and one in An Daingean with the loss of 40 jobs.  Not only that, the company that operated those three call centres was to start up in another part of Donegal with the creation of another 40 jobs in the next two months.  These closures have the same effect as thousands of jobs being lost overnight in the city of Dublin.  There is serious pressure in the west.  I ask that we would facilitate a debate on regional development, particularly all that needs to be done in the areas of employment, infrastructure and the necessary supports for the west.</P>

	<P>Oireachtas Members attended a meeting with the Health Service Executive yesterday on the health service in the midlands, which is why I call for this debate.  The Leader, Senator Cassidy, promised that the Minister would come to the House but she has not done so.  She is coming to deal with the pharmacy issue because it is topical but I am talking about the sale of three acres of land on the St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital site.  Where will that money go?  Will it go back into the psychiatric services where it can have an affect for the people who need it most?  We need an Alzheimer&rsquo;s unit.  The family of a 49 year old man came to me yesterday because they have nowhere to put him because there is no Alzheimer&rsquo;s unit in the mid<Col N="1428"/>lands.

	<P>I join the call for a debate on the Middle East, but perhaps it should not happen quite yet.  It is somewhat dangerous to talk in the heat and passion of the incident which has just happened.  As all right-thinking Members in the House have said, it is an appalling situation where babies and children, or any innocent human beings, lose their lives.  It appears this debate provokes sometimes unreasonable passions and it provokes anti-Israeli feeling which is ingrained in the minds of some Members of this House.  I noticed in particular Senator Leyden&rsquo;s language.  He talked about 100 Palestinians being slaughtered but he also said three Israelis were killed as well.  That type of language puts one killing on one level and the other on another.  That is the danger we are getting into in this debate.  We all despise, condemn and are repulsed by the loss of human life.  If the Israelis commit atrocities they must be condemned but we must not fall into the trap of not condemning those on the other side who also commit atrocities.</P>

	<P>It is a question of language.  If we have that debate we must be very focused and look also at Iran and other countries in that area which are guilty of atrocities of which we cannot approve either.  If we are to have a debate, it must be balanced.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Quinn about financial regulation.  Regulation in this country is ridiculous and is out of hand.  I do not know whether the Senator said this but my belief is that we should debate not so much the regulations as the regulators.  Maybe that is what Senator Quinn is seeking.  Because we have so many regulators it is almost impossible to keep up with what they are doing.  What we ought to do is to look at whether they are of any value.</P>
        <P>I have severe doubts about the Financial Regulator which is very fast to pounce on a wrongdoing when it has happened but very slow to ever discover it.  Its public relations staff are geniuses.  When something goes wrong it comes in with its army of public relations people and pursues the person or the institution which has committed the financial misdemeanour but it rarely discovers <Col N="1429"/>any wrongdoing.  We might debate the matter in that light.</P>

        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader, as previous colleagues on this side of the House have done, to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House for one serious debate on the underfunding of primary education.  The summer works scheme is gone, although it allowed much valuable work to be done during the summer.  The devolved scheme which allowed local communities to build classrooms has been slashed.  Water charges have been introduced and a new form of funding, namely, fundraising, such as &ldquo;Who wants to be a Thousandaire?&rdquo;.  That is the way our schools are being funded.  In the past three weeks I have written three cheques for three different schools that were trying to get advertising to fund &ldquo;Who wants to be a Thousandaire?&rdquo;.  What is our chance in the knowledge society?  I do not know.</P>

        <P>I was contacted urgently this morning about another breakdown in education.  A commitment was given to Glenamaddy community school in 2001 when it agreed to the amalgamation of two schools in Glenamaddy.  Those two buildings are still in existence three quarters of a mile apart.  A total of 500 second level schoolchildren are being bussed from one end of the town to the other.  Some of them walk that distance.  This is appalling.  This gives rise to loss of learning time, inconvenience to teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach is not solely responsible for the peace process and the Celtic tiger.

	<P>We can be thankful that so little media attention is paid to the Seanad or else we would be greatly enlarging the amount of coverage given to the tribunals, something that is so deplored by Deputy John Cregan and others.  I support Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comment on the general need for us to have a discussion about how the tribunals are working.  I have long been concerned about the impact of the tribunals on due process.  I do not wish to get into the substantive issues being ventilated by the tribunals at the moment but there is a serious problem with the way some people&rsquo;s reputations are being treated.</P>
        <P>In that context I would welcome broadly what Deputy John Cregan wrote in his letter about RTE&rsquo;s coverage.  I would defend him also in that he did not purport to speak for the committee, even if he slyly got in the fact that he was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  His plaudits in favour of RTE at the end of his letter were perhaps a little undeserved when he mentioned a broadcaster with such a strong and well-deserved reputation for balance and political impartiality.  Senator Eoghan Harris could probably share anecdotes with us about a time when one left winger vied with another in RTE for the right to dictate the nation&rsquo;s opinions on a range of issues.</P>

	<P>I also join those who have called for a debate on the Middle East.  It is tragic that Israel, a country which many of us respect and whose right to exist none of us disputes, appears to deviate from the normal standards of justice seeking because it has a strong ally.  It is important we have a debate on this.  Many of us who like to criticise the Republican Party in the United States for its bias should note that Senator Obama and Senator Clinton will probably have very little to say in criticism of Israel over the next few months.</P>

	<P>In the absence of the Leader today, I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange an immediate debate on the tribunals so that we can purge ourselves of the daily diatribe we must suffer.  Senator Nicky McFadden rightly said, in disarray with her own party colleagues, that we need to start debating the real issues that matter to the people in the gallery and to the people of this country.</P>

	<P>While the tribunals seek to do their work, and they have done much good work, the Oireachtas must keep them under review if we are to be true to the people.  As a new Senator, let me say to Senator Eugene Regan that despite his eminence in the legal profession, he is not solely responsible for the upkeep of the tribunals or the Irish legal system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Frances Fitzgerald on the letter from Deputy John Cregan.  The RTE Authority was before the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources last week, which Deputy John Cregan chairs.  As <Col N="1434"/>far as I know, Deputy John Cregan did not then raise any issue about the level of reporting in the tribunal, so it is rather strange to find that he has signed a letter criticising the tribunal following the revelations about the &pound;30,000 that was used to buy a particular property.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Paul Bradford in his call for a debate on genetically modified food and feedstuffs.  There was a change to the schedule last Thursday, but we should have a discussion on this issue as early as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science should come to the House to discuss the issue of a university for the south-eastern region.  Senator Doherty raised the issue of regional development.  Under every heading I have been able to investigate, the south-east emerges as the worst performing region.  It has the highest level of unemployment, lowest level of participation in third level education and lowest average household income.  A serious proposal to establish a university in the region was examined in the Port report, which has been published and is mainly positive.  The Minister for Education and Science should come before the House to outline her views on the issue.</P>
        <P>Last weekend was another appalling period on our roads.  In recent weeks, Senators asked that the Minister resolve the problem regarding speed cameras.  I call for a debate on road safety, of which the House has had many over the years, as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Doherty&rsquo;s proposal.  When is it proposed that the Taoiseach will come before the House?  I have been a Senator for only six years during which time the Taoiseach has always discussed Northern Ireland and other issues in the Chamber at the start of the autumn session.  From my observations of the workings of the Oireachtas, it appears to be highly irregular that he has not come to the House for a discussion of these issues for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Harris, Hannigan, Healy Eames, Regan, Mullen and John Paul Phelan referred to the letter written by Deputy John Cregan which appeared in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that Deputy Cregan has a right to make whatever statement he likes.  The question of whether he made his statement as Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which he cited in the letter, is a matter for the joint committee.  If the four Senators, including Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who are members of the joint committee raise the matter in the committee, further information may be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Healy Eames asked about funding for education.  The programme for Government promised a significant increase in funding for education.  While the increase was not <Col N="1435"/>as large as had been hoped in the Government&rsquo;s first budget, we are beginning to see the effects of additional funding in the schools building programme.  A request will be issued to determine whether the Minister, who appeared before the House in recent weeks, is willing to make herself available for a further debate in the near future.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the question of the construction industry and its request to reduce costs.  I suggest the social partnership talks, with which the Senator will be familiar &mdash; he may also know some of its participants &mdash; is a better forum for addressing the issue.  I hope an agreement on future pay increases will soon be reached by the social partners.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, de B&uacute;rca, Norris and Coghlan raised the issue of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  I share the Senators&rsquo; reservations regarding this body.  It is important the tribunal has the confidence of members of the public and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The immigration Bill, which will soon come before the House, proposes a set of measures in this area.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is always willing to make himself available to the House.  Senators on all sides will have an opportunity to express their concerns about this matter when we discuss the provisions concerning refugees.</P>
        <P>Every so often, it is necessary to make a call on whether the Stages of a Bill should be taken in the quickest possible time.  Ideally, all Bills should be given maximum time for consideration.  Second Stage of the Passports Bill has been ordered for tomorrow and it is proposed to take Committee Stage on Thursday.  The House will have a better sense tomorrow of whether further Second Stage discussion will be necessary.  I will make the Bills Office aware of Senators&rsquo; views on the importance of having sufficient time between Second Stage and Committee Stage to give Bills proper consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca raised the issue of radon gas and highlighted the case of a house where radon gas levels were found to be 25 times higher than acceptable limits.  The south and west are most affected by this problem.  Measures were introduced to increase take-up of testing for radon gas in households.  If the Minister is available to answer questions or to make statements on the issue, it would assist the work of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and ease the concerns of many householders.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford and Phelan referred to genetically modified foodstuffs.  As it happens, I attended a meeting in Hillsborough yesterday on the environment and social policy.  The agriculture committee at Stormont held a similar discussion at the same time and unfortunately I could not be in both places at one time.  This issue is being addressed by the Government here, the Assembly and the Executive.  Four Ministries &mdash; the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Agriculture, Fisheries <Col N="1436"/>and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health and Children &mdash; are involved in this complex issue.  Discussions are ongoing on what will be Ireland&rsquo;s international position on GM foods and how the commitment in the programme for Government can be best addressed.  It will be useful to debate the issue in the House when further information becomes available.  As Senators will be aware, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has debated genetically modified foodstuffs.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden, Norris, Hanafin, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Doherty, Hannigan and Mullen raised current events in the Middle East.  All Senators accept that the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel is unacceptable and that the legitimate actions of a State in defending itself must be proportionate.  In light of statements made by the United Nations Secretary General and the European Union, current actions do not appear to reflect the principle of proportionality.  The concern of the House will be made known to the Minister and if an opportunity to discuss the issue arises, it will be taken.  Unfortunately, it is likely that the events of recent days will continue.</P>
        <P>On the school of pharmacy, to which Senator Norris referred, I will raise the issue with the Minister.  It would be an industrial dispute if pharmacists were to decide to close their premises.  In that case it would not be a matter of the Government&rsquo;s making.  It is hoped the scenario the Senator raised can be avoided.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris and other speakers referred in general terms to the work of the tribunals.  While I do not wish to discuss the work of the Mahon tribunal because the Cathaoirleach has ruled on the matter, I suggest that tomorrow night&rsquo;s debate on establishing an electoral commission presents an opportunity to discuss how political ethics can be addressed by means other than tribunals.</P>
        <P>Senators Quinn and Ross raised the issue of over-regulation and noted the number of regulations and regulators.  There is scope for a debate, whether on the work of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority or on the annual reports of the relevant bodies as and when they become available.  I will discuss with the Leader whether we can have such a debate in the near future.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and McFadden raised men&rsquo;s health and mental health.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Jimmy Devins, came before the House recently for a general debate on the issue of mental health, which was probably not sufficiently broad to address all the concerns Senators have raised about this issue.  We will request a further debate on the topic.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty requested a debate on Northern Ireland.  Senators have proposed several options for a debate, including on North-South bodies or to mark the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  The House should take <Col N="1437"/>the opportunity to mark the establishment of the North-South bodies and the Agreement.  I will ask whether this is possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty also raised the need for Senators to air their views on certain issues facing the west.  The Western Development Commission is about to be reappointed.  That might be a mechanism to ask questions about matters of regional development in the west.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan asked a similar question on regional development in the south east.  I am unsure if Senators would be willing to debate regional development for the country or have separate debates.</P>

        <P>With regard to Part V, the planning and development legislation, Senator Coghlan wanted particular elucidation on my behalf.  The situation is quite simple.</P>

    <Title>Fairtrade: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members for the opportunity to present a statement on Fairtrade to the Seanad and to set out Irish Aid supports provided to Fairtrade.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is among the largest donors to Fairtrade in the world.  We have supported the Irish Fairtrade Network since 2002 and approved grants of more than &euro;8.5 million in support of producers in developing countries and development education work in Ireland.  Irish Aid has a longstanding record of support for Fairtrade producers in Central America.  Due to the success of this work, similar programmes of support are being considered for East Africa producers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As set out in the programme for Government, the Government is committed to ensuring that the sourcing of Fairtrade goods, where possible, is part of the purchasing policy of all Departments.  As Senators are aware, the White Paper on Irish Aid published last year put the case for trade and development when it states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Increased trade, regionally and globally, is central to sustained economic growth for the world&rsquo;s least developed countries, but we recognize that developing countries need assistance to enhance their capacity to produce, deliver and sell goods and services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are committed to increase our financial support for initiatives which promote fair and ethical trade.</P>
        <P>The World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development concludes that investment in agriculture is four times as effective as any other investment in reducing poverty.  In particular, the report explored how what is termed &ldquo;decommodification&rdquo;, through brand identity such as Fairtrade, of some traditional agricultural products opened alternative markets for higher value products.</P><Col N="1439"/>
        <P>Increased investment in international trade in agriculture will have a significant impact on poverty reduction.  However, this will be true only if prices paid to farmers are sufficient to cover their costs, provide them with a decent livelihood and allow enough of a surplus for investment in the future.  Fairtrade markets offer a fair price for farmers&rsquo; produce and a social premium for local development.  The price is sustained even through times of market fluctuations that cause loss of income, often with a tragic impact on rural families.</P>
        <P>Business development requires access to markets for farmers in developing countries where many of the products we consume are produced.  Equally, Irish and EU businesses require a constant guaranteed supply of high quality products.  This is the basis for a mutually beneficial long-term partnership between farmers in developing countries and Irish businesses.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade provides independently certified direct links between Irish companies and the producers in the countries concerned and the major benefit to small farmers lies in better access to markets in Europe and North America as well as in Ireland.  Irish Aid is working with organisations such as the Irish Fair Trade Network to improve the livelihoods of people in some of the poorest countries in the world.  For this reason, I am pleased that Ireland is one of the largest international donors to fair trade world-wide.  We provide funding to support farmers and agricultural workers to improve the quality of their products so that they can access fair trade certified markets.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade Mark Ireland is the main project of the Irish Fair Trade Network, a registered charity which was set up in 1992 with the support of individuals and all the main Third World charities in Ireland.  The objective of the organisation is to promote justice in trade between people in Ireland and people in Third World countries.  Fairtrade Mark Ireland awards a consumer label, the Fairtrade Mark, to products which meet internationally recognised standards of fair trade.  It is a small charity based in Dublin supported by Amnesty International, Actionaid Ireland, Christian Aid, Comhl&aacute;mh, Concern, Oxfam Ireland, Tr&oacute;caire and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
        <P>Fair trade is active throughout Ireland via a supporter network of dedicated volunteers, involved in the promotion of fair trade, such as the Fairtrade Towns project, and Fairtrade Mark products.  There are now 31 fair trade towns and cities throughout the country and 30 more are seeking fair trade town status.  Dublin city was awarded fair trade capital status.  The growth in fair trade towns and the increasing awareness of the importance of fair trade among Irish consumers is principally due to the work of 61 voluntary committees, North and South.  According to a Millard Brown IMS consumer survey, aware<Col N="1440"/>ness of the fair trade label in Ireland has grown from 16% of Irish adults in 2002 to 53% of Irish adults in 2007.</P>
        <P>Fair trade also plays a key role in engaging the public with development issues and deepening public understanding about the role Ireland is playing in tackling global poverty.  Irish Aid is committed to supporting development education and, by using the role of fair trade in building this understanding, will continue to support work in this important area.  For many years Irish Aid has funded the Irish Fair Trade Network via the development education funding scheme.  The network received &euro;125,000 in 2005, &euro;135,000 in 2006 and &euro;150,000 in 2007.  This development education work aims to increase public awareness of the values of fair trade through educational materials and events and projects including Fairtrade Fortnight and fair trade towns.</P>
        <P>The positive impacts of the fair trade campaign are easy to grasp.  For this reason it attracts people with a broad interest in development issues and encourages them to learn more.  This is reflected in the hundreds of individual initiatives throughout the country, from the conversion of school cafeterias to fair trade, to education programmes in schools and universities.  Fair trade is also part of the Irish school curriculum and features in subject areas such as civic, social and political education, CSPE, and geography.  Leaving certificate geography examinations now include questions on fair trade.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid has played an important role in supporting capacity building for small producers in Central America through its funding for Fairtrade Labelling Organizations (FLO) International, of which Irish Fair Trade Network, IFN, is the Irish member, under our Central America programme.  This funding amounted to &euro;567,000 for the period 2003-06.</P>
        <P>The focus of the Central America programme has been to increase the quality and quantity of coffee supplied to fair trade certified niche markets, principally in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  Key elements include market access and mutual support to guarantee timely supply to international coffee roasters.</P>
        <P>The programme also funds conversion to organic coffee, GPS mapping of farms, development of processing plant and infrastructure, improving product quality, efficient and reliable business management, personnel training and consolidating links with Irish coffee roasters, including Bewley&rsquo;s, and other large European coffee companies.</P>
        <P>I would like to cite some concrete examples of the impact of this support.  The programme has had an immediate impact by stabilising small producers&rsquo; income during the most recent collapse of international coffee prices, which reached their lowest level in 35 years in 2002-03.  It helped by changing the focus of the producers from marketing a product based on volume to one based on improving quality, producing specialist coffees, <Col N="1441"/>segmenting their market, identifying niche markets and converting to organic products.  That integrated approach contributed to an increase in local employment.</P>
        <P>Fair trade is helping to diversify out of monoculture, with coffee growers developing citrus fruits, banana farmers moving into other premium tropical products and other rural communities investing in eco-tourism.  In this context, Irish Fair Trade Network received grant approval for &euro;7.5 million from Irish Aid in support for two initiatives in the fair trade sector in Central America over the period 2006-2010.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;3.25 million is provided to increase support for the Fairtrade Labelling Organisations&rsquo; capacity building programme for small producers and builds on the elements of the previous programme. Funding is also provided to Irish Fair Trade Network to support UTZ Certified, the world&rsquo;s largest established certification body for mainstream coffee and other products.  That funding of &euro;3.25 million provides support to coffee producers in Central America to enable them meet acceptable quality, social and environmental standards similar to the ISO2000 approach.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of the Irish Aid support to Fairtrade producers in Central America, the Irish Fair Trade Network is now preparing a similar programme for Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda.  It is hoped this work can commence in 2008.  Progress can be made only to the extent to which donors, large and small, work jointly.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid participates in a European donor co-ordination group designed to support the expansion of access to Fairtrade certified markets.  Although most Fairtrade products are produced by small-scale farmers, some of the products also come from large farms and plantations. Irish Aid also supports the work of the Fairtrade movement in encouraging plantations to comply with labour and environmental legislation.  This includes paying decent wages, guaranteeing the right to join trade unions and providing good and safe conditions for their workers in accordance with International Labour Organisation core conventions.</P>
        <P>In Ireland companies such as Bewley&rsquo;s, Blakes Organic Chocolate Company, Cafedirect, Java Republic Roasting Company, Robert Roberts, Fyffes, O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Sandwich Bars, Insomnia Coffee Company, Superquinn, Tesco, SuperValu, Dunnes Stores, Marks &amp; Spencer and many more now offer consumers a range of Fairtrade products.</P>
        <P>In Ireland and other developed economies Fairtrade has become a viable and growing niche market for products from developing country producers.  Irish Aid is committed to working with Fairtrade and with Irish companies to promote fair trading.  It is probably not surprising that as Fairtrade grows, it is becoming the subject of comment, praise and criticism.  It has many advocates but it also has some critics.</P><Col N="1442"/>
        <P>To coincide with Fairtrade Fortnight this year, a London based conservative think-tank, the Adam Smith Institute, issued a critical report.  It suggests that Fairtrade benefits a small number of farmers in developing countries and is wrong in principle.  It suggests that more free trade is what is needed.  It also suggests that the impact of Fairtrade is less than it claims for itself.</P>
        <P>Professor Frank Barry, professor of international development and business at Trinity College Dublin, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">By seeking to influence the behaviour of consumers, the [Fairtrade] movement harnesses that most powerful instrument &mdash; the market mechanism &mdash; to affect economic outcomes by strengthening the hand of impoverished developing-country producers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He goes on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Although still relatively small &mdash; global sales of Fairtrade certified products amounted to about &euro;1.5 billion in 2006 &mdash; this was almost a 100% increase on the 2005 figure, so it is growing fast.  One and a half million disadvantaged developing-country producers have benefited directly from the Fairtrade initiative, while an additional four to five million are benefiting from the community development projects and rural infrastructure that the Fairtrade premia have funded.  A Trojan horse for protectionism it is not.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I assure the House that Irish Aid&rsquo;s current financial support for Fairtrade and ethical trade certification schemes is carefully monitored.  In addition, longer-term studies of impact are now under way to ensure that the Fairtrade system does what it says and to indicate areas in which it might be improved if this proves necessary.</P>
        <P>I should make clear that Irish Aid funding is not used to engage in some kind of market fixing or price support.  It is used to improve agricultural practices to ensure that the small farmers&rsquo; organisations concerned can meet the standards required to gain Fairtrade certification.  That includes agricultural advice and training, small investment in equipment, small credit funds, proper administration and marketing systems and the like.</P>
        <P>The Fairtrade system has won prestigious international human rights and development awards, including the King Baudouin Prize, Europe&rsquo;s premier human rights award. The continued growth in awareness of Fairtrade and purchases of certified products by the Irish public is mirrored by support for Fairtrade by Irish Aid and the Government.  I look forward to working with the Members in this endeavour.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to the House.</P>
        <P>We held a worthwhile debate on overseas aid in the House some weeks ago and today our focus <Col N="1443"/>is on fair trade at a time when we also celebrate Fair Trade Fortnight.</P>
        <P>We should welcome the growth of Fairtrade towns and cities throughout our country.  It is a welcome development and one that is extremely beneficial for schools, youth groups and the community in general. In Waterford, the One World Centre is doing great work organising workshops, projects and events that explore a range of development themes such as fair trade, human rights, sustainable development, cultural diversity, racism and many other subjects which greatly assist the community in understanding the needs of the developing world.  It increases the understanding of economic, social, political and environmental forces which shape our lives and develops the attitudes, skills and values which enable people to work together and to bring about change.  It also works towards achieving a more just and sustainable world in which power and resources are shared more equitably.</P>
        <P>What is Fairtrade?  It is a movement to help producers in developing countries gain fair access to their markets.  It involves campaigning for a more just trading system.  It involves small producers and helps them to sell their goods and produce directly to consumers in commercially developed countries such as Ireland.  It helps those small producers to avoid the middle men who often exploited them in the past.</P>
        <P>Danilo Nunez, a small sesame seed farmer from Nicaragua, states:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Fairtrade provides us with security when the market-price falls and allows us to survive as farmers.  Without it, we would be swallowed up by large-scale agriculture and end up as farm labourers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That brings home to us the importance of Fairtrade and highlights the need for us as a rich, developed country to ensure we do everything possible to promote and assist Fairtrade projects which, in turn, will help small producers like Danilo Nunez.  Here in the Houses of the Oireachtas we serve Fairtrade tea and coffee and I welcome the Government&rsquo;s commitment to source Fairtrade goods wherever possible.  Every little step helps and I note from recent statistics that, as the Minister of State stated, Fairtrade sales grew by about 75% again last year in Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Sub-Saharan Africa attracts less than 3% of global foreign direct investment.  The least developed countries share in global exports has fallen steadily from 3% in the 1950s to the current level of 0.5%.  Increased trade is central to sustained economic growth in these least developed countries.  It is important to note that Africa has the potential to earn from trade many times more than what it obtains in official development assistance.</P>
        <P>Ireland must be, and we are to a certain extent, to the forefront in providing assistance to <Col N="1444"/>enhance these countries&rsquo; capacity to produce, deliver and sell goods.  There is no doubt that the ability of a country to benefit from more liberalised trade depends on the strength and productivity of its domestic economy.  Developing countries are more vulnerable and need more protection and we must ensure always in world trade talks that this protection is afforded to developing countries throughout the world.  It is essential that the poorest and weakest countries are not overwhelmed and marginalised but, instead, are able to put forward and defend their own interests so the outcome is a just and equitable trading system which provides the greatest opportunities for those most in need.</P>
        <P>The principles of the Fairtrade movement are ones which any Irish Government should continue to support and they include creating economic opportunities, capacity building, a fair-pricing structure, gender equality, safe and healthy working conditions and the protection of the environment.  Researchers have found that Fairtrade has significant impacts on the lives of local producers which include greater economic stability, decreased child mortality, increased food consumption and increased educational attainment.  Overall, it has been established that participation in a Fairtrade co-operative results in a better quality of life for all concerned.</P>
        <P>By coincidence, a couple of hours ago I received correspondence from a constituent advising me that he will facilitate a group of Nepalese businessmen who will visit Ireland from 6 to 13 April.  They hope to make contact with companies and organisations who may be interested in their products.  Nepal is an extremely poor country with few of the economic and infrastructural advantages we enjoy in Ireland.  It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 30% of the population living below the poverty line and unemployment rates in excess of 40%.  I hope that during this visit, the Minister of State or someone in his Department might meet the group and discuss its needs.</P>
        <P>I wish to pay tribute to the staff and volunteers in the 26 towns and cities throughout this country which have already achieved Fairtrade status.  Their work is extremely important in reminding us that we must use every means at our disposal to prevent exploitation of weaker and poorer nations and that by purchasing Fairtrade products we, as individuals, are helping in some small way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that we are adopting such great enthusiasm in this country for Fairtrade.  There was a time when we had to do a great deal of work to put our products on the market and we were paid very little.  Fairtrade Fortnight 2008 was launched on Monday 25 February by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt.  Fairtrade sales grew by 75% last year, which is an enormous success.  We now have more than 60 voluntary Fairtrade towns committees around <Col N="1445"/>Ireland and 31 of them have met the criteria to become Fairtrade towns.  There were some real breakthroughs last year and we expect this trend to continue in 2008.  It is important that we have the commitment to do so.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s campaign is on the simple changes Irish consumers and businesses can make to help the lives of people in developing countries.  Everyone knows that Fairtrade makes a difference and while it does not change the world on its own it contributes to real and lasting improvements in the lives of hundreds of thousands people in the Third World.  This is an extremely important aspect of Fairtrade.  Fairtrade Fortnight 2008 coincides with the announcement that the D&aacute;il and Seanad restaurants and bars will use Fairtrade products.</P>
        <P>Last week, Dublin joined a select group of European capitals, including Rome and Edinburgh, when it was awarded Fairtrade capital city status.  This is a wonderful achievement.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Michael Kitt believes the right kind of trade empowers rather than exploits communities in the developing world and it is for this reason that Irish Aid is one of the largest international supporters of Fairtrade.</P>
        <P>Worldwide, consumers spent &euro;1.6 billion on Fairtrade certified products in 2006, according to Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, FLO.  This is a 41% increase on the previous year, directly benefiting more than 1.4 million producers and workers worldwide.  Impressive growth figures can be seen across product categories, with increases in particular in cocoa by 93%, coffee by 53%, tea by 41% and bananas by 31%.  Fairtrade cotton farmers have also seen how the demand for their produce has more than doubled in one year.  Retail sales of Fairtrade products in Ireland increased by 74% to more than &euro;20 million in 2007.  This is an increase from &euro;11.5 million in 2006.  These are impressive figures.</P>
        <P>Traditional Fairtrade products like coffee and tea are stocked by all the main retailers including Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Marks and Spencer, Lidl, Superquinn, Londis, SuperValu, Centra, and Spar.  That large companies such as these take the products shows a real commitment to Fairtrade.  It also proves that the quality of the product is good.</P>
        <P>Marks &amp; Spencer now stocks more than 50 Fairtrade products with Tesco, Superquinn, and SuperValu moving in the same direction.  Lidl recently announced it is switching all its organic bananas to Fairtrade organic bananas which will quadruple the volume of Fairtrade bananas sold in their stores.</P>
        <P>Mr. Peter Gaynor stated that Fairtrade is crossing the Rubicon from the marginal to the mainstream with regard to the recent growth in Fairtrade, including the launch by Dunnes Stores of its own-label range of Fairtade-certified cotton towels as well as the recent launch by the Jack &amp; <Col N="1446"/>Jones retail chain of a range of trendy men&rsquo;s clothing made from Fairtrade certified cotton.  Other high profile nationwide chains and companies, including Insomnia Coffee Company, Java Republic and the Thomas Read Group, continue to expand their commitment to Fairtrade mark products.</P>
        <P>Stocking Fairtrade mark products is not just an ethical action; it is also good for business.  Tessa Van Rensburg, Java Republic&rsquo;s marketing director, has stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Interest in Fairtrade is phenomenal.  Consumers now realise the product is better than it was five years ago.  You can see that by the amount of people changing over to Fairtrade coffee.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Insomnia chain of cafes has reported a 5% to 10% increase in like-for-like sales after switching 100% to Fairtrade mark coffee.</P>
        <P>Nimrod Wimbette, a member of a Ugandan coffee co-operative, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Since joining the Fairtrade family, the horizon for us small farmers looks brighter with each harvest.  The benefits include a guaranteed price for our product and a social premium for economic and social projects such as roads and schools which benefit all people who live in the coffee growing areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland has been good at ensuring a fair price is paid for products.  We must not forget also that some of our farmers are struggling to secure a fair price from the supermarkets for their products.</P>
        <P>The Fairtrade Mark Ireland was established in 1992 to promote justice in trade between Irish consumers and producers and workers in developing countries.  Fairtrade products are sourced directly from the producer, ensuring producers receive a fair and stable price for their products.  The organisation is supported by the main development agencies, including Action Aid Ireland, Concern and Christian Aid.</P>
        <P>The first two tonnes of Fairtrade coffee beans were imported into Ireland in November 1996, increasing to 400 tonnes by 2007.  An IMS consumer survey conducted in April 2007 found 53% of people are aware of the Fairtrade mark, compared with just 16% in 2002.  It is all about marketing.  The current Fairtrade fortnight will make a difference to those struggling in the developing world.  While we had our breakfast this morning, many others in the world did not.</P>
        <P>Up to 26 towns and cities have been awarded Fairtrade town status, including Athlone, Bandon, Bantry, Belfast, Bray, Limerick, Maynooth, Mullingar, Newry and Wexford.  During this year&rsquo;s Fairtrade fortnight, Baltinglass, Ennis, Newbridge, Roscommon and Sligo will be awarded Fairtrade town status.</P>
        <P>The problems experienced by poor producers and workers in developing countries differ greatly from product to product.  For example, the majority of coffee and cocoa is grown by indepen<Col N="1447"/>dent small farmers, working their own land and marketing their produce through a local cooperative.  For these producers, receiving a fair price is more important than any other aspect of fair trade.  Most tea, however, is grown on estates.  The concern for workers employed on tea plantations is fair wages and decent working conditions.  That is the least we must demand of all imported products.</P>
        <P>Trading standards for licensees using the Fairtrade mark on their products stipulate that traders must pay a price to producers to cover the costs of sustainable production and living, pay a premium that producers can invest in development and sign contracts that allow for long-term planning and sustainable production practices.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been an enthusiast for Fairtrade ever since it started in 1996.  Then I was honoured to be asked to go on board the <i>SV Estelle</i> when it came to Dublin to promote Bewley&rsquo;s first Fairtrade coffee.</P>
        <P>A certain ambiguity surrounds the term &ldquo;fair trade&rdquo;.  The Fairtrade movement, which spells it as one word, is the meaning that most people are more familiar with, given that it has operated mainly at the retail level.  Fairtrade aims to create a situation in which the producers of certain goods in developing countries are paid a fair price for the work they put in.  The resulting products are sold under the Fairtrade label in developed countries such as our own.  The invitation to customers is to pay a premium price for these products in return for the assurance the original producers will get a better deal.  This started out originally with coffee and has since extended to a broad range of other products.  It has been notably successful in Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, this is not the whole story of fair trade.  The success of the Fairtrade initiative, which I applaud, tends to mask a much wider problem.  The world trading system, in general, is systemically opposed to the notion of fair trading in agriculture between the developing countries and the developed world.  This is the conundrum the World Trade Organisation, WTO, has been struggling to resolve for many years and what the present Doha round of trade talks are all about.</P>
        <P>Put simply, the developed world &mdash; most notably Europe and America &mdash; operates a highly protectionist scheme in agriculture.  To protect the narrow interests of its farmers, the developed world has tried to keep out produce from the developing world.  Even worse, by flooding world markets with its surplus products at subsidised prices, it has depressed the market possibilities for the products of the developing world.  Not <Col N="1448"/>only do we largely keep the developing world&rsquo;s products out of our markets, we also undermine their sales efforts in the rest of the world, including their home markets.</P>
        <P>For anyone who regards all human beings as equal, this market behaviour is simply wrong.  It is morally reprehensible and cannot be defended on any basis but pure national selfishness.  I have said before this behaviour makes me ashamed to be an Irishman, a European, even a citizen of the developed world.  How will we explain this to future generations?  We are the evil-doers.  Our policy should be to end this evil as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>It makes me especially sad that Ireland is among the most active players in the EU when it comes to this.  We and the French are the unholy alliance driving EU policy on world trade.  It is we who are trying to defend the indefensible.</P>
        <P>It is particularly ironic that the same developed countries which are most actively protectionist when it comes to agriculture are also the most generous as development aid donors to the developing world.  Despite this, it has been calculated on many occasions that the sum total of all our development aid is of less value to the developing countries than they would gain from a truly fair world trading system.  &ldquo;Trade, not aid&rdquo; is a slogan that seeks to encapsulate this irony, and it does it very well.  Trade, not aid, is what we should be aiming for.</P>
        <P>Before the friends of Irish farming in this and the other House have another of their ritual apoplectic fits, I will point out that I am not speaking against the interests of farmers in pleading for a fair world trade deal.  However, I believe farmers are our problem, or a European problem.  We should not expect the developing world to bear the costs involved in looking after European farmers.  In particular, we should not allow our farmers to dictate a morally reprehensible trade policy to the country and by extension to the whole of Europe.</P>
        <P>The amount we spend on development aid, which in one way does Ireland considerable credit, is a mask for an overall trade policy which is nothing to be proud of.  In fact, it is one of which we should be thoroughly ashamed.  It saddens me that I am one of the few Oireachtas Members who is prepared to stand up and publicly acknowledge these truths.  Equally, the success of the fair trade movement in Ireland &mdash; which, as I have said, I warmly applaud &mdash; should not blind us to the fact that in our overall trade policy we are effectively opponents, not supporters, of fair trade.  It would be a tragedy if the many good people who deliberately buy Fairtrade products here in Ireland for the best possible reasons were fooled into thinking that our national policies share and reflect their views.  Unfortunately, they do not.</P>

	<P>And then I will ignore you.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Quinn on his extraordinary courage and honesty.  He has gone right to the heart of the matter.  It is good to hear that from the heart of the commercial world.  What we are dealing with is a historical discrepancy between what was paid to producers at ground level and the enormous profits made by large corporations.  We have only to consider the phrase &ldquo;banana republic&rdquo; to see this.  Bananas are one of the original products for which this was the case.  The Americans, for example, colonised parts of Central America commercially and turned people to slave labour in the interests of large banana companies.</P>
        <P>I remember some years ago there was a significant row about the production of chocolate, which is a very ordinary thing.  Within the past ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I stand reproved.  I am sure Senator White, who is a decent person, will accept that conditions in the cacao harvest in certain central American countries were completely abominable, involving the exploitation of child labour.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that when the Fairtrade movement began in the 1950s and 1960s, it was largely a religious movement.  That is still reflected to a certain extent in the organisations involved, which include Christian Aid, Comhl&aacute;mh, Concern, Oxfam, Irish Aid, Action Aid and Tr&oacute;caire, as well as some trade union groups.  We should pay tribute to them.  The political organisation was started in the Netherlands in the 1960s.  Senator Quinn played an interesting role by being involved in the 1996 launch of Bewley&rsquo;s Fairtrade coffee in Ireland.  The association with Bewley&rsquo;s is appropriate because the Bewleys were a great Quaker family who had a sense of justice and fair play.  The interesting thing is the way in which the market has grown exponentially.  After the launch in 1996, sales of Fairtrade coffee reached &euro;1 million in 2002, while in 2007 they reached &euro;20 million.  That is an enormous and marvellous increase.</P>
        <P>We have improved on this with the development of Fairtrade labelling.  In Europe, some Fairtrade-marked goods have a 20% national market share, and sales are growing by 40% every year, which is interesting.  Towns all over Ireland have become involved by having the local council pass a resolution and setting proportionate targets per head of population in terms of retail outlets, catering companies, and so on.</P>

        <P>The fair trade movement creates opportunities for economically disadvantaged people, improves transparency and accountability and builds capacity.  The payment of a fair price, negotiated locally, is important.  It also contributes to gender equality by ensuring that men and women are treated equally in local areas.  It ensures safe and healthy working conditions and better environmental practices.  Everybody in the House wishes to support Fairtrade.  Representatives of Fairtrade were in the Houses last week, in the restaurant, and we were all at the launch of the Fairtrade event at the Royal College of Physicians.  I am happy to yield to Senator Mullen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Norris and Quinn.</P>
        <P>There are two points I wish to cover in the brief time available.  One is to commend the free trade movement and its work generally, while the other is a consideration of fair trade as a global issue on which we in Ireland should take a strong stand.  We all agree that the development of the fair trade movement is a good-news story.  It is an issue on which people have been able to think globally and act locally.  Many of us feel powerless to have a positive impact on economic matters at a global level in support of the less well-off or the most disadvantaged people in our society.  One of the great strengths of the fair trade movement is that it allows us to redress that feeling of powerlessness.  The good news is that fair trade sales grew by about 75% in the past year.  We must commend the work that is being done, particularly in the education sector.  For example, in our primary schools the Alive-O 8 religious education pack has a feature on fair trade, and the CSPE courses focus on the concept of interdependence.  At third level, NUI Maynooth became the first university to be accredited as a Fairtrade university in April 2006.</P>
        <P>In general terms, when we talk about the issue of fair trade, we all feel we are doing something good.  It is great that so many more Irish people are now conscious of the Fairtrade brand, as explained by the Minister.  However, we all know that purchasing Fairtrade goods is but a small step unless we seek to influence the broader area of trade agreements on a worldwide basis.  We must remember that the purpose of the economy is to serve the common good by meeting the material needs of the individual.  As consumers our choices can enhance or diminish economic opportunity for families and communities in developing countries.  As we have heard, the Fairtrade initiative is an alternative approach that ensures better prices for farmers and producers.  However, we must focus on what the principle of subsidiarity requires of us at the level of global trade.  Current international trading practice does <Col N="1451"/>not provide much incentive for application of the fair trade principle or the principle of subsidiarity.  As pointed out by Tr&oacute;caire, while Ireland&rsquo;s goal to increase its official level of development assistance to 0.7% of GNP by 2012 is laudable, these aims must be accompanied by an effort to tackle inequitable conditions in the global trade system.  In a recent policy document by Tr&oacute;caire, a convincing argument is made for policy coherence.</P>
        <P>There is not enough debate in the Houses about trade negotiations.  If we do manage to focus on this issue, it is to be hoped that Ireland can play a stronger part in urging the EU, in the context of the economic partnership agreement currently being negotiated, to make sure negotiations are aimed at making global trade rules more development-friendly.  Our ability to ensure that vulnerable farming communities in developing countries can prosper depends on the establishment of a system of international trade which allows developing countries to pursue policies that foster competitiveness among local producers and address the protectionist practices of developed countries.  In that context I strongly support the points made by Senator Quinn.</P>
        <P>According to Tr&oacute;caire, it is estimated that if Africa were to increase its share of world exports by just 1%, tens of millions of people would be lifted out of poverty.  That is a statistic that should exercise our minds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Mary White.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to the House and thank him for his statement on fair trade.  I also welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate during Fairtrade fortnight.  I acknowledge the long record of support by Irish Aid of the Fairtrade movement and the hard work of the Irish Fair Trade Network, which is supported by the Government and has been responsible for the huge increase in consumer awareness in this country and elsewhere of the concept of fair trade.  A Senator said earlier that fair trade equals trade justice but, unfortunately, the trading rules that apply in the international trading system at present contain little that is just.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As other Senators have said, however, there is a growing awareness on the part of consumers that price cannot be the only criterion on which they base their purchasing decisions.  They must consider also issues such as the conditions in which particular products are produced, labour standards, health and safety regulations and, critically, the price paid to producers for goods.  The origin of the Fairtrade movement is the realisation that producers in developing countries often are paid very little for the primary commodities they produce.  The commodities are taken over by middle men and large multinational corporations end up benefiting from the prices paid in the developed world for the pro<Col N="1452"/>cessed goods or products.  The producers do not benefit from the enormous profits to be made from the sale of their products in the developed world.  The Fairtrade movement is about guaranteeing, despite market fluctuations, a fair and consistent price to the primary producers of these goods.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the issue of trade in general.  This debate gives us an opportunity to highlight the fact that the World Trade Organisation at present is developing an international system of trade rules that are blind to many of the issues we are discussing today.  The Doha round is supposed to be about recognising the special development needs of developing countries, but the reluctance of the developing countries to conclude that round suggests they are not happy with what the developed world is trying to convince them is a good deal for their countries.  Although I accept the sincerity of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s remarks, I am not sure I agree with him with regard to the supposed rationale for the attempt to bring developing countries into the world trade system and increase their export markets and so forth.  The World Trade Organisation and the free trade agreements that are negotiated within that organisation do not always recognise that there are differing levels of development between the developed and developing world and that we cannot consider developing countries as being in a position to compete on equal terms with the developed world.  Unfortunately, little special provision is made or few special conditions are allowed for developing countries in the way the trade agreements are hammered out.</P>
        <P>There appears to be an attitude that if developing countries develop their export markets and get access to markets in the developed world, it will create more prosperity.  In fact, many developing countries are at subsistence level in terms of agricultural production and are incapable in many instances of producing for the export market, and if they are it is at the expense of their home market and feeding their own population.  The issue is far more complex than just opening up markets.  Often, the European Union and the United States are at the World Trade Organisation seeking, above all, market access to the developing countries.  They see them as greenfield markets of consumers where they can peddle their products and create new demand for them.  Many of the markets in the developed world are saturated with these products and they are no longer in demand.  There is a certain amount of cynicism, so we should examine carefully the rhetoric of free trade and the concept that simply removing barriers to free trade will somehow cause all boats to rise.  I do not believe that is the case.  Special and differential trade rules are required for developing countries based on their particular levels of development, but these different levels of development are not generally recognised in <Col N="1453"/>the trade agreements concluded in the World Trade Organisation.</P>
        <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the Fairtrade movement and its objectives which are to make trade more ethical and fair and to ensure everyone benefits in all parts of the world, not just the developed world which is at a competitive advantage in terms of negotiating power, penetrating markets and selling products.  I hope Ireland will play its part in discussions within the Council of Ministers on trade agreements.  The way trade policy has developed at European Union level has been most unsatisfactory to date.  It has lacked transparency and the European Parliament, until now, has had little or no input into decision making on, or the content of, trade agreements.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices in the discussions taking place in the Council of Ministers to raise these issues and to ensure the developing world gets a fairer deal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Michael Kitt, on the tremendous endeavours he is applying to his job as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development.  He is the right man for the job because he has tremendous empathy for people, as I have said previously.  Everyone is aware that the principle of Fairtrade is to support the producers of raw materials such as cotton, coffee, cocoa beans, fruit and bananas.  As Senator Norris said, these products are grown in former English, French and Spanish colonies that generated wealth for those countries through the use of slave labour.</P>
        <P>The Fairtrade organisation was set up to ensure local farmers receive a fair price for their produce.  This invariably means that Fairtrade raw materials extract a premium over non-Fairtrade material.  In the case of Fairtrade chocolate, for example, there is a premium of 50% per tonne over normal chocolate, that is, producers get 50% more.  In the past 12 months questions have been asked in the international media whether all the premium pricing built into the ingredients is being passed on to producers.  However, in principle, Fairtrade is an excellent idea and has enjoyed huge support in the UK and Ireland through satisfying consumers&rsquo; needs to do something tangible for emerging nations.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade producers can set aside funds for community projects such as schools, clinics, training, improvement in the quality of product, sustainable production and providing a decent standard of living for the people who work for the Fairtrade producers so their children can be educated.  Education is the stepping stone to developing one&rsquo;s potential and leading a full life.  The benefits of Fairtrade are not reaching all Fairtrade farmers because there is insufficient demand for their crops.  No one else today has pointed that out.  Producers sell an average of 20% of the crop at Fairtrade terms, selling the rest through the world market at far lower prices. <Col N="1454"/> Fairtrade is an ideal, inspirational product issue for young people who can encourage the shops, businesses, restaurants and coffee shops in their areas to sell and use Fairtrade products and the universities and colleges to ask their suppliers and service providers to use Fairtrade goods.</P>
        <P>It is a source of great pleasure for everyone in Ireland that Dublin has been awarded the title &ldquo;Fairtrade Capital City&rdquo; following a two-year campaign to attain the coveted status.  The Irish Fairtrade Association presented Dublin&rsquo;s Lord Mayor, Mr. Paddy Bourke, with a plaque to mark the event at a ceremony in Dublin City Hall in recognition of the city&rsquo;s efforts to encourage the public to buy Fairtrade products.  Council staff, retailers, schools and universities joined the campaign to help Dublin achieve the coveted status and approximately 120 shops and 60 catering outlets across the capital have signed up to sell Fairtrade products.  Dublin has become the latest European capital, along with the likes of Rome and Edinburgh, to support the growing worldwide movement, which is a form of marketing that promotes the payment of a fair price for products from developing countries in a bid to fight poverty and inequality.</P>
        <P>As the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Paddy Bourke, said, &ldquo;Irish people are a very generous people by nature.&rdquo;  The Minister of State knows that the various fund-raising campaigns for fighting famine and poverty in Africa have been generously supported by Irish people.  They are unique in the world in that regard.</P>
        <P>As Mr. Peter Gaynor, director of Fairtrade Mark Ireland, said recently:</P>
        <P LI="1">Everyone knows Fairtrade makes a difference.  It doesn&rsquo;t change the world on its own but it contributes to real and lasting improvements in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Third World producers.</P>
        <P>The Co-Op supermarket chain in the United Kingdom, which was once the largest retailer of Fairtrade branded products, plans to switch all of its own-brand teas to Fairtrade and to stop selling eggs from caged hens as it tries to reclaim its position as the country&rsquo;s leading ethical supermarket chain.  The Co-Op began stocking Fairtrade products a decade ago.  British sales of Fairtrade goods are now running at &pound;400 million annually, an increase from &pound;290 million in 2006.  There is now intense rivalry between Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury to surpass the Co-Op in Fairtrade sales.  Marks and Spencer has set itself the goal of becoming Britain&rsquo;s greenest retailer by 2012.  It only stocks Fairtrade coffee and tea and claims to buy one third of the world&rsquo;s Fairtrade cotton.  Tesco offers the largest range of Fairtrade products, with 140 lines, including mangoes, basmati rice and honey.</P>
        <P>My company, Lir Chocolates, supplies the Co-Op supermarket chain in the United Kingdom with many of its high-end premium chocolate offerings, made from Fairtrade products.  We had <Col N="1455"/>to satisfy the Fairtrade authorisation requirements in the United Kingdom to source our Fairtrade ingredients, such as chocolate, coffee, strawberry and caramel flavours, and so forth.  It was my pleasure to participate in this discussion today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  World poverty and disadvantage is still one of the leading concerns in the world today.  We are seeing an ever-widening gap between the rich northern hemisphere and the poor southern hemisphere, with many children born into the deepest levels of poverty imaginable.  As a result, we see efforts by right-meaning people to try to narrow the wealth gap.  In Ireland, we are pushing towards the goal of spending 0.7% of gross domestic product on overseas aid.  We also see initiatives such as Fairtrade to try to assist local economies in the developing world.</P>
        <P>Coffee production, to which other Senators referred, is one of the largest industries in the world.  As demand for coffee has increased, so too has supply, leading to rock-bottom prices for coffee growers, many of whom can no longer make a living producing coffee.  Fairtrade came along and created an opportunity for these producers who would otherwise be economically dead in the water.  It enables them to develop a certain amount of market independence, allowing them to improve their farms and other assets and to diversify into other areas.  The fair price paid for their produce covers the cost of production, ensures fair pay and conditions for individual workers and brings benefits to local facilities such as schools, health centres and so forth.  Fairtrade also ensures the participation of women in the production process is adequately and properly rewarded.</P>
        <P>The Fairtrade initiative has struck a chord with people across the world because, put simply, it makes sense.  As a result, the market for Fairtrade products has grown enormously.  In 2006, consumers around the world purchased &euro;1.6 billion of Fairtrade products, representing a 42% increase on 2005.  In Ireland in 2005 the retail value of Fairtrade products was &euro;6.5 million.  By the following year, that had almost doubled to &euro;11.5 million.  Last year, the figure almost doubled again, with Fairtrade sales reaching &euro;20 million.  Currently, the sale of Fairtrade products is growing rapidly across the world and in Ireland in particular.  Combined with Irish increases in the level of overseas development aid, these figures demonstrate Irish people&rsquo;s willingness to try to counter the massive global poverty epidemic.  They are choosing to make ethical purchases so as not to make matters worse.</P>
        <P>The genius of the Fairtrade initiative is that it poses a simple ethical question to consumers in supermarkets, namely, &ldquo;Am I part of the problem or part of the solution?&rdquo;  It enables people to lift <Col N="1456"/>themselves directly out of the cycle of keeping Third World farmers and producers in a thick web of poverty.</P>
        <P>It must be noted that there are some concerns about the Fairtrade initiative.  I have read complaints that Fairtrade seeks to create an artificial market price that will lead to dangerous market conditions.  The concern is that if Fairtrade leads to an increased supply of tea, for example, the excess supply will lead to lower prices in the non-Fairtrade market which will then require a market correction.  However, Fairtrade itself is the market correction we are seeking.  The Fairtrade labelling organisation has asserted that farmers can only receive Fairtrade prices if they find a buyer willing to pay them.  Furthermore, studies have shown that farmers use the additional income to improve their living conditions and the education of their children.  They do not use the additional income to increase the production of crops.  I have also read case studies comparing Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers which show the former were more successful in diversifying their produce.  Those in Fairtrade deals also saw a significant drop in child mortality, improvements in the food consumption of their households and received a better price for their crops.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade is proven to work.  In Ireland it has been very successful.  We see the ethical choice being passed back to consumers who are reacting accordingly.  There are already 30 Fairtrade towns in Ireland, with a further 30 actively seeking Fairtrade status.  Dublin is now a Fairtrade capital, thanks to people like the Lord Mayor, Councillor Paddy Bourke, and Councillor Eric Byrne.  The latter, in particular, has been working towards achieving Fairtrade status for the past few years.  There is now a Fairtrade schools pack which details a syllabus for junior certificate students and uses the civics course for what it should be used for, namely, to enlighten young people about the world and provide them with an active opportunity to become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his statement on this very fine initiative, Fairtrade.  I had no real understanding of what Fairtrade was about.  I had an idea that it was something to do with the Third World but I did not know anything beyond that.  Now we are in the middle of Fairtrade fortnight and in Leinster House we have switched the bulk of tea and coffee supplies to Fairtrade products.  That is an excellent example for us to be setting.  This is the message we should be projecting, that every individual consumer has to do it in his or her own way and the best way to do it is to buy the products.</P>
        <P>Having examined the issue further, I have found out that the idea behind Fairtrade is to give an agreed price to the farmers and producers in underdeveloped countries as well as a premium. <Col N="1457"/> This extra money is used for developments in education and health through community projects.  Everyone must agree with that principle.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is very committed to examining how best to assist those in poverty.  The Irish Aid programme has become a major force in many developing countries.  It knows because it is working in the field to help upgrade vulnerable farmers that may be pushed aside by large producers.  The global aspect to this matter is evident in the fact that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, along with international unions, is taking up the initiative to ensure workers are not exploited in these countries.</P>
        <P>People who choose to buy Fairtrade products, such as tea, coffee, coca, sugar and so on, will play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self sufficiency.  I was delighted to hear there are now 25 Fairtrade towns and cities in Ireland but I had not previously heard that, for example, the cities of Waterford and Dublin had been designated as such.  The area of public awareness is where we are failing on this issue.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a school&rsquo;s career guidance counsellor and asked whether this issue was discussed in civic education.  She said it was not but that it should be.  Are Fairtrade products in staff rooms?  Are they available in every public organisation and every walk of life?  My thinking has gone full circle and I now believe the approach to be taken must come from the bottom up.  If this matter is not approached as a societal issue nothing will happen.  We could discuss this subject until doomsday but nobody outside these walls would listen.  I wonder who is listening to us at the moment, apart from those of us in this room?  I do not like this because this is a serious matter and I feel everyone&rsquo;s opinion on it should be heard.</P>
        <P>The Celtic tiger is roaring and we have so much money we do not know what to do with it but we should think of those in underdeveloped countries.  I spent a month in South Africa and saw the difference Irish aid can make to people in need of education projects, health facilities and so on.  Fairtrade gives us another opportunity to help as Ireland has always been good at helping and the Ireland of today helps people when necessary.</P>
        <P>How should we promote this concept throughout Ireland and what criteria apply to making a town a Fairtrade town?  To qualify as a Fairtrade town, the local council must pass a resolution in support of Fairtrade and agree to serve Fairtrade products.  Has every council and local authority in Ireland promoted Fairtrade?  I am sure they would welcome Fairtrade products but I am not sure if they currently promote them.  I visited my local authority recently but did not drink Fairtrade coffee there.  In addition, to qualify as a Fairtrade town, a range of Fairtrade products must be available in local shops.  Why not have a sample of them, even in small shops?  I have not seen these products in my local shop and the staff <Col N="1458"/>there did not know what I was talking about when I mentioned them.  I am saying many things that the Minister of State might prefer I did not say.  Fairtrade is beginning to make an impact in workplaces and some, but not all, community organisations.</P>
        <P>In terms of media coverage, is anything being done to attract support for the campaign?  A local steering committee should be set up in all large organisations to promote Fairtrade.  Civic education in schools provides a golden opportunity for the promotion of Fairtrade and would help reach out to parents and the wider community.</P>
        <P>I want this campaign to be highlighted and to raise awareness.  Everyone here knows the purpose of Fairtrade and I am repeating what they have said today but it is important that those outside this House know about it.  Until we interact with Irish citizens we will fail in communicating our message on the importance of the Fairtrade initiative and this fortnight.  A knowledge of Fairtrade should be spread to all walks of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Bradford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am honoured to speak on this matter during Fairtrade Fortnight and I commend the Minister of State on the graciousness and compassion he showed the delegation at the launch of Fairtrade Fortnight.  The Fairtrade movement began in Ireland in 1992 to promote justice in trade between Irish consumers and workers and producers in developing countries.  I like the theme of Fairtrade Fortnight: &ldquo;Change today, choose Fairtrade&rdquo;.  This matter is a question of choice and by making simple choices Irish consumers can make a long and lasting difference to the lives of producers in the developing world.</P>
        <P>I agree with most of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s sentiments and his preference for trade before aid.  The people of the developing world do not need our platitudes, they need us to support them and allow them be competitive by buying their products.  We should help them to help themselves.  Like other Senators, I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement that the restaurants in the Houses of the Oireachtas are to switch to Fairtrade tea and coffee because this commitment signals the all-party support that exists for the movement.</P>
        <P>Dublin has joined Edinburgh and Rome as a Fairtrade city and this is not due solely to city councillors; the dedication and commitment of small Fairtrade committees around the country have helped towns and cities in achieving this designation.  They debate Fairtrade late into the night and this has helped bring Fairtrade to fruition in Ireland.  I was a member of such a committee and I commend the people involved.  My <Col N="1459"/>local authority, Athlone Town Council, embraced Fairtrade and, on the passing of a motion placed before the council, Athlone became a Fairtrade town.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade creates the potential for very good community projects with members of Fairtrade committees visiting local schools, shops and businesses.  Athlone Institute of Technology, one of the biggest employers in the region, became the flagship for the initiative in my area.  Fairtrade towns must have a flagship.  This was a great way of promoting Fairtrade in Athlone and I urge other towns to get involved in such a positive community project.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have referred to retail outlets and Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Superquinn, Super Valu and others have dramatically increased the number of Fairtrade products available in their stores.  Senator Butler mentioned that Lidl now supplies organic Fairtrade bananas and this has quadrupled the sale of Fairtrade products in Lidl stores.  Consumers now realise there is choice because there are so many products and the quality is so much better than five years ago.  As other speakers said, this is evident in the sales of Fairtrade products in Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Working with Fairtrade can provide farmers in the developing world with the opportunity to diversify by making resources available to invest in new products, such as citrus fruits, bananas and cotton.  One of my Fine Gael colleagues is wearing a Fairtrade shirt today, which I commend.  It is about individuals making choices.</P>
        <P>Rice and wine are products that are now being traded fairly.  This is taking away the dependency, as Senator Hannigan said, from coffee and increasing the incomes of Fairtrade producers in the developing world.</P>
        <P>In some instances Fairtrade sales have provided for co-operatives to buy land and build factories.  This will add further to their share of profits from the produce.  Other coffee producers are branching into the growing of macadamia nuts, which I commend, and setting up tourism projects.  Tea farmers in Sri Lanka are starting to grow spices.  This has all come about because small producers have been given the support and funding to diversify by working with Fairtrade.  It is about empowering people from the developing world to give them independence and freedom.  I commend all the Fairtrade towns and cities in Ireland for taking up this mantle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am aware of his genuine personal commitment not only to the issue of Fairtrade but also the broader issue of development co-operation and the success of the Irish Aid programme worldwide.  He has played a key role in that concept in both Houses during the past 20 years or so and it is very much at the centre of his political thinking.</P><Col N="1460"/>
        <P>When we speak about fair trade, which we all support, I like to discuss it in the broader concept of world trade, world development and our role in attempting to help develop the Third World.  The work of Irish Aid in that regard has been a monumental success.  It would be great if trade alone would solve the problem but there has to be support at the lowest possible level &mdash; direct financial aid and support &mdash; and Irish Aid plays a major role in that regard.</P>
        <P>Over the years, through various parliamentary visits, I have been to places such as Malawi, Lesotho and Zambia.  When one sees at first hand, on one side of the equation, the scale of the abject poverty, the poor governance and the lack of proper political structures and, at the other side of the equation, the work being done by the various charities, aid agencies and Irish Aid, in particular, one realises we are playing a constructive role.  In regard to Fairtrade, its major success in recent years has been to engage and inform public opinion.  That has been very helpful.</P>
        <P>We are having this debate during the Lenten season.  The work of Tr&oacute;caire, in particular, over the past 25 to 30 years has been marvellous, not just from the concept of collecting and distributing money but from the perspective of getting people to reflect on trade, aid, human rights and civil rights worldwide.  It is all part of the one equation and the one jigsaw.  One cannot solve the problem unless all the pieces are in place.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier the issue of governance, which may not be the most popular way of looking at the problem.  When help is made available, be it through financial resources or grants of any description, it is important it is spent well and wisely.  We cannot undersell the concept of good governance.  One only has to look at the situation in Zimbabwe to see the disaster that occurs when a country is misgoverned.  That is the greatest international tragedy at present.  The old country of Rhodesia probably was discussed in this House and elsewhere almost weekly during the 1970s when it was politically necessary and popular to do so.  The tragedy is that Zimbabwe does not get the attention it deserves and we need to put it back on the radar.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the agriculture side of the equation.  It was a continuance of our discussion at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a fortnight ago, when we had a presentation on a range of issues, including the world trade talks from the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association.  There was something in the speech of the Minister of State which I thought was interesting and would have a certain resonance in Irish agriculture.  He made the point that the prices being paid to farmers must be sufficient to cover their costs, provide them with a decent livelihood and allow enough of a surplus for investment in the future.  Of course we agree with that view, but that relates not only to agriculture in the Third World but to agriculture at home.</P><Col N="1461"/>
        <P>The World Trade Organisation talks pose a genuine threat to Irish agriculture and Irish jobs.  We could easily get carried away with the notion that progress in the WTO talks and progress in pushing through the Peter Mandelson formula somehow would be beneficial to the Third World.  I say to my colleagues in the House that we have seen only one example of WTO policy imposed on this country, namely, the decision to close the Irish sugar industry.  We were told its closure and the general slowdown of the sugar industry in Europe would be good for the Third World, that somehow the poorest of the poor in Africa would benefit from commercial decisions taken in Europe.  What has happened is that a tiny number of growers in South America, in Brazil in particular, have benefited.  Irish agriculture, Irish farmers and the Irish economy have lost one of our oldest natural industries but very few have benefited and certainly not the poorest of the poor.</P>
        <P>The issue of trade, aid and so on relates to another debate we are having on genetically modified foods and feedstuffs.  We sometimes portray ourselves as speaking from some high moral plateau.  There is a prospect of the development of many new seed varieties which could transform agriculture and give real hope in parts of Africa which suffers continually from drought and the inability to grow crops.  However, we in the EU are saying what can and cannot be done and what type of genetic modification can or cannot take place.  We have no right to block the possible production of seed varieties which might well be a solution to some of the dreadful famines being endured by people in parts of Africa.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I have drifted well beyond the issue of fair trade but it is all part of the equation.  We all support Fairtrade.  It is not the total answer by any means but it is certainly a help.  We welcome and support all the Fairtrade towns but we also have to keep our eye on other parts of the same equation &mdash; the politics, the governance, the need to spread democracy, the need to help communities through direct grant aid and so on.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, especially on the work being done by Irish Aid and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase funding to the Third World, which we have debated many times.  At least we are increasing our national spend on aid and development, something I support very much.  I hope we utilise it to the best advantage because the people of the Third World certainly need our continuing support.  Fair trade is part of it but is not the whole equation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael P. Kitt, to the House.  Nobody is better equipped to be Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development than the Deputy.  As the outgoing Chairman of the sub-committee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs concerned with overseas development, he <Col N="1462"/>has vast knowledge of this particular portfolio and has shown a great commitment to this field.  I wish to draw attention to the fact that the Minister of State, along with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, were prepared to go to Iraq on the eve of the war, at enormous risk to themselves, to see if they could do anything to prevent that terrible war that has proved so devastating.</P>
        <P>I have read the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech which was well prepared and presented by him.  It outlines exactly the concept of Fairtrade.  It is an issue in which we in Roscommon have an involvement because a councillor, Orla Leyden, put forward the motion at Roscommon County Council to have the county approved as a Fairtrade county.  This has been approved.  It achieved the six goals.  At least ten businesses in the town must have Fairtrade products for sale and the council must pass a motion in support of Fairtrade.  This motion was passed and it is now a Fairtrade town, and there has been a 75% increase in the consumption of Fairtrade products in Roscommon town.  I congratulate all the councillors involved as it was a decision of Roscommon County Council that it would become a Fairtrade county.  A meeting was held on the issue last night.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade brings knowledge, realisation and education to many people on the question of the strength and importance of trade, Fairtrade and Fairtrade products.  It gives direct assistance to producers from Third World countries to help ensure they get a fair price for their products.  It is said that if one gives people fish, they will survive for so long, but if one gives them a fishing rod and teaches them how to fish, they have a job for life and can sustain their families.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State and the Department in this regard.  The Minister of State in his contribution noted:</P>
        <P LI="1">[The allocation of] &euro;8.5 million in support of producers in developing countries and development education work in Ireland.  Irish Aid has a long-standing record of support for fair trade producers in Central America.  Due to the success of this work, similar programmes of support are being considered for East Africa producers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is worthwhile.  The Minister of State is also prepared to listen to criticism in this regard.  A report by one organisation expressed concerns about certain aspects and the Minister of State referred to its critical report when he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It suggests that Fairtrade benefits a small number of farmers in developing countries and is wrong in principle: it suggests that more free trade is what is needed.  It also suggests that the impact of Fairtrade is less than it claims for itself.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Professor Frank Barry, professor of international development and business at Trinity College Dublin, states:</P><Col N="1463"/>
        <P LI="2">By seeking to influence the behaviour of consumers, the [Fairtrade] movement harnesses that most powerful instrument &mdash; the market mechanism &mdash; to affect economic outcomes by strengthening the hand of impoverished developing-country producers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is worthwhile.  I know the Minister of State considered all of these aspects.</P>
        <P>The concept of fair trade is a good one.  Unfortunately, areas such as the Gaza Strip cannot export their products, fair trade or otherwise.  Gaza is totally cut off from its export markets.  I ask the Minister of State and the Department to take a particular interest in this region.  The people of Palestine have been suppressed economically because they cannot get their products to the markets.  There is now no port servicing the Gaza Strip, although it is on the coast, or an airport through which products could be transported to the markets.  These are the issues that should and, I know, do affect the Minister of State in his work on overseas development.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade has a bearing on the Minister of State&rsquo;s overall portfolio, although it is only a part of it.  Volunteering is one area of development the Minister of State is keen to progress.  The idea of the United States Peace Corps, which operated during the Kennedy era, was very worthwhile.  As I have discussed with the Minister of State, a great number of people are available.  Through this debate, I wish to promote the concept of people making themselves available at short notice to go on voluntary projects when there is hardship in particular regions, whether as a result of a hurricane, volcano, earthquake or other natural disaster.  I commend the fact we will have at our disposal well-qualified people who are prepared to spend three or four months working with the regional authorities in affected areas.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State for his support of the Niall Mellon fund.  I heard the Minister of State on radio refer to the fact Niall Mellon put forward a proposal to him on his work in South Africa.  I hope Mr. Mellon will extend his work to areas such as Kenya.  I visited Nairobi two years ago.  It is devastating to see the shanty towns in places like Nairobi, where hundreds of thousands of people live in the most appalling conditions.  If we can assist through projects such as Niall Mellon&rsquo;s or others, great work would be done.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State encouraged RTE or TV3 to bring a journalist and television crew with him on his visits, while this might be criticised for promoting the Minister of State &mdash; I do not believe it will be &mdash; it would also promote and support the work he and all the overseas development agencies are doing in developing countries.  We can see the response to the recent television production on the Niall Mellon fund.  More people are volunteering because it showed the effect of the work he is doing with the thousands of volunteers who go to South Africa every aut<Col N="1464"/>umn to build thousands of houses.  The more we promote this, the better.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister of State, as I did his predecessors, Deputies Tom Kitt and Conor Lenihan, to support Oireachtas Members in accompanying some of his missions to developing countries.  Oireachtas Members can get the word through and the cost of such trips is minimal compared to the percentage spent on development and world aid.  Oireachtas Members are prepared to go on such visits because they realise the value of this work.  When I visited Kenya, I went with UNESCO to the northern region when it was suffering severe drought.  This meant I could at least bring that message back to the Oireachtas and other fora to highlight the situation as well as the situation I witnessed in Nairobi, which I would never have known of had I not been there as part of an inter-parliamentary group.  I would encourage Oireachtas Members to make such visits and I would stand over the decision of any Member who was prepared to visit these regions with the Minister of State or his team.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should keep up his excellent work.  He has followed in the shoes of the Ministers of State, his brother Deputy Tom Kitt and Deputy Conor Lenihan, who have also served in his current role.  It is a vital ministry, which has significance in world terms as the lives of many people depend on our commitment and investment in those regions.  I wish the Minister of State continued success in the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his good work in drawing attention to various aspects of Third World development and his openness to meeting various groups.  It is very encouraging to many of us who are involved in various Third World and developing world initiatives and related matters that the Minister of State makes himself available to meet people and tries to see exactly how the system is working.</P>
        <P>I have the view that if we could apply the Treaty of Rome to the world, we could solve much poverty overnight.  In other words, if we could do for the world what Europe did for Ireland by having free movement of labour and goods, this in effect would sort out many of our problems.  The major problem relates to trade.  People in the Third World can produce but they do not have the opportunity to export their goods for sale in the developed world.  Moreover, they must deal with the problem of dumping in their own countries.  Countries in the west can produce cheaply and dump the goods abroad if they cannot sell them at home, which is also an important issue.</P>
        <P>There is much artificiality with regard to prices.  In a form of reverse psychology, if one allowed the market to do its own thing European farmers would be entitled at present to sell abroad because there is a shortage of food in the world.  We need to deal with a number of issues and in <Col N="1465"/>particular we need to open up trade.  This is why Fairtrade is important.  We know when buying a Fairtrade product that we are supporting a real initiative on the ground and that the people who produced the product we are eating or using have been paid properly, dealt with properly and have rights.</P>
        <P>Is not the real issue of fair trade that human and civil rights are inextricably linked?  It was appalling to hear another report from China this morning about a plan to set up yet another flooded area in the southern part of the country which will drive people out of their homes and farms.  No permission is required and the Government will not even compensate people nor give them land instead.  In addition, the local media is not allowed to report on the matter or discuss it.</P>
        <P>Fairtrade brings education in terms of how we allow people and train people to improve themselves.  That is something we should examine.  Fair trade is part of the work voluntary groups do in the developing world.  They show people how to use the land, how to understand agriculture and horticulture and how to fish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, is younger than I but he may recall one of the first slogans used by Tr&oacute;caire about it being better to teach people how to fish than to give them fish.  This is part of the same thing.  Instead of simply giving charity we are involved in trade and in giving people an opportunity to express themselves and to develop.  We can help people by allowing them to participate in the world of trade.  In that sense, each one of the groups to which the Minister of State referred has made an extraordinary contribution.  I have been involved with a number of them, especially the ICTU but Comhl&aacute;mh and others also.  They have been working assiduously, quietly and with extraordinary energy and commitment over the years.</P>
        <P>I return to the issue of education and how we can train people and give them every opportunity.  If we can ensure that the new generation in the Third World are healthy and educated they will find their way.  As part of the Fairtrade initiative we should bring people to Ireland where they can learn about the principles of agriculture.  I do not suggest that they should learn to till the fields and do Irish dancing but they should attend agricultural colleges and horticultural colleges and learn about farm management and the appropriate skills they need to bring back to their countries and to learn the theory behind the application of agriculture.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak for a few minutes.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, and congratulate him on the work he is doing.  This House supports strongly the Fairtrade mark and all that it is achieving.  We also congratulate the people involved on the great work they are doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank <Col N="1466"/>Senators for their welcome comments and statements on Fairtrade.  I refer to the White Paper on Irish Aid which states that we will &ldquo;increase our financial support for initiatives which promote fair and ethical trade.&rdquo;  That sums up many of the issues I raised and that were raised by Senators today.  I reaffirm the commitment to support the expansion of Fairtrade throughout Ireland and to support poor farmers&rsquo; access to Fairtrade certified markets, especially in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is one of the largest donors to Fairtrade in the world.  We will motivate other donors to continue to support producers in the poorest countries of the world.  Building on the success of Irish Aid&rsquo;s support to the Fairtrade Network, we will continue to support development education, Fairtrade Fortnight, which is on at present, and Fairtrade towns.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins referred to the increase in Fairtrade sales.  He referred in particular to business people from Nepal.  I will make contact with the people whom he mentioned when they visit Ireland in the middle of April.  I am pleased to do that.  Senator Butler spoke about how the Oireachtas bars and restaurants now stock Fairtrade products.  He is proud of the fact that Dublin is a Fairtrade capital.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn made some interesting comments on his experience of dealing with Fairtrade products as a businessman.  He also referred to the Doha talks where Europe tried to keep out products from the developing world.  He outlined that farmers need to make even a small profit in order to invest in the future.  That is true of all farmers.  Senator Norris spoke about slave labour and gender equality.  I fully support his comments on those issues.  Senator Mullen said we were talking about a good news story where sales of Fairtrade products had grown by 75%.  He mentioned that NUI Maynooth was the first Fairtrade university.</P>
        <P>Comments from Senator de B&uacute;rca on the Fairtrade movement were also very positive.  She spoke about the need for a fair price to be paid to producers and welcomed trade agreements.  Senator Mary White outlined her personal experience of growing products involved in the production of chocolate.  She also referred to the very important role of young people.  A number of schemes are in place such as the global schools awards and Fairtrade projects for schools.  In some cases transition year students can travel to developing countries.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the great support of Irish people for Fairtrade products and the gap between rich and poor.  He also referred to the ethical questions that have to be asked in regard to these products.  Senator Ormonde spoke about the role of local authorities and media coverage.  She is correct.  We should promote this area more.  The work of schools is important.  I support what she said.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden referred to the importance of towns promoting Fairtrade goods.  Other <Col N="1467"/>Senators also mentioned this.  Senator Bradford spoke about his experience of visiting developing countries.  He referred to Zimbabwe in particular and said the situation there was not getting enough media attention.  He has raised the issue here and I hope it will get more attention.  He also praised Tr&oacute;caire for its various Lenten campaigns on trade and aid.  The current campaign, which is also a very good one, relates to climate change.  He referred to the sugar industry and the fact that we also need to consider GM foods and not to dismiss the proposals in that regard.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Leyden on his contribution.  He referred to the fact that Roscommon County Council has proposed Roscommon as a Fairtrade county.  I congratulate Councillor Orla Leyden who proposed the motion and all her colleagues who unanimously agreed it.  He referred to visits to developing countries by Oireachtas Members, which is something I have promoted.  I wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs about the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the Treaty of Rome and the need to open trade.  I am pleased that he referred to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because it is one of the important bodies that has promoted the issue of fair trade.  He was correct in saying that education is one way of helping people to improve their lives.  It is a basic right that should be available to people in developing countries.</P>
        <P>We support the Irish Fairtrade Network.  We have approved grants of more than &euro;8.5 million.  We will continue to work with the Irish Fairtrade Network to support producers in developing countries.  I reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment, which is in the programme for Government, to ensure that the sourcing of Fairtrade goods, where possible, is part of the purchasing policy of all Departments.</P>
        <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed and I hope we will have another opportunity to discuss issues that help the lives of people in the developing world.</P>

    <Title>Pharmaceutical Pricing: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very happy to be here to deal with pharmacy pricing issues.  Many Members of this House have been interested in this for some time.  I want to set out the context in which the HSE and the Government is examining the cost of pharmaceutical products.  We cannot separate this from the wider issue of health reform.  In the health reform or transformation programme we seek to achieve a number of objectives, in particular to make our health service more responsive to the needs of patients and ensure patients have access to appropriate treatments when they need them, whether in hospital treatments or pharmaceutical or other products.</P><Col N="1468"/>
        <P>The cost of pharmaceutical products in Ireland has risen very dramatically.  In 1991, for example, we spent the equivalent of &euro;200 million on the community drugs scheme.  In 2007 we spent &euro;1.5 billion on the same scheme.  By any standards that is an incredible increase.  When the Government and the HSE investigated the rising cost of drugs in Ireland we had to examine the whole supply chain.  There are three elements in that chain: the manufacturers or producers, the wholesalers and the community or retail pharmacy sector.</P>
        <P>First, the HSE and Government began negotiations with the producers of medicine and the result of those negotiations has been positive from the perspective of taxpayers and patients.  Prices of all drugs going off patent will be reduced by at least 35%.  That is significant and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics said it is a greater saving than if we immediately moved to generic prescribing.  In addition, Ireland is part of a wider basket of countries.  In the past we belonged to a basket of five countries, and they were the five most expensive countries in the EU.  Today Ireland belongs to a basket of nine countries including Spain, and we will procure new pharmaceutical products at the average price in that basket.  That is 10% lower than the price at which we produce new products today.  That is very satisfactory from the perspective of the taxpayer and the patients.</P>
        <P>Next, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children sought and began, in good faith, to negotiate with the wholesalers.  In the middle of those negotiations the wholesalers produced legal advice that suggested it was a breach of competition law to negotiate, that fixing or agreeing prices with the wholesalers, which is what would happen through those negotiations, was contrary to Irish and European competition law.  Negotiations were suspended for the HSE to get legal advice.  I also sought the advice of the Attorney General and independent legal advice was sought.  It confirmed that Irish and European competition law does not allow the Government to enter negotiations on price setting with any group.  That was a disappointment and it was news to us, but it is the law.  Thereafter, the HSE commissioned independent research by Indecon to look at the wholesale margin in Ireland.  Essentially the wholesale margin in Ireland is double the margin across the EU.  For example, we pay 18% by way of a wholesale margin.</P>
        <P>The next piece in the equation is the retail or community pharmacist, and the State&rsquo;s contract with such pharmacists is based on supplying drugs through the General Medical Services, also known as the medical card scheme, or through the drug payment scheme.  There are also some small agreements on high-tech drugs.  For the GMS, we pay a dispensing fee of &euro;3.26 per item, and we pay a 50% mark-up on the drug for the drug payment scheme, as well as a dispensing fee of about &euro;2.60.  Those fees deliver an average of &euro;240,000 per year to pharmacists, or &euro;100,000 <Col N="1469"/>more than pharmacists in Northern Ireland for the service they provide.</P>
        <P>It is my view that pharmacists should be paid for the professional service they supply, which is the dispensing of medication.  They should not be paid fees based on the commodity price or based on a mark-up of the commodity price.  As drugs get more expensive, a 50% mark-up clearly would become unsustainable and I know of no country where fees are paid on that basis.  We are seeking to get better value for taxpayers and better value for patients.  The wholesale margin will be reduced to roughly the European average of 8% from 1 March and 7% from 1 January 2009.  When the wholesalers made their submission to the HSE as part of those negotiations, they acknowledged that the 7% to 8% margin allowed for overheads and running costs of 4% to 5% plus a profit margin of 2% to 3%.  The HSE recently went to tender for the supply of vaccines, which must be distributed in complicated conditions in freezers and so on.  The company that won the contract did so on a 4% margin.  In Northern Ireland the wholesale price is 12.5% for the first &euro;180,000 and thereafter it drops to 4%.  Therefore, I do not accept that a wholesale margin of 7% from the start of next year is not adequate for a thriving wholesale business.</P>
        <P>We have a virtual market here.  The three big wholesale companies have major interests in the pharmacy sector.  United Drug has invested &euro;300 million in pharmacies.  Cahill May Roberts owns about 70 pharmacies while Uniphar owns between 400 and 500 pharmacies.</P>
        <P>A number of changes have been made to pharmacy legislation in recent years.  A regulation was introduced in 1996 to restrict the location of pharmacies, based on the number of miles from the nearest pharmacy.  This was repealed by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in 2002.  At that time the Irish Pharmaceutical Union predicted that there would be catastrophic consequences, but since then we have had a 26% increase in the number of pharmacies in this country.</P>
        <P>I enacted a Bill in 2005 to liberalise the market to allow more pharmacists to open premises in Ireland, including many graduates who could not get into pharmacy school in this country because we only had one school with a restricted number of places.  Many of our own young people had to go abroad to study pharmacy, but when they came home they could not open their own pharmacy.  When we acted in 2005 to change that, it was again predicted that there would be dire consequences for the pharmacy sector.  Since then, there has been a 5% increase per annum in the number of pharmacies in the country.</P>
        <P>The Government wants to see a thriving community pharmacy sector.  It has been suggested that up to 200 pharmacies may close as a result of the new wholesale price.  Even if we were to accept that, it means that we are being asked to pay &euro;5 million per annum to each of those phar<Col N="1470"/>macies to keep them open.  I do not think anyone could suggest that that would be possible or desirable.</P>
        <P>The new dispensing fee of &euro;5 per item from 1 March for those who wish to enter into a temporary contract, as announced by the HSE, represents a 70% increase on the &euro;3.26 fee.  That may well be attractive for some pharmacists.  However, representatives of the pharmacy union made the point to me that because that fee was not set by an independent process, pharmacists would be very reluctant to accept it.  That is why I asked Mr. Sean Dorgan, a former head of the IDA and a former Secretary General of two Departments, to oversee a group which was composed of himself, Mr. Mark Moran, the former chief executive officer of the Mater Private Hospital and who worked in the pharmaceutical sector, and Ms Mary O&rsquo;Dea, the director of consumer affairs at the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and who has enormous credibility as a consumer champion.  The group was asked to look at the flat fee for dispensing on a temporary basis.</P>
        <P>We are not in a position to break a contract nor would we wish to do so.  Breaking a contract requires at least six months&rsquo; notice.  The intention of the Government and the HSE is to enter into negotiations with the IPU on a new contract for pharmacists.  I want to see the developmental role of pharmacists taken more seriously.  I want to see pharmacists, as well-educated and skilled health care professionals, more involved in chronic illness management, in preventative health care measures and in primary care.  Through negotiating a new contract with the IPU, I hope we will be able to do that.  We would not be able to negotiate the price for that new contract owing to the competition laws I mentioned earlier, so it will have to be set by an independent body.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable nor sustainable that it should cost &euro;600 million in Ireland to get &euro;1 billion worth of products from the manufacturer to the patients.  I know of no sectors that have margins of 60% to 70%.  Therefore, I believe that the separation of the professional dispensing fee from mark-ups and discounts is desirable in the interests of the taxpayers and in the interests of the patients.  It is also desirable in the interest of the pharmacy sector, especially those pharmacists that are very heavily dependent on medical card patients or in rural areas with very small turnover.  Such pharmacists will do a lot better as a result of a higher dispensing fee than is currently the case.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased that patients have not been adversely affected since 1 March.  The freefone line operated by the HSE has taken about 300 calls.  In all those cases the operatives have been able to reassure the patients, and I pay tribute to the pharmacy profession.  I think pharmacists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Pharmacists take their ethical responsibility seriously and all evidence suggests that is the case.  If anyone can show me anywhere in the world where it costs &euro;600 million to bring &euro;1 billion worth of drugs to patients, I will be very surprised.  We have put in place a regime for the reimbursement of the retail pharmacy sector which is just not sustainable.  As new drugs come on the market for cancer and other ailments, it is important we have access to those drugs.  We have a finite resource available for health care and we must ensure that we deliver those drugs to patients in the most cost-effective way, remunerating the professional skills, educational competence and training which pharmacists have, but also delivering appropriate value for money for patients, the pharmacy sector and the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  There have been many calls in recent weeks for her to come to the Seanad and to explain the action she has been taking.  The reason Members on all sides wanted her to come was because of the concerns of the pharmacy sector.  These concerns focus mainly on the risks to the community pharmacy sector.  Pharmacists say that many pharmacies could close because of the changed economic situation which they face.  They also say that many people who are new to the profession will find it difficult to survive.</P>
        <P>There is a wide range of concerns on all sides of the House and Members would have welcomed an opportunity to discuss them with the Minister before the deadline of 1 March.  I regret the Minister chose to come to the House after the deadline had passed.  It does a disservice to the Seanad, following the disservice done to the D&aacute;il when she chose to appear before it as late as last Thursday.  If democracy is to mean anything, Parliament must engage in vigorous debate and discussion of issues.  Instead, representatives of the Health Service Executive appeared before a committee of the House to defend the organisation&rsquo;s decision and stated the HSE was carrying out political orders.  We did not hear the details from the Minister.  The HSE defended her policy and she chose not to explain, defend or debate the changes she was introducing in either House.</P>
        <P>As usual, the Minister strongly defended her stance.  She indicated that she has taken into account broader health issues and the cost of drugs.  No one disagrees with her argument that drugs should be cheaper and profit margins need to be examined.  The Indecon report, which examined margins, noted the difficulties in making the type of international comparisons to which the Minister referred.</P>
        <P>The Minister is presiding over a failure in industrial relations.  Those working in the phar<Col N="1472"/>macy sector, which provides a good community service, are very concerned and alienated.  They believe a confrontational approach has been taken, they were not involved in meaningful discussions about the changes and efforts were not made to bring them on board.  Time and again they have indicated that they accept the need to reduce costs.  They have also made a range of suggestions for making cost savings and recognise wastefulness in the dispensing of medicines.  Clearly, therefore, there is scope for agreement and discussion.</P>
        <P>Having established an independent body, why did the Minister not remove the deadline?  Why did she not engage in discussions to reach agreement on a range of measures to be taken to secure the cost savings she seeks to deliver a better health service?  We are aware of the many deficits in the health service, realise that money is needed for many frontline services and accept that savings should be made in the area of drug prescribing.  However, the manner in which the changes have been implemented is disturbing.</P>
        <P>Many people are concerned about the impact of the changes on the fabric of community life.  There has been considerable discussion in the media and elsewhere about threats to the fabric of community, especially since the violent killings last week of two young Polish men.  While that incident may appear to be far removed from the issue under discussion, the role of the pharmacy in delivering local services to vulnerable people in communities has emerged in this debate.  Post offices, for example, are closing and the fabric of rural life is under threat.</P>
        <P>A letter from a pharmacist published in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The HSE action will result in the community-based service being available only in large urban centres operated by Boots, Tesco or Unicare. The Minister won&rsquo;t say it publicly but this is what she wants because her HSE advisers tell her the large multinationals can absorb the costs. Meanwhile, a fine body of caring, frontline, professionals who have been providing a service, quietly and efficiently, to generations are put out in the cold.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Regardless of whether the Minister likes it, this is how pharmacists view the impact of the changes.  They believe the Minister is supporting large multinationals without taking into account the concerns of smaller pharmacists, community pharmacists, the independent sector and those pharmacies with a large cohort of medical card customers.  I ask the Minister to respond.</P>
        <P>All sides, not only the Opposition, are concerned about this issue.  Many Members on the Government side have expressed concern about the manner in which the HSE has acted.  I refer to another letter published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 1 March, which noted that the HSE acted &ldquo;without any consultation.&rdquo;  It added: &ldquo;If the changes go ahead as scheduled, the impli<Col N="1473"/>cations for our national delivery of pharmaceutical services will, in my view, be catastrophic.&rdquo;  These words were not written by an Opposition politician but by a former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children in the previous Government, the Minister&rsquo;s party colleague, Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Malley.  The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il that Mr. O&rsquo;Malley is a pharmacist.  He raised the concerns I have raised about the future of small, local pharmacies, especially in rural areas.  Will their future be threatened?  If so, where are their patients, particularly elderly people, expected to go to obtain prescribed medication?  Will the Minister outline what contingency plans have been made?  She indicated that only 300 calls had been made to the helpline.  That is a significant number of people raising concerns about whether their medication will be available.  I expect many of the calls were made by elderly people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In her address to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Aisling Reast, a young pharmacist from Lucan, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Young pharmacists like me face financial ruin for wanting to play a key role in looking after our community&rsquo;s health.  We want this issue to be resolved in a way that will ensure our patients will receive the service they need and that our members will be paid a fair rate for providing that service.  All we want is fair play.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Pharmacists want negotiation and engagement.  I ask the Minister to respond to some of the specific key areas of concern which have been articulated by Members from all sides regarding the impact of the unilateral change which took effect on 1 March.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister reminds me of St. Paul riding his horse into Damascus, except she has not yet fallen off her horse or been politically converted.  Why is she being confrontational on an issue on which there was scope for agreement and compromise?  She and her Government colleagues have instilled fear in ordinary people.  I use the Northgate pharmacy in Cork city, a simple operation run by a woman and her daughter who act as the friends, counsellors and confidantes of many of their customers.  Why is the Minister placing them under severe pressure?</P>
        <P>The viability of community pharmacists in rural and urban areas is being put at risk.  What contin<Col N="1474"/>gency plans are in place in the event that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union decides this week that enough is enough?  The Minister indicated that 300 people telephoned the helpline before the deadline expired.  What will happen when chaos looms?  What contingency plans are in place?  We have spin and bluster from the Department when we need answers and reassurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important issue and thank her for regularly making time available to come to the House.  I commend her on the determination and commitment she brings to the vital issue of health reform.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is important to remind the House of the long-standing problem faced by patients regarding the cost of medication.  They pay a multiple of the cost in other countries.This has long been a bone of contention for all parties and a constant source of frustration for people when they travel abroad and purchase medication at a fraction of the price paid in Ireland.  This is not in the best interests of the consumer and as the taxpayer foots &euro;100 million of this unnecessary cost, it is not in the best interests of the taxpayer or the Irish finances.  There is much we could do with &euro;100 million and we can all think of projects on which we would willingly spend it.</P>
        <P>The increasing cost of medication in Ireland represents a significant portion of our health budget.  The ageing population has increased the demand for a practical and efficient community pharmacy drugs supply program.  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children have sought to provide a system giving greater value to patients purchasing medication and to taxpayers who contribute to that budget.</P>
        <P>The Brennan Commission highlighted faults with the present system of reimbursements under the drugs payment scheme.  As a result, the existing wholesale mark-up paid for drugs is to be reduced to a level fair to both wholesalers and taxpayers.  The Government should be commended for this bold step to ensure a sustainable and principled system of drugs payment exists.</P>
        <P>It is important to note the context in which the change takes place.  The HSE expenditure on medical card and community drugs schemes in 2007 shows that &euro;1.1 billion was spent on purchasing drugs and medicines from manufacturers; &euro;200 million was paid to wholesalers to deliver these products to community pharmacies; &euro;237 million was paid to pharmacists in fees for the medical card, drugs payment scheme and long term illness schemes; and a further &euro;130 million in markups on specific schemes giving a total of &euro;367 million.  Adding VAT of &euro;38 million, the total cost of drugs and medicines under the schemes will amount to approximately &euro;1.74 billion in 2007.  Therefore, it costs upwards of &euro;600 million to deliver drugs and medicines costing &euro;1.1 billion from the factory to the patient. <Col N="1475"/> This is very expensive and the HSE saving of &euro;100 million from the wholesale delivery side should be seen in this context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reduction of the wholesale margin from almost 18% to a level eventually reaching 7% will represent a saving of &euro;9 million per month.  This will bring the Irish level in line with the European average.  It has cost us in excess of &euro;600 million just to deliver &euro;1 billion of drugs to the patient.  This situation is untenable and avoidable. The HSE&rsquo;s pharmaceutical reform will provide a stable foundation for the process of pharmaceutical pricing for the years to come.</P>
        <P>The new system of pharmaceutical pricing ensures dispensing fees will stand independently and eradicates the practice of external wholesaler discounting.  This simplification affords every party of the supply chain &mdash; the producers of medicine, the distributors to the retail sector and the pharmacists &mdash; with a durable and effective method of interaction and work.</P>
        <P>Wholesale companies have given assurances that they will not charge pharmacists more than the amount wholesalers are reimbursed by the HSE for the cost of drugs and medicines supplied.  Therefore, contrary to beliefs, pharmacists will not have to sell below cost.  The HSE&rsquo;s decision on the wholesale price does not affect the &euro;370 million paid in fees to pharmacists.  The flat fee proposal that will be assessed by the independent body will be voluntary.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children of the establishment of an independent body to assess an interim, fair community pharmacy dispensing fee, with at least &euro;5 to be paid for the medical card scheme, the drugs payment scheme and other community drug schemes.  This amount is an increase of over &euro;1.70 per item dispensed.  This offer to individual community pharmacists is voluntary and the option to remain with their existing contracts allows for a level of flexibility during the transition period.  This option facilitates the evolution of the system in a practical and sensitive way.  The HSE will not be taking contracts away from any chemist.</P>
        <P>Reservations have been expressed by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union about the new pricing system.  Questions have been aired about the survival of many pharmacies across the country.  These concerns have resulted in an extensive lobbying campaign on behalf of the pharmacists.</P>
        <P>While I commend pharmacists for the role they play in our community &mdash; I have seen first hand their professionalism and compassion &mdash; I have grave reservations regarding some of the actions they have undertaken in this campaign, particularly their early move regarding people who use methadone.  I regret the fear that is now being instilled in elderly and vulnerable patients.</P>
        <P>I commend the pharmacists&rsquo; intention to minimise the impact of their actions.  I applaud their commitment to developing their role and enhanc<Col N="1476"/>ing the services they provide to the community.  I understand their fear of change.  I hope that they will find reassurance in the Government&rsquo;s clear dedication to maintaining the role of the pharmacy and to ensuring fair fees for this development.</P>
        <P>The role of the pharmacist in Irish society is not to be understated.  Pharmacies are an integral part of our health system.  It is not envisaged that any pharmacies will suffer as a result of this latest reform.  Previous pessimism about the fate of pharmacies after reform was introduced in recent years has proved unfounded.  This instance will be no different.</P>
        <P>I welcome the HSE&rsquo;s intention to enter discussions with the IPU and other parties on the development of a new substantive contract and I especially welcome the commitment to a proper professional fee for contracted pharmacy services.  This is a deserved recognition and acknowledgement of the valuable role played by pharmacists within our community.  Pharmacists have made the strong point that theirs is a role that could be developed further for the benefit of the public, for example in the areas of diabetes and health screening.</P>
        <P>The professional fee provides a basis for a proper acknowledgement of this role and its further development.  However, in the interests of value for money, we should look not only at wholesalers and pharmacists but also at the structure in place to support the various drugs payment schemes.  Pharmacists recount a multitude of frustrating experiences in following up on their payments and the associated paperwork.  They report being passed from one person to another and the considerable time required in following up claims.  If this is the case, it is not a good use of anybody&rsquo;s time.  It is not efficient and carries a cost that cannot be considered value for money.  I ask the Minister to examine such comments and to investigate what improvements may be required to ensure an efficient, effective system that contributes to value for money.</P>
        <P>It is essential to keep in mind that the welfare of the patient is at the crux of the transfer to a new pricing system.  We must guarantee that no patient will suffer as a result of this reform programme and that provisions are in place should such an occurrence arise.  Ultimately, the change in price will benefit the patient through reductions in drug prices.  The target of reducing the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs to 7% by January 2009 represents the target set by the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to achieve fair and sustainable levels for all.  This is also on par with European counterparts.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the recommendations of the independent body in late May.  Rounded and wide-ranging opinions gathered from independent analysis, and from all stakeholders, can only strengthen this reforming process.  I strongly urge the pharmacists and the HSE to work with the <Col N="1477"/>independent body to ensure that the best possible service for the patient is delivered at a reasonable cost, with appropriate acknowledgement and recognition of the role of the pharmacist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Ross.  I welcome the Minister to the House and the explanations she has given on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I came into this House 15 years ago I decided that I would examine all proposed legislation from the customer&rsquo;s point of view.  I want to look at the present problem from a slightly wider angle than we have become used to over the last few weeks.</P>
        <P>I am a fan of the tasks that pharmacists do.  I see them as fulfilling an important and necessary role in the overall health service.  In a situation where the primary health care provided by doctors is hopelessly inadequate, pharmacists serve as a kind of auxiliary troop in the fight against ill health.  At community level they are an important part of the health care team and could play an even more important role.</P>
        <P>However, while I am a fan of the task of pharmacists and their general role, I am much less of a fan of the pharmacists themselves.  To be more precise, I am not in favour of the way they have defended their vested interests in recent years against the more general interests of the community the Minister described so well earlier.  Their policy all along has been blatantly protectionist, and in a rapidly changing world they have tried their hardest to defend the indefensible.</P>
        <P>In the current dispute the mark-ups pharmacists enjoy in dispensing medicines are undoubtedly excessive, and I fully support the Health Service Executive in its efforts to reduce them.  However, I have not always been much of a fan of the HSE, either generally or in the way it appears to have handled this dispute.  The HSE deserves at least some of the blame for the situation we find ourselves in today.  The fact that it has the right on its side does not give it licence to behave unreasonably in its negotiations.</P>
        <P>Having called down a plague on both houses in this dispute, I will now try to widen the issue.  The mark-up by pharmacists is not the only issue that affects the excessive cost of drugs in this country.  There are at least three other factors that the HSE should be paying attention to and which, until I heard the Minister speak earlier, I thought it was ignoring.</P>
        <P>The first factor is the use of its buying power against the prices demanded by the drug multinationals.  As a retailer I am very aware of the clout created by being a big customer.  I had intended suggesting to the Minister that she should get together with other countries &mdash; she has indicated she has got together with nine of them &mdash; to be able to negotiate in a better way than we have done previously.  I was pleased to hear that.</P><Col N="1478"/>
        <P>The second factor is the greater use of generic drugs.  These are drugs on which royalties do not have to be paid because their original patents have expired.  The drug multinationals are past masters at making tiny and inconsequential changes to their drugs just as the patents are about to expire.  They ally that with pressure on doctors to prescribe the new drugs rather than switch to the much cheaper but just as effective generic drugs.  Since the medical profession has shown itself incapable of addressing this problem, the time has now come to deal with it at national level, probably by way of legislation.</P>
        <P>The third urgent issue also involves curbing the doctor&rsquo;s traditionally unfettered freedom to prescribe whatever he or she likes.  It has become clear in recent years that we have a serious problem in over-prescribing by doctors, largely created by the expectations of patients.  It is notable, for instance, that the average number of drugs prescribed to medical card patients, who can visit the doctor as often as they like, is considerably higher than the average number of drugs prescribed to private patients.  That has very serious cost implications for the health service but it is not the most important reason over-prescription must be stopped as a matter of urgency.  The more drugs that are prescribed, especially of antibiotics, the more resistant the patient&rsquo;s body becomes to them.  I understand the staggering increase in the prevalence of the MRSA bug in our hospitals in recent years has been attributed to the general over-prescribing of antibiotics by general practitioners.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contribution to the debate.  The row between the HSE and the pharmacists will no doubt sort itself out in the coming weeks.  The Minister has shone a beam of light on an area I had not quite understood until today.  It will help bring this dispute to a conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me, particularly as I do not agree with a word he said, something of which he was perhaps unaware when he generously agreed to my request.</P>
        <P>I see this as a kind of David and Goliath struggle, with the HSE on one side and the pharmacists on the other.  An unequal battle is taking place because the weapons the pharmacists must use are very difficult, if not impossible, to exercise.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Corrigan said about the withdrawal of methadone services.  That was a public relations mistake.  The only weapon the pharmacists now have is either to withdraw or not withdraw their services.  The HSE is using what is always a problem in the health service, namely, a type of commercial bludgeon with which to hit community workers.</P>
        <P>We must recognise that pharmacists have two roles.  They must make money but they must also be community workers.  Somewhere in the middle stands the State, which says they must behave in <Col N="1479"/>a totally commercial way where they are community workers.  We cannot expect people to do that when they are expected to do a duty for the State.  It is the same weapon the nurses have when they threaten to go on strike.  They cannot go on strike because the consequences of using that ultimate weapon are unthinkable.  What happened in the methadone case was catastrophic and the pharmacists rightly pulled back from it immediately.  If they now decide not to dispense certain medicines to medical card holders it will be a disaster, not just for the individuals concerned but for the pharmacists also because the support of public opinion will be lost.</P>
        <P>In that situation the HSE holds all the cards.  It is aware the pharmacists are, to some extent, fairly helpless and weak in the battle they are fighting.  It is wrong for a State monolith like that to take on what is ultimately a weak group, bully them and use fairly tyrannical tactics to get its way.</P>
        <P>I understand the solution being suggested by the pharmacists is a reasonable one.  They are not as intransigent as the HSE.  They say they are happy to go to independent arbitration.  That is a reasonable position to put forward.  They say they are prepared to examine the waste in the pharmaceutical area in the dispensing and the use of medicines.  That is another area which should be examined.  They even say they will make concessions on costs and perhaps even on margin if it is necessary but they say they do not want to be kicked around when they have nothing with which to fight.  That is what is happening currently.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the umbrella organisation the Minister has set up because to include in a group a former of IDA Ireland, the head of the Mater Private Hospital and a high profile member of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s staff is putting official Ireland up front to make a decision which to some extent is predestined.  Mr. Moran also happens to be chairman of the EBS.  That may or may not qualify him for this particular post but it puts him in a certain category which might not necessarily be sympathetic to the pharmacists.</P>
        <P>The Minister made two statements which were interesting.  She said this was to be considered in the context of overall savings in the health service.  That is a reasonable statement to make but Members of the Oireachtas would be aware that the Health Service Executive bombards us daily with propaganda.  I do not know if I get it because I am a member of the press, a Member of the Oireachtas or both but the propaganda from the HSE never stops.  There is a spinning war going on which is lethal but it reflects what is happening here.  I understand the HSE has now appointed a parliamentary director.  This morning I heard someone who is a director of something else in the HSE.  It issues dozens of press releases on a regular basis.  It has people in its public relations office spinning continuously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The survey undertaken by the pharmacists indicates the consequences of the action proposed will be far more severe than the spin which emanates from the Department and the HSE.  The number of closures, possible unemployment and the cost to rural communities will be immense and ultimately unacceptable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for coming to the House.  The issue before the House on matters relating to community pharmacists should not take up the time of this Chamber, the Minister or the D&aacute;il Chamber, as it did last Thursday.  This is because the principal parties involved, namely the HSE and the community pharmacists, should be able to resolve this issue.  I understand from speaking to a number of pharmacists, whom I know well, that the vast majority of community pharmacists wish to assist in finding a resolution.  They support the view that savings can be made.  The intransigent position taken by the HSE, regardless of the fallout, is regrettable.</P>
        <P>Reform and reduction in the cost of medication is welcome.  I will mention something stated earlier by a Senator; he may wish that I did not state it in his absence.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will stay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested to hear the words of various contributors.  A view was put forward that in the market place we do not have normal market forces.  We know in the grocery industry, and a good friend of mine is involved in the wholesale end of grocery, that issues arose with regard to below-cost selling, hello money and various other matters.  Whether one changes the name and it is called &ldquo;13 for 12&rdquo;, a space on a shelf, bin-end or service, it is a market force. </P>
        <P>If the Minister states that we have a group of people who are good marketeers and who have developed their pharmaceutical chain to include a number of pharmacies and are consequently able to use their clout to demand more, then so be it.  It is wrong to state that because United Drug, Cahill May Roberts and Uniphar have a number of interests to defend we are now changing market forces.</P>
        <P>The current situation is not in the best public interest.  I will put on record my understanding of the party of which I am a member, Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has always adopted a caring philosophy and put people first while at the same time ensuring value for money and managing the nation&rsquo;s affairs in the people&rsquo;s best interest and benefit.  The personnel involved in the pharmaceutical negotiations, particularly the HSE, seemed not to have <Col N="1481"/>adopted this caring philosophy.  The proposal, and manner in which it has been pursued by the HSE, has done enormous damage.</P>
        <P>I am aware the HSE proposal has been on the table for a considerable period of time.  I have heard the cases for and against both sides.  The positions presented indicate huge variances and it is regrettable that we find ourselves in this position.  The HSE has advanced its process of review of the pharmaceutical supply chain and I understand agreements have been made between the HSE and the wholesalers.</P>
        <P>I understand that &euro;877.98 million was paid to manufacturers in 2006 and an agreement has been reached with the wholesalers for savings of &euro;65 million.  The fees and mark-up paid to pharmacists in 2006 was &euro;321.7 million, of which we now seek to save approximately &euro;100 million.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm the accuracy of those figures.</P>
        <P>I concur with previous speakers on the service provided by community pharmacists.  No community pharmacist would have cut required methadone provision to an addict when it was used as a lever.  It may have been threatened but I know many pharmacists went to great lengths to ensure that if an addict would not get methadone in their pharmacies an alternative arrangement was made.</P>
        <P>The emphasis on reimbursement and the new contract is causing serious difficulties for community pharmacists and the Minister knows this.  It is also causing heightened anxiety among patients.  I have heard people talk about the savings to the public.  I am not sure what great savings will be made with the various schemes which operate, including the GMS, the LTI and the DPS.</P>
        <P>The Minister made a comparison with the North with regard to vaccines.  How much of the figure of &euro;1.6 billion, referred to in this debate, is spent on vaccines?  I would think it is a minute percentage.  The comparison made by the Minister is unfair.  I also understand there are only two or three suppliers in the vaccine area.  It is a specialised area and some people are prepared to carry loss-leaders or a product for the sake of turnover or other reasons.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated she sought the advice of the Attorney General.  Did she seek his advice with regard to the HSE changing the contract in place on 1 March and what was the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice with regard to reimbursement?</P>
        <P>We all welcome the group established by the Minister.  However, is it fair to state it is only examining one matter?  We know other issues exist and that this dispute is not only about fees.  I would welcome the Minister stating the group will examine not only fees but also reimbursement prices along the lines mentioned by her.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned facts and figures earlier and I wish to outline others.  It has been brought to my attention that pre-tax and pre-interest profits currently run at 13.5% in phar<Col N="1482"/>macies and the impact of an 8.2% reduction in reimbursement prices will hit pharmacy profits by approximately 4.3%.  The effect of the interim contract removing the mark-up taken by pharmacists on the DPS and the LTI schemes would be to remove a further 6.5%.  The interim contract increase on the script, from 3.26% to 5%, would add back 1.5%.  The combination of the 8.2% reduction in reimbursement together with the impact the interim contract would have if implemented would reduce pre-interest and pre-tax profits from 13.5% to 4%.  This would mean that 77% of existing pharmacies would be unable to meet their debt commitments to banks.  I cite these to also illustrate that we can all marshall facts and figures to sustain our arguments.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said she wishes to avoid anxiety among patients or frustration among pharmacists.  The pharmacists do not know if they hold &euro;50,000 or &euro;150,000 worth of stock.  They do not know what the reimbursement rate will be, how it will be calculated or what mechanisms will be put in place.  The community pharmacists have assisted on many other fronts and are willing to reach agreement on this matter.</P>
        <P>I have been involved in the health services on both sides, as a Minister of State at the Department and in pharmaceutical sales.  This is a very complex matter in which I support the Minister.  If we want to attract multinational pharmaceutical company investment, research and development, we cannot prescribe generic pharmaceutical products.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable we were not able to ensure harmony and agreement between all players in the dispute.  I believe, however, it is still possible.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response and hope she outlines how best we can get a resolution.  A three-man independent body only examining one issue will not be the solution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This dispute strikes me as another fine mess we have gotten into.  I was going to blame the HSE entirely but the Minister stated it was a Government and HSE decision.  I agree with the Minister that the pharmacists are very ethical and responsible.  I have no doubt those who require medicines will continue to have access to them.  I agree with the setting up of an independent body, chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, to come to conclusions on changes to the community pharmacists&rsquo; contract with the HSE.  This is the approach that should have been taken rather than the unilateral action that has already taken place, which puts the cart before the horse.</P>
        <P>Unilateral variation is a basic but major change to the contract.  In essence, it is a breach of contract.  I take issue with the manner and method of <Col N="1483"/>this whole operation.  I agree with Senator Shane Ross that all Members, as does the Minister, accept that dialogue is essential to conflict resolution.  Consultation with those involved is a <i>sine qua non</i>.</P>
        <P>I am greatly concerned for the future of community pharmacy shops.  We all like the idea of a pharmacy shop on the streets of our towns rather than the proliferation of bookie shops or fast-food outlets.  I am also concerned with the emergence of out-of-town medical centres and super pharmacies.  A number of rural pharmacies will be under severe threat with the proposed changes to the contracts.  The only pharmacy in Castlegregory will be forced to shut down, leaving none on the northern side of the Dingle Peninsula.</P>
        <P>The handling of this dispute is unusual and highly irregular.  The motion proposed by Deputy Moloney, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, stated no change should be made to contracts between the HSE and community pharmacists in advance of the setting up and reporting of an independent body whose remit will be to make recommendations on the reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs supplied under the State&rsquo;s community drugs schemes.  It recognised the vital role community pharmacists play in the delivery of health services.  It further recognised proposed changes to the contracts between the HSE and the pharmacists should be designed to allow for financial sustainability.  Every Member on both sides of the House agreed to this wording.  I do not know why it was subsequently withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s aim to save &euro;100 million on the costs of drugs to the HSE.  However, I vehemently disagree with her uncompromising method of achieving that end.  The Minister may be proud of being Machiavellian but it is an approach I deplore.  A recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> pointed out the Minister is showing an iron fist to community pharmacists, a fist she lacked when setting up the HSE and failed to implement a rationalisation of health board employees.</P>
        <P>Community pharmacists are an easy target for the Minister.  Her approach also threatens patients and will cause unemployment and undue hardship.  To comprehend the issue, I called a public meeting for pharmacists in Galway and attended one.  The IPU, the body the Minister has fought and refused to meet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I met the IPU just two weeks ago.  I never refused to meet the IPU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  The Minister has refused to negotiate with the IPU.  It has urged pharmacists to continue dispensing medical card prescriptions, despite the massive cut in their fees, as a token of goodwill and to allow time to find a formula to resolve the <Col N="1484"/>issue.  What compromise is the Minister willing to make to prevent this dispute escalating?</P>
        <P>I do not know where pharmacists&rsquo; breaking point is but it must be very close.  In Carraroe I met a young pharmacist with a young family whose pharmacy is 90% dependent on the GMS.  He was shaken by the dispute and must be about to close up shop.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s action is a massive hit to rural and young start-up pharmacies.  Up to 300 outlets are under pressure to close.  In Galway, one to 1.5 lay-offs per shop is expected.  Why threaten so many livelihoods?  I do not thank the Minister for this.  It is all because she will not negotiate.</P>
        <P>Shame on the Minister.  Why has she not gone after the drug manufacturers who make the big bucks?  She knows this because she agreed the price with them.  What is her hidden agenda?  What deal has she entered into with them?</P>
        <P>The so-called independent body under Se&aacute;n Dorgan, unilaterally established by the Minister, is restricted to coming up with a flat fee to apply to the contract.  No pharmacist has yet signed up to it, as it was drafted entirely by the HSE and not negotiated or agreed with them.</P>
        <P>If the Minister agreed the terms of reference for the independent body with the IPU, there might be some chance pharmacists could accept the outcome.  The Minister, however, is persisting with the one-sided bullying approach, instead of calmly negotiating with the IPU, which wants to negotiate and achieve the same savings.</P>
        <P>The Minister, as Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, is presiding over a failed industrial relations negotiation.  Will the Minister explain why she is embarking on a unilateral breach of pharmacists&rsquo; contracts?  A contract must have two parties at least.  The Minister is exposing the State again to large litigation costs.  Between 500 to 600 litigation cases are being prepared.  This attitude is similar to that of the Department of Education and Science against children with special educational needs.  It wasted &euro;11.5 million in litigation costs fighting them instead of providing them with services.  To give pharmacists their due, proposals have been on the Minister&rsquo;s desk for some time outlining ways to save &euro;90 million through generic substitution, as well as alleviating waste through the over-prescription of drugs.</P>
        <P>We cannot forget the patient, the most vulnerable party in the loop.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s plans to get drugs to patients in the absence of a local pharmacy or when a drug is not on the shelf because it is too expensive to carry?  Some drugs for shingles, for example, cost more than &euro;100.  What are her plans in that case?  I want to hear some answers.  I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s adoption of an entrenched approach when negotiation would have made all the difference.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge the contribution made by pharmacists around the country.  I come from a rural area in Donegal and I recognise the wonderful contribution of rural pharmacies in helping vulnerable members of our society, including the young and the elderly.</P>
        <P>The HSE announced new arrangements for wholesale margins on 17 September last year, which affect the price for the supply of drugs to the State.  This followed the completion of new arrangements with drug manufacturers in 2006 and the IPHA-APMI agreements.  This, as the Minister mentioned, is distinct from the dispensing fees paid to community pharmacists under the general medical scheme and the drug payment scheme, which remain unaffected by these arrangements.  It was planned that the new wholesale price arrangements for the delivery of drugs to pharmacies would take effect from 1 January 2008 but, as we know, the date was deferred to 1 March by the HSE in light of the ongoing engagement with the IPU under the auspices of Mr. Bill Shipsey SC.</P>
        <P>The Government is firm in its view that the wholesale mark-up paid on the price of drugs should be reduced to a level that is fair to both taxpayers and wholesalers.  The existing mark-up is between 15% and 17.6%, while the revised mark-up, as we know, is 8% from 1 March this year and will be reduced to 7% from January 2009.  In light of the concerns expressed about the alleged impact of the new wholesale arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies in particular, a draft interim contract with a flat-rate dispensing fee of not less than &euro;5 has been offered to individual community pharmacists.  This offer is voluntary and pharmacists can opt to stay with their existing contracts if they so wish.  Pharmacists with a high proportion of medical card patients currently receive a dispensing fee of &euro;3.26 for most transactions.  Many of these pharmacies are in rural or inner-city areas and provide an important social and health service.  The higher flat rate is aimed at these pharmacies in particular.</P>
        <P>The Minister, contrary to a suggestion made by a Senator from the Opposition, did meet with the IPU recently &mdash; I understand from the Minister it was about two weeks ago &mdash; and heard its point that there should be an independent assessment of the fees offered.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has established an independent body which will immediately begin work to assess a fair interim community pharmacy dispensing fee of at least &euro;5 to be paid for the GMS, the DPS and other community drug schemes.  However, &euro;5 is a little on the low side.  I ask the Minister to use her good offices to impress upon this body to consider increasing the &euro;5 fee.  I note that it is a mini<Col N="1486"/>mum dispensing fee but I urge that it be increased.</P>
        <P>The independent body is chaired by Se&aacute;n Dorgan, the former head of IDA Ireland.  I have full confidence that Mr. Dorgan, who is a man of great reputation, will bring forward proposals that can be agreed upon by both the HSE and the IPU.  Submissions from all stakeholders will be accepted and analysis of those submissions will be carried out by the three-member body.  Recommendations are to be made to Government by the end of May and the recommended fee, subject to Government approval, will be backdated to 1 March 2008 or to whatever date individual community pharmacists choose to accept the HSE&rsquo;s voluntary interim contract.  The independent body and independent negotiations represent the best available option for addressing the concerns of pharmacies.  I have confidence that there will be meaningful discussions and a meaningful outcome.  We all anxiously await this.</P>
        <P>The body met first on 25 February and again yesterday.  Public submissions have been invited and the development of a new substantive pharmacy contract will get under way as soon as possible.  This will be done under the auspices of an agreed facilitator and it too will be priced by the independent body.  Thus, we have the independent negotiations which we all sought, certainly on this side of the House, and we all welcome them.</P>
        <P>I commend the IPU on the manner in which it dealt with this over the weekend.  On Thursday evening the president of the IPU, Michael Guckian, called on all pharmacies to continue dispensing medicines to patients on 1 March.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She has a difficult row to hoe.  I have some disagreements with her but I was impressed by what Senator Feargal Quinn had to say.  He talked a great deal of practical sense and I was glad to have heard him.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an issue that is perhaps an unintended by-product of this dispute but one that I would like the Minister to take seriously.  I mentioned this on the Order of Business and asked the Acting Leader to bring it to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  I received a letter from Dr. Martin Henman, professor of pharmacy and pharmaceutical science at Trinity College, in which he indicated that this dispute was directly affecting senior sophisters in the pharmacy degree course.  On completion of the degree, graduates must undertake a year&rsquo;s supervised practice, of which at least six months must be in either a community or a hospital pharmacy.  This practice is undertaken under the supervision of a tutor pharmacist and it must take place in a specified practice.  Both the pharmacist and the practice site must be approved by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
        <P>These courses or training posts are funded by the community pharmacists and graduates pay the society&rsquo;s fees and the examination fee.  They must do these courses or they cannot graduate.  The majority, 90%, of the students undertake either six or 12 months&rsquo; training in a community pharmacy and the remainder enter a hospital practice.  While the hospital places have mainly been continued this year, Professor Henman says those in Tullamore were cut by the HSE after being advertised.  There are therefore no places in Tullamore.</P><Col N="1488"/>
        <P>The situation has created considerable uncertainty for students.  Many of them, probably the majority, who would have been offered a pre-registration training place are not prepared to take them.  The effect of the dispute means that because of the legal challenge it is unlikely that this will be resolved immediately.  If it goes to the courts, the earliest it can be heard is June.  The senior sophister students in Trinity and elsewhere are faced with the prospect of being graduates who are unable to complete their professional training, and the health service will find itself without a cohort of pharmacists.  That will mean further upward pressure on salaries and will make staff retention in the hospital sector, where salaries are lower, difficult.  Staff will be inclined to move out of hospitals.  The independent pharmacies will be disproportionately affected because they do not have excess fat in terms of finance to cope.</P>
        <P>Professor Henman says in his letter that the situation is unique in his experience of just over 25 years in Trinity College.  He knows of one student who has submitted over 45 <i>curricula vitae</i> and, in all but a handful of cases, has been told that no position will be offered in the coming year.  He says his students are unsettled and unable to give all the attention they should to their academic work because they are intensively searching for pre-registration places.  I ask the Minister to take particular notice of this matter, which could be damaging for students at a vulnerable time and also damaging for the industry and the delivery of community health.</P>
        <P>With regard to the general situation, the competition elements are anathema to me.  I believe we have made competition a false god and I strongly object to the fact that under the competition legislation, the HSE is prohibited from negotiating directly with the pharmacists.  The same situation applies to Equity.  In other words, the weakest people are disbarred.  That law should be re-examined.  It is not fair or appropriate.  Competition is not the wonderful thing it is claimed to be.  Look at the impact it has had in spreading the plague of drink in this country, with every huckster shop piled to the ceiling with gin, wine, beer and so forth, and open all night.  This happens in the name of competition.  Let us not pretend competition is the be all and end all.</P>
        <P>Reference should also be made to the letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> from former Deputy, Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Malley.  It is an interesting letter that gets the situation right; he puts the patient centre stage.  He wrote it as a pharmacist.  He is a former colleague of the Minister and a decent man.  He referred to the clawback by the HSE.  I urge the pharmacists to be very careful.  The pharmacists are marvellous people but there is a notice on the window of my local pharmacy telling customers that the pharmacy will be closed tomorrow for a meeting.  These meetings usually take place on Sunday, so the pharmacists are definitely using the patients and customers.  They should be care<Col N="1489"/>ful about doing so because they are in great danger of alienating the public, as they did when they threatened to withdraw methadone services.  That was cruel and callous and, from the point of view of public relations, stupid.</P>
        <P>There should be genuinely independent arbitration of this matter.  I am concerned about small pharmacies going out of business.  Like other Members, I have received a sheaf of letters from pharmacists throughout the country, and they cannot all be wrong.  They suffer under the economies of scale and the fact that the larger pharmacy chains are in a far stronger position to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies.</P>
        <P>Another point should be made.  There are plenty of people around here who will suck up to the pharmacists for their votes.  I am not one of them.  I have supported the pharmacists over the years, when others would not, on ideological grounds.  However, where there is a wholesale services mark-up of 17% on medicines in this country and it is only 7% in Europe, there is something wrong.  We must examine it and we are being dishonest if we say otherwise.  It may be the case that the smaller pharmacies should be cushioned in some way against this, and I would support that.  However, I am not in favour of profiteering.  There are large pharmacy chains in this country but the number of pharmacies has increased by 26% in the last couple of years.  That does not suggest that all pharmacies are on the margins.  I am prepared to believe that the rural and community pharmacies are but why should patients pay twice the price their European counterparts pay?  Why not go to Europe and return with suitcases full of drugs?</P>

	<P>It is not just due to that.  The Competition Act should be scrapped.  It has not served the country well, just as the abolition of the groceries order did not.  I also warned against the abolition of the groceries order and look at the result of that.  There must be independent arbitration but we must ensure that small, family run pharmacies in local areas stay in business.  We have seen the post offices wiped out in rural areas and the Garda stations replaced by a telephone device.  If the local pharmacists are destroyed, will anybody be surprised at a flight from the land?  However, there is an argument for cutting some margins in line with the margins in other European countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to listen to the debate.  I will start with two peripheral points.  Members of the EU scrutiny committee on a visit to Brussels recently met with nine EU Commissioners.  One of them was the EU Commissioner for agriculture, who outlined the measures that had been taken regarding Brazilian beef.  It was obvious that the effective lobbying of the IFA <Col N="1490"/>was instrumental in that decision.  I would have considered the IFA to be the pre-eminent organisation for lobbying in this country, until the pharmacy issue arose.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has put the IFA in the ha&rsquo;penny place.</P>
        <P>Never previously have I seen so many politicians rush to a cause.  Some time ago a senior Opposition politician in the Lower House said to me, &ldquo;Jim, there are two types of politician: politicians of image and politicians of substance.&rdquo;  I believe we must constantly question ourselves as to the category to which we belong.  The Health Service Executive must tackle a multiplicity of areas where money is being spent unnecessarily and one of those areas is undoubtedly medicinal products.  I will return to that point later.  This campaign by pharmacists is one of the most intensive I have experienced.  It was reasonable to extend the date to 1 March.  The Minister is in a better position to evaluate what use was made of that time by the Pharmaceutical Society but it appeared to me that there was no engagement on its side.  The society continued to lobby rather than constructively engage.</P>
        <P>As has been said by a number of speakers, the comparative cost of medicines abroad clearly illustrates that something is wrong.  I am not often impressed with the content of the &ldquo;Joe Duffy Show&rdquo; on RTE.  However, years ago I heard a number of radio programmes on the topic of people who could travel abroad and buy generic drugs at a fraction of the cost of the medication in this country.  That cannot be overlooked or lightly set aside.  I accept that a small number of small pharmacies throughout the country might come under pressure and that the pharmacists&rsquo; livelihoods might be threatened.  In the majority of cases, it is a very lucrative business to be in and one would not need to be an accountant, or a pharmacist&rsquo;s accountant, to come to that conclusion.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris suggested scrapping the Competition Authority because of this issue but anybody who knows anything about the business fabric of this country would argue to the contrary.  We need competition and effective competitive systems in place in the interest of consumers and everyone else.  My criticism would be that the Competition Authority has been very ineffective in many areas.  I was highly critical of its failure, for example, to tackle other professions who cream off society.  Very little has been done in that regard.  The legal profession is probably the most notorious in that resect and we in these Houses have involved ourselves in paying huge fees on a daily basis to people who are producing very little, relative to what they are being paid.  That area must be tackled.  In fairness to the Competition Authority, it has drawn up recommendations in that regard and responsibility at this stage rests with the Government &mdash; I am surprised it is taking so long &mdash; to come up with real measures that will make a difference to consumers in our society.</P><Col N="1491"/>
        <P>The risk takers in our society are the ones who primed this economy.  They are the people who invested and through their courage, innovation and entrepreneurial flair, created the jobs that have brought this country to the standard we now enjoy, where we are the envy of many countries in Europe and the wider world.</P>
        <P>Professions which add nothing to the economic output of the country are in a privileged position because the State has colluded in it, inadvertently or otherwise and has allowed it to continue.  The pharmacists would not be top of the list in this regard.  They would be well down the list, to be fair, but others in the medical profession, including consultants, would be well up on the list.  I spoke to a medical consultant recently who agreed with my views on this matter but argued that nothing will change because the vested interests of the consultants and others in the medical services are endemic.  Unless we are prepared to assist the HSE in achieving the savings it should be achieving, we are defeating the purpose for which we are elected.</P>
        <P>We are paying approximately &euro;16 billion this year to the HSE.  I estimate, conservatively, that &euro;3 billion of that money is wasted.  If we could identify the waste of that &euro;3 billion, it would do so much to address the real issue of lack of access to services that people require.  It is not an easy task in a body that employs 120,000 people but it is what we must do.  Where the Government sets up a body like the HSE, which is like a board of directors, to do a job it should not put obstacles in the way of what is already a difficult job.  We should assist and help it to achieve the reasonable targets that have been set.  My main criticism of the HSE is that it is not doing enough to identify and achieve the necessary savings.  However, I have confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.  If anybody can achieve the efficiencies and the cost effectiveness that we need in our health services, it is the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, who in the past has shown the courage and the skill to manage and achieve the type of public service to which we all aspire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House.  This is a very important debate about an issue which goes to the core of our health service. The patient is at the centre of this issue.  The pharmacists are providing a wonderful service throughout the country.  </P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to clarify who sets the prices of drugs with the drug companies in this country.  Is it the Minister who sets the price?  She is getting the credit for setting the price and I presume it is she who does so.  I wish to know who is fully responsible for setting the price for drugs and that should be our starting point.</P>
        <P>How did the Minister arrive at the price proposal whereby pharmacists will be paid the invoice price for drugs,  less 8%?  Why is the figure <Col N="1492"/>not 7%, for example, or 10%?  How was the figure of 8% decided upon?</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh referred to the independent arbitrator but, unlike him, I believe the pharmacists and their union, the IPU, have acted very responsibly in this dispute, which has been going on for more than a year.  The pharmacists&rsquo; union should have been allowed to negotiate on behalf of its members.  The pharmacists sought the appointment of an independent arbitrator.  Why did the HSE not allow an independent arbitrator to negotiate and come to some agreement with the pharmacists?  I believe it was because the Minister for Finance decided he would take &euro;100 million out of the budget for health, end of story.  The Minister for Health and Children found herself short &euro;100 million and decided she could not afford to have an independent arbitrator in place because every month the dispute continued would cost the Department &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million.  No-one could say when the independent arbitrator would report and every month the issue went unresolved, the Department would lose millions.  That is why the Minister for Health and Children did not put in place an independent arbitrator.</P>
        <P>It is incredible that pharmacists will invoice the HSE and will be paid 8% less than the cost of the drugs.  I cannot get my head around this, to be honest.  I heard the Minister state there is a mark-up of 17% on drugs.   If that is true, why does the Minister not pursue the wholesalers?  Why is she taking the pharmacists to task?  The pharmacists do not know where they stand now.  They must stock their shelves, heat and light their premises, put in place security measures and ensure a pharmacist is available at all times to dispense the drugs for which the HSE will now pay &euro;5.  I do not understand how the Minister arrived at the figure of 8%.  She referred to a 17% margin but it is the Minister who sets the price of the drugs.  The wholesalers do not seem to come into the equation at all.  There is a 17% margin somewhere but the Minister is going to take it off the pharmacists.</P>
        <P>Let us examine the 8% the pharmacists are supposed to be getting in rebates.  The Minister referred earlier to the cost of money being in the region of 4% to 5% but I urge her to come into the real world.  Where can one get borrowed money at 4% to 5% interest?  Perhaps the HSE or local authorities can borrow money at 4% or 5% but I do not know any small business that can borrow money, on overdraft, at those rates.  If it is possible to borrow money at those rates, perhaps that is the road the Minister should go down.  She should give soft loans to pharmacists to stock their shelves with drugs and provide the services.  Certainly all of the overdraft facilities of which I am aware are in the region of 10% to 12%.</P>
        <P>The 8% rebate the pharmacists receive is not for only one element of the service they provide.  It comes as a result of investments made in the past ten to 15 years.  The system has been com<Col N="1493"/>puterised and they pay in 30 or 60 days or pay cash on demand of invoice.  This is from where their 8% comes.  Hard-pressed pharmacists are providing wonderful services throughout the country and receive twice-daily deliveries from wholesalers.  Will the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, tell us whether the HSE, will pay in 30 or 60 days or pay cash on demand of invoice?  This is something pharmacists need to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, who has at long last come before the House to discuss this issue.  A Senator from the Government benches wondered whether we are rushing under pressure or have been lobbied intensively to speak on this issue.  I was the first person to speak on this issue in the Seanad and since the resumption of the Seanad and D&aacute;il last year Sinn F&eacute;in has called on the Minister to deal with this critical issue, which has escalated in its threat to community pharmacies.  It is only now, after the cuts that have been imposed, that there are statements and questions on these matters.  A similar situation has arisen in the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which dealt with this matter in detail and met over three days to hear submissions, followed by questions and answers, from the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  The committee requested that the Minister attend these hearings before 1 March but she did not do so.  I believe the Minister shirked her responsibilities and sent a negative signal to Senators and Deputies who represent their constituencies.  She is hiding from this issue and is avoiding her accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The escalating pharmacy dispute has been a cause of concern for tens of thousands of patients.  Not only have pharmacists contacted Members of these Houses but we have also received calls from patients worried that they will not receive service if their pharmacies withdraw from the general medical service, GMS, or the drugs payment scheme.  Last week 475,000 letters were handed in to these Houses but they were allowed in at a rate of only five at a time.  The figure shows how many people believe the Minister is doing the wrong thing on this issue.</P>
        <P>This matter has caused concern for all users of our health services, whether medical card patients or those dependent on the drugs payment scheme.  I have seldom seen an issue that led to such prolonged lobbying of TDs and Senators, yet hardly featured in the media.  This is unfortunate because if this matter received the media attention it deserves it might have been resolved before now.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the most aggravating factor in this dispute has been the adherence of the Government and the HSE to the line that they cannot negotiate financial issues with the IPU, allegedly because of the Competition Act.  Many Senators spoke of the Competition Act and the <Col N="1494"/>Minister and the Government have hidden behind it without attempting to address this piece of their own legislation.  They opposed the Competition (Amendment) Bill put to the D&aacute;il by Deputy Michael D. Higgins in recent weeks and I do not believe they are sincere in their efforts to resolve this issue and negotiate with the IPU on financial matters.</P>
        <P>If the IPU withdraws from the medical card and drugs payment schemes tens of thousands of patients will be affected.  The HSE tells us that only a few pharmacies will withdraw from these schemes but this remains to be seen.  I hope no pharmacy withdraws from them and I appeal to all of them to continue their services because patients will be affected by such a withdrawal.  The IPU is to meet tomorrow and as a result pharmacies across the State will close.  The IPU is to be commended on organising an emergency service, but in Donegal four pharmacies will remain open for three hours each.  That amounts to four pharmacies in a county where it takes two hours to travel from one to the other.  In their need to avail of pharmacy services tomorrow, patients will see the long-term effects of the decision of this Minister, which will close rural pharmacies that are not viable and that depend on the medical card scheme.  In my county 80% of patients who visit pharmacies hold medical cards.</P>
        <P>The Department has received e-mails on this matter.  Some pharmacists are asking the Minister and the Department to run the numbers they are offering pharmacies, audit their accounts, and tell them whether they will stay in business under such terms.  I welcome the extension of the deadline to 1 March on the cuts imposed by the Minister but there is no point extending a deadline if nothing is to happen in the period before it is reached.  There should have been meaningful negotiations during this period, involving the independent body, to review the pricing of medicines for pharmacies.  There is no point having negotiations now if the cuts are to be imposed anyway.  I fear the decision some pharmacies will take on 21 April, the day pharmacies across the State will receive payments for drugs issued at the reduced prices.</P>
        <P>This issue is all about patients.  Across the State, in rural Ireland and particularly on the west coast, the effect of the closure of post offices can be seen.  One day in January five post offices closed in rural Ireland and I have no doubt that if the Minister continues with this scheme we will see the same type of effects.  They were not evident on 1 March and will not be evident on 21 April but will happen drip by drip.  This is not good for patient care, services or rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>The IPU uses its figures to claim that more than 300 rural pharmacies will be the worst affected.  Age Action Ireland is very concerned about this matter because older people in areas with no public transport will be forced to travel long distances for medication.</P><Col N="1495"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to enter meaningful negotiations with the IPU on all of the issues involved in this matter, including pricing.  The president of the IPU called on all pharmacies to maintain services and this shows real leadership while some pharmacies are threatened with going out of business.  I ask the Minister to meet pharmacists&rsquo; representatives, enter meaningful negotiations, defer the cuts introduced in March and allow the independent body to review the pricing mechanisms in order that she can deal with this in a more considered way.</P>
        <P>The Minister has tackled this issue in a ham-fisted way.  There was an iron lady in Britain in the 1980s and there is no desire to replicate her in this country.  I ask the Minister to take a more compassionate, considered approach to this matter.  The media have not picked up on this story, unfortunately, because it is complex and while the HSE says one thing the Department says another and the pharmacies another.  Everything is revolving around notions such as the 17% and the 8% and the overall cost of medication.</P>
        <P>My young son is on medication that costs &euro;40 at the local pharmacy.  A couple of miles across the Border, in Derry, the same medication costs &euro;5?  Who is responsible for this?  This is not a 17% increase but is a result of prices set by the Department of Health and Children and manufacturers.  I welcome that we are examining savings that can be made in the health service and are seeking to reduce the cost of medication to the general public.  However, I ask the Minister to accept audited accounts from pharmacies and to run the figures on what they are being offered.  Will she come back to the House and confirm, on the basis of those audited accounts, that those pharmacies will remain in existence?  If not, will she confirm that her decision and that of the Government will result in the closure of rural pharmacies and that she stands over that?</P>

	<P>I am very happy to be here to respond to the debate.  I wish to correct the record, I have spoken on this issue in this House on two occasions since last summer.  This is not the first time I have come to address the issue relating to pharmaceutical pricing and my view has not changed in the intervening period. </P>
        <P>There is no change in the contract between pharmacists and the Health Service Executive.  Pharmacists have a contract with the Health Service Executive which provides for the payment of a dispensing fee of &euro;3.26 for items on the <Col N="1496"/>GMS and for a mark-up of 50% and a dispensing fee of &euro;2.60 for the DPS.  That is the contract and it has not been broken.  In 2005 pharmacists, by way of fees, got &euro;293 million; in 2006 they got &euro;321 million; in 2007 they got &euro;367 million.  That figure is not being altered.  I remind Senator Doherty that these payments amount to, on average, &euro;100,000 more than is paid to pharmacists in Northern Ireland.  I accept there are caveats when comparing different jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The Government does not have an agreement with the pharmaceutical sector in Ireland.  Ireland is now part of a basket of nine countries where we pay the average price.  Unfortunately, with pharmaceutical products, the normal market does not apply because in most instances there are monopoly suppliers of various drugs.  One does not have the option of putting an advertisement in the newspaper for different companies to supply drugs across the whole range of medicines that are required in the health service.  Therefore, Ireland, like all other Governments, negotiates with the producers of those goods.  We have negotiated, from a position where we were part of a basket of five countries &mdash; the most expensive five in Europe &mdash; to a position where we are now part of a basket of nine countries and we will pay the average price in that basket.  That basket includes countries such as Spain where drugs are substantially cheaper than in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As a result of this decision to reduce the distribution cost I was asked why we do not take it from the wholesalers.  We do not have a contract with the wholesalers.  There has never been a contract between the State and the wholesalers.  When the HSE and the Department negotiated in good faith with the wholesalers they produced the legal advice.  They were the first to do so.  I reiterate what I said here, we have a virtual market.  Some 400 pharmacies own UniPhar, one of the big wholesalers, a further 150 pharmacies have been financed by a financial wing known as IPOS.  Cahill May Roberts is the owner of Unicare, which has 72 pharmacies and United Drug has put &euro;300 million into pharmacies.  Given that, perhaps, between 700 and 900 pharmacies are owned by the wholesalers.  We do not have a separation in the way many of the Senators tried to portray.</P>
        <P>In 2002 when my predecessor, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, removed the restriction which essentially provided that a pharmacy could not be opened within a certain short mileage of another pharmacy &mdash; it prevented many places in the country from having pharmacies &mdash; I could embarrass some Members here by telling them what their party said.  Some said it would bring to an end the pharmacy in the rural Ireland, they would not be viable, they would not be economic and so on.  He was heavily criticised in this House by the then Opposition and in the other House.  We know that since then there has been an increase of 26% in the number of pharmacies.</P><Col N="1497"/>
        <P>I am usually attacked here and elsewhere for supporting the private sector.  The party opposite accuses me of Americanising the health service and supporting private companies.  This is private enterprise.  The pharmacists are health care professionals who have invested in private businesses.  Nobody more than me wants to see people getting a decent return on risk taking, innovation and making their business work.  That is the reason why in the 2005 Bill, when we published our proposals, which was only passed in 2007, we facilitated liberalisation here ahead of many other European countries.  It used to break my heart to meet Irish pharmacists who qualified abroad, due to the restrictions on trying to become a pharmacist here because there was only one school, and who could not open a pharmacy.  Nobody more than me wants to facilitate the development of pharmacy.</P>
        <P>In the legislation passed we have provided for the regulation for the first time in Ireland of corporate entities, heretofore it was just pharmacists who were regulated.  We have also provided in respect of conflict of interests between those who prescribe and those who dispense because a huge concern was expressed by pharmacists, which I shared, to the effect that groups of doctors were coming together, one person would be asked for a huge amount for key money and it would be very hard for other pharmacists to compete in the environs where the patients come from the doctor and they have their prescription.  We have provided very strong provisions in the new pharmacy legislation to prevent that occurring and to eliminate those conflicts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not need any lectures here about supporting the pharmacists and the pharmacy profession.  We have to get value for money.  We have to get better value for money, for the patients and for the taxpayers.  Some 70% of the bills are paid for by taxpayers and we are entitled to ensure we get the best possible value.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Dorgan group &mdash; I regret very much what Senator Ross said about the individuals &mdash; these are highly skilled professional people whose professional reputations matter to them.  They are people whom I know individually, personally and professionally.  I know them to be people of the highest integrity.  In regard to their appointment, I discussed it only with one of my advisers and with the Secretary General of my Department when I was seeking to put a group of what I regarded as fair-minded competent citizens together to look at this issue.</P>
        <P>The pharmacy profession, through its union or through whatever other source, can make the case as strongly as it wishes to that group of people.  There are no restrictions in terms of sums of money that I have placed on that group, except that we want them to come forward with a recommendation for a flat fee for the interim contract.  We have not broken the contract.  This will simply be an interim flat fee that we will pay to those who opt for that.  I decided to take this course of <Col N="1498"/>action because the IPU was of the view &mdash; it made that point strongly to me when I met it &mdash; that the mechanism for devising the &euro;5 flat fee was not an independent mechanism and, perhaps, if it was it may be more acceptable.  I understand that.  That is the reason it is important to have the independent group.  Furthermore, we have said that when it makes its recommendations by the end of May we will backdate, subject to Government approval, whatever it recommends to 1 March.  That is very reasonable.</P>
        <P>It is the future I am concerned about and we all need to focus on it.  I hope we can enter into negotiations with the IPU for a new contract for the community pharmacist.  Clearly, we cannot set the prices in that context.  We must have a different independent group to set the price but there is no point establishing such a group until we know what we are asking it to price.  In particular, I want to see the role of the pharmacist more involved in primary care, in chronic illness management and dealing with many of the issues involving waste which many Members have mentioned.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris mentioned the training places for those who are currently studying pharmacy at Trinity College.  This is an issue I have discussed with the pharmaceutical society and the regulatory body during the past fortnight.  I hope we will be able to address the perceived difficulty that exists which, in fairness, may be a real one.  We do not want to train and educate potential pharmacists without giving them the opportunity to complete their training with a view to establishing themselves as pharmacists, hopefully in the Irish health care system.  I hope that issue can be resolved.</P>
        <P>In regard to the contingency arrangements and the phone line, I understand there have been approximately 300 calls, most of which came before last week, although the line is still available.  The patients have all been reassured.  Contingency plans will be put in place and I accept what many Senators said.  I commend the comments of the president of the IPU and others.  I know these situations are difficult for all organisations but I commend the comments made and the fact that, to date, patients have not been used in this conflict between the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and Children and the pharmacy profession.  I hope that continues to be the case.  I am more than happy to take specific questions from any of the Members.</P>
        <P>I understand the HSE pays 14 working days after the bills are submitted.  With regard to pricing, invoices and so on, I am not a party to how the wholesalers deal with invoices between them and pharmacists &mdash; that is a matter for them.  What I am certain of is that no pharmacist will be asked to pay more for a product than he or she will be reimbursed by the HSE.  Nobody would expect anyone to do business with them if they were to charge them more than they were to be reimbursed.  I do not buy that.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for her response.

What effort is she prepared to make to resolve this dispute and try to get to a stage where the mechanism she has set up is accepted by all?  The Minister in her reply did not deal with the issue of rural pharmacies closing or the problems facing new entrants and young pharmacists who have said they will not be able to continue and have provided the costings.  Does she believe pharmacies will close?  Does she believe what has been said with regard to young pharmacists and rural pharmacists?  What does she intend to do about this?</P>

On a specific matter, will the Minister accept from myself or any other Senator audited accounts from pharmacists?  Will she run the numbers with regard to the interim offer she, the Department and the Government are willing to offer the pharmacists?  Will she inform the House whether pharmacies will close due to what the Department is offering?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The independent body has been asked to report by the end of May.  While I have not spoken to the individuals involved, I understand they intend to meet that timeframe and have already had a number of meetings.  In fact, I saw an advertisement in the newspapers yesterday inviting submissions.  Their intention is to talk to and engage with the various stakeholders and obviously to commission independent support and economic expertise to help them in their work.</P>
        <P>I am not prepared to change the terms of reference.  Senator Fitzgerald is asking me to have mark-ups and discounts.  What we are talking about here is a temporary contract.  We want to pay a fee for the expertise which the pharmacist brings to the health care system, namely, the dispensing of medication.  It is not desirable that we continue with a situation where we have roughly double the distribution margin that applies across the European Union, including Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>We will never get to the desired situation if we are taking money out of the system.  Notwithstanding these savings, the cost of drugs this year will be substantially higher than last year.  I presented the Department&rsquo;s strategy for 2008-10 <Col N="1500"/>to the Cabinet today and I commented on the fact that in recent years the number of items dispensed through the GMS has increased from 20 million to 41 million per year, even though the growth in medical cards was approximately 5% in the same period.  That is the reality of modern medicine and will continue to be the case.  I will not be back here next year with the drugs bill reduced by &euro;100 million; it will still be rising rapidly.  What we are trying to do is to halt the increase and take out moneys that are surplus to what we believe is necessary to have a vibrant, functioning market.</P>
        <P>On the issue of rural pharmacies, the same claims that this would spell the end of the pharmacy in rural Ireland were made in 2002 when the restrictions were removed by the then Minister, Deputy Martin.  At that time, one had to be a certain geographic distance from a current pharmacy before one could open a new one.  It did not have that effect.  I genuinely believe that those pharmacies with low volumes of dispensing and those heavily dependent on medical card and GMS patients will do substantially better with the higher dispensing fee of at least &euro;5 &mdash; it may well be substantially higher following the work of the Dorgan group.</P>
        <P>Vibrant markets always attract new entrants &mdash; I made this point in the other House last week and I made the same point to solicitors when PIAB was being introduced.  In any developed, well-off society like ours, professionals always do well &mdash; that is a fact.  Whether we are talking about health care professionals, accountants, engineers or lawyers, professionals do well in well-developed countries, and this is a very well-developed and prosperous country where huge opportunities will exist.</P>
        <P>With regard to overheads, I am not an expert on how to run any business and I will not get into the situation of auditing anybody&rsquo;s accounts.  I understand that last year a pharmacy on Grafton Street, one of two owned by Hickeys, closed down despite being on one of the busiest streets in the country.</P>

We can pride ourselves that even in relatively small places we have successful pharmacies and general practitioners, which is not the norm in some other countries.  This will continue to be the case and is a policy position I want to see implemented.  I <Col N="1501"/>want to have a vibrant community pharmacy sector throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House.  While I mean nothing against the Minister of State, who is a nice gentleman, we have yet to have the Minister for Education and Science in the Chamber for an Adjournment debate.  It is unfair on a Minister of State from a different Department to answer on the Adjournment.  I thank the Cathaoirleach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.  However, it is disingenuous of the Minister not to come to the House and to have had no Minister of State from her Department present for any Adjournment debate matter I have raised on education.  This is a serious matter I am raising on behalf of the people of Passage West.</P>
        <P>I want to read into the record of the House an e-mail I received from a student of the school, Shauna Williams, who wrote to the Minister for Education and Science, as it will give the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, a greater appreciation of the issue before us.  The e-mail stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Minister Hanafin,</P>
        <P LI="1">I am a fifth class student at Star of the Sea Primary School, Passage West, Co. Cork.  Our class is in the Assembly Hall because we do not have a classroom.  We were told we would be moved into a portacabin classroom in the teachers car park within two months of the start of the school year.  We are still waiting for it.  There are 27 children in our class.  It is hard to hear our teacher because the hall is too big for one class.  Miss Caplis my teacher has already lost her voice three times because she has to shout so that everybody can hear her.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In the PE cupboard there was a rat and there are probably some more in there.  Classes also can not have proper drama which my parents pay a lot for because we are in the hall.  Our school has no fire alarm the alarm is only a bell that is either rung by a student or a teacher.  The upper floor has no fire escape.  The toilets <Col N="1502"/>are horrible as well.  There is a horrible musky, old, rotting smell the minute you walk in there.  This is why I do not go to the toilet from 8:10 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.  It is also very cold in the toilets.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">We cannot even be a green school because of the rat problem.  We started recycling but had to stop as rats were eating the waste.  The prefab buildings are also falling apart.  The floor had a hole in it and the roof has fallen in endless times.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Why did Rochestown get their school in two years and we have been waiting for ten years?  When Star of the Sea, like I have just told you needs a new school urgently.  I have just heard that we will NOT be getting a new school.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I do not understand why you are not allowing the grant for our new school.  But just imagine when the new houses quite close by are filled with children.  Where will they go?  Monkstown is already full and Star of the Sea just cannot take any more.  We have already two fourth classes, two second classes.  The third class and half of the fourth are in the same classroom, being taught by the same teacher at the same time.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I would be personally happy if you would come and see the conditions I am taught in.</P>
        <P LI="1">Do send a reply, and my kind regards,</P>
        <P LI="1">Shauna Williams.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a wonderful letter which encapsulates the disgraceful situation which Shauna and her classmates have had to endure.  The school was sanctioned by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, in 1999.  Two schools were amalgamated, namely Scoil Cholmcille and St. Mary&rsquo;s, and now we have no adequate school in the area.  The parents&rsquo; association, the board of management, the principal and teachers are all upset.</P>
        <P>I could give the Minister a litany of reasons the school should be built, including population growth, as the census of population showed a 13% increase in the past six years.  I visited the school yesterday, along with members of Cork County Council.  The conditions are cramped and the school is in need of a complete overhaul.  The students and the teachers deserve a new school.</P>
        <P>During my visit I was told by a person that platitudes are all they receive from Government.  We are at the point of no return.  The pupils, staff and parents of the Star of the Sea primary school, Passage West, deserve a new school.  We have a defect and a remedy is available.  All that is required is the progression to the construction phase.  I will ask a brief supplementary question following the reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for giving me the <Col N="1503"/>opportunity to respond to this matter on the Star of the Sea primary school, Passage West, County Cork.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister who is unavoidably absent.</P>
        <P>Under the national development plan &euro;4.5 billion was assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  Approximately &euro;600 million will be spent this year on school buildings.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  I accept I am speaking in the macro sense while Senator Buttimer and all those concerned about the Star of the Sea primary school want me to refer to the school itself and where it stands in terms of the proposed new school.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer is aware the school has a staffing complement consisting of a principal and 11 mainstream teachers, together with three special education teachers and two temporary language support teachers.  He is also aware the proposed building project will comprise a new 16 classroom generic repeat design, GRD, school, including a general purpose hall and ancillary accommodation on a greenfield site, and that the process of appointing a design team to the school building project is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>A number of stages are involved in the process.  This is the first one after the decision in principle is taken.  I am aware of what was said in 1999 regarding the amalgamation of Scoil Choilmcille and St. Mary&rsquo;s.  The school is at an advanced stage and is awaiting the appointment of a design team.  I assure the Senator that the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and her Department are fully committed to providing suitable high-quality accommodation for the school at the earliest possible date.  The Minister will respond to the contents of the email which Senator Buttimer read into the record of the House.  He can inform the pupil and all those involved with the school that the appointment of a design team for the project is at an advanced stage.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for the reply.  I accept it is not his Department nor his brief.  In fairness to him, he has the unenviable job of giving the reply in the House, but it does not tell us when, where or how the school will be progressed.  I urge the Minister of State to impress on the Department of Education and Science that we need information urgently.</P>
        <P>The reply I received is unsatisfactory.  I do not blame the Minister of State.  In general, the replies we get to Adjournment matters leave much to be desired.  I hope the Minister of State will go back to the Department of Education and Science and ask that we would get real replies to <Col N="1504"/>queries we raise regarding school building programmes.

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.  He indicated the Minister is unavoidably absent but there are at least three if not four Ministers of State in the Department of Education and Science.  While I have no problem with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, being here, it is disappointing on a night when both Adjournment matters relate to education that none of the Ministers of State from the Department of Education and Science can be here.  That is surprising and disappointing and it is not the most suitable arrangement given the matters raised, but that is a matter that will have to be taken up in a different forum.</P>
        <P>I rise to bring up another educational issue.  This is another example of where a Department has let down a community, similar to the case outlined by Senator Buttimer.  The issue I raise relates to secondary education in the town of New Ross and the surrounding hinterland of Wexford, Kilkenny and south County Carlow.  I attended secondary school in New Ross, along with my four siblings, as do many people on the Kilkenny side of the bridge that joins Wexford and Kilkenny.  There are five secondary schools in New Ross.  When I left Good Counsel College in 1997 the process of discussion on amalgamation and consolidation for the future was already under way.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report was published five years ago and it outlined a blueprint for the future of second level education in the town of New Ross.  However, that report has not been acted upon.  The recommendations of the report were clear, namely, that there would be three secondary schools, one all-boys, one all-girls and one co-educational.  Since the publication of the report there was a massive explosion in the population of the town of New Ross, as has happened in many areas across the country.</P>
        <P>I read recently a surprising statistic in a national newspaper, that outside of the city of Dublin the district electoral division with the highest proportion of immigrants in the country is Rosbercon urban.  This area is on the Kilkenny side of the bridge from New Ross and one of the existing secondary schools is located here.  A significant case can be made for the provision of four schools as a possible solution to future needs in this area.</P>
        <P>Despite the recommendations of the report and various meetings of school trustees in that five year period, not one iota of progress has been made.  What is most disappointing is that as a result of the McCarthy report and the push by the Department of Education and Science to force the hand of the trustees and the schools in <Col N="1505"/>question to amalgamate, there has been a complete freeze on capital investment in the secondary schools in New Ross which is leading to a very unsatisfactory situation within those schools.  Basic maintenance work has not been carried out because the schools are not funded by the Department.</P>
        <P>Good Counsel College is only 20 years old but a problem recently developed in the art room where part of the floor collapsed.  The Augustinians who still run the school had to pay for patching the floor out of their household fund.  That is disgraceful.  Something has to be done.  I plead with the Department and the Minister for Education and Science in this regard.  There are more than 2,000 second level students in New Ross, a large number in a town of approximately 7,000 or 8,000 people.  A large hinterland surrounds the town.  There are more than 2,100 students in second level education in the town of New Ross and these people are being disenfranchised and neglected because their school facilities have not been upgraded in the past five years.  They are being placed at a severe disadvantage through no fault of their own by the efforts of the Department to bully the schools into amalgamation.</P>
        <P>Everybody in the town and its schools accepts changes must be made and there is a strong case for amalgamation.  Therefore let us make some progress on it.  Second level education in New Ross and its hinterland has had five years of stagnation and limbo.  I seek leadership from the Department on this issue.  It cannot be allowed to drag on any longer.  Students have entered and left second level education under this cloud of the McCarthy report and the lack of capital investment in the schools&rsquo; infrastructure in New Ross and that is not satisfactory.  I urge the Department to resolve that situation as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator John Paul Phelan for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on second level education infrastructure in New Ross town.  I do so on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  There are five post primary schools in New Ross.  Applications for major capital investment from each of the schools, against a backdrop of declining enrolments, prompted a review of infrastructural provision in the area which was extended to include its primary schools.  In view of the scale of the review being carried out, Dr. Tom McCarthy was appointed as a facilitator to consult with the local providers and to identify the key issues in primary and post primary provision in the area.</P>
        <P>In his report Dr. McCarthy recommended a reduction at post primary level to three schools each catering for 720 pupils, which would provide accommodation and facilities for the 2,100 pupils to which Senator Phelan referred.  The schools were to comprise one single sex girls&rsquo; school, one <Col N="1506"/>single sex boys&rsquo; school and one co-educational school.  Subsequently the school planning section of the Department prepared a discussion paper for the trustees of both the primary and post primary schools to progress the matter further.  Given the intervening period since Dr. McCarthy&rsquo;s report and the change in demographics etc., the purpose of the paper was to put forward for discussion the Department&rsquo;s view on how best the primary and post primary educational infrastructural needs of New Ross could be met into the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The paper recommended the five post primary schools should be rationalised to provide three schools each catering for 500 mainstream pupils.  It also recommended the VEC should continue to cater for PLC and VTOS students and its accommodation should be augmented to cater for enrolment on approved Department courses.  It further recommended enrolment policies should be put in place by all schools to ensure pupils from the catchment area are given preference and that this should be a condition of capital investment.  Discussions are ongoing among the trustees on these findings.</P>
        <P>Senator Phelan will appreciate this is a complex matter for the schools concerned given the structure of the individual schools and the fact that the town falls into two different parishes in two different dioceses and two different county council areas of functionality.  When the trustees have completed their discussions and the Department is made aware of the outcome, consideration will be given to capital investment in the area under the school building and modernisation programme.  Rationalisation projects attract a band one rating under my Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  This is the highest priority rating possible.  I have heard the Senator&rsquo;s argument and will bring the strongly held views he enunciated here this evening to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gallagher gave as good an answer as he could.  In the early part of his answer he referred to three schools catering for 720 pupils each and in the second part he said the school planning section&rsquo;s discussion paper recommended three schools catering for 500 each.  At the beginning of his reply the Minister of State referred to declining enrolments.  There has been a large increase in enrolments in the past few years in New Ross.  Despite the fact that it seems the school planning section is talking about declining enrolments, that is not the case.  Enrolments have grown in recent years.  The catchment area of New Ross extends to three parishes, diocese and county council areas.  I think there is a tiny piece of south county Carlow around St. Mullins.  I stand to be corrected on that.</P><Col N="1507"/>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the ongoing discussion between the trustees, but that has been ongoing for five years.  While he cannot solve it here tonight, it must be brought to a head because there are significant problems in the secondary schools.  The buildings need investment or they will become dilapidated.  I ask the Department to get involved in bringing it to a positive resolution for the students.  This has dragged on <Col N="1508"/>since the McCarthy report five years ago.  That must be unsatisfactory to all concerned.  I would welcome it if Deputy Gallagher could bring my concerns on this issue to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science.  New Ross has been badly neglected on this issue.</P>
