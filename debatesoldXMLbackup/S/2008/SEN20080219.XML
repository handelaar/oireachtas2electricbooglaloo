	<P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to hasten the process for Irish citizens to adopt children from overseas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to simplify the application process for new housing grant schemes in order to make it easier for the disabled and elderly to avail of the schemes; and if he will reconsider his decision to terminate the HSE special housing aid for the elderly scheme which is due to cease on 31 March 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Ciaran Cannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on the provision of a new community school in Glenamaddy, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Ellis of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the position with regard to the provision of a community hospital-primary care centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Shane Ross, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Ciaran Cannon and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ellis may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
        <P>Before calling the Leader on the Order of Business and in view of the recent media coverage of <Col N="902"/>a proposal to relocate Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I wish to clarify the matter for Members and explain the background to the reports.  Arising from a full technical analysis of the structural integrity of the original Leinster House building by the Office of Public Works, it was discovered that there are many structural failures that need immediate attention, both from an operational and heritage point of view.  The Office of Public Works and its consultants have recommended to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission that the problem be addressed by a scheme of works commencing in July 2008 and concluding in September 2009, which has the implication of a full vacation of the accommodation currently being utilised by Seanad &Eacute;ireann within the original Leinster House building.</P>
        <P>That proposal was discussed at a meeting of the commission last Thursday and subsequently gave rise to media reports.  The Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges met this morning and is in adjournment to allow the Office of Public Works to investigate fully all possible options for any such relocation, together with feasibility studies.  The matter rests there and the committee will report back to the House when it has fully considered all options put forward and is in a position to make a recommendation.  Until then, I request Members to leave the matter within the remit of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, where the matter will be fully considered.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re custodial sentences, back from committee without debate, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, motion re Disease of Animals (Amendment) Act 2001, referral to committee without debate, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 3, Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and on which Senators may share time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Some weeks ago I raised the case of a young woman with curvature of the spine who needed immediate attention.  The Leader took up this case as well and the National Treatment Purchase Fund changed some of its rules to accommodate this young woman and to ensure she received the necessary treatment.  One must welcome that and I hope the outcome in that case will be good.</P>
        <P>Today I want to raise another question on the public health service, namely a situation that has arisen in Beaumont Hospital.  Some of the Senators will have read the lead letter in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> where a local general practitioner writes that he is horrified that the <Col N="903"/>staff at Beaumont Hospital must hold a fund-raising golf classic and write to local general practitioners asking for a contribution of &euro;100 to buy a basic piece of ultrasound equipment costing &euro;24,000.  It is extraordinary when we hear about the money being pumped into the health service &mdash; we have had the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in this House on a number of occasions speaking about it &mdash; that it does not seem to be reaching the right places.  Why must the staff of Beaumont Hospital and the local general practitioners fund-raise to get a basic piece of equipment which they need for the accident and emergency department?  Given the millions of euro being poured into the health service, it seems extraordinary.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister, to ask for action on it and to see where is the barrier that has meant that Beaumont Hospital does not have the funding for this basic piece of necessary emergency equipment.</P>
        <P>It seems that the bureaucracy is taking over.  We have spoken at length about much of the money that has been invested in the health service being focused in the wrong place.  It is disgraceful that patients coming into the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital do not have access to this equipment and that the medics do not have access to it to use it for people who really need it.  It is a sad indictment of the present state of the health service that such a situation has arisen.</P>
        <P>I want to mention the U-turn by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, on the privatisation of bus services.  We thought he had done all his U-turns for the year, but now there is another one.  Many people in Dublin will attest to the fact that there are not enough buses, people are left waiting all the time and the service leaves much to be desired.  One of the ways of dealing with this is to privatise certain routes and give the option to private operators to provide this service.  That now seems to have been taken away by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Leader could get the Minister to address this issue in the House.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, threatened to resign the last time this was on the agenda when it was stated that the Government was changing from this agreement.  Perhaps the Leader would clarify if she intends to resign on this occasion because of this changed decision.  As I stated, it is yet another U-turn and it is the commuters of Dublin who will suffer if we do not have better bus services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the Leader, I propose a minor amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 14, Credit Union Savings Protection Bill 2008 &mdash; First Stage and No. 15, Mental Capacity and Guardianship Bill 2008 <Col N="904"/>&mdash; First Stage, which lapsed with the election, be taken today.</P>
        <P>We will have a long debate on Thursday on the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  I have been a great critic of the Minister for Education and Science with regard to the lack of movement on that issue and the fact it has not been commenced and moneys have not been provided.  I have also been a constant critic with regard to the lack of support for special education.  However, I would like to clarify one thing.  Fair is fair and of all the Ministers for Education and Science we have had over the past 20 years, no other Minister has put more into autism than the current Minister.  It is not enough and I have disagreed with her, but in terms of the current row, she has done more than any Minister of the past 20 years on autism.  I remember trying to convince Ministers 20 years ago that there was such a condition as autism.  One might find that hard to believe, but there was a time when the Department would argue that it was a social and emotional need and not a specific condition.</P>
        <P>In the past two months a number of people have raised the question of the Law Society and how it deals with its members.  Since we last met, two further members of the Law Society have been dealt with, which amounts to six or eight in the last couple of months.  I do not know what is going on in the Law Society, but it seems it only supervises, investigates, takes action or visits members when there is a complaint against them.  If there is to be self regulation, it must be proactive.  I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to explain to us what it means to be a member of the Law Society, what is required of the society and its membership and how it ensures its members are acting properly within its rules.  Is the society proactive or reactive?</P>
        <P>I remind the Leader that I raised a matter with him and received a positive response a month or so ago.  Senators Paul Coghlan, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Pearse Doherty raised the same matter, namely, the question of Valentia and Malin coastguard stations.  This is a serious local issue and we should have a discussion on it as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady on raising a very interesting and timely debate which ought to be held in this House and more widely about the balance that should be struck between what he described as individual wealth and adequate public provision of public services.  He also pointed to the question of the primacy of the market and the fact that the market cannot, despite what some people think, solve all our problems.  We should debate these interesting issues in this House.</P>
<Col N="905"/>
        <P>We should include in that debate consideration of whether there is a need to increase taxes in circumstances where we have a vision for adequate, better and first class public services.  The notion of considering this should not be shunned.  We should not avoid the necessity to debate the question of taxation and an equitable taxation system in circumstances where there are so many legitimate demands, whether with regard to autism, the education sector, child care or otherwise.  We have had 20 years where it has been almost impossible for any voices to be raised on the question of the adequacy of our tax take.</P>
        <P>I am a member of a party that, before the election with other parties, advocated tax cuts.  However, the time has come for us to debate the question of whether we need to look at the fairness of the tax system.  We also need to look at the level of the tax take in circumstances where we have a vision for a better society, public services and universal child care.  Many of us believe we should look to a more universal system of child care.  We had a debate on the subvention scheme in that regard some months ago.  Subvention only patches up and deals with one element of what ought to be a first class child care system along the lines of what is available to parents in other European countries, countries that are described as our competitors.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Cardinal on raising these issues and invite the Leader to consider whether it would be possible for us to have a wide-ranging debate on this question in the House at a convenient time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator White.</P>
        <P>We should also take the opportunity to welcome the fact that the commission on taxation has now been established.  It is the first such commission to be established for over two decades.  As a House of the Oireachtas, we should, in general terms, allow it to get on with its work.  It is due to report in September 2009.  We will have peripheral debates on budgets, the Finance Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and so on, which will deal with exactly those issues Senator Alex White has raised.  However, we should look forward to an overall review of the taxation system, its intent and effectiveness, once the commission issues its report.  Following that, we can have such a debate in this House.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to agree to a debate on the decision of RTE to discontinue its services on the medium wave band.  I do not know about other Senators, but I have received a number of representations about the effect of that decision.  Many Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom, for example, are now deprived of access to RTE services on medium wave and long wave.  We must take into account that while radio stations are available on the Internet, a significant number <Col N="906"/>of people do not have access to that technology.  It would be a good use of our time to debate the decision by RTE and seek to influence it in some way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to draw the House&rsquo;s attention to the plight of the former employees of Gentex, a factory in Athlone which closed in the mid 1980s, causing severe financial hardship for a number of families.  It appears that New Ireland Assurance was attempting to wrap up a pension plan when it discovered that all payments had not been made.  New Ireland Assurance informed Mercer, which is the trustee of the Gentex pension plan, that the payments were outstanding.  How, more than 20 years after the closure of Gentex, can payments be still outstanding to beneficiaries?  Some of those beneficiaries have since passed away and it now falls to their families to try to sort out their entitlements.  I understand 140 people could be affected by this situation.  </P>
        <P>I am aware that the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority have been contacted about this issue.  It raises the question as to how many other pension plans have been left hanging in mid air.  Who is the watchdog for this area? I ask the Leader to clarify this and explain how all of the beneficiaries will be contacted.  I believe the trustees have a duty of care to these people and should place advertisements in national and local newspapers informing them of their entitlements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the statement made at the weekend by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, indicating its overwhelming support for the Lisbon treaty.  The IFA also declared its support for the treaty.  Two major organisations, coming from different angles, have urged people to vote yes in the forthcoming referendum.  This House should take a leadership role and have a debate on the referendum.  We should discuss why people should vote yes and put forward the reasons, very cogently, from both an economic and consumer point of view.  In 1996, for example, we exported &euro;56 billion in goods and service to the other EU member states, compared to ten years previously, when the figure was only &euro;36 billion.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate as soon as possible on the Lisbon treaty.  We should take leadership on this issue and there is no better forum than Seanad &Eacute;ireann to extol the virtues of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a track record in this House of raising the issue of workers&rsquo; rights and do so again today.  Last week I called on the Government to name and shame those who tried to pay people less than the minimum wage.  Unfortunately today I must name and shame the <Col N="907"/>Government itself, as Ireland is one of only four countries that is refusing to put in place the EU agency worker directive.  I condemn this because we are at a stage where there are at least 520 agency organisations for a population of 4.2 million.  In many cases, agency workers are being exploited because their pay, conditions, working terms, etc. are not the same as those of other workers.  This situation is growing across sectors.  Previously, it was in secretarial areas and is now in the construction sector and elsewhere.  Many workers are being discriminated against and exploited.  It is time the matter was investigated.  As the four countries in question, of which Ireland is one, have a net migrant intake, there must be a common thread.</P>
        <P>I condemn the absurd comments of Councillor Jimmy Mulroy in respect of migrant workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not refer to a person who is not a Member of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only will we be bringing workers into this country and, according to Fianna F&aacute;il, asking them to accept different pay, they will get into their cars and be asked to pay different fines if they get caught for speeding or to drive at different speeds, according to the Leader.  It is absurd.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everyone in the House will respect an important issue, namely, the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley report has not been published and will be delayed for another month.  We need the report to be published.  Ms Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley lives beside me in County Tipperary and I consider her a friend.  She is concerned that there will be a further delay.  People are entitled to their constitutional rights and there may be some legal issues, but there is a point at which the report must be published and its recommendations implemented lest other women suffer similarly, which is not right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>As a matter of urgency, could the Leader arrange for the appropriate Minister to attend the House for a debate on the image of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in particular on how to improve it?  As I am sure we are all aware at this point, the image of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is low in the minds of most people in terms of its usefulness and the role it plays.  It is not an extreme statement to make that our public relations are abominable.  We did not cover ourselves in glory in this regard in recent weeks.  While many of us welcomed that some Members of the House might seek to go to the Phoenix Park to work, it would have been good manners and courtesy at least to consult the rest of us before being consigned to &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo;.  A Minister of State announced that we would go there.  Is it any won<Col N="908"/>der that the public&rsquo;s perception is what it is if, as Members of the Oireachtas and this House, we are treated with that level of disdain and contempt?  As someone in his sixth year as a Member of this House, I have had enough of the perception through the media of the uselessness of the House.  Were the public truly informed of the level of debate and scrutiny of legislation that occurs in the House, it would have much more confidence in the political system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, did the Cathaoirleach not ask us at the beginning to refrain from making comments on this matter because it would be dealt with in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  Perhaps Senator MacSharry did not hear the request, but those were the initial remarks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked all Members to co-operate in that regard.  I would ask the Senator again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify my position, I was speaking on the Order of Business and asking for a debate on the image of Seanad &Eacute;ireann as a matter of urgency.  It was coincidental but opportune that the Cathaoirleach made his comments, which I welcome.  We cannot criticise aimlessly the media coverage of the House and its workings.  We must deal with the situation ourselves as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder whether Senator MacSharry was a little harsh, but he may have been well intentioned.  I agree with the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s remarks and will abide by them.</P>
        <P>I second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s slight amendment to the Order of Business regarding the inclusion of Nos. 14 and 15.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention the issue of Valentia Island and Malin Head.  Valentia is the oldest Coast Guard station in the country and it has given a tremendous service to the State over the years.  The highly skilled staff there has a great record in dealing with serious marine incidents and what is being mooted flies in the face of Government decentralisation policy.  The suggested relocation is not needed; if anything is needed it is new equipment.  There are no arguments relevant to this matter in respect of ESB supply, broadband or cost-effectiveness as Mr. Tadhg O&rsquo;Donoghue, the former chairman of the ESB, demolished such arguments.</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, received a report on this from Deloitte &amp; Touche and sought an upgrade, a policy which I agreed.  I wish to plead with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, through the Leader to get this issue right as the proposed changes are not necessary.  There is a highly skilled workforce in place with the necessary <Col N="909"/>infrastructure, there is a record of excellent service and the proposed changes are lunacy.  I will not go as far as some of my colleagues in Kerry, who yesterday referred to the matter as bureaucratic thuggery, but this lunacy must cease.  I plead with the Minister for Transport, through the Leader, to get this back on track.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse and echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, and will say no more on the matter as I have raised it before in the House.  It is ludicrous that the likes of Valentia and Malin Coast Guard stations will be closed purely for the purpose of centralisation.  If it not broken, do not fix it.  Having these stations where they are gives confidence to coastal communities and fishermen and moving them would be madness.  I will not plough old ground because these points have been made cogently by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Coghlan.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the area of fisheries.  The talks on pay are approaching and for years farmers have had an input in such negotiations.  This has worked well and I feel fishermen should also have a say, and I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister concerned.  Fishermen have been neglected for too long and should be included in these talks.  A recent programme on RTE related the tragic events on our coastline of just over a year ago that saw the loss of seven lives.</P>
        <P>Still on the area of fisheries and community support, I got caught in the net of the Fisheries Bill 2006 and this caused me some damage.  The Bill should be revisited because a commitment was given in the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that after a year or two matters would be re-examined, particularly the area of administrative fines.  Irish fishermen are being treated with severe criminal sanctions and, in this regard, we are the exception in Europe.  I fought this matter tooth and nail in the other House and feel it should be revisited given what is happening in the rest of Europe.  Why should we, with a weakened, declining fishing community, be the exception?</P>
        <P>The Leader of the Opposition raised the issue of the ultrasound machine in Beaumont Hospital and I see her point but I have a slightly different view.  A few years ago I shaved my head and beard to raise &euro;10,000 for a CT scanner for Bantry Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was very restrained to only shave his head and beard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>One might ask why such fundraising is necessary but it put a spotlight on a remote hospital that is hugely important to me.  It forced the Health Service Executive, HSE, <Col N="910"/>and the Minister for Health and Children, who subsequently had to visit the hospital to launch the CT scanner, to examine the importance of such hospitals in Ireland, including areas like Letterkenny.  Approximately &euro;250,000 was raised for the machine in Bantry and the community got behind the drive for a CT scanner.  The position was that the only dedicated ambulance in Bantry had to rush patients to Cork as many as ten times per week, often leaving west Cork without a dedicated ambulance for a full day.  While in one sense I understand the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Coghlan, this case highlights that community involvement can be good. </P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I had intended to second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendments but a little outbreak of Kerry collegiality deprived me of the opportunity to do so.  I appear also to be similarly silenced by the Cathaoirleach with regard to the proposals for the repair of this Chamber and its ultimate destination.  The Cathaoirleach has no need to wave his glasses at me and the Clerk need not whisper either because I do not intend to break the Chair&rsquo;s ruling.  I will observe it and he should restrain himself. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak on the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If we are to be spancelled, when will the House have an opportunity to discuss the matter?  This is an important question, particularly for those of us who have been in receipt of communications from constituents.  While some of those I have received have been balanced, others have been neurotic and abusive and assume that I am personally responsible for the desecration of the museum next door.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">If Senator MacSharry is interested in Seanad reform, he should note that when, at the beginning of this session, I tabled a bundle of recommendations which emerged from a series of discussions, including the deliberations of a cross-party committee chaired by the then Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who is now a Member of the other House, the Government side voted against them.  That shows how serious the Government is about Seanad reform.  It has been indicated in the press that some reform may by introduced, led by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, which will be targeted, perhaps exclusively, at the university seats in order that we may be effectively neutered and the whole constituency opened up to political hackery.  The Government will not get away with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to speak on the very important issue of autism on Thursday when I will take a divergent view from that of the Minister for Education and Science.  I deplore the fact that in the past week or so the Opposition in the other House twice targeted Ministers by suggesting they had deliberately absented themselves to travel abroad on frolics, whereas they were engaged in State business.  This hockeying up of Ministers in their absence when they are engaged in valuable work does not do credit to politics.  I point to the tradition in this House, from which the other House could learn, of not referring to the absence of Members. </P>

	<P Just="Left">In 2003, the House passed important legislation implementing the partial incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights into Irish law.  This provided for a declaration of incompatibility as a result of court proceedings.  The first such decision was handed down on 14 February in a very important and sensitive case taken by a brave citizen, Dr. Lydia Foy, who was the victim of gender identity disorder.  It is important that we examine what was said in the ruling by Mr. Justice McKechnie who found against the State.  There is a certain leeway because if the decision is not appealed, the Taoiseach must, within 21 days, place this information and the order declaring the incompatibility before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Mr. Justice McKechnie expressed disappointment at the failure of the Government to follow the important decision in the European Court of Human Rights in 2002 in the Goodwin <i>v</i>. the United Kingdom case and his warning in an earlier stage of the Dr. Lydia Foy case.  It is a pity that once again in these sensitive areas Ireland is isolated in Europe and is in the company of only Andorra and Albania in not having recognised transgendered persons.  Why not be adult and mature and take action before the courts force us, as a Legislature, to act?</P>

	<P>I wish to raise an issue which has a legal implication.  Gift tokens are part of our currency and they serve an important purpose.  They are usually purchased over a holiday period and I imagine it is a multi-million euro business.  However, it has a downside and increasingly I hear concerns about it.  These tokens have an expiry date and while this might <Col N="912"/>be understandable in the long term, the length of validity is getting increasingly shorter.  Often, when people cash in the token they are embarrassed and told it is worthless.  We must bear in mind goods or services have not changed hands.  The business that issued the token now has the benefit of the money.  However, the person who bought it and the person who received it have lost.</P>
        <P>Often, poor circumstances are involved and the person who received the token is deprived of his or her rights.  A debate on this would be helpful because it seems to require regulation.  I was not aware of the serious nature of this matter until the number of people bringing it to my notice increased.  We must respond to this concern.</P>

	<P>I seek an urgent debate on prisons in light of the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday which shows levels of drug use in prisons are high.  Inmates tested positive for drug use approximately 40,000 times during the past three years.  This is a damning indictment of Government policy since 2006.  We have seen no reduction in drug consumption in prisons despite promises from successive Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of a zero tolerance approach.</P>
        <P>We have no rehabilitative programmes for drug users in prisons.  Today&rsquo;s newspapers carry reports that prison guards now claim they are powerless to arrest people smuggling drugs into prisons.  If we are serious about tackling drug use, prison reform and having rehabilitative programmes in prisons we must address this as a matter of political priority.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House for a meaningful debate on this matter?  It is disturbing that in some prisons detection of drug use was as high as 75%.</P>

	<P>Like Senator Norris, I wish to assure the Cathaoirleach I do not intend to breach his recommendation not to discuss our move.  However, Senator MacSharry is quite right to raise the matter of the image of the House and I wish to make a small comment on this.</P>
        <P>Like any political institution, the greatest danger facing the Seanad is that of being too pompous about its image.  The Seanad has been around for a long time and it is likely to be around for a long time more.  If a few populists in the press like to sneer and have a few jokes let them at it.  The great Earl of Clarendon stated the best way to deal with libels is to ignore them and by ignoring them appear not to deserve them.  We are giving these people too much status.  Vincent Browne may be looking for a column and he deserves it.  He is a national institution like we are.  I do not recommend that he be abolished or even reformed.  He does his thing and we do ours.</P>

	<P>I accept that.  However it came about or however it may be reformed in the future, the Seanad is likely to be a permanent part of the institutions of the State, not least because it would require approximately 50 amendments of the Constitution to remove it.  In the meantime, I suggest we go about our business.  The populist sneer is that we are a talking shop.  What else would we be in a democracy?  We can hardly engage in armed struggle, can we?  Our business is to be a talking shop and the talk here is good.  I learn something every day in here, as does the public.  Every discussion I have heard here, be it on the Constitution, health or road safety has illuminated Bills, cast light on dark corners and done good for the State.  It is a talking shop and let us be proud of it.</P>

	<P>I agree with my colleague Senator Buttimer on the question of drugs in prisons.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, gave an undertaking that we would have drug-free prisons by this year if his proposals and measures were put in place and implemented.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said he was disturbed at the figures for drug use in prisons.  His predecessor stated it was a matter of urgency to deal with the matter.  Will the Minister explain to the House the measures he intends to put in place to combat this urgent problem?  With more than 40,000 positive cases of drug-taking in our prisons in the past three years, it is a disgrace.  What does the Government intend doing about it?</P>

	<P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on local authority funding?  In Athlone a few days ago, the Minister for Transport said local authorities should match euro for euro the funding provided by his Department for national and non-national roads.  If this were to happen, it would put a major drain on the finances of local authorities.  If funding were conditional on the local authorities matching euro for euro, the majority of them would not be able to match it.  We should have a serious debate on local authority funding.</P>

	<P>It crosses several Departments.  The Minister for Transport now has a major say in local authority funding, as well as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

	<P>At this time of year, many people are trying to give up smoking.  I recently received a letter from ASH Ireland, as I am sure did others.  It is campaigning for the Government to introduce a ban on smoking in cars in which children under 16 years of age are transported.  Given the time of year and the important public health nature of the issue, it would be timely for the House to debate the issue.  I am not a fan of excessive regulation but when it comes to protecting people&rsquo;s health, there are many dimensions to it.  There is the stress on our health services and the responsibility of adults to people under age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the remarks by my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, on the Dr. Lydia Foy case, we have not had a sufficient discussion on the importance of our Constitution.  We debated it recently in the House but with the Lisbon treaty being debated soon, we need to move urgently to debating the fundamental question of who decides Irish law on fundamental matters.  Even when aspects of our law may displease certain people, the fact is our Constitution allows us to determine fundamental issues for ourselves.  I am concerned we will end up having a referendum on the Lisbon treaty which may be about all manner of issues but will fail to bring before the Irish people the essential question of whether it is they or someone else who decides our fundamental constitutional values touching on human rights and dignity.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and O&rsquo;Donovan expressed their serious concerns regarding public health services and, in particular, the purchase of an ultrasound unit by the staff of Beaumont Hospital.  The example <Col N="915"/>given by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan can only reflect well on all those who participated.  The strength of our community is always exemplified in fund-raising, no matter where it takes place.  However, in view of the large amounts of funding being made available to the health services by the Government &mdash; more than &euro;15 billion &mdash; the need to raise funds for a &euro;24,000 purchase beggars belief, as the Senators correctly pointed out.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also mentioned bus services and asked for a debate on transport.  I have agreed to have this debate and have been in touch with the Minister&rsquo;s office.  I look forward to getting a favourable response for a date in the Minister&rsquo;s diary.  I agree to the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan and Norris to allow the Credit Union Savings Protection Bill 2008 &mdash; First Stage and the Mental Capacity and Guardianship Bill 2008 &mdash; First Stage to be placed on the Order Paper and taken today.  I seek the support of the House in this matter when I conclude my responding remarks.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole expressed his views regarding the major extra funding that has been received by the Department of Education and Science under the leadership of the current Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  As I informed the House on the Order of Business, the Minister will be in the House on Thursday.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also expressed serious concerns about the way in which the Law Society deals with its members.  Most Senators would support these views and share these concerns.  For generations, our families have placed their trust in the legal profession and their local solicitors in dealing with family matters such as wills.  A considerable amount of trust has been put in the exemplary group of people that are our legal representatives.  However, we have now seen too many times for our liking the various abuses that are taking place in that profession.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan and O&rsquo;Donovan also expressed serious concerns regarding the proposed removal of radio stations from Malin and Valentia.  I have given my word in the House that we will have a debate on this at the earliest possible opportunity, hopefully the week after next.  I fully agree with the vote of confidence in these stations.  As Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Coghlan and O&rsquo;Toole &mdash; eminent Senators from the kingdom of Kerry and the rebel county of Cork &mdash; have quite correctly pointed out, these two stations are of the utmost importance to their local communities in terms of job creation.  I have no difficulty in asking the Minister to come to the House to listen to the serious concerns and views of Senators about this proposal.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White and the Deputy Leader, Senator Dan Boyle, called on the Minister for Finance to consider the comments by our new <Col N="916"/>cardinal, Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady, on public services and individual wealth in Ireland and also the need for a new vision in terms of the demands on Government for extra funding, including the possibility of small, minute increases in taxation.  If we could get all-party agreement for a motion on this issue I certainly could allow a debate during Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time in this session, of which, as we all know, there are only four weeks left before the Easter break.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle also called for a debate before the end of this month on the proposed removal by RTE of its medium wave services which are of considerable importance to senior citizens throughout the country and to our emigrants, especially in the UK.</P>

	<P>Senator McFadden voiced her serious concerns about the former employees of Gentex in Athlone where up to 140 people could be affected.  This is a very serious concern for those families and I will pass on the views of the Senator to the Minister following the Order of Business.  Perhaps the Senator could raise this issue during Private Members&rsquo; business or on the Adjournment to find out the exact position of the Department in respect of it.  It will probably also speed things up.  I have a very serious request in respect of the peace of mind one gets from having a little pension to assist in one&rsquo;s senior years for which one has worked and paid in very bad times.  I want to see how we can bring the Minister to the House to be answerable and to see how we can progress the serious concerns of the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde welcomed the decision by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the IFA to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum.  As we all know, the EU reform treaty is about making Europe more effective and this will help in the development of the  Irish economy into the future.  Ireland is a very respected member of the EU and I would go so far to say that we are role models in Europe.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is providing information about the treaty.  We all know that the Department has already published 150,000 leaflets explaining the treaty.  However, when the Bill is published, the Government will set up a referendum commission which will be allocated almost &euro;6 million to send out balanced information to citizens outlining the key issues in the treaty.</P>
<Col N="917"/>
        <P>This treaty is a very good deal for Ireland and Europe.  I agree with the Senator that Ireland&rsquo;s future economic interest will remain at heart of it.  This is part of our selling message to the new investors and companies who are interested in coming here and anyone with which we are doing business around the world.</P>
        <P>Senator Alan Kelly made his very strong views known to the House about workers&rsquo; wages in Ireland.  In comparison with the average wage in the UK, which is &euro;26,000, the average wage in Ireland is &euro;32,000.  I believe it is the second highest in Europe.  However, instances, such as those pointed out by the Senator today, arise and I take the points he has made.  When the Senator&rsquo;s party was endorsed in 1982, 1,000 people were leaving our shores every week.  What a wonderful change there has been since then.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the introduction of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill, which is much needed legislation, particularly as human trafficking is recognised as the third most lucrative international crime after drugs and arms trafficking.  Ireland is one of the richest countries in Europe and is a tempting destination for human traffickers.  It is important to enact legislation to curb this phenomenon.  The Minister estimates that up to 100 people are trafficked into Ireland every year, based on the Ruhama report published in 2007.  It is generally acknowledged that the figure could be double that.</P>
        <P>While it is important for victims&rsquo; rights to be protected, there has been an interesting debate on whether this Bill is the correct method to do so.  It may not be the correct place for some of the rights under discussion.  I must air the concern that, if victims are given residential status based on co-operating with the prosecution of traffickers, it may undermine their human rights and put successful prosecutions in jeopardy if witnesses have been given incentives such as temporary residence permits or social welfare to give evidence against alleged perpetrators.  This was recognised by the Minister as creating a danger of evidence being contaminated due to the incentives offered to witnesses and preventing an effective prosecution.  Members of my party and of the Government parties have referred to this.  I wish to hear the Minister address this in replying to the debate on Second Stage.</P>
<Col N="921"/>
        <P>The Minister has concerns about putting victims&rsquo; protection into prosecutorial law.  I recognise that individuals involved in trafficking have the right to be protected.  It is important that this is addressed in legislation, whether in this Bill or another.  If this is to be addressed in another item of legislation we would like to know the timeframe for it.  It should be very speedy if not dealt with in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I have done research on unaccompanied and separated children coming into Ireland.  I interviewed many of these children in the hostels in which they were staying.  I was horrified at the vulnerability of these young people.  I note with distress that many young people who entered Ireland unaccompanied were placed in hostels and have disappeared.  Serious questions must be raised about the level of care we give these people and the follow-up undertaken.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in trying to track these people but I have no doubt some of them have been trafficked into prostitution.  We must pay far more attention to this area.  The children face risks from predators.  We must pay far more attention to how they are looked after when they arrive in the country.  They are under threat of being lured into abusive relationships or the sex industry.</P>
        <P>Legislation alone will not improve the conditions of these minors who are the victims of trafficking.  It is important that the providers of social services are aware of the varied needs of these young people and set up proper services.  The study with Ms Pauline Conroy of Ralaheen Limited, who has done much work in this area, showed that the young children were not receiving the level of care and services needed.  A more co-ordinated approach is needed between the HSE, various service providers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is no point in recognising the rights of these victims unless we provide for the rights on a practical level.</P>
        <P>The objective of this Bill is to put traffickers out of business and, by doing so, to protect the human rights of the victims of trafficking.  It is important the Bill is enacted in order that we can ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  This will enable a Europe-wide battle against the trafficking of humans.  I hope the Government did not weaken its hand when it opted out of the justice elements of European co-operation.  I ask the Minister to address this when he returns to the House.  Europe-wide action is needed to deal with this topic.</P>
        <P>An important aspect of the battle against trafficking is similar to the battle against drugs, namely, demand.  Fine Gael tabled an amendment to extend criminal liability to those who used trafficked prostitutes.  It was apparently accepted by the Minister.  One consequence of limiting demand may be to drive the industry <Col N="922"/>underground.  If we are serious about reducing the demand for trafficked persons we must examine issues such as the various arenas of adult entertainment and lap dancing clubs.  The community&rsquo;s wishes must be taken into account.  Where these arenas flourish, one creates a market for sex trafficking.  We have seen what has happened in Holland, a country with liberal policies in respect of these practices.  That country is recognised as an international hub for paedophilia and sex trafficking.</P>
        <P>Prostitution is not a criminal offence in Ireland but there is a battery of laws regulating the advertising and management of prostitution and attempting to prevent public nuisance from the activities of prostitutes.  These laws do not address the demand for sexual services and the criminalisation of sexual acts and thus the women engaged in prostitution are criminialised while the men who use the services are not.</P>
        <P>By criminialising those who use trafficked prostitutes, this Bill goes some way to redressing the balance in our prostitution laws.  These must be examined to combat the veritable sex industry that is emerging.  We need joined-up thinking.  We must examine human trafficking, drugs and prostitution, all of which are run by criminals.  One activity provides the cash to fuel another.  A lax attitude to any of these activities can cause a problem in other areas.  While the Bill aims to tackle those involved in human trafficking, the Government must realise that as long as drug lords and brothel owners are allowed to operate in Ireland and reap massive profits, there always will be a demand for trafficked persons, whether for the importation of drugs or for the sex industry.  Much work must be done and the legislation must examine the definitions that are required for the Bill, such as that of pornography.</P>
        <P>The Minister commented that the issue of victims&rsquo; rights will be addressed in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill but I urge him not to rely solely on that Bill to protect the victims of trafficking, as it only deals with non-EEA nationals.  It should be recognised that many victims have been trafficked from within the EU and they and their families also face many problems.  Many people have been trafficked into this country under false pretences from eastern Europe.</P>
        <P>We must examine also the deceit involved at the outset of a trafficking itinerary, often by a person of the same background, village or milieu.  The trafficker gains the trust of the victim only to deceive him or her or their parents in the long term.  This deceit is intrinsic to the Palermo Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and I urge that the Bill be amended to include the words &ldquo;deceitfully induces&rdquo; as an offence.  In fact, there was a horrific description in one of last Sunday&rsquo;s newspapers of the situation of a young woman who had been trafficked in this way.  She was brought to this country through deceit and <Col N="923"/>kept in captivity.  She escaped and was lucky enough to be helped by a woman who brought her to a police station.  We must bear in mind that some of the victims of trafficking are from within the European Union and look after them as well.</P>
        <P>Traffickers intentionally confuse and disorientate victims so they will be less likely to escape from their situation.  Irish social services, health services and garda&iacute; must be trained to watch for the symptoms of abuse and be aware of those who are at risk.  This goes beyond what is in the legislation but solving this problem cannot be done through legislation alone.  Recognising that there is a problem is the first step towards creating a solution.  This legislation will be effective in prosecuting those involved in trafficking.</P>
        <P>One matter should be mentioned before I conclude.  In the matter of the sale of children, it is important that the Bill recognises the role of intermediaries in cases of inter-country adoption, particularly in light of the recent judgments of Justice McMenamin in regard to the case of Tristan Dowse.  The Bill should be amended to include the charging of transaction costs which are beyond what is reasonable to incur to comply with adoption administrative provisions in the State.  Enacting and implementing this legislation effectively will not only reduce the potential for trafficking minors but will also prevent citizens of Ireland from being taken advantage of in the course of trying to adopt foreign children.  This is an area that has not been greatly discussed in this country but we should examine it.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on the inter-country adoption issue where in fact it does amount to the sale of children.  It is a difficult and tricky area but it is one we must examine.</P>
        <P>I commend the thrust of the Bill and I hope the Minister will consider the additions I have recommended.  I urge him to introduce legislation urgently to ensure the rights of all victims of trafficking are recognised and protected under Irish law.  This Bill must be seen as just one facet of the strategy against human trafficking.  It is important that we take a multifaceted approach to this problem which must include the welfare and rights of victims as well as the education of present and future victims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power.  Any legislation that helps to protect the most vulnerable in society must be embraced wholeheartedly and, in that regard, I welcome the broad objectives of the Bill.  Organised criminal gangs make substantial profits from the exploitation of poor people, both young and old.  Organised crime across Europe and the world simply uses human beings as commodities.  It sees people as a means of making profit and has no regard for human rights.  The people involved in such crimes are devoid of <Col N="924"/>scruples or morals.  Ireland must take a stand and play a part in smashing these criminal gangs.  It must do its best to eliminate human trafficking in Ireland and across Europe.  I look forward to this country ratifying the Council of Europe convention which deals with victim protection.</P>
        <P>We also must consider carefully how to protect the victim on a practical level, such as through legal and translation services, accommodation and so forth.  The most important aspect of protecting the victim is a focused approach to child trafficking.  Ireland and its people are known worldwide as a nation and a people that care for the vulnerable, poor and needy.  We should strive to be an example to the world in how seriously we take the problem of the exploitation of human beings, especially women and children.  Legislation is required but real action must follow.  We must make Ireland a country where criminal gangs know they cannot operate and a country that continues to be known as being to the fore in the protection of human rights.</P>
        <P>The problem of human trafficking, particularly child trafficking, must be a priority for the Government.  The EU estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked worldwide.  A portion of them would be in Europe and would have crossed our shores.  These children are mainly from poorer nations, such as those in the old Soviet bloc, eastern Europe and Africa.  Legislation and enforcement will undoubtedly help but the Government must also consider how to tackle the root causes and the economic reasons for the prevalence of human trafficking in poorer nations.  In that regard, we must continue to improve Irish Government foreign aid further.</P>
        <P>I support many aspects of this Bill, including the provision on consent.  The issue of consent leads to uncertainty because it is difficult to prove.  Women did not give consent to their recruiters if they were lured under the pretext that faraway hills are green and they would have a rosy life and great earning potential in Ireland.  Little did they know they were being introduced to seedy, grubby apartments or bedsits in which they were told to ply their trade and give their money to their pimp or recruiter.  They are debased and abused hourly and if their earnings are not high enough, they are further dehumanised and debased.  Consent is a difficult issue but I believe no consent is given in such instances.</P>
        <P>The problem of trafficking is significant but is largely opaque.  The Minister stated there were 76 reported cases but I do not believe that is the true number.  Who reports such incidents?  If a woman manages to escape, is she free from the fear of being caught again by her recruiter who would make her undergo further awful debasement?  While I accept that the figure of 76 cases in seven years was given to the Minister by his officials in good faith, I do not believe it reflects the true number.  The fear felt by a woman when <Col N="925"/>approaching a garda is significant.  I therefore caution against believing trafficking is very rare.  Although 76 cases are 76 too many, I believe there are even more.  The problem is opaque and I do not know how it can be made less so.</P>
        <P>Article 26 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings proposed a non-punishment provision but it has not been included in this legislation.  I hope it will be entertained by the Minister.  Members are aware of the case of a woman who was incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison simply because she was trafficked into the country. She was under the cloud of having committed a crime but she committed none.  The crime was on the part of the person who procured her for the purpose of prostitution.  We should examine also the issue of temporary residence permits for women and children who need to stay in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on introducing this Bill so soon after the formation of the new Government. It demonstrates the importance of the issue.  I am concerned, however, that the Bill does nothing to change the law whereby those who are trafficked can be jailed or deported.  Why is that?  It is a most awful experience for a human being to be trafficked.  It is proposed that women can be jailed or deported for the crime of having been trafficked.  When the Minister and his officials review the comments in today&rsquo;s debate, I hope they will consider tabling amendments to address this aspect of the Bill.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill aims to outlaw sex with trafficking victims.  Using the sexual services of a victim of human trafficking, therefore, is to be criminalised.  That is to be welcomed but it is confusing and the provision does not go far enough.</P>
        <P>It is not currently a crime in Ireland to pay a prostitute for sex.  That must change.  If we are to make any impact on combating prostitution and human trafficking within the sex industry, we must target the demand for such services and outlaw the act of paying for sexual services.  We must clarify the law on brothel keeping and advertising prostitution &mdash; the area in which human trafficking thrives.  It is illegal to run a brothel and advertise prostitution services in the State.  Why can we not close down the websites which peddle the services of prostitutes and advertise the apartments and hotels where these services can be engaged?  These websites are fuelling the trafficking and brothel-keeping industry.  We cannot close down the websites apparently because their domain names are <i>.com</i>, not <i>.ie</i>.  However, the pimps who use these sites are often in Ireland, collecting the money from the prostitutes, running brothels and trafficking women, so why can they not be arrested?</P>
        <P>The reason arrests are not being made is that Ireland does not have a dedicated vice squad to police our makeshift legislation.  The Garda <Col N="926"/>National Immigration Bureau does great work, as does the Garda domestic violence unit, but the Garda does not have a designated, dedicated vice squad.  The immigration bureau and the domestic violence unit must deal with their particular areas and issues, which are issues the House will debate on another day.  There have been many cosmetic exercises over the years in this area, with the Garda setting up task forces and operations to combat the problem of human trafficking and prostitution.</P>
        <P>I welcome the aspects of the Bill which set up the high level group, which will include representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and relevant Departments, which is to draw up an action plan.  That notwithstanding, we need a serious vice squad forthwith to combat prostitution and sex slavery in this country.  This is a vicious, insidious area which is cash rich and drugs ridden, where women and children are trafficked in to work as prostitutes in our apartments and hotels.  As I speak, hundreds of prostitutes are working around Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway, and other towns and cities across Ireland.  We either take this problem seriously and outlaw prostitution properly and police it properly with a vice squad, or we legalise the area.  At present, it is a grey area and this Bill does not clarify it in any regard.  It is clear that we need to ban it outright and be serious on the matter.</P>
        <P>The public perception of prostitution in Ireland also needs to be considered.  Only one newspaper has consistently reported on the issue, exposing the pimps and criminals of the underworld who operate brothels and traffic women and children, namely the <i>Sunday World</i>.  We need to acknowledge that but we need to call on the other arms of the media to do the same type of work and change the public&rsquo;s perception of this issue in conjunction with policing it properly.</P>
        <P>As legislators, we are responsible for ensuring those who engage in the trafficking of other human beings can be caught.  Our duty is to ensure no aspect of human trafficking is allowed to continue so that it becomes one of the forms of evil we leave behind in the early days of this new century.  The best way to do this is to outlaw the purchasing of sexual services in Ireland.  Subject to the above, I commend the thrust of the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the short time available to me I want to concentrate on some points relating to this Bill.  First, I am concerned that the terms of section 5, which criminalises the trafficking of persons other than children, may not be sufficiently broad to catch the situation where people engage in or facilitate the trafficking of persons who may consent to enter the country of their own accord, perhaps voluntarily in the belief that, whatever their experiences in their home countries, life could be better in Ireland.  I mean <Col N="927"/>that in the case of exploitation within the sex industry or in terms of labour.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns raised by others about the failure of the Bill to meet the needs of victims of human trafficking by prescribing in the necessary detail the rights and benefits of which they should be allowed to avail.  The Minister argued he would deal with victim protection under the Immigration, Residency and Protection Bill and cannot deal with it in the current Bill as it could be seen as an incentive for a victim to testify and be used by the defence, but the provisions in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill that a victim of trafficking would be allowed a period of recovery and reflection and that there would be a discretion to give a visa of six months of temporary residence for victims of trafficking do not go far enough.  What about provisions such as social welfare?  Victims may be too traumatised to work for a period.  What about access to medical and psychological assistance?  These issues are not covered in the Immigration, Residency and Protection Bill.  The residence provision will be of assistance only to trafficked persons from outside the European Economic Area.  There is no provision for the wider needs of trafficked persons, whether from inside or outside the EEA.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned by the failure of the Bill to provide that victims of trafficking will not be punished, either for being in the State illegally or for offences, for example, those associated with prostitution.  I accept we do not want to create a loophole that would be exploited by persons who are not victims of trafficking, but it should be possible to provide the necessary protection.  It would be anomalous if people who are victims of trafficking could be liable to prosecution while those who would avail of their services get off scot free.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the fact that on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, gave an undertaking, in response to contributions from Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Denis Naughten, to bring forward an amendment which would criminalise those who avail of sexual services provided by trafficked women working in prostitution, as recommended by the Council of Europe among others.  In the Seanad last week, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, invited us to give our views on the question of whether we should provide for the criminalisation of using or availing of the services of a trafficked person.  I hope that is not a row-back, but it is certainly sounds like it.</P>
        <P>I note the comments of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the D&aacute;il, that his concern is for the alleged victim of trafficking and &ldquo;one must make a judgment on what is in his or her best interest&rdquo;.  That must be our starting point, but I did not find satisfactory the Minister&rsquo;s D&aacute;il expla<Col N="928"/>nation of the difficulties that would be entailed by criminalising the users of trafficked women.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some sympathy with his view that it would be difficult to get a conviction because the prosecution would be obliged to prove that the accused knew that the alleged victim had been trafficked.  It would be difficult, but not impossible.  It is a matter of enforcement and, specifically, a question of proper resources for those who would investigate such crimes.</P>
        <P>I found somewhat bizarre the argument that the user of the sexual services might be the best chance a victim has of escaping her ordeal and that such users would be less likely to help if they knew they had committed an offence, for example, by having sex with a trafficked person.  The notion of such users being ready to act as white knights is rather far-fetched.  That would be very rare if it were ever to happen.</P>
        <P>All things considered, the Minister was right to tell the D&aacute;il that, &ldquo;In terms of legal policy, if one wants to provide for what is being suggested [the criminalisation of the users and those who avail of the services of trafficked persons], one must criminalise the purchase of sex generally&rdquo;, and that is in the context of prostitution.  I note and welcome what my colleague, Senator McDonald, said and I hope she will put pressure on the Government to bring her aspiration to fruition.</P>
        <P>The Minister should move to that position of criminalising the users of sexual services generally, and I will table amendments for Committee Stage dealing with the criminalisation not only of those who use and avail of trafficked persons but of those who use and avail of the services of persons in prostitution generally.</P>
        <P>It may well be, as the Minister claims, that a report commissioned by the Norwegian Government, which examined the impact of differing approaches to the sex industry in Holland and Sweden, concluded in the case of Sweden that whereas the abolitionist approach to prostitution had reduced the number of women on the streets, it may have had unintended consequences such as sending the industry further underground and thereby increasing women&rsquo;s vulnerability.  We must note this word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Ruhama, which does excellent work accompanying women caught up in prostitution, including many trafficked women, reports the views of various colleagues and contacts in Sweden, working within non-governmental organisations and for the Swedish authorities.  These all maintain that the Swedish legislation, which criminalises the purchasers of sex generally, has had a positive impact in tackling both human trafficking and prostitution.  Fears that the criminalisation of the user will drive trafficking and prostitution further underground ignore the fact that much of this activity, by definition, already is underground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must realise that there will always be a part of this murky world that will be far underground <Col N="929"/>and that developments in mobile phone and internet technology, for example, mean that a certain amount of trafficking and use of prostitution will be difficult to reach despite the best efforts of legislation.  This is what we have seen in Sweden, which has seen far fewer women in prostitution on the streets but may also be experiencing less of the underground activity relative to neighbouring and other countries.  Rather than relying on reports, I hope our policymakers, and the Minister, in particular, would be in touch with the Swedish authorities who appear to have no inclination to reverse their enlightened law of 1999.  They appear to believe that trafficking and prostitution have not increased in their country, bucking the trend in other countries.  They believe they have fewer problems with trafficking than any other country in the European Union.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the other country studied by that Norwegian report, namely, Holland, which went the route of regularising prostitution and, presumably, almost giving people the equivalent of PPSNs, found that it still had problems with an underground dimension to the prostitution problem, which suggests to me that there would be no harm done by criminalising the users.  A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting and being briefed by Ms Agneta Bucknell who worked in Stockholm in the state social services for women in prostitution.  She advocates legislation along the Swedish model.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear.  It would be unjust to have trafficking legislation which could potentially prosecute the victims of trafficking but could allow those who exploit these persons get away because their acts are not considered criminal in Ireland.  Let us remember that given the vulnerability of many of the people involved, one could be speaking about people effectively getting away with rape.  Let us be clear also that it is inconsistent to attempt to criminalise situations where users avail of trafficked adult persons but not to extend this protection to other adult persons.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I cannot understand why it is not more obvious to policymakers that by criminalising the users of women in prostitution, we would bring about a negative impact on the number of those who use the services of prostitutes in general and of trafficked women in particular.  I worry that there is an element of fatalism in policymakers&rsquo; minds about prostitution being the oldest profession, etc.  Perhaps worse, there may be even some who believe that prostitution provides some kind of a vent for the sexual energies of people who, apparently, cannot be controlled.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>We need to get back to first principles.  We are talking about solidarity with other people.  In this case we are talking about solidarity with persons engaged or caught up in prostitution, many of whom have been trafficked.  We need to remember that the law has the capacity to influence <Col N="930"/>people&rsquo;s behaviour.  When something is criminalised, many people are deterred from engaging in it.  In other situations, we see how much benefit the criminal law is as an influence on people&rsquo;s behaviour.  How can we legislate to prohibit smoking in public places, litter, drink driving or speeding, but not legislate to prohibit people from exploiting the bodies of other people, generally women, who in the majority of cases are not in the business out of anything that could be remotely described as unfettered free choice?</P>
        <P>There are people who have a crazy notion that prostitution is something some women choose to do.  This ignores all the pressures on women who make this so-called choice, it ignores the momentum legalisation or tolerance creates for other women to be exploited, it ignores the negative exploitative attitudes towards women which this generates and it ignores the wider impact on society.</P>
        <P>Nobody disputes any longer that drink driving and speeding are hard to prevent, but neither do we dispute that enforcement is both possible and necessary.  Today, I received a letter from Action on Smoking and Health, ASH, seeking the introduction of a ban on smoking in cars in which persons under 16 are being transported.  That is a law that could be difficult to enforce and where convictions might be difficult to secure.  Nonetheless, nobody suggests we should not attempt this, because we see the educative dimension of the law.   We should have no more talk about laws being impossible to enforce and convictions impossible to secure or that the laws drive certain things underground.  This kind of talk takes us into a moral and jurisprudential wasteland.</P>
        <P>We need legislation to protect people and society from vice.  The best way to do this is to target the user, not the person in prostitution or the one being trafficked to be exploited, whether in the sex industry or the labour area generally.   If such legislation tackles the users and creates a massive disincentive for them, it will impact in the way we want on our trafficking problem.  However, we also need the resources for enforcement of the criminal law.</P>
        <P>We must resist the temptation to see victims of trafficking as just an immigration problem.  The Minister has set up an anti-trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and this is welcome as is the proposed involvement of NGOs in the unit.  However, I wonder whether the legislation should also provide a statutory basis for the unit, akin to the establishment of the Press Council for example, and set terms of reference which will set out &mdash; as Deputy Pat Rabbitte attempted to do in an amendment in the D&aacute;il &mdash; the types of protection and assistance which will be available to victims of trafficking.</P>
        <P>This legislation is timely, but we have some way to go before it takes a properly principled <Col N="931"/>and humanitarian approach to the problems of human trafficking and the consequences of this serious problem for vulnerable people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate for their comments, which were, in general, positive.  Their contributions are much appreciated.  It is clear we all share an abhorrence of the evil trade of trafficking in human beings and wish, not only to tackle it in Ireland, but internationally through police co-operation and heightened awareness.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s opening contribution mentioned we are adopting a holistic approach to the challenge posed by trafficking in human beings.  An holistic approach does not necessarily mean that we will include all our responses and initiatives in one Bill, or even that everything must be done by way of legislation.  It means that when we add together all the initiatives taking place, of which the Bill is one important part, we will have a comprehensive policy response that ensures that human trafficking is tackled at every level, including the protection of victims.</P>
        <P>There is no need to repeat in any detail how we will give effect to that policy as it is on the record of the House.  The Bill represents just one of four strands of a comprehensive strategy to tackle trafficking in human beings.  All four strands will develop side by side so that, for example, the enactment of the criminal offences legislation dealing with immigration issues, a more structured scheme of victim protection, the provision of services to victims and awareness raising will take place contemporaneously. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assured the D&aacute;il when the Bill was going through that House that when the legislation comes into operation one month after its enactment, the recovery and reflection and residency provisions in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will apply to trafficked persons on an administrative basis, as if that Bill was already in operation on that date.  This will ensure that the gap between the coming into operation of the two pieces of legislation will be filled by administrative action in that respect.  I can give the same assurance to the Seanad today.</P>
        <P>Our primary goals in the field of trafficking are to ensure that the criminal gangs involved in this evil trade are put out of business and behind bars, that victims will be protected, receive all necessary supports and have no fear in giving evidence in court, that country citizens will receive the necessary residential rights under the Immigration legislation and, finally, the early ratification of the relevant international instruments, in particular the Council of Europe convention on <Col N="932"/>action against trafficking in human beings.  Before the Council of Europe convention can be ratified, the proper structures must be in place.  Chapter VII of the convention establishes a strict monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the convention by a group of experts, which shall be known as GRETA.  The evaluation procedure for the parties to the convention may include country visits.  The Minister said in his opening address that this legislation alone is not sufficient for ratification of the convention.  For that reason, he has established a high level group to recommend the most appropriate and effective response to protecting victims, in line with the requirements of the Council of Europe convention. It is also the reason he established a dedicated anti-trafficking unit, headed by a recently appointed executive director.</P>
        <P>Where legislation is needed, such as in criminal and immigration laws, that is being provided.  Also, where administrative measures are required, they will be provided.  I assure Senators that victims of trafficking will receive all the necessary protection and services that are provided for in the United Nations and Council of Europe instruments on trafficking.  If we cannot do that, we cannot ratify those instruments.</P>
        <P>I would now like to respond to the specific issues raised by Senators in the course of the debate.  My responses are not in any order of importance, but more or less in the order they were made.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan referred to the delay in bringing the Bill forward, considering that the Council framework decision was due for compliance in August 2004.  That is true, but it would be unusual to legislate for a subject that was still being negotiated at the time.  I refer to the Council of Europe convention against trafficking in human beings, which was finalised in 2005.  The general scheme of a Bill, of which trafficking was just one component, was published in 2006 but, because it was proving difficult to get the Bill finalised, the Minister decided, on taking up office, to extract the trafficking provisions and provide for them in a separate Bill as a matter of urgency.  That is the reason we are in a position to debate this Bill today and why it will shortly become law.</P>
        <P>Senators Regan and Fitzgerald maintained that the period of recovery and reflection in the Immigration Bill will only apply to third country nationals.  That is true.  Persons from the EU member states of Eastern Europe have a right of residency in this country and their need for protection and the services to be provided to them will be catered for administratively in the national action plan being drawn up by the high level group.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan also commented that the work of the high level group would be improved by the participation of the NGOs.  Part of the remit of <Col N="933"/>the group is to decide on the most appropriate way to engage constructively with the NGOs and other interested persons to ensure the most effective response to trafficking in human beings.  Accordingly, the matter will be considered at the first meeting of the high level group which will take place early next month.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Norris referred to trafficking for the purpose of transplanting human organs.  This is included in the Bill in order to comply with the United Nations and Council of Europe instruments on trafficking.  However, there is no evidence of such trafficking into Ireland or, for that matter, into the member states of the European Union.  That is why such trafficking does not feature in the EU trafficking framework decision.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik considered that immigration issues should not be separated from the criminal issues and should, accordingly, be included in the Bill.  The Senator has a point, but the greater argument can be made that not separating the immigration issues from immigration matters generally and that placing all immigration issues in one Bill that deals comprehensively with policy on that subject is preferable.  I emphasise again that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill deals only with immigration issues.  Protection issues which do not have immigration aspects will be dealt with administratively.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and McDonald argued for a non-punishment clause in this Bill but such a statutory clause, providing complete immunity from prosecution, would be at variance with the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am happy to rely on the common sense and discretion of the investigating and prosecuting authorities when dealing with trafficked persons.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Fitzgerald, McDonald and Mullen also asked that we consider adopting the Swedish system of criminalising the purchase of sex and decriminalising the sale of sex.  The Swedish laws have been studied in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and are being kept under constant review.  To date, the arguments for adopting that system are not totally convincing and the lack of adoption of the Swedish laws in other countries is also relevant.  There appears to be a drop in the number of street prostitutes in Sweden, although the level of reduction is disputed.  Furthermore, the level of prostitution via the Internet, mobile telephones and hotel rooms is also unclear.  Neighbouring countries have reported an increase in prostitution.  The fact is that demand does not disappear because of a change in the law; it is simply displaced.  We are examining whether it would be feasible to draft an amendment creating an offence of soliciting a trafficked person for sex in the knowledge or belief that he or she was trafficked.  Such <Col N="934"/>an amendment must be credible and not just inserted for the optics.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle and Alex White referred to legislation providing for enabling provisions, thereby shifting the power to make or to elaborate on the laws through secondary legislation or ministerial regulation.  This Bill contains no such power.  In recent years, decisions of the courts have greatly curtailed what can be left to ministerial regulations.  I remind Senator Alex White that his party proposed, in the D&aacute;il, an amendment on victims&rsquo; rights that would have enabled the Minister to promulgate a code of victims&rsquo; rights in respect of victims of trafficking.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White read out a graphic would-be job description for a woman trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Her words confirm that the actions being taken on so many levels, including in this Bill, are not only worthwhile but essential.  The Minister mentioned in his opening speech the establishment of a dedicated anti-trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the significance of the establishment of that unit should not be underestimated.  It is not every new or newly-significant issue that results in the establishment of such a dedicated unit.  It will be in a position to drive the response to trafficking and to ensure that all the necessary protections and services are available to alleged victims.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Fitzgerald raised a number of issues today, with which I will now deal briefly.  The Senator called for the term &ldquo;deceit&rdquo; to be inserted into the Bill.  However, the term &ldquo;deceived&rdquo; is already included in section 5(1)(<i>b</i>), which will no doubt satisfy the Senator.  She also referred to the possibility that residing rights might be seen as an incentive that could affect the subsequent prosecution of a trafficker.  This is dealt with in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which was prepared in the light of expert legal advice.  It is relevant that the residency rights are temporary in nature.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also raised the issue of awareness of the issue among garda&iacute;.  In that context, I must point out that a total of 150 police officers from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI were trained in prevention, protection and prosecution measures relating to trafficking in human beings during the period 2006 to 2007.  The officers who received the training were selected as being those most likely to encounter victims of trafficking, in the Border, immigration and detective units nationwide.  The training was designed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with the International Organisation for Migration.  Non-governmental organisations such as Ruhama and Migrant&rsquo;s Rights gave presentations to participants, based on their interactions with the victims of trafficking.  From the point of view of awareness, everything that could be done has been <Col N="935"/>done but this is an area that will be kept under review and if further training is required, it will be provided.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also referred to lap dancing clubs.  While existing legislation does not specifically cover the licensing of lap dancing clubs, the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in such clubs is controlled by the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 2004 and the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 2004.  Therefore, it is open to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter such premises for the purposes of preventing or detecting the violation of any of the provisions of the licensing laws.  Where circumstances so warrant, it is also open to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to object to the granting or renewal of licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor in these establishments.  Licences for the sale of alcohol must be renewed annually, in September, and it is open to any person, not just a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to lodge an objection to renewal in any case.  This can be done, for example, on public order or nuisance grounds.  It is also possible to object to the granting of special exemption orders, which permit late opening.  I understand there is a group within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which is examining the issue of the regulation of premises used in the sex industry.</P>
        <P>I am familiar with one lap dancing club which opened close to my own home.  It caused a lot of concern as it was located in a most unsuitable area.  However, through a lack of business, the club eventually closed down and the premises reverted to its previous business of selling pints to the locals.  I can identify with what Senator Fitzgerald said regarding the need for locals to have a say in the type of activities that are carried on in premises in their neighbourhoods.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken a proactive approach and is very vigilant in ensuring that any allegations relating to the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation are vigorously investigated.  While evidence of the involvement of criminal gangs in the trafficking or smuggling of non-nationals into the State is scarce, a number of specific operations have been put in place with a view to the prevention and detection of such activity.  One such operation is operation quest, the objective of which was to investigate allegations that non-nationals were being illegally brought into the State for the purpose of employment in the sex industry.  The main target of the operation was activity associated with lap dancing clubs.</P>
        <P>In the course of operation quest, several hundred non-national lap dancers were interviewed and asked how they came to be employed in the sex industry.  During interviews conducted by the investigating officers, one case was identified <Col N="936"/>where it was suggested that trafficking was a factor.  A subsequent investigation resulted in the identification of a suspect, who is a Bulgarian citizen.  It is suspected that he operates throughout Europe, using a number of aliases.  It is also believed that while he has been in this jurisdiction, he has since left.  None of the other women made any allegations of mistreatment or showed any indication that they were victims of trafficking.  Prosecutions of the owners and managers of lap dancing clubs were commenced in all cases where breaches of legislation, for example, the Employment Permits Act of 2003, were detected.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald made reference to the fact that we do not have a dedicated vice squad.  As Senators will be aware, the deployment of resources is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but it must be pointed out that the domestic violence unit is also a sexual assault unit.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the lack of protection for victims.  However, as was mentioned during the Second Stage debate, victims of trafficking, whether from within or outside the European Union, will be protected and will receive all the necessary services, which will be set out in the national action plan being prepared by the high-level group.</P>
        <P>I hope I have dealt with the main points that arose in the debate.  It was an invigorating debate that covered a large area of policy on trafficking.  Immigration policy was a recurring theme and there will be ample opportunity to discuss it further in the debate on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill in the coming weeks and months.  However, the main theme of the debate was the overwhelming concern expressed by all speakers for the plight of the unfortunate victims of trafficking and what our response should be to the challenges it poses.  I am satisfied the responses I have detailed today and the opening speech made by my colleague indicate that we are adopting the correct approach which will make Ireland a very hostile place for traffickers and a friendly and humane place for alleged victims, irrespective of whether immigration issues are a factor.</P>
        <P>If I have not had time to deal with particular issues raised by Members, they can contact the Department and we will provide them with detailed responses where possible.  I thank Members for their constructive contributions.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter on the Adjournment concerns the need for the Minister for Health and Children to hasten the process for Irish citizens to adopt children from overseas.  The Minister of State will be familiar with this subject and I hope she will be familiar with the extreme pain, difficulties and sadness this problem causes a large number of families in Ireland.  I am struck by the number of people who have approached me on this subject who were frustrated by a system that works badly and could be improved quickly.</P>
        <P>It is a simple equation in some ways.  There is a supply of children overseas who need happy homes badly and there are approximately 2,000 Irish people willing and anxious to take them on board and to provide them with happy homes.  Some of the children live overseas in awful conditions of great poverty and in orphanages and should be provided with homes.  The only element that is lacking is a speedy and fair system to hurry up the ultimate solution, namely, a happy upbringing.</P>
        <P>What is the problem?  Many were under the impression that it lay in the adoption systems abroad, but that is not the case.  There is some slowness in many countries.  Traditionally, the further east, the more bureaucratic.  However, much of the blame for the delay experienced by Irish people who are anxious to adopt lies in Ireland.  No one should take away the need for a rigorous and robust assessment of parents who seek to give homes to children and the State must ensure, as far as humanly possible, that the children are given happy, safe and secure homes and parents who will care for them and raise them well.  Nobody who is frustrated by the system contests the need for rigorous assessment.  What is at issue is the extraordinary slowness and the pain it causes parents who believe they are on the road to bringing up children, but find themselves frustrated.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech will give some comfort to the parents because the progress made in recent years is deplorable.  The situation is getting much worse, not better.  I will provide the Minister of State with a few statistics to which <Col N="938"/>a response would be interesting.  In 2002, there were 41.1 full-time equivalent social workers dealing with inter-country adoptions.  At the end of June 2007, the latest figures I have, there were 45.5 such workers, an increase of approximately 10%.  In 2002, there were 1,057 applications waiting to be assessed.  As of June last year, there were 1,928 applications waiting.  What does this mean?  Whereas demand has approximately doubled, the number of social workers has hardly increased.  The result is a slowing down of the process.  In 2002, 653 people were on the waiting list, but there are currently 1,525 people on the list, a multiple of 2.5.</P>
        <P>Not only is the process slowing, but an independent report on the adoption process in 1999 suggested that 20 to 24 cases per annum should be cleared by a trained social worker.  I do not know from where the figure came, but I presume it was produced by people with an expertise.  The HSE accepted it, but preferred to go for the lowest possible figure, as it tends to do, of the 18-20 range.  The actual figure being processed only occasionally reaches double digits.  We have a crying need for more social workers if the applications are to be processed with the rigour the State requires.</P>
        <P>Not only do we need more social workers, we need an end to the systemic delays in the adoption procedure.  When I examined it, I knew of the regional differences.  For example, it is easier in Donegal than in Dublin for various reasons.  The procedures and the stages through which people must go are so demanding, long and many that there is almost automatically an extraordinary delay.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be more familiar with the situation than I am, but I counted at least 12 principal types of procedure through which a person wishing to adopt abroad must go in Ireland.  This is absurd and ridiculous.  Some of the procedures are bureaucratic and I do not have time to list them all, but there is an initial approach to the HSE, followed by what is termed an &ldquo;information meeting&rdquo;, usually three to four months later.  The applicants makes a formal written submission but there appears to be a delay in the HSE &mdash; often between two and three years &mdash; before the application is activated.</P>
        <P>I do not know what in the name of God happens in that time period but potential parents who would be happy to provide a home for a child must wait two or three years before their application is activated.  Legitimate inquiries, such as Garda inquiries, medical tests and income assessments, are then made in respect of those involved, but why can these not be done beforehand?  Why must it wait for activation by the HSE?  I do not know why this process cannot be shortened.</P>
<Col N="939"/>
        <P>After Garda, legal and medical inquiries it is necessary to meet the social worker.  The social worker carries out home visits to assess the home, ensure the family is happy and see that things work out.  It is right that he or she should do so, particularly if other children are present.  However, these home visits could take place months or even years earlier, before an application is activated.</P>
        <P>The problem is the blockage in the bureaucratic system evident in the HSE&rsquo;s three year delay in activating applications, the lack of social workers and the fact that social workers seem to be missing their targets.  It is unfashionable to criticise social workers, and I am not doing so, but an independent inquiry said they should process a certain number of applications and they are not achieving this goal.  There should be an inquiry as to why productivity targets are not being met; if a processing level of 20 to 24 applications is sought why are only 12 processed when there is a queue of 650 applications?</P>
        <P>There are other procedures that must be gone through as part of the process, including visiting the Adoption Board, which takes another year or so because it also has a backlog.  This probably means more people are needed on the Adoption Board.</P>
        <P>This is a serious human problem that relates to the laws of supply and demand and it can easily be resolved through more staff, more resources and by firmly asking the HSE why there are such long delays between applicants writing in and the activation of their applications.  I do not understand why it is not possible to activate applications immediately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this issue and extend my apologies on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, on his unavoidable absence.</P>
        <P>This matter relates to putting intercountry adoption in context and I aim to address the issues Senator Ross has raised.  Intercountry adoption has become an increasing phenomenon in recent years.  The International Social Service has estimated that between 30,000 and 40,000 children are adopted annually around the world.  These children generally come from developing countries, or those in transition, and are received by families living in industrialised countries, particularly those in Europe and North America.</P>
        <P>This trend is reflected in Ireland, as requests for intercountry adoption assessments are continuously increasing.  The study on intercountry adoption, undertaken by the Children&rsquo;s Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for intercountry <Col N="940"/>adoption in Europe.  It is against this background that the Minister of State&rsquo;s office is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks, which will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption. The aim is to support and protect prospective parents and, even more importantly, the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided.</P>
        <P>The first priority is the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, 1993.  A core principle of the Hague convention, which will be ratified by Ireland in a Bill to be published shortly, is that intercountry adoption should be child-centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount.  Legislating for intercountry adoption is essential to give protections to children in the process of adoption.  The Hague convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland in terms of the standards that are being applied in the sending country, over which we have no jurisdiction.  As a receiving country it is especially important to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.</P>
        <P>Legislation, specifically the regime of the Hague convention, is at least some assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that an adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  The convention is based on the premise that intercountry adoption should only be considered when a suitable family cannot be found for the child in his or her country of origin.  Accordingly, a series of options, such as the child being cared for by relatives or in a family within his or her own country, are considered.  The convention does not oblige a sending country to engage in a particular amount of adoptions; rather sending countries are advised to only engage in as much intercountry adoption as they can reasonably control.  The Department fully supports this approach.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that despite the situation in individual countries, on a global scale there appears to be fewer children available for intercountry adoption.  Many developing countries are no longer able to release enough children to respond to the adoption requests of receiving countries.  The demand for children to adopt is greater than the supply and this situation can create pressure on sending countries, which can carry the risk of the interests of the child not being paramount.  Department officials and the Adoption Board, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs, are working on an <Col N="941"/>ongoing basis to identify and negotiate with countries that continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care that cannot be provided domestically.</P>
        <P>As regards the assessment process, a family that wishes to adopt should be recognised beforehand as able to promote, safeguard and support the development and well being of a child in need of adoption in a lasting manner.  The Minister of State is conscious that persons applying for intercountry adoption are experiencing delays in the assessment process and he appreciates the frustration this causes to those who are anxious to adopt and who are more than willing to participate fully in the necessary assessment procedures.</P>
        <P>The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive.  It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences.  In a number of areas the HSE has improved waiting times by contracting assessments out to non-statutory agencies that are registered with the Adoption Board and which have the appropriate expertise.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that increasing numbers of adopted children from abroad create additional pressures on intercountry adoption teams within the HSE.  This is because these teams provide post-adoption reports to the sending countries, at the request of those countries, with the agreement of the adoptive parents.  This is an important component in the willingness of countries to consider Irish applicants for adoption.</P>
        <P>At the request of the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, the HSE is undertaking a review of the intercountry adoption service.  This review is examining staffing, business processes, resources and there will be proposals to improve this service based on the outcome of the review.</P>
        <P>It is the Minister of State&rsquo;s view that the issue of waiting lists for adoption is far from simple, and he urges caution in discussing discrete aspects of intercountry adoption in isolation.  The Minister of State and each of his predecessors have introduced a range of measures to improve waiting times for intercountry adoption, which continue to be overtaken by the escalating demand.</P>
        <P>Adoption, particularly intercountry adoption, is different to having biological children.  It is different emotionally, socially and practically because of the international component and because of the legal processes and bureaucracy involved.  Although the assessment process can be lengthy, it is very important for prospective parents and children. The Minister of State and his officials are continuing to work closely with the HSE and the Adoption Board on the streamlining of services and the development and <Col N="942"/>implementation of best practice on a consistent basis around the country with a view to achieving improvements in the service.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Senator of the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system that is provided on a timely, fair and transparent basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been a Member of this House for a very long time but I do not believe I ever digested such rhubarb as was offered in that reply, which was unbelievable garbage.  I am extremely disappointed as it is no good to tell us there will be reviews of this, that and the other.  The next time this matter arises I hope the Minister of State will not wipe his hands of the issue, as happened today, because it is difficult due to the involvement of other regimes.  We need more than reviews as they are merely a political way of choosing inaction.  What will be done for potential parents who must sometimes wait for up to eight years?  There is a clog in the system and the Irish bureaucracy is at fault.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply offers no comfort whatever.  Perhaps she could ask the Minister for Health and Children what action will be taken immediately by the Health Service Executive to remove this blockage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House.  I propose to raise a number of issues concerning the new grant system introduced by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, which I wholeheartedly welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2007, the Minister of State completed a review of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant, essential repair grant, and special housing aid for the elderly schemes operated by the Health Service Executive.  A revised grant framework has been introduced with the objective of providing a more seamless set of responses to the housing needs of older people and people with disabilities.  In effect, the disabled person&rsquo;s grant has been replaced by the housing adaptation grant for people with disabilities.  Grants of up to &euro;30,000 <Col N="943"/>are available under this scheme, which has been welcomed by elderly people and their representative organisations.  The mobility aid grant of up to &euro;6,000 covers up to 100% of the costs of work done.  The essential repair grant and special housing aid for the elderly schemes, which were previously administered by the Health Service Executive, have been amalgamated in the housing aid for older people scheme, which provides grants of up to &euro;10,500 towards the costs of works.  All the revised schemes, which came into effect on 1 November 2007, are administered by local authorities which assumed responsibility for the special housing aid for the elderly scheme from the HSE, although the scheme will continue until 31 March 2008.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s proactive approach to simplifying the housing grant schemes and making them more user friendly.  Notwithstanding this, I ask him to consider simplifying the application forms for the schemes because I am receiving many queries from elderly people who have received letters from their local authorities seeking additional information or clarification because certain information was not provided when the application forms were submitted.  Owing to the complexity of the new scheme and the administrative work associated with it, some elderly people do not furnish the additional information and, unfortunately, are denied the grant.  Despite this, I praise the Minister of State&rsquo;s proactive approach to these welcome schemes which will benefit many people.</P>
        <P>I strongly impress on the Minister of State the vital importance of not terminating the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which has delivered major benefits to many elderly people in recent decades.  The scheme allows individuals to have emergency repairs carried out on their homes under flexible terms and work carried out under it offered value for money and allowed many elderly people to stay in their own homes for longer than otherwise would have been the case.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to terminate the scheme.  To give an example of its benefits, 250 elderly people in County Donegal availed of it in 2007 and I am informed that all the work carried out provided value for money and represented a good deal for the taxpayer and the elderly people in question.  In some cases, they were able to get contractors who were not C2 registered to carry out the work on a short-term basis.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to comment on the possibility of simplifying the application forms for housing grants and on whether he will decline to terminate the special housing aid for the elderly scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to discuss the new framework of housing adaptation grant schemes, which my Department introduced on 1 November 2007, and the issue of the transfer of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme from the HSE to my Department.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their homes by older people and people with a disability my Department recently completed a review of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes.  A primary aim of the review was to streamline the administrative and operational procedures governing the schemes to facilitate easier and quicker access by applicants to the grants available.</P>
        <P>In introducing the new framework of grant schemes I have been very much aware of the needs of some of the more vulnerable members of our community.  In this context, I have introduced standardised schemes across all local authority areas.  This has resulted in the removal of the inconsistencies and inequities which had existed in the application and approval process.  I have streamlined the application process, including through the introduction of standardised application forms which all local authorities are required to use, the introduction of panels of contractors to assist applicants in sourcing quotes and the standardisation of costs to ensure transparency for all applicants.  Furthermore, to ensure applicants are not subject to undue delays in accessing occupational therapy assessment, revised and simplified arrangements have been established.</P>
        <P>Applicants who are experiencing difficulties with grant applications can access the customer care support offered by individual local authorities, including through lo-call customer care telephone services and customer care desks.  I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor the new schemes in consultation with local authorities to ensure the application process is as simple and user friendly as possible.</P>
        <P>As regards the transfer of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme to my Department, the Senator will be aware that, following a recommendation which arose from the core functions of the health service report, the Government decided in February 2006 that a more integrated service would be achieved by transferring responsibility for the special housing aid for the elderly scheme from the HSE to my Department.  It has been always understood that the transfer of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme from the HSE to the local authority sector would pose significant challenges.  In recognition of this and to ensure the satisfactory resolution of all <Col N="945"/>outstanding issues, including staffing arrangements and the practical operation of the scheme on the ground, it has been agreed with the HSE that the special housing aid for the elderly scheme will continue to operate and be administered by the HSE until such time as all outstanding issues arising from the transfer are fully and satisfactorily resolved.  In the meantime, my Department continues to work closely with the HSE and local authorities to achieve a smooth and seamless transfer of the scheme.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>I am particularly aware that the integrity and the holistic and flexible nature of the scheme must be maintained under the new regime and, in this context, specific mechanisms will be implemented in order that the needs of the more vulnerable members of our older community, such as those suffering from illiteracy, social exclusion and isolation are addressed.  I am confident the new arrangements will provide a more integrated and comprehensive response to the needs of older people.</P>

	<P>Rarely in my relatively short career as a politician have I received such a number of telephone calls, e-mails or letters as I have on this matter.  I have been in touch with a number of very concerned parents in Glenamaddy in north-east Galway about a commitment given by the Minister for Education and Science and her Department in 2001 that planning for a new community school in Glenamaddy could go ahead immediately.  A funding commitment was also given with the funding to be accessed once other aspects of the school planning process were complete.</P>
        <P>The school was designed, a site was acquired and planning permission was sought and acquired.  A tendering process was put in place and a contractor was appointed.  The planning permission is due to expire in June.  The people of Glenamaddy and its hinterland are becoming increasingly concerned that the commitment made in 2001 will not be honoured.  We are getting to a point where the planning permission will be invalid and a new planning process must be engaged in.</P>
        <P>Politicians often wonder why people are becoming increasingly cynical about politics and the political process.  It is no wonder such cynicism exists and is growing when a commitment given in 2001 that a new school was about to be put in place has yet to be honoured in 2008.</P>
        <P>One parent put it very well in an e-mail she sent me last week which stated:</P>
<Col N="946"/>
        <P LI="1">How can the teachers in Glenamaddy community school teach science without a proper purpose built science room?  How can new curricula truly be implemented?  Our children will have to imagine rather than explore, investigate, experiment, test or analyse.  The same is true of other subjects &mdash; art, languages, engineering.  Why should the children of Glenamaddy and surrounding areas not get the education to which they are entitled in Glenamaddy?</P>
        <P LI="1">My oldest child is in fifth class, I first heard talk of the new school bulling when she was in junior infants.  I think she and the children of Glenamaddy have waited long enough.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will the Minister of State clarify the Department&rsquo;s commitment to providing a new school in Glenamaddy?  I would be grateful for a swift and honest response.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the provision of a new community school for Glenamaddy, County Galway.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to build a new community school in Glenamaddy with a floor area of approximately 5,200 sq. m. to cater for a long term projected enrolment of 550 pupils.  This new school is to cater for the amalgamation of St. Joseph&rsquo;s convent school and the vocational school.  The amalgamated school is housed on the site of St Joseph&rsquo;s convent school in a mixture of temporary and permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>Tenders were originally received for the proposed new school in 2004.  However, owing to delays acquiring the site under the redress scheme it was not possible to accept a tender at that time.  The project was re-tendered in 2007 and a tender report for the project is being reviewed by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Under the lifetime of the national development plan approximately &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  Approximately &euro;600 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments over the next few years.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building <Col N="947"/>and modernisation programme.  The project referred to by the Senator likewise will be considered in that context.  I give the assurance that the Minister and her Department are committed to providing a new community school for Glenamaddy at the earliest possible date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  It is reasonably encouraging.  I impress upon him the urgency of this matter as the planning permission runs out in the middle of this year.  The planning process for serious infrastructure such as a new school is quite convoluted and the community of Glenamaddy would not like to have to start the planning process again.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme, <Col N="948"/>during recent months when making inquiries on behalf a number of schools in east Galway departmental officials told me they were instructed by the Minister to prioritise new school building programmes on the east coast of the country.  While I welcome this as communities on the east coast are devoid of any school facilities, it should not and must not be done to the detriment of schools in the west and pupils being educated in sub-standard and unsafe schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is well aware of the needs of educational facilities in areas outside the greater Dublin area.  This matter has been brought to her attention and she is cognisant of this fact.</P>
