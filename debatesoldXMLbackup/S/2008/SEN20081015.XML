	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to appoint a new chairperson to Cork Airport Authority and to publish the Cork Airport business plan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to improve services for cyclists in Dublin city centre.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the retention and enhancement of the colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the outstanding issues that remain for the colposcopy service at Letterkenny to attain the HSE recognition and the way in which these can be overcome.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and Senators Buttimer and Ross&rsquo;s matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doherty and Keaveney have raised a similar matter and I ask them to share time.  It will also be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on unemployment to be taken at the conclusion at the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the end of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons or leaders; and No. 2 statements on budget 2009 to be taken not earlier than 4 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m. <Col N="470" /> Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time.  The business of the House will be interrupted between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader clarify how the banking scheme and regulations debate will be dealt with in the House?  The D&aacute;il will deal with it between 10.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Friday.  Senators would like the Minister for Finance to be present during the debate.  Rather than pressing an amendment to the Order of Business, will the Leader clarify, either this morning or tomorrow morning, how it will be dealt with?</P>
        <P>Every Senator will have an opportunity to speak on the budget but it can be said unequivocally that the Government is using every taxpayer in the country to bail it out of the bad decisions and mismanagement we have seen in the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Every taxpayer is being asked to bail out the Government.  Elderly citizens were promised medical cards, which are being withdrawn, and they are being asked to bail out the Government.  Parents are being asked to bail out the Government through increased class sizes for their children.  Small businesses were given nothing in yesterday&rsquo;s budget and they are struggling to retain their staff but they are also being asked to bail out the Government.  Everyone who drives a car is being asked to bail out the Government.  All over the country people are bailing out the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>We have witnessed U-turns on policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be an opportunity later for all Senators to contribute on the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, I cannot let the day pass without mentioning the Government U-turns on policy, whether they relate to class size, decentralisation or the medical card for the over 70s, which bought the 2002 general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Senators are quiet.</P>

	<P>Senator Buttimer is not sitting in a council chamber now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Taxpayers will bail out all of those decisions.  There is no reform in the budget.  It is unfortunate that we may again listen to the Minister using the same words to deal with the problems in the economy.</P>
        <P>Worst of all is the lack of investment in the future and children.  What will happen to the family in Lucan trying to pay for or find child care?  Instead of having discretionary money to pay for child care or tutorials, they are being asked to bail out the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government because of its excessive spending and lack of reforms and value for money in the past ten years.  Every taxpayer will bail out the Government of its poor decisions and management.  Every Senator will have an opportunity to speak on this debate today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel wasted.  I spent one career trying to reduce class sizes and another trying to keep the minimum wage out of the tax net.  In one short speech yesterday, the Minister <Col N="471" />turned on its head a large amount of good, hard, committed and energetic work done by many people over the years.  It will return to haunt the Government.</P>
        <P>There is nothing wrong with the 1% and 2% income levies.  Asking people such as ourselves to pay more is fine and cannot be argued with.  It is a question of the poor, the old, the lonely and the sick.  People who had medical cards will no longer have them, older people will have more to worry about and younger people will be shoved into larger classes.  As in the case of the Lisbon treaty, instead of dealing with an issue in a straightforward manner, the Government has created seven different oppositions in terms of the over 70s, education and so on.  The fine print will return to haunt us.</P>
        <P>When the budget&rsquo;s provisions come into effect, a local school may lose a staff member.  While people would get used to this, there will no longer be cover for teachers on sick leave until such time as they get doctors&rsquo; certification.  That certification would not be a problem, but it would rarely be acquired on the first day.  There will be chaos in schools for small money.  It would have been better to take a cleaner approach.  If a 2% levy is necessary above the minimum wage level, so be it.  The Government should revisit some of the budget&rsquo;s dafter parts, which will worry and upset people unnecessarily.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Budget Statement, many of us were hoping for a bold and innovative set of measures to rescue the country from its current economic situation.  We got nothing of the sort.  Instead, we got the launch of a number of liferafts by the Government to try to save the economy.</P>
        <P>I will either disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole concerning the levy or nuance some of his comments.  While this matter can be dealt with during the debate, it is worth mentioning.  Recently, the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s party leader, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, appeared to advocate higher taxes for the higher paid, the rich and the super rich, with which I agree.  He stated that he would try to achieve such in Government, in which respect I would have supported him.  Regrettably, he did not achieve it.  The levy represents the crudest, most regressive and most dishonest tax increase ever seen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks and months, I wondered whether the inevitable tax increases would arrive before or after the final demise of the Progressive Democrats.  The increases arrived just beforehand.  It is a tax increase, yet the Government dares not speak its name.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others are correct regarding the 2% levy.  If we want to go after higher earners, which I would advocate, we should do so in an honest way.  Let us face up to the taxation system and the dishonesty and unfairness therein.  However, the Government appears to want to have it both ways.  The Government is telling us to leave the debate on equality and equity of tax, in principle, to the Commission on Taxation next year, but it then introduces an extraordinarily regressive tax, undermining any suggestion of equity in the taxation system.  We should face up to taxation and to the questions of how to match the public services we want with taxation, how to levy tax and from whom.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to several measures in the budget, but we will have an opportunity to revert to them.  The cuts in services for children and education are the most serious and regressive of the Government&rsquo;s decisions.  It will cut child benefit payments in half and then remove them in respect of people above the age of 18 years.  It will increase university registration fees substantially, effectively re-introducing tuition fees by the back door.  The decision to abolish the Combat Poverty Agency, which has done considerable independent <Col N="472" />work in the past two decades to identify poverty in society, is outrageous.  It appears that the Government does not want independent voices raised on poverty and related issues.</P>
        <P>My colleagues opposite always look in a forlorn way and wonder whether I have anything positive to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two positive comments.  Since it may be due to the input of the Green Party, given that it is a decision consistent with the party&rsquo;s position prior to the election, I congratulate the Government on finally ending the sham of the so-called decentralisation programme.  It is a welcome move and I congratulate the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government appears to have embraced the notion of performance-related pay.  Members of the Government have taken 10% cuts, presumably based on their performances in recent months.  I hope that they will revert to the House in the coming months regarding proposals on the inevitable further cuts in pay that they will need to take.  The ultimate cut that they should take is not 10% or 20%.  Rather, it is 100%.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Send them packing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the example set by the Opposition when it was in power, yesterday would have been an interesting story had we not been in Government.  I say this despite all of the details of what the Opposition believes the Government did wrong yesterday.</P>

	<P>I will.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="473" />
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senators do not stop, I will adjourn.  They should listen to what people have to say.  If I believe something is out of place, I will stop them.  If they do not abide by this, we will adjourn.  Senators cannot with argue one another across the floor.  It will not continue.  I will ask those who start arguing like that to leave.  Senator Keaveney without interruption and on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In welcoming the additional money for disability, mental health and suicide prevention services, I note the 125 additional therapy posts.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State with responsibility for the Health Professions Council, Deputy Moloney, to the Seanad this session?  We could consider having creative arts therapies, including music therapy, officially recognised.</P>
        <P>Recently, I read an international newspaper in which it was reported that the European Commission has made &euro;120 million available to assist countries with a poor record in teaching second languages in school.  We do not have a poor record in this regard.  Will we be attempting to draw down some of this European funding in having our schools assisted in teaching foreign languages as indicated by the availability of &euro;120 million from the European Commission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the increase in capitation to help with the day-to-day costs of running schools, a point every speaker made during the debate on the Fine Gael motion on underfunding of primary education.  It is not as much as we would like but it is a step in the right direction.  I am flabbergasted, however, by the increase in pupil-teacher ratio.  It should have been an untouchable for a Minister with responsibility for education.  Irish children are now officially in the largest classes of the 27 EU countries.  It will mean no jobs for 400 new teachers, 200 at primary level and 200 at secondary level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a question for the Leader?  We will have statements on the budget later today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the cruellest cut of all because it affects children&rsquo;s learning and their life chances in a highly competitive world.  As a result of this cut in the pupil-teacher ratio, I ask urgently for a debate with the Minister for Education and Science on learning outcomes and the factors that affect it.  This move shows he does not understand the importance of learning outcomes and the effects on the child and the nation.  We did well on underfunding but clearly the Minister does not realise the link with learning outcomes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We should put forward helpful suggestions for the finance Bill that will be published.</P>

	<P>Is there a question for the Leader? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the contribution, or lack of, from the Opposition, it is fortunate that Fine Gael and the Labour Party did not get into government last May because we would have had great difficulties if they had.  The country would have been broken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is broken now.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be a question, not a suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="474" />
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;was that non-residents who are not paying tax in this country should be taxed at the highest possible rate.  Let the airport tax be the method of finding out when they arrive back and we can slap a high tax on every one of them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with colleagues in welcoming the debate on the budget.  One of the most critical issues is the one which Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White raised.  I am perfectly happy to pay the 1% levy and, if my income goes over &euro;100,000 to pay 2%.  It is totally appropriate and I have no quarrel with it but Senator White is 100% right in saying that this is a vicious tax.  There must be a lower limit.  I applaud the higher limit but how can we expect people under &euro;35,000 to pay 1%?  This is cutting into what they pay on food, heating and education of their children.  This House should urge a lower limit beneath which people pay nothing at all.  If necessary, the tax should be raised for the rest of us.  We can afford it, they cannot.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have received information from D&oacute;chas that the 0.7% target in overseas development aid will be reached during the specified time.  That is good but the problem is that this is dislodging attention from other issues.  We are properly concerned with the international financial situation and its repercussions in Ireland but there are other matters around the world.  I would like a debate on the situation in Zimbabwe.  It is quite extraordinary but, alas, predictable that Robert Mugabe is doing what some of us felt he might.  He is outflanking Morgan Tsvangirai by grabbing the three most significant ministries &mdash; defence, security and finance &mdash; and then offering to dump finance onto Morgan Tsvangirai in a trade-off.  This is very serious and if we believe in democracy, we need to examine this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on the budget later this afternoon and on the Finance Bill when that comes to the House.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the budget in light of comments made by Senators on the Opposition side.  I welcome the budget, which was a brave and decisive step taken by the Minister for Finance in challenging economic times.  If an alternative Government had been in place which proposed to increase spending by &euro;14 billion in the 2007 general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I welcome and call for a debate on the schools building programme.  I welcome the additional allocation of &euro;75 million announced in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.  It will assist primary, secondary and third level educational development.  There is an opportunity to seek value for money in schools building projects for the years ahead.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to address the issue of obtaining value for money from developers who have done very well over the past ten years given the economic circumstances?  I welcome the &euro;200 holiday homes charge for second homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I call for a debate on the fishing industry.  We were to have a debate prior to the recess in the summer.  My colleague from Cork, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, is anxious to have this debate.  Not only should we consider salmon and sea fishermen but also inland fishermen, especially those along the River Foyle in the Lifford and St. Johnston areas who find themselves in a distressing position.  I call for this debate in the next week or two.  The industry is in a difficult position and we should discuss and support its position.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We heard this week about a run of people taking food from the shops and worrying whether there was enough currency to meet import bills.  This was not in Zimbabwe but in Iceland, a developed economy like our own.  People in that country have a very high standard of living in one of the countries of the First World, a major OECD member and a first member of many organisations and groups set up to develop world economies.  This country, however, has been affected by the crisis in the financial markets.  If a country such as Iceland, or our jobs here, or those around the world, can be affected by people who make decisions, surely those decisions must be regulated.</P>
        <P>Now that we have a global financial market, regulations must be introduced and we should have a say in how the global markets are run.  Where did the simple principle go whereby a bank borrowed on the basis of the amount of deposits it had?  From where did all the off-balance sheet borrowing come?  It is not prudent lending and we must get back to the original principle.  The practice has put at risk western economies and those throughout the world, including fragile ones.  One would never have thought of Iceland as a fragile economy.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to pass on our commendation to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan.  His budget was one that many of us will be quick to claim in difficult times.  The 8.4% increase in social welfare spending at a time when there is a shortfall of billions is a credit to this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others I look forward to the debate we will have later today on the budget.  We must have honesty in this debate and also an element of realism.  Contrary to what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, we do not have a low-tax economy.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We certainly do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us refer to the income levy in terms of what it is, an increase in general taxation.  It has been perpetrated on those who earn the lowest wage in our economy.  It is an attack on the vulnerable and the lower paid and is a symptom, as Senator Buttimer said, of 11 years of greed.</P><Col N="477" />
        <P>Now that the Government has increased taxation by 1% will the Leader prevail upon the Minister for Finance to be honest in how he approaches that?  He must stop calling it an income levy and call it an increase in income tax.  Does the Leader agree with the prevailing view on the removal of medical cards from those over 70 years of age?  This is another attack on the most vulnerable.  It was an initiative introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also have a question on the budget although I know we will have a debate.  This budget is mean, nasty and sneaky.  It is mean in terms of the 1% levy because this is regressive.  It is nasty in terms of the increase in an array of health charges.  It is sneaky in many respects, particularly the one by which one must qualify for health benefits.  That is at the micro level.  Many of the sneaky elements were not in the Minister&rsquo;s speech yesterday but are found in the small print.  </P>
        <P>On the macro level the big problems are not resolved, namely, the issue of public finances.  We will still increase borrowing by &euro;2 billion in 2009 and we will borrow for current spending.  I remember the Haughey years of high spending before the Fine Gael Governments led by Garret FitzGerald came into power and put things right.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>What about the shoes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Leader remembers those years well.  That was the cause of the problems in our public finances.  We will have a doubling of the national debt over two years.  We will also exceed by over 100% the 3% borrowing limit against GDP.  We will increase inflation, reduce growth and increase unemployment.  Does the Leader agree with this assessment of the impact of the budget on the individual and on the general economic level?  </P>
        <P>I raised a question last week regarding the guarantee scheme.  Last week the Government stated that it could not return the guarantee scheme to the Oireachtas for debate because it first had to go to Brussels.  Now that it has been agreed by the European Commission, the Government claims it cannot be changed and therefore we cannot have any meaningful debate in the Oireachtas.  The Government bypasses the democratic process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and the scrutiny by this House of decisions made which have European implications.  The Leader should explain why the scheme was not brought back to the Seanad for debate last week.  We might have pointed to further frailties in it as we did in respect of the State aid and discrimination aspects when it was first introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget is most regrettable and regressive, as other speakers on this side have said.  There is an immense amount of hardship and pain to be suffered, much of it hidden in small print and in back door measures.  There will be a slow burn of anger as people realise the true impact of the budget on them, their incomes and their family and household incomes.  We will see a long-term impact, unfortunately. </P>
        <P Just="Left">One element has not been highlighted although some speakers have touched upon it.  It deserved to be highlighted and we should debate it because it appears to be a new and especially regressive policy of the Minister and of this Government.  That policy is to do away <Col N="478" />with universal social benefits and instead to introduce means testing.  The Minister has introduced means testing for those over 70 years of age in respect of health benefits and has effectively introduced means testing for other social benefits and separate elements.  He abolished the child care supplements for children over five and a half years of age and child benefit payments for students over 18 and has introduced a vastly increased student registration charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is for the budget debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question and it is of particular concern.  The Minister has asked the Commission on Taxation to examine more generally the payment of universal child benefit.  Does this mean he will extend this apparent attack on universal benefit provision in a most regrettable way to child benefit payments?  As legislators we deserve to know this and if it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention we should have a debate on the matter.  If that is the case, it should be a matter of grave concern to all of us.  It is a most regressive measure to start means testing for all sorts of State benefits and it will lead to greater inequity and inequality.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on youth justice.  At this time of cutbacks and closures it is important that the House should debate what will happen to young offenders who are a particularly vulnerable group.  In that context, I and Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke will co-host a seminar on youth justice tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. in the audiovisual room.  The meeting will be addressed by a leading academic expert in the field from University College Cork and will be facilitated by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  All colleagues are welcome and I urge Senators to come along, even for a short time, or to send assistants if they wish to learn about development in the difficult area of youth justice or whether plans to build Thornton Hall and children detention centres will proceed in the current economic climate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader outline the sitting arrangements for the remainder of this week and, if possible, next week?  While I welcome the debate on the budget scheduled for this afternoon, the matter of crucial importance at this time, one which has been alluded to by colleagues, is the guarantee scheme provided for under Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 passed by the Oireachtas several weeks ago.  The continuing delay in this regard is creating uncertainty.  When will we have sight of the details of the scheme and when will the House debate it?  This matter cannot be put off.  As Senator Fitzgerald noted, it is also important that the Minister be present for the debate.  I ask the Leader, as the Government representative in the House, to outline his knowledge of the detail of the scheme.  However, the sooner we have a copy of the document, the better.</P>
        <P>On the budget, it will be important to make a suitable amendment in the Finance Bill to exclude all those earning the minimum wage from the levy on earnings.  Government Members will share the widespread view that this group should have been excluded from this savage attack on incomes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Reilly who called for a debate on nursing homes and the fair deal scheme on the Order of Business yesterday.  If the legislation, which is ready, is not to be introduced to the House until the new year, will the Leader accommodate Senators by having a debate on the issue?</P>
        <P>I welcome the additional &euro;55 million allocated to the nursing home scheme in yesterday&rsquo;s budget as an indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the elderly.  I will elaborate on this during this afternoon&rsquo;s debate on the budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my appreciation to the Leader for allowing a three hour debate on the budget within 24 hours of the Budget Statement.  For this reason, I propose to be obedient for a change and avoid speaking on yesterday&rsquo;s events.  Until yesterday, I had not heard of &ldquo;egging&rdquo;, a form of anti-social behaviour engaged in, I gather, by people from all social backgrounds.  I will cite an e-mail I received yesterday in which a man describes the effects of a case of egging. It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">What happened was that a 16 year old youth threw an egg from a car at my wife in a totally random stupid act.  The egg hit her in the face and the shell was propelled into her eye, splitting her eyeball and blinding her for life.  She spent nine days in hospital where they were able to repair the damage to the eye without removing it.  However, the eye, five months on, is shrunken and it is very possible that, within 6 months, she will have to have her eye removed.  This is all because some idiots think it&rsquo;s funny to throw eggs at people.</P>
        <P LI="1">Anyway, the reason for my email is that they were able to throw the eggs because there is no restriction on the sale of eggs in shops.  These kids call into shops and buy 24, 48 eggs at a go and nothing else.  If shopkeepers took it upon themselves to refuse the sale in these obvious scenarios, it may do something to reduce the occurrences of these eggings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Apparently, this practice is comparatively common and regarded as good fun among teenagers.  I am not sure what the House can do about it other than to publicise the damage it caused in the case I describe.</P>
        <P>To return to one of my hobby horses, Ireland should adopt central European time as it would give us one extra hour of daylight all year around.  Progress was being made in this regard until Portugal decided some years ago to switch from central European time to Greenwich mean time.  The reason I raise this issue is I read in a newspaper report this morning that Jersey will have a referendum on adopting central European time.  I hope we will follow suit in the years ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I will comment briefly on the budget, about which many Senators have spoken.  We were all prepared for a budget that would not be easy.  In difficult economic times hard choices have to be made.  It will be helpful in the coming weeks and months, when various Ministers come before the House, to question them about the priorities they highlighted in their budget allocations and choices.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the positive aspects of the budget because we are hearing a great deal of critical commentary.  Most of those criticising the budget are aware of the difficult circumstances in which the decisions were made.  It is important to balance their views by commenting on the positive aspects of the budget decisions.  For example, in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government investment in water services has increased to the highest level ever.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Is the Leader concerned that the many exhortations made by a number of Senators, of whom I am proud to be one, to resolve the financial crisis without harming those on lower incomes and the weaker sections of the community have been ignored?  Will he raise this issue in government to ensure an amendment, as proposed by Senator Coghlan, is made to remove the income levy from the lower paid, that is, those earning less than &euro;35,000 per annum?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Norris and Coghlan both proposed that an amendment should be made.  It is unthinkable that one would impose a 1% levy on the income of a home help working on virtually the minimum wage to provide a vital service that keeps people out of institutional care or on the outdoor staff of our hospitals and local authorities. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>These groups will also be adversely affected by the 0.5% increase in the VAT rate, which will diminish their income.</P>
        <P>I have a specific question on an issue of immense concern of which the Leader must be aware.  In rural areas, especially the area I represent, people do not have access to public transport infrastructure, for example, a railway or comprehensive bus service, to take them to work.  An 8 cent increase in the price of a litre of petrol effectively amounts to a tax on work and will have serious implications.  This decision must be reviewed.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader consider having a debate on the Government&rsquo;s failure to protect poorer members of the community in the budget?  This matter needs to be addressed immediately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments about the &ldquo;egging&rdquo; of people.  I was struck by what he said about this behaviour.  It highlighted that the activity known as &ldquo;egging&rdquo; has become a sinister and insidious form of bullying of people in their homes and neighbourhoods.  It may be difficult to address it, but the Senator said that if a group of young people come into a shop to buy a large number of eggs, the retailer might use some common sense, particularly as we approach Hallowe&rsquo;en.  A number of people have approached me recently following their houses having been egged and told me of the damage caused by it and of their children having been egged on their way home.  This is sinister, bullying and intimidating behaviour.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of legislation on mental capacity.  Our existing legislation is flawed and deficient.  It has resulted in a number of citizens with intellectual disability and mental health challenges having their basic human rights infringed upon.  It will increasingly become <Col N="481" />an issue for us, particularly for people with age related disorders as they become older.  It has become an issue in the context of the new Fair Deal scheme.  We were promised the introduction of new legislation on mental capacity and I understand it is currently being drafted.  Will the Leader indicate if it will be introduced in this session?  I ask him to stress to the Minister the urgency of the situation.</P>

    <Title>Unemployment Levels: Statements </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is timely, coming as it does during challenging times for economies across the globe.  The recent increase in the numbers on the live register is an unwelcome illustration of the challenge that lies ahead in steering the economy through what are undoubtedly challenging times.  I want to outline the specific measures that the Government is taking to ensure that this country does not return to the era of long-term unemployment and emigration on a large scale. </P>
        <P>As the current live register figures indicate, the economic downturn has already affected many.  In bringing forward yesterday&rsquo;s budget by six weeks the Government recognised that further measures will need to be taken to bring stability to the economy and create an environment which will allow those who have lost their jobs to quickly return to the labour market.  Against this background, I want to detail the assistance the Government is providing to ensure that those who have lost their jobs receive the right supports to help them return quickly to employment.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate it is important that the Government and its agencies provide proactive support to those affected by job losses.  With this in mind the Government is working closely with its employment and training authority, F&Aacute;S, to offer a range of services, supports and programmes to help those in our workforce to both return to the labour market and remain in it.  For those who have recently become unemployed, F&Aacute;S is liaising closely with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in responding to the rising numbers on the live register.  This involves more intensive arrangements with the local employment services to increase their capacity to deal with the increasing live register referrals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It also involves an increase in the number of short, flexible relevant training courses to equip those who have been made redundant with the necessary skills to enable them to obtain alternative employment as soon as possible. This is particularly important at present in the context of the rapid slowdown in the construction sector where F&Aacute;S is focusing on the provision of retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers, for alternative and emerging areas, such as sustainable and environmental technologies.  I want to emphasise that with regard to apprentices in the crafts area of construction, in particular, F&Aacute;S has been adapting a new model whereby they can come off training, while allowing them to continue with their apprenticeships.  We want to ensure they can complete their training and leave with certification.  In the context of yesterday&rsquo;s budget, provision was made for that area in terms of ring-fencing for apprenticeships in the craft areas of construction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The measures taken by F&Aacute;S to assist redundant workers are, in co-ordination with our enterprise agencies, tailored specifically to urgently address the education and skills needs of individuals affected by any company contraction or closure.  There are those who, for a variety of reasons, have, over time, become distanced from the labour market.  That is why programmes such as the community employment scheme are so important in offering a roadmap back to work, through the provision of specific active schemes within local communities that break the <Col N="486" />cycle of long-term inactivity and instead offer individuals on a fixed-term basis the chance to reintegrate into a daily working regime.  These programmes also help in the development of both technical and personal skills.  There are almost 22,500 people on the community employment scheme and it is worth pointing out that the Government is investing &euro;377 million this year to maintain overall numbers at this level while at the same time operating a degree of flexibility in order to both maximise the number of those successfully progressing to the labour market and support the work being carried out in local communities.</P>
        <P>The importance of upskilling in the context of the economy&rsquo;s competitiveness cannot be overstated.  The skills of our workforce will need to be able to adapt quickly to meet the challenges posed by a rapidly shifting global economic market.</P>
        <P>The participation of ever greater numbers of our population in lifelong learning is essential to ensuring that this country&rsquo;s economy remains adaptable against the background of the type of economic challenges that we face today.  Again, when we look at what has happened in the context of the financial credit crisis and volatility on the stock markets, these are indications of the level of uncertainty that exists.  This phenomenon could continue for some time in terms of the lack of credit available for companies and small investors.  It can put enormous pressures on the economy.  It is important therefore that we continually emphasise the need for upskilling and training.  Life-long learning is part and parcel of that and I encourage people, regardless of where they are on the educational ladder, to continue to pursue it.  Again, this is something that we have been encouraging over many years.</P>
        <P>Through individually tailored training programmes run both by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets, the Government is demonstrating its commitment to life-long learning for our workforce.  We must all embrace this aspiration, individuals and social partners  alike, if this  country is to successfully meet the economic challenges of the future.</P>
        <P>I indicated earlier the role played by our enterprise agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards, alongside F&Aacute;S, in the event of company contractions or closures. The continued development of our enterprise sector is, even in unpredictable economic times such as these, vital for fostering the growth of Irish companies and positioning them to compete strongly in global markets.</P>
        <P>The development of Irish-owned companies has been pivotal to the economic growth and prosperity that this country has enjoyed over the last decade.  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated in the D&aacute;il last week, over 250,000 small businesses operate in our economy employing approximately 800,000 people.  There is little doubt that Ireland&rsquo;s future wealth will depend to a significant extent on the further development of these enterprises.  Productive, sustainable and export driven businesses that develop and embrace cutting-edge technologies within a supportive operating environment are essential for further business growth, whether on a local or national scale.</P>
        <P>I am confident, but certainly not complacent, that the measures taken by this Government on research and development and business regulation as well as our highly supportive tax regime will encourage the emergence of new business creations and facilitate long-term business survival.  Certainly, the figures in the 2007 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report for Ireland, of 2,700 individuals setting up a new business each month, are encouraging.</P>
        <P>Investment into Ireland is also central to our economy&rsquo;s continued development.  We have a light regulatory system and supportive tax regime and that was emphasised by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech yesterday.  He outlined what we are doing in the context of the current tax regime.  He also placed a strong emphasis on the commitment to ensure that corporation tax will not go above 12.5% in the lifetime of this Government.  We should speak about <Col N="487" />that commitment because, globally, our competitors often try to undermine the advantages we have in terms of a highly educated, mobile and skilled workforce.  Our corporation tax regime is a central plank to our policy in terms of attracting inward investment.  It is important Senators highlight that whenever they get the opportunity to do so.  With more than 1,000 operating companies and 136,000 people employed in the foreign direct investment sector, we have an excellent record of attracting quality investment into this country compared to other developed nations.</P>
        <P>Through the work of our inward investment agency, the IDA, Ireland is winning high-value foreign direct investment in new cutting-edge business areas, including the Internet and media sectors.  The establishment of Amazon, eBay and Yahoo in Ireland are good examples of recent investments and the announcement earlier this month by the social networking site, Facebook, that it is to establish its headquarters in Dublin continues this encouraging trend.</P>
        <P>In the first half of 2008, IDA Ireland announced 22 investments with a capital investment of &euro;916 million and a potential to create approximately 1,600 jobs.  This compares very favourably with similar figures for 2007 which, in itself, included the winning of more than 100 new investments.  I am confident that Ireland is well-positioned to continue to secure leading new investment projects over the medium term.</P>
        <P>I am also confident that in keeping a collective focus on upskilling and lifelong learning and the continuing development of Ireland into a genuine knowledge economy, we can continue to look forward to similar investments into this country such as those made in the last year by Google and Glaxosmithkline.  However, it will be important to concentrate not only on the number of jobs created by inward investment into this country but also on the quality and the scope of the employment created and, in particular, its potential for adaptation to changing market conditions and long lasting growth.</P>
        <P>We have good reason to be optimistic despite the current economic turbulence and the slowdown caused by a number of factors, including, notably, the adjustment in the construction sector and the deterioration in the international environment.  True enough, the current slowdown represents the severest of challenges but we have faced and overcome challenges of this nature before.  The key difference now is that we approach this current turbulence from a stronger economic position that has been forged on a more focused emphasis on knowledge and expertise.  I am, therefore, confident that in this country, the right policies and conditions are in place to allow us to ride out the current storm and return to sustainable economic and employment growth levels in the medium term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech yesterday, we face challenging times internationally and we also face challenging times domestically due to the slowdown in the construction industry.  Those two issues have put huge pressures on the public finances.  The first measures were taken in July when we announced cuts, or savings, of &euro;400 million and &euro;1 billion in 2009.</P>

	<P>A Freudian slip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We call it as it is.  We like to be up-front and honest.  In the context of this budget, people generally accept that the challenges must be faced immediately.  We cannot put this on the long finger.  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il this morning that we are trying to ensure we restore stability to the public finances, that we remain competitive and that we do not create any hindrance to, or place any burden on, business and investment.  In the long term, the policies being pursued in this budget will be proved correct.   </P>
        <P>Nobody should be under any illusion but that this year and next year will be very challenging because of the international backdrop.  Rising commodity prices and fluctuating stock markets <Col N="488" />coupled with the credit squeeze have caused grave uncertainty.  As a small global open economy, we are very dependent on inward investment to stimulate growth and on our export markets.</P>
        <P>As announced this morning, unemployment in the United Kingdom has risen to 1.79 million.  That indicates there are huge pressures on the stronger economies, including Germany and others.  Across the European Union, many of our trading partners are under huge pressure and there are challenges in the context of inward investment in the case of the United States.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The IDA is actively promoting Ireland and we should use every opportunity to promote Ireland as a place in which to do business.  I mentioned earlier our corporation tax of 12.5% and our light regulatory framework.  Year after year many international surveys show that Ireland is a very competitive place in which to do business.  Our best selling point is that we have a flexible, highly mobile and highly educated workforce, which we must continue to ensure.  When we talk about flexi-security in the context of flexibility in the workplace and security of employment, we must ensure we get the dynamic right and that we are not too inflexible and too securitised.</P>
        <P>I will welcome comments from Senators and look forward to hearing their views.</P>

        <P>The Minister of State will have no difficulty generously accepting that the corporation tax rate of 12.5% was an initiative of the John Bruton-led rainbow Government and one of the key pillars in the creation of the Celtic tiger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator is looking for praise, he invited the wrong Minister to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure he will generously accept that.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting the gravity of the situation with which we are confronted in regard to unemployment.  The live register is currently at 244,500, or 6.3% of the population.  We have an unemployment rate which is higher than that in the United States, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Poland, Singapore and South Korea among others.  The ESRI predicted last week that unemployment will reach 8% in 2009.  The number employed directly by the construction industry &mdash; this is a critical issue &mdash; fell by 17.9% from August 2007 to August 2008.  Between the beginning of 2001 and 2007, Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness against our trading partners has worsened by 35%.  Goods exports declined by 6% and manufacturing employment declined by 9%.  That is the backdrop to what we are discussing and it is extraordinarily serious.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate to note that yesterday&rsquo;s budget, rather than rectify the difficulty, will contribute to the problem.  The budget will drive down consumer confidence because of the increased tax rates.  The 1% levy on those earning below &euro;35,000 is a horrendous disincentive to going into the employment market and it is a penal tax on work.  Imagine a home help travelling from house to house keeping people out of institutional care looking at the prospect of a 1% levy on his or her income.  I appeal to the Minister to amend the Finance Bill to deal with this.  People will have less money to spend as a result of the budget.  There will be less cash in circulation with an obvious knock-on effect on business.</P>
        <P>The cut in the local government fund will put more pressure on local authorities to raise rates on businesses and make up the funding shortfall in this way with a consequent domino <Col N="489" />effect on employment.  The Fine Gael party is opposed to this.  The &euro;1 billion budget for F&Aacute;S is maintained in the budget, but there is no mention of reform or streamlining.  We need to be better placed to retrain people in our rapidly changing labour market.</P>
        <P>Another misconception in yesterday&rsquo;s budget relates to a matter to which I referred at some length during debate yesterday.  Yesterday&rsquo;s budget suggests the capital spend on the schools building programme is increased.  This is not the case.  It will change from &euro;285 million this year to &euro;281 million next year.  The reason there appears to be an increase is that the Minister included the third level capital programme in his figures.  Therefore the budget for the schools building programme has decreased in net terms.  This is critical because the schools building programme at primary and secondary level, particularly at primary level, offered the Government a wonderful opportunity to deal with the unemployment issue, particularly in the construction area.</P>
        <P>I suggest the Minister should re-examine this matter.  If, for example, he considers the cost of prefabs on school grounds, the cost of unemployment assistance for people displaced from the construction industry and takes on board that he can get good value for money on tenders and contracts from local builders if he uses the Department of Education and Science devolved grant scheme and that there would be a return in VAT to Revenue, the net cost of building a primary school could be very low, resulting in wonderful social and capital advantages for society.  The Minister lost the opportunity to do this in the budget.  When the detail of the Finance Bill is being worked out, the Minister should seriously consider using the schools building programme to create employment for unemployed construction workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person must be 12 months unemployed before being eligible for the back to education allowance.  This is an insane bureaucratic anti-employment and development requirement.  The sooner a person dislocated from employment can be helped return to education &mdash; there is potential to get an extra 6,000 people back into education &mdash; the more immediate the implications for improving the life of that person and the economy, ultimately saving in welfare payments.  The eligibility requirement therefore should be reversed and I appeal to the Minister to respond positively in this regard.  Retaining the 12-month requirement commits people to continued unemployment and demotivates them rather than inviting them back to education when still in a reasonable psychological state.  This must be addressed.  I suggest to the Minister that the back to education allowance should be increased because there is great potential in that.</P>
        <P>There is also great potential for the creation of employment in the green area.  We must have immediate retraining for unemployed construction workers.  The first objective should be to redeploy them on a school building programme, on worthwhile capital expenditure or development.  The Minister remarked that he saw merit in the community employment scheme and I commend him on that.  I agree with him as that scheme has done great good for the country.  However, I would like to see the community employment scheme expanded.  I am concerned about the three-year cap on community employment.  I am not sure there is logic in allowing people to work for only three years before letting them go.  People should be allowed remain on the scheme, but there should be continued efforts to bring them into the mainstream workforce.  It is wrong to sentence them to a third rate existence by removing them from the community employment scheme after a few years, just when they are beginning to feel empowered.</P>
        <P>While community employment and redeployment of construction workers have a vital role to play, we should seize the potential of green energy development and the green economy to provide employment to displaced people and to create new employment.  There is immense potential for retraining in this area.  People could be involved with energy audits in buildings and houses, with wind energy projects and with implementing alternative energy sources.  It is <Col N="490" />a pity the ESB is allowed continue to prevent the wind energy sector from supplying new green energy to the grid.  It should be much easier for small groups of farmers to come together and create a co-operative for wind energy development.  It also should be easier for industry to have its own micro wind generator.  These areas should be examined and the ESB should be challenged on its monopoly and competition created.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must return to the Government with the opinion of the Seanad that an opportunity was missed yesterday in the budget to deal in a positive sense with the unemployment issue.  There is too much acquiescence and acceptance of unemployment here and not enough effort is made to think outside the box.  We must think outside the box on the matter of school buildings, green energy, retraining and back to education.  We must also think outside the box with regard to putting a penal levy on the lowest paid, which is a disincentive to wanting to be in employment.  The Government must change in this regard.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government must be aware we no longer have the safety valve of emigration to deal with unemployment.  I have no empirical findings on this, but, anecdotally, the only country with potential for employment is Australia and it has a quota system in place and immigrants must have specific skills.  The option we had in olden days, when we could dump the problem onto our neighbour, no longer exists.  We will have to cope with unemployment within the country.  The welfare of the human beings involved is a significant issue.  There is potential for social revolution in the country if we do not deal with unemployment.  We must recognise that the nature of our unemployed has changed and they will not be as docile as they were in the past.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister not to miss the opportunity to take on board my suggestions about back to school education, green energy, school buildings and the disincentive to work at the lower end of the spectrum.  The Minister must consider imaginative ways to deal with unemployment.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.  This is one of the most serious debates this House will have for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House.  One of the fundamental indicators of our economy is the level of employment.  The most recent data available from the Central Statistics Office indicate employment has increased by 7,000 in the past 12 months, to a total number of people at work of more than 2.1 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When one reflects on the transformation of this great country over the past decade, one of the greatest dividends of the transformation is the number of people at work.   I listened to what Senator O&rsquo;Reilly had to say with regard to the live register.  He indicated the percentage of people on the register was the percentage of people unemployed.  The total number of people on the live register is around 240,000 but, as we all know, the live register is not a true reflection of unemployment, as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers.  However, what is noticeable is the acute increase in the number of people signing on.  This is a source of concern.</P>
        <P>Our economic performance in recent years reflects Government policies and investments and, more importantly, the commitment of our citizens, their education, their skills, their ability and their determination to meet the challenges and opportunities with which they are presented.  Through their hard work, innovation and success, Ireland has been established as a sound and vibrant economy energised by some of the most sophisticated industries and services in the world &mdash; as mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher &mdash; along with a strong entrepreneurial flair driving small and medium enterprises in every region.  Some argue that we have not made enough of this success.  I disagree.  Ireland has proved to be a good place to <Col N="491" />do business and we have achieved success beyond our measure.  We have been the European success story in recent years.</P>
        <P>We are now well aware of the uncertainty in the international economic environment and of the fact that our economy faces tough times ahead.  There are serious challenges to address.  No one underestimates the scale of the challenges that face us.  We are in uncharted economic territory and there are no easy solutions or quick fixes.  The greatest challenge right now is to manage the economy through these uncertain times, to take the correct decisive actions to protect the progress we have made and to prepare to benefit from the upturn when it comes.  We all need to sign up to the measures required to meet the challenge ahead, or we will lose our unity of purpose to improve the quality of life for all and our sense of national purpose.  There will be no agreement on what we are trying to achieve, and perhaps the most worrying change would be increasing negativity and disillusionment and a further lack of confidence.  We all need to take stock, think realistically, reorganise and reposition ourselves.</P>
        <P>One of our priorities must be to re-establish that unique Irish confidence, create a positive climate, lift the uncertainty, doubt and anxiety, and rebuild a sense of national pride.  In the 1990s there was an air of achievement.  There was real progress and development and nothing seemed impossible to achieve.  Above all, there was a great national spirit and pride in what was being done and what was being achieved.  We had built a great team with all the players signed in.  We enjoyed success for so many years and reaped great benefits and gains for all.</P>
        <P>As a small island nation, we are vulnerable to economic shocks beyond our shores.  The collapse of the global economy has taken us all by surprise.  The result of this economic collapse has had a ripple effect on every region and every family on our island.  One of the results has been a sharp rise in unemployment, coming from a base of nearly full employment in which an additional 1,000 new jobs were created every week over a number of years.  I ask the Minister of State and his colleague the T&aacute;naiste to spell out the proactive range of measures, job-related services, supports and training programmes that are being provided to help any individual or family facing unemployment.  F&Aacute;S, the national training and employment authority, provides a range of such services and has introduced some new schemes to address emerging trends, as mentioned by the Minister of State.  However, I ask the Minister of State to explain the barometer used to measure the success or otherwise of such agencies in addressing emerging trends satisfactorily and the speed of response.  We must ensure that the systems, services, training and supports put in place by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets represent an adequate response to all such emerging trends and continue to harness the collective skills and talents of our workforce.</P>
        <P>In the modern high-tech world in which we live, education and training is more vital than ever.  We must expand our investment to ensure that those who experience unemployment are fully capable of adapting to new challenges and emerging opportunities.  The Government needs to set pragmatic targets to encourage greater participation in lifelong learning by involving people and facilitating them in increasing their skill levels and qualifications.  Lifelong learning is an important key to our success and in ensuring that we remain one of the world&rsquo;s competitive economies.  I am encouraged by the determination of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, and their colleagues to create and develop the conditions to foster enterprise and business growth despite the current global turbulence.  I congratulate the ministerial team at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the departmental officials and the various agencies, especially IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, on their success in encouraging the development of world-class Irish companies and the strong position we now hold in the global markets.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is strongly of the view that a vital ingredient in our future prosperity will be the development and growth of Irish-owned companies.  Her vision can be realised if the challenges faced, especially by small and medium enterprises, are met head on.</P><Col N="492" />
        <P>I am pleased to note certain measures are in place to encourage the emergence of new businesses and to facilitate long-term business survival.  One of these actions is the adoption of new strategies to support the enterprise sector.  As we know, SMEs make a major contribution to the economy.  A special focus and supports are now warranted in this area, especially due to the changed economic realities compounded by the international credit crisis.  It is generally agreed that SMEs tend to be more flexible and responsive to changing economic circumstances and are crucial in providing employment opportunities.  It is not said often enough that it is absolutely essential that SMEs have all the required supports to assist them in addressing the emerging challenges.  One crucial issue for SMEs is funding, as mentioned by the Minister of State before he went on to talk about employment and increasing skills and qualifications.  It is important for SMEs that the required finance be made available by the banks to keep all systems operating.  One of my reasons for supporting the recent Government action of the bail-out scheme for our financial institutions was the aim of ensuring that the banks could retain their deposit accounts and access to international credit lines.</P>
        <P>In a recent research paper on the financial stability of the Irish banking sector, reference number 2008/4313, July 2008, a number of interesting statistics were presented.  The paper states that the most significant economic impact made by the banking sector is that it provides the capital necessary for business to function and to make investment for expansion.  We all know that so why say it, especially if we sign up to the fact that the significant role of the banking sector is imperative.  We should sign up to it especially for the small and medium enterprises.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House and the Minister of State to certain bank practices that may require a level of accommodation and from the information available to me may need urgent address.  In the interest of any declaration of self-interest, I should point out that I have a level of activity with some such banking groups.  A typical situation that has been brought to my attention by more than one source is where an entrepreneur has obtained finance for a project, agreements reached on interest and pay back and the product produced &mdash; the ideal being profit for both the bank and entrepreneur, and economic gain for all.  I now understand the banks are adopting a tighter lending policy particularly noticeable after the bank bailout and such policies are a source of grave concern even for the proven and successful entrepreneurs.  This is not my understanding of the fundamental and significant role that the banking sector is expected to provide, especially if its lending policies and practices stagnate growth and-or cause businesses to collapse with the reality of a further detrimental impact on employment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the great numbers &mdash; we all know what happened in the construction sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret I am running out of time because I would like to expand on this point.  I say to the Minister of State, his officials and the banking groups that I would welcome the opportunity, which is merited, to have a think-in to ascertain how we can resolve the issues that exist.  The Minister of State referred to the numbers of people affected by the downturn in the construction industry.  Now the people who are trying to survive in the construction industry &mdash; not just the small and medium enterprises of which we know in every region &mdash; are being put under pressure by the banking sector in a very unfair manner.  I am not too sure if the same banking sector would be in a position to do so if we had not given it the recent bailout.  </P><Col N="493" />
        <P>The banks are suggesting to those people that they gave them X amount to carry out a project but are now reassessing and want them to put X amount of cash on the table.  The banks also want them to dispose of some of their assets.  In the present market we all know that if a person in the building industry is being asked to dispose of assets the true value of the asset cannot be realised.  This is a daunting and concerning aspect at this time on a journey that may need to be completed to see the end result to the satisfaction of all the players.  We have never previously experienced anything like the current economic difficulties, international currency crisis and the total financial collapse of the markets around the world.  Therefore it is vital that the Minister of State and his officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;leave this room today with agreement to appoint either a rapid response group or a senior departmental official to work with the banking sector and SME representatives along with pragmatic players in the marketplace to help address such important fundamentals especially at this time.  I regret I have run out of time, as I would like to continue in this vein.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>To some extent I am sorry the Senator did not have an opportunity to elaborate further because, with all due respect to him, it might have been possible for those of us who were listening carefully to him to get to the bottom of what he was driving at in his cry for help for the construction industry and his apparent criticism of the banks for failing to ride to the rescue of the construction industry.  That would appear to be the burden of what he was saying towards the close of his remarks.  Perhaps he will have an opportunity to elaborate on the point when we debate the banking scheme, if and when it is brought into this House.  The notion that our approach to the crisis should be one that would be predicated upon a Government supporting or even, as Senator Callely appeared to suggest, encouraging the banks to take a lenient attitude towards some of the outrageous practices we have seen in the construction industry, the legacy of which we now need to live with, I would find reprehensible.  I wonder if that is what he was advocating.  </P>
        <P>We might get an opportunity to delve into that matter further and ascertain who these pragmatic players, to whom he urged the Minister of State to talk, are.  I always wonder about such phrases and about the identity of these pragmatic people.  Let us have this debate in the open.  This is not a criticism of the Minister of State or anything like that &mdash; I will come to that in a minute.  The notion that there should be talks behind closed doors between banks, the Government and the construction industry is precisely the kind of context that in my submission has led us to the kind of situation in which we find ourselves, involving the unreal levels of valuation on property which clearly exist and are likely to lead to a serious crisis not just in the liquidity of the banks and lending institutions but also in the fundamental level of the availability of capital and their capitalisation.  That is clearly where the debate needs to go and we will all need to face up to that in this House if and when we get an opportunity to debate it.</P>
        <P>I was listening to Senator Callely, as I always listen to my colleagues.  One of the things he said leads to points I want to make about where we should go from here.  I thought I heard him say that the crisis we are in took everybody by surprise.  I do not believe it took everybody by surprise.  It may have taken the Senator by surprise &mdash; although I doubt it.  It cannot have taken the Government by surprise and certainly did not take Members on this side of the House by surprise because there have been repeated warnings, not just by politicians, but also by commentators, economists, journalists and even financial practitioners about what was happening.  Even some Senators opposite gave warnings.  In particular Senator Mary White a few months ago stated that the dogs in the street &mdash; that may not have been her exact phrase <Col N="494" />&mdash; could see what was happening regarding our over-reliance on the construction industry and that the chickens would come home to roost at some point.  I know there are &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;chickens&rdquo; in that sentence, but I believe Senators know what I mean.  It cannot have come as a surprise.</P>
        <P>Even Senators on the other side accept we have an enormous increase in unemployment &mdash; the largest increase in unemployment for some decades if not ever.  I accept it is coming from a higher base of employment.  This week&rsquo;s Budget Statement was devoid of any measures, plan or strategy to attack this problem.  If someone coming from abroad were to point out that unemployment here had increased and asked whether the budget contained something about it, we would need to reply that it had no strategy to stimulate employment or any bold, innovative or imaginative initiatives &mdash; in fact no initiatives of any kind, good bad or indifferent.  It was one of the most striking aspects of the budget presented yesterday, which we will get an opportunity to discuss later today.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, too, was devoid of proposals of any kind, new measures or even suggestions of new measures which the Government may intend to introduce to deal with this serious problem.  I can only describe what the Minister of State said to the House today as a mildly interesting commentary on the problem but which was devoid of any new solutions, measures or initiatives which the Minister of State may intend to take.  It has a ring of familiarity about it in that it looks very like a speech the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, made in the D&aacute;il on this difficulty, on one occasion if not more.  While I have no problem with Ministers sharing their documentation and intelligence when they are running the Government, I would have hoped on this day of days and week of weeks in the economic downturn we are in that the Minister of State would have had something of content to say to Members today, but he did not.  His speech even mentioned various projects already in existence and various F&Aacute;S measures which were neither specified nor referred to in detail.  It also referred to programmes without any suggestion, plan or indication of any intention to introduce anything new or radical to deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>The idea of upskilling was mentioned.  An economics or secondary school student looking at the economy and drawing up an essay or commentary on it would mention the importance of upskilling.  This cannot be overstated.  How could one disagree with it?  The Minister of State said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The importance of upskilling in the context of the economy&rsquo;s competitiveness cannot be overstated.  The skills of our workforce will need to be able to adapt quickly to meet the challenges posed[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a self-evidently clear statement.  We can all say that or write it down, but we look to the Government to deliver it and come forward with proposals, measures, schemes and initiatives to make those words a reality.  Unfortunately, there was nothing in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech that suggested that might be done.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that, because sometimes politicians on the Opposition side can be accused of exaggerating when they make rhetorical flourishes and say the Government is doing nothing.  There was nothing new at all in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  There are murmurs from the Government side of the House.  I challenge anyone on that side to read the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and find one new thing in it.  They can shake their heads all they like, but if they tell me one new thing, I will withdraw my statement.  When the new things in the speech are pointed out, I will withdraw my allegation.  That is a promise.  There was nothing in the speech, however.  Why is that the case?  Why should the Opposition let the Government away with the implication it is doing something and grabbing hold of the problem when it is not doing so?</P><Col N="495" />
        <P>The Minister of State referred to persons on the live register and arrangements in local employment services to increase capacity to deal with the expected increase in live register referrals.  One would imagine they would have to make such arrangements.</P>
        <P>One measure taken in the budget is the cutting of the standard entitlement to 15 months&rsquo; unemployment benefit to 12 months, where 260 or more PRSI payments have been paid, and to nine months where fewer than 260 contributions are made.  That is an initiative that has been taken.  Will it be of assistance?  Will it attack or alleviate the problem of unemployment?  Clearly it will not.  Someone facing unemployment is now in the situation where they are affected on the double.  They have had the misfortune of losing their employment, have little or no hope of an alternative job, and now cannot rely on the income they thought they were entitled to through welfare provisions provided by the Government and to which they have been contributing over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The budget was devoid of ideas and proposals on jobs.  There is no reform of the back to education allowance &mdash; the Minister is keen on second-chance education &mdash; and we need such reform to boost that area.  There is no reform of the back to work enterprise allowance, no new community employment places and no initiatives on job sharing or career breaks.  If one wants to encourage people to go back to college or education to increase their skills in the middle of their careers, issues regarding job sharing and career breaks must be looked at.</P>
        <P>Practical proposals must be made to go with the rhetorical references in speeches.  While I know the Minister of State must say something when he comes to the House, I would have expected something concrete, such as the proposals brought forward by my party in recent weeks.  I wonder if my colleagues on the Government side, who are guffawing, have read them.  They like to ask where the Opposition&rsquo;s proposals are.  I will send the Senators an attachment by e-mail this afternoon where they will find our proposals in black and white and carefully costed and argued.  An example would be stimulation by making employment available for those in the construction sector who have lost their jobs quickly and dramatically in recent months.  My party has set out and published this clear set of proposals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we want a real debate in this House, and the Minister of State could easily and capably participate in a real debate rather than a sham, I am happy to have these proposals tested and scrutinised by him or his colleagues to see if they stand up.  No one is a complete repository of expertise.  If my party, or Fine Gael, put forward real proposals, they must bear scrutiny, and be examined and criticised by the Government side if that is what they wish to do.  Likewise, in a modern democracy and parliament, when we are addressed on the question of the serious and worsening crisis in unemployment, we are entitled to expect more than we received today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I read the Labour Party proposals, and they are a Keynesian analysis that we can spend our way out of the current situation.  That raises the obvious question of which money we spend to achieve that desired end.  Yesterday&rsquo;s budget, which we will discuss in greater detail later, clearly shows we do not have that money to spend, and it is not a short-term response.  If the response is a larger public sector, it is the wrong analysis.  We live in a small country with a public sector that needs to be examined in terms of what we can afford and how we can best deliver public services.  I am not sure whether the Labour Party proposals are the best way of going about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure Senator Boyle has read them.  He thinks they are a public sector panacea; they are not. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a lot of it, and there is no surprise there either.  Regarding employment, we must discuss the state of the global economy.  In the United States, the national debt clock that measured their debt in trillions of dollars has become obsolete because the debt has <Col N="496" />moved into the quadrillion category and the clock does not measure the size of the debt any more.  The United States has been recognised as the engine of the world economy, and this country has tied much of its economic interests and policies towards that established fact in the recent past.</P>
        <P>As we look towards the type of economy that might exist in the 21st century and how it might affect our country, the first thing we may have to realise is that we may be coming towards the end of the American century.  We must identify the engine in the new world economy.  That probably will be in the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China.  Efforts have been made by State agencies, in particular the IDA, to establish relations with China, the fastest growing economy in the world, and we need to ask which industries will provide sustainable jobs into the future.  A fair comment on the budget analysis is that we relied too heavily on the construction sector and we could never expect to build 90,000 housing units year on year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to ask how much unnecessary manufacturing capacity has been let go.  Traditional manufacturing industries such as textiles and footwear are gone forever.  Earlier I attended a presentation by Boston Scientific, a significant employer in the State and in my constituency, in particular.  The company manufactures high-tech equipment and we need to aspire to attracting more companies like this.  High-tech manufacturing is based on significant research and I am glad decisions were made yesterday to enhance research and development budgets because that is where our economic prosperity and future employment potential lies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the same time as replacing traditional manufacturing with high-tech manufacturing and research and development, other economies have relied on the services sector and this should be examined critically by the Government.  The financial services sector relies on information technology, which provides employment potential, but it has existed on shifting sands and it is not in our interest to put too many eggs in that basket for future economic or employment growth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to Government announcements in the coming weeks regarding green technology and employment potential in the energy, waste management and research and development sectors, which will help us move into a post-fossil fuel economy.  Research and development resources are needed to develop such technology.  For instance, we are catching up in the area of wind energy and while we may reach a stage where we produce the required amount of electricity through wind power, we will do so through Danish and German windmills.  Had we invested in such energy earlier, we would have developed the technology and generated the necessary capacity.  Ireland still has an opportunity to do this in the area of wave energy.  We are ahead of the rest of the world in development in this area.  I am hopeful green technology will be shown to be most vigorous in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The move from the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m work model has benefitted the economy in the recent past but we need to be more flexible by assisting people to work at home and to opt in and out of the work they do and get away from seeing work in its traditional setting.  If that can be done, environmental and social improvements will result in a reduced necessity for child care and the avoidance of unnecessary travel.  A more productive workforce would result from the introduction of more flexible work practices.  Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment level should be looked on from a glass three quarters full perspective.  The total workforce still numbers two million and it is anticipated unemployment will increase to more than 7%.  The necessary corrections to the economy, which we will discuss later, will help to increase employment and I look forward to the Government acting on much of that potential.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="497" />
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the issue of unemployment and, more important, job creation.  It is appropriate that we are taking this debate on the same day as we take statements on the budget because they are very much interlinked.  While the focus of yesterday&rsquo;s budget debate was the immediate financial crisis facing the country and the taxpayer, from now on we must examine in depth issues such as job creation and employment figures and bring forward proposals to ensure the sadly increasing trend in unemployment is reversed.</P>
        <P>A Government Member earlier mentioned the creation of the magic figure of 1,000 jobs per week, which happened for many years.  However, during the mid-1990s when the rainbow Government was in office, that figure was achieved for the first time and it was looked on as a major step forward.  Until recently, that rate of employment was maintained.  The construction industry led the growth in job creation and while we should not be overly critical of the industry because it responded to demand and it was good that the boom lasted so long, it must be conceded the Government adopted a construction culture rather than an enterprise culture.  It must be recognised all has changed from a construction perspective and the same number of new houses will not be required annually in the next ten to 20 years.  The number of people working in the sector will, therefore, reduce, which will result in an increase in the live register.</P>
        <P>I expected the measures in yesterday&rsquo;s budget to deal with the crisis facing the public finances and, hopefully, support and develop rather than hinder job creation.  That is why I am concerned about a number of yesterday&rsquo;s announcements and the immediate negative impact they will have on job creation and retention.  The change to VAT could be presented as a modest 0.5% increase but the Government is attacking the services and retail sectors in which many people work.  Money is being taking out of the economy, which will hinder rather than help job creation.</P>
        <P>I appreciate an economic and political argument can be made for introducing all these measures.  Fianna F&aacute;il, its partners, the previous Taoiseach and our present EU Commissioner always proclaimed loudly that the reduction in capital gains tax did wonders from an economic perspective by bringing in money to the Exchequer, putting money in circulation and creating jobs but that policy was reversed yesterday when the tax was increased by 2%.  That will not help job creation.  The 1% income levy may not have an immediate impact on the jobs market but I fear one of its negative aspects, apart from affecting every person other than those on social welfare, will be to push a small number of people into the black economy.  Due to employers who are not offering high wages, there will sadly be an incentive for people at the lower end of the salary scale to work on the margins and in the black economy instead of within the system.  It will not do much for employment or job creation in the long run.</P>
        <P>We must start looking for new ideas and solutions.  Senator Alex White outlined some of his party&rsquo;s proposals and my party produced a substantial document last week on broad economic issues, including job creation.  There is as much of a domestic side as there is an international side.  On the domestic side, the Government must put in place certain financial parameters.  It is disappointing that some of yesterday&rsquo;s budget announcements will not help job creation.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle mentioned the world&rsquo;s future growth regions, such as Brazil, China and Russia.  A major Government initiative must be undertaken to link our economy with some of those growing regions.  Given how Ireland has developed as a society, country and economy since joining the EU and our considerable amount of inward investment, Ireland has been the bridge into the EU for many companies, particularly from the US.  This has created tens of thousands of jobs.  We must now try to ensure that Ireland will be seen as a bridge into Europe and north America among the emerging economies of the Far East.  In terms of the workforce, taxation and Government policy, we must be an attractive location for inward investment.  Every year, <Col N="498" />tens of millions of jobs are being created by the economies of the Far East.  We must try to get a slice of that market.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to flexible working patterns.  They will not solve all problems and will not create jobs on their own, but the Minister of State should try to encourage them.  We must move away from the one size fits all system in which people leave for work at 8 a.m. and return home at 6 p.m.  Working hours and workplaces must be as flexible as possible.  As something that would be good for society and not just economics, flexible working hours must be encouraged.</P>
        <P>The House will revert to this debate during this afternoon&rsquo;s discussion on the budget.  We must examine the Minister&rsquo;s Budget Statement in more detail to determine how it will impact on job creation.  With growing unemployment almost back at the bad old days of the 1980s, serious political attention must be given to this emerging crisis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on his speech, regardless of what some Members of the Opposition might have stated.  His speech was comprehensive and provides a line on where we are going.</P>
        <P>We are in trying economic times and the level of unemployment is high.  The construction industry is more than partly relevant in this regard.  However, I agree with Senator Bradford that we cannot be overly critical of the construction industry.  There was a demand.  Perhaps it should have been streamlined to where houses were most needed instead of in small villages and towns where there is an oversaturation and insufficient employment to warrant such a supply.</P>
        <P>In bringing the budget forward to yesterday, the Government fully recognised the necessity for further measures.  According to the Minister of State, F&Aacute;S will be asked to liaise more closely with his Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs to respond to the increasing numbers on the live register.  Will the Minister of State emphasise to F&Aacute;S and the latter Department that speed is necessary when dealing with the unemployed and that people should not endure long waits to get their entitlements and money?  A provision should be put in place so that people get the payments to which they are entitled within a few weeks of becoming unemployed.  Sometimes, the situation can become protracted, leaving people in limbo.</P>
        <P>Of concern to me and all rural representatives is the community employment scheme.  Although I am not happy that almost 22,500 people are on the scheme, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s investment of &euro;377 million this year to retain overall numbers while maintaining a degree of flexibility to both maximise the number of those successfully progressing to the labour market and to support the work being carried out in local communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years, the scheme has been successful.  It gives people in a certain age category &mdash; the over 55 year olds &mdash; who may have lost their jobs or have never been in employment the opportunity to do something constructive in their local communities.  It is phenomenal to drive through any village or small town and see the amount of work done under the scheme.  It has lifted villages and small towns that, ten or 15 years ago, had grotty entrances.  Since the scheme has come on stream, the people it has employed have done significant work.  It has given people in villages and towns the initiative to do up their premises.  It is worthwhile and I am delighted that the Government will invest so much money in maintaining it.</P>
        <P>People of a certain age cannot get employment on other schemes.  From a social perspective, the work being done by the scheme&rsquo;s employees is visible.  While they are in receipt of social <Col N="499" />welfare payments, they are giving something back to the community.  They are proud and happy to do so.</P>
        <P>Major companies such as Allergan, Coca Cola and Baxter Healthcare are providing good employment in this county.  While this is welcome, they could do more were they guaranteed power, which is problematic for them.  I am sure that the Minister of State is well aware of the problem.  He has met the people in question since assuming his position, as has the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
        <P>However, most employment in County Mayo and most rural counties is derived from small indigenous industries that employ 20, 25 or 30 people.  Each town may have a few such industries, presenting a significant asset.  The industries are always complaining that excessive regulation and red tape are crippling their business.  They must employ people to answer the questions of the ESRI or other bodies.  While this is important, something should be done to alleviate the amount of time that small companies spend on administration.  They tell me that the level of detail they must give is incredible and they find it difficult.  This could be examined and more help could be given to small companies.  These are indigenous and will not run away at the first sign of an economic downturn.  They are family-owned businesses in many cases and are there for the long haul.  More help and encouragement should be given.</P>

T&aacute; m&eacute;ad&uacute; m&oacute;r ar an d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ocht sa chathair sin.  If we take the starting point that the Minister of State and his colleagues have slaughtered the Celtic tiger and that the era is over, we might get some honesty.</P>
        <P>If I can be parochial regarding Cork city, I ask the Minister of State to address core issues.  In the Cork city social and family affairs office, there is a 45% increase in the number of under 25s signing on and in Cork county the increase is 60%.  Unemployment has increased by 45.5% overall in Cork city, twice the national average and a worrying trend in our city.  If the current trend in the unemployment rate continues, unemployment will be higher than when this Government took over from the rainbow Government in 1997.  That is the legacy, Senator Ormonde, of eleven years of boom and bloom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer should not look at me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does Cork have twice the national average rate of unemployment?  Is it because Government has not provided the necessary infrastructure to entice business to Cork or because the Government has not provided funding for the eastern gateway bridge to regenerate the Cork docklands?  Is it the fact that Cork Airport is saddled with debt and the Government has failed to appoint a chairman to the Cork Airport Authority?  These are pertinent questions that have not been addressed.</P>
        <P>In one of her stirring contributions on the Order of Business some days ago, Senator Mary White referred to the cost of doing business.  The Minister of State made numerous references to the same issue.  We must address it.</P>
        <P>The graph shows a spiralling increase under this Government in the past three years and especially in the past three months.  I listened in my office to the speech of the Minister of State.  Some of it sounded good and read well but there was nothing new, as Senator Alex White stated.  There was no new policy statement, roadmap or new direction.  There was much rhetoric.  In the first few lines of his speech the Minister of State said: &ldquo;The recent increase in the numbers on the live register is an unwelcome illustration of the challenge that lies ahead in steering the economy through what are undoubtedly challenging times.&rdquo;  This is true but we cannot blame foreign events for the mismanagement of our economy.  We fuelled the boom in <Col N="500" />the construction industry.  As a consequence, many of the migrant workers have gone home or to London or wherever and our people have been left behind on the unemployment scrapheap.  Will they be consigned to that?  I hope not.</P>
        <P>As a director of adult education in my previous incarnation, the Minister of State will get no argument from me because I fully subscribe to education, upskilling and retraining.  From experience, however, much of it is happening without co-ordination or joined-up thinking.  Many of those involved work alone.  I hope the Government prioritises retraining and upskilling in the next 12 months.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State knows, the area of Cork city and county has lost many jobs in the electronic assembly sector.  What plans have been made to tackle that?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not wish to jump on the anti-F&Aacute;S bandwagon because it serves no one well.  Mistakes have been made by F&Aacute;S, which everyone recognises.  Through the community employment scheme, however, F&Aacute;S has provided the opportunity to engage in worthwhile and, as Senator Carty said, valuable practices.  Under the Ministers, Deputies Martin and Harney, there has been a rowing back of this and a reinvention of F&Aacute;S schemes.  Now, trying to keep people on such schemes is like trying to get through to the Vatican, so to speak, unless I talk to someone such as the Minister of State.  We must be serious about community employment because it is a valuable asset to the community.  In a time of recession, we should enhance it and not take people off such schemes and put them on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or whatever.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s reference to flexible working patterns.  In the context of the fact that Ireland has become very expensive to do business in &mdash; the Minister of State may be right in saying we should not talk down Ireland but the reality is that we are where we are at &mdash; I agree also with Senator Bradford that we should build bridges with countries we can have links with.  I am not referring in that context to Governor Palin&rsquo;s bridges to nowhere.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to prioritise lifelong learning.  There are great models from which we can learn.  At UCC, Dr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Fathaigh demystified lifelong learning and brought it to the heartland of rural Ireland and the suburbs in Munster.  If we do the same, we will be on the right track.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to address the matter of F&Aacute;S and the speed with which it responds to situations, as referred to by Senator Carty.  Members on all sides may be concerned at the way F&Aacute;S handles that specific issue.  It is worrying that two thirds of new claimants were men and that a quarter were under 25.  We cannot blame outside forces for the cost of doing business here.  The rise in youth unemployment is worrying and I ask the Minister of State to address this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well now, more so than ever, in these challenging times.  We are discussing the increase in unemployment as a result of the downturn in the economy.  Yesterday, we spoke at length on the budget and we will have an opportunity this afternoon to discuss aspects of the budget relevant to this subject.</P>
        <P>I am not here to do a bashing exercise, so to speak, nor will I ever speak in that role.  However, all that some colleagues can do is engage in such a bashing exercise without doing any constructive thinking of their own.  They think they have the answers but if they have, why are they not in government?  We are doing our best to stabilise the economy, a difficult job at this time.  There are no guarantees that this is the right way forward but the budget is helping to stabilise the economy.  We are here to face up to how we might help those who have become unemployed.  As the Minister of State said, according to the August statistics there are more <Col N="501" />than 240,000 on the live register.  That is a considerable increase and is very disappointing.  It appears that the principal fall-off is in the construction industry and the credit crisis has also come into its own.  We had extraordinary growth and cannot expect it to be rosy in the garden always.  The challenge is there for us to face.</P>
        <P>The role of F&Aacute;S will be very important in how we handle unemployment.  Although the organisation has got a bad press in the past  it now has a golden opportunity to address that and rise to the challenge of handling the new situation.  It is not about upskilling, a word that I hate.  Upskilling means saying to a person, &ldquo;You were good at plumbing, now we will put you into something else&rdquo;.  I would not like F&Aacute;S to think along those lines in the future but would prefer to see in its programmes and modules research into where future jobs lie.  There will be a new emphasis and it will not be on the construction industry but on climate change and in the area of energy.  Underground cabling has become a new phenomenon in construction.  There is also the area of child care and the entire service industry.  Technologies are coming forward and the question is whether F&Aacute;S will be able to handle the research needed and how it can apply such research to the live register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A great variety of job skills exists that was required once but is no longer.  How can we change the thinking of F&Aacute;S?  How do we interview everybody on the live register in order to find out their position and where they are going?  How do we do the joined-up thinking between the Department of Education and Science, the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department and that which deals with the live register?  How can we work in a way that will tap into this for the individual ?  I am a guidance counsellor.  How do I know how to reach out to that person, interview him or her, at a guidance or a counselling level, in order to give the person an opportunity to move from A to B?  That is where we must step in.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was very good.  He said that these areas are being examined.  F&Aacute;S will continue to be involved.  The Department of Education and Science, which deals with the VEC schools, has a golden opportunity to engage in joined-up thinking with F&Aacute;S at local level.  The Minister of State mentioned community employment schemes.  There is an opportunity to pursue those and to see how people can be brought back to life-long learning programmes such as those to which the Minister of State referred.  There must be research into opportunities for the future.  Perhaps many who are plumbers, plasterers or roofers will not wish to continue those trades.  What might their inclinations be?  Where might they be placed?</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has a role.  If it wishes to redeem itself it has expert professional people in its own organisation.  Let them come out from behind closed doors, examine the live register, do their interviewing and their placements and go to the VECs which have equally good back-to-work and education programmes.  These organisations can link up in order to help those people, boost their morale and provide opportunities.  It can happen.</P>
        <P>We must introduce flexibility.  Work may be a morning or afternoon affair because the day of the 9-5 job is over.  We have an opportunity to look at the areas in which F&Aacute;S can help in a significant way.  There must be information centres.  I do not know where I would go if I were on the live register at this time.  If I were told that my job was to go in the morning how would I know where to go?  F&Aacute;S must tell those who are unemployed it is there to help them and that it will work with the Department of Education and Science on its programmes.  In that way education and training can gel together.  One does not go without the other although we isolated them in the past.  We had education but training was not mixed with it.  That has changed and the thinking of the future must change too.</P>
        <P>We must employ global thinking in order to re-employ those who do not wish to go back into roofing or plumbing, who want to change their way of life and have the opportunity to do <Col N="502" />so through F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s research and modular programmes, and morning programmes.  Whatever way F&Aacute;S wishes to implement this it now has a greater opportunity than in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  We are seeing a lot of him in recent times.  That is good news but, on the other hand, unemployment is not.</P>
        <P>I was a member of a partnership group which I had to leave when I was elected to the Seanad.  I was concerned by a memory I had of previous times where groups were formed in different parts of the country to solve a problem.  I thought it was great that people were getting up and doing something for themselves but when the group got together what was the first thing it did?  It decided to send a deputation to Dublin in order that the problem would be solved from there.  I am a great believer in the notion of doing it oneself, in self-help and in people being able to organise themselves.  I remember going to the first meeting of that partnership in which I was involved.  I brought a number of ideas but discovered that nobody else was thinking of doing it themselves.  They thought they would get some organisation to do it for them, that they would get in touch with F&Aacute;S or some other group, many of them referred to by the Minister of State in his speech.</P>
        <P>I said to them that there was a future in the area.  We had a supermarket there and we needed somebody who could make jam and somebody who could provide good celery which was hard to get.  One person started to grow lettuce.  Another set up a car valeting business, another a window washing service.  Suddenly we found there were a number of jobs, none of them big jobs, but they were getting people to think correctly.  They were thinking of doing it themselves rather than relying on somebody else to do it for them.  I have a concern, therefore, that when we set up or use State agencies, we might forget that there is work that requires to be done.  There should be a way of doing it.</P>
        <P>We must ensure and encourage the continuance of foreign direct investment.  I was disappointed in one aspect of the budget.  With all the tough decisions and all the bad news, something that created a spark was needed in the Minister of Finance&rsquo;s speech.  The importance of foreign direct investment must not be forgotten.  I was delighted that the Minister gave a guarantee that the 12.5% corporate tax rate will not change.</P>
        <P>A few weeks ago in the first debate between Senators Obama and McCain in the US presidential election, Senator John McCain made an error.  He criticised Senator Obama because of the likelihood that he would increase tax, and pointed out that Americans should look to Ireland.  He said that when this country reduced tax it took in more money and that its corporate tax was 11%.  He meant, of course, 12.5% but perhaps he was giving us a hint.  It would have been great if, when the Minister was announcing the tough decisions and the bad news, that he had announced brightly that we were taking Senator McCain&rsquo;s advice and were dropping our corporate tax to 11%.  The reason I raise this is that every time taxation rates have been reduced, revenue has increased.  As corporation tax was progressively cut from 30% to 12.5%, revenue generated from this source increased significantly.  The decision by former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, to reduce betting tax from 20% to 10% was greeted with a chorus of criticism.  However, the increase in income from this tax was such that the Minister decided one year later to reduce it further to 5%.  My intention is not to be glib but to remind others that we must show imagination in addressing unemployment.</P>
        <P>While it will not eliminate unemployment, a recent French initiative to tackle the problem has impressed me.  Retired engineers, architects and other skilled professionals in the field of construction have established an association which groups from around the country contact when they wish to have buildings of cultural value to their respective area repaired.  Members of the association travel to the area in question and provide free advice on how the building <Col N="503" />can be patched up or repaired.  Local firms usually supply the equipment required for the works, while local unemployed people carry out the work.  It must be possible to be imaginative in creating work for people who are unemployed.  Perhaps people who are unemployed and out of the habit of working could be used to do this type of work at little cost to the State.  One expects those who are unemployed to be willing to work if employment can be found for them in their local area.  I have thrown this proposal into the melting pot for consideration.</P>
        <P>As unemployment rises, it is essential to get people back to work.  The Government should do this by providing schemes and training in specific skills.  Having rescued the banks, it should make greater efforts to assist those who are in the unfortunate position of having been made redundant.</P>
        <P>A new report published on Monday last found that the number of companies collapsing &mdash; perhaps that is the wrong word to use &mdash; has increased by 90% this year in comparison with last year.  I was stunned at the figures in the report.  A total of 477 companies collapsed in the first nine months of this year compared to 256 in the same period last year.  I accept, however, that an essential part of business is that not all companies will succeed.</P>
        <P>The number of people on the live register is increasing at the fastest rate in the history of the State.  Certain straightforward initiatives can help to address the unemployment problem.  For instance, the Government should reconsider the requirement that people must wait six months before they become eligible to participate in a F&Aacute;S course.  Many people learn in advance that they will be made redundant.  If they were able to join a F&Aacute;S scheme on becoming unemployed, there would not be a gap between employment and training.</P>
        <P>Other new schemes are worth noting.  An additional 700 people are signing on at Kilbarrack social welfare office while a further 1,000 people are signing on in Coolock.  In 2006, a jobs club was established by the Northside Partnership with sponsorship from F&Aacute;S.  This club is a tangible example of an initiative which gets people back to work, providing training programmes to assist participants who are ready for work to develop the skills they possess or teach them new skills.  These can then be used to find a job or suitable training course.</P>
        <P>The number of employees being laid off in the construction trade, which has featured strongly in this debate, is a major problem.  More construction companies have gone out of business this year than in all of 2007.  Considering the state of disrepair of many schools &mdash; I understand 40,000 children are taught in prefabricated buildings &mdash; the Government should consider diverting construction employees to work on public projects such as school building in addition to the road building projects which form part of the national development plan.  Many people need building services.  Establishing a regulated building service provider to ensure cash payments are regulated and go through the books would provide increased tax revenue.  Builders would also arrive for jobs on time, an unlikely scenario during the Celtic tiger era, and many of those losing their jobs in the construction industry would be re-employed.</P>
        <P>We also need to press ahead with the roll-out of broadband services.  Recently, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, rejected data indicating that Ireland is at the bottom of the broadband penetration pile.  However, the new European performance index contradicts the Minister&rsquo;s statements on broadband as it shows that Ireland is lagging far behind our European competitors.  While one could ask where we will get the money to fund the roll-out of broadband, we must show imagination as we endeavour to overcome the challenge of unemployment.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State is present as I know he will give the issue of unemployment serious attention.  From experience, I know he get things done if he gets to grip with an issue.  I urge the Government to use imagination in addressing the problem of unemployment and to avoid talking us into a recession, as we have done much too easily.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House.  There is no doubt that governing is akin to paddling a canoe.  If one keeps paddling on either the right or left, one moves in circles, whereas if one paddles on both sides, one moves straight ahead.  If the financial crisis of recent weeks has shown us anything, it is that State intervention, when necessary, is beneficial.  This principle also applies when dealing with unemployment. </P>
        <P>Yesterday, a welcome recognition was given to the benefit of Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation taxation regime in attracting industry.  When one speaks of unemployment what one means is the period when one prepares people for employment.  The budget featured other innovative, imaginative and progressive measures, including an increase in research and development tax credits and a remission in corporation tax and capital gains tax for new start-ups.  At this difficult juncture, positive and immediate steps are being taken to promote employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much has been said about the construction industry.  The difficulties we are experiencing were the result of an over-dependence on this sector.  However, a similar over-dependence has been evident throughout the world.  In addition, the mis-selling of financial instruments has resulted in a serious correction.</P>
        <P>Construction, which has benefited the economy, is still important and could expand in future.  A number of solid Irish companies, for example, the Grafton Group, McInerney Holdings and Cement Roadstone, have a European and an international dimension.  Increased Government expenditure on education and school building projects is another positive step which will improve education facilities and provide employment in the construction industry.</P>
        <P>In another positive development, the Government increased mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers.  It is important, given that the boom was created by the construction industry, to take positive steps in this area because construction is an important part of the economy which could still expand, especially in terms of exports.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that many construction workers enjoy substantial earnings.  I am informed, for example, that when asked about wages, a Dublin builder indicated he was paying &euro;2,000 per week for skilled and semi-skilled labour.  It is difficult for people to move from such a high level of income to being unemployed.  That is a challenge for the Government.  It is where community employment, training and education schemes come into focus.  Community employment schemes are highly regarded.  It is interesting that people who have had highly paid jobs seek to participate in these schemes from which they would get an income that is &euro;38 above what they would receive in unemployment assistance.  They seek to participate in them because they know the work involved is worth doing.  It is highly visible and of benefit to the community.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that it is difficult now for apprentices to get jobs.  There is a role for F&Aacute;S in this respect.  I ask the Minister of State to make it as easy as possible for people to participate in these schemes as soon as possible.  Many of the reasons for the delay in allowing people to participate on these schemes relate to possible abuses of them.  Perhaps he might reconsider this matter because these schemes are highly valued by people who are skilled and wish to contribute to their community.</P>
        <P>It is expected that we will have a  higher unemployment level this year, but there are measures that can be taken in that respect.  Like any good player of a sport, we should be where the ball is going to be and not where it is at.  It is interesting that even during the Great Depression there were areas of growth in the new technologies of electronics and in other areas that we now take for granted, but they were new at that time.</P>
        <P>In the area of science, technology and innovation, I commend the Minister on the grants and increase given for that area.  It is a recognition that it is a growth area.  There are still possibilities for growth areas in the biotechnology sector and in ethical biotechnology in particular, which will have an important role to play in the development of genetic solutions to health and <Col N="505" />medical problems.  There will also be growth in the services sector in the future and we need to prepare for those markets.</P>
        <P>It is also possible to prepare in respect of energy efficiency areas.  With regard to the construction sector, jobs can be created to ensure that houses are insulated to the highest possible standard.  It is a benefit of the boom that we have a high standard of housing stock and a high standard of living.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further area we should examine in terms of development is what are known as the BRIC countries, those of Brazil, Russia, India and China.  These countries are expected to grow at a strong rate for the next ten to 15 years.  There will be emerging markets that will present wonderful opportunities.  We should focus our attention on expanding our markets in these countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in the task of dealing with the appalling unemployment figures we face in this country.  I also wish him well in reaching out to those who have become unemployed because there is nothing more harrowing or distressing for an individual or a family than to face into a period of unemployment and feel unsupported, not knowing where to turn or what one&rsquo;s next step will be.  That is the way many people will feel at present, given the economic situation we are facing.</P>
        <P>In the early 1990s I worked on the National Economic and Social Forum and the Minister of State will remember that it produced a report at that time on coping with long-term unemployment and the steps that the then Government needed to take to deal with it.  It is sad to think that we have to take up that report and check if there are recommendations in it which we can now put to good use.  I agree with Senator Quinn that we need to be imaginative and show initiative in dealing with the current situation if we are to reach out to help the people who need it most.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the provisions in the budget announced yesterday.  The budget does not protect the vulnerable, those at the cutting edge and those who are least able to cope with the downturn in the economy.  It will result in an increase in costs and charges for them.  This is a demanding time in terms of dealing with the unemployment figures.</P>
        <P>The level of unemployment here is now higher than that in the United States, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Poland, Singapore, South Korea.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that the international situation has led to the rising level of unemployment here.  There are national factors involved.  Decisions were taken here that have led to a situation where jobs are being lost at an alarming rate.</P>
        <P>I had hoped that the budget would have contained some particular initiatives to deal with unemployment.  In his speech the Minister of State gave very few specifics.  I ask him and his Department to come up with more.  We need to hear of the initiatives that will be taken to retrain people and help them get back to education.  Those are the areas on which we should be focusing in order to give people hope.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael has made a number of recommendations on back to education incentives on which the Government could act.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to examine them.  One of the recommendations is the extension of the back to education allowance.  We must try to ensure that we do not return to an era of long-term unemployment and emigration.  We will need a more proactive approach than we have seen to date.</P>
        <P>In this context, I refer to the example of the debate on F&Aacute;S in recent weeks and the criticisms of that agency, yet one of the first points the Minister of State made in his speech concerned the role played by F&Aacute;S.  This is an agency that has been heavily criticised recently, yet in almost the first point he made in his speech, the Minister of State outlined F&Aacute;S will offer a range of <Col N="506" />services, supports and programmes to help those in the workforce.  I hope the agency can do that, but it is clear that there needs to be a great deal of supervision, monitoring and reporting back to the Minister about the initiatives it is taking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What are the more intensive arrangements with the local employment services to deal with the increases expected in live register referrals?  What are the short relevant training courses they will provide and where will they be available?  I would like to hear much more about that.  Senator Ormonde said it is important for people who suddenly become unemployed to know where to turn and what is available.  We need to hear much more about this.  We also need to hear much more about initiatives on the retraining and back to education side as well as about the support for the community employment schemes.  That is essential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scale of what is happening is frightening.  The number of unemployed people signing on the live register in my area in Clondalkin has increased by 47%.  Facing unemployment is a dramatic change for families.  People are seeking support from MABS on how to deal with their day-to-day bills.  The sudden unemployment people are facing has a serious impact on their personal lives.  I am receiving contact from constituents about having to queue in the rain outside the unemployment office in Lucan.  The office does not have the capacity to cope with the numbers.</P>
        <P>The issue of how we deal with the people who become unemployed is important.  We have heard reports from many Senators about the conditions, the way people are being dealt with and the delays they encounter in getting their benefits.  We heard more announcements last night about the number of stamps people will need before they will be eligible for allowances.  This increases the stress on the families concerned.  We also need to examine those aspects.</P>
        <P>Increasing our competitiveness is a key factor.  I spoke to individuals involved in small businesses this morning and they are devastated by the budget announcements.  They do not believe there were any initiatives for small business, but that in fact the pressure on them has increased, and these are the people who have been creating most of the jobs in the country, as we know.  They did not get much solace, yesterday, from the budget, and perhaps the Minister of State might comment on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a great deal of talk about the amount of bureaucracy and red tape that so many employers in small business have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  Something could be done about this.  It would help to restore our competitiveness.  Initiatives must be taken to restore competitiveness in the country.  One can see that our competitiveness graph has been falling and this is a key factor behind the type of unemployment we are facing.  We need to hear from the Minister of State about the type of initiatives that are being taken to restore competitiveness in the country.  It is critical. We must do it if we are to increase exports.  Growth rates in Irish exports have fallen below our peer countries in recent years, and our share of global trade has declined each year since 2002.</P>
        <P>Our productivity growth has been below the OECD average since 2003.  High inflation has affected our competitiveness as well as poor infrastructure across the board and not enough investment in research and development &mdash; although I take on board what Senator Hanafin said yesterday about that.  That is what is going to make a difference if we are to reduce the unemployment figures and stop the type of job losses we have seen in recent weeks and months.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the number of small businesses going to the wall and expressed his surprise at the statistics.  If we are not competitive and continue to make the demands on small businesses that we have been making, we will see more of them folding.  That is the sector which needs the support and initiatives to make it realistic for small businesses to continue to keep the people they have, employ more and grow and develop.</P><Col N="507" />
        <P>Again, we did not see that, yesterday.  We are in 22nd place in the global competitiveness report, which was published.  I want to deal with the reasons behind that.  It is largely due to our inadequate infrastructure, high inflation and inefficient Government bureaucracy.  We did not see any reform announced in the budget yesterday, and that is a big disappointment.  There was no reform of the bureaucracies that have been built up.  We are not going to get efficient frontline services if we do not reform the bureaucracies and they will eat away at our money.  All the extra tax put on people yesterday in the budget will be used up on these bureaucracies and the money will not be available for the creative initiatives that might make a difference in terms of creating more employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I see the Government side is losing its appetite for debates on unemployment and the budget.  However, I hope there is a full attendance at the debate on the budget later so that Members can do their duty. </P>
        <P>In terms of unemployment, the budget is regressive.  There are a number of points that will create difficulty.  In fairness, Senator Hanafin pointed out one of the few good points, dealing with the question of research and development, and I agree with him.  That is enormously important and it is something I have asked for many times in this House.  I wish the initiative well and hope it is successful.  However, it must be said that other countries, equally, are engaged in similar initiatives to try to promote research and development.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is too young to remember, but the Cathaoirleach and I can recall the same situation, in 1987, when we ran into difficult times.  The first thing the Government decided to do was to increase class sizes, and there was an unholy war about it at the time, because people felt that was not the way to go.  The new initiative will create unemployed teachers.  If there was a surplus of teachers, they could take their falls like everybody else.  However, young students went into teaching because they were assured that a supply of teachers was needed.  We have the largest class sizes in Europe.  Ireland is the country in Europe most in need of teachers and reductions in class sizes, yet the Government takes the opposite route.  I understand the Government&rsquo;s reasons, and I am not quibbling with that.  I would not have whinged if it had increased income tax by 2.5% but would have conceded that it needed to be done, perhaps with one codicil, that it must exclude the minimum wage.  The Minister of State, in his section of the Department that deals with labour affairs, must have some sympathy with my viewpoint in this regard, because again, it is as if we have forgotten history.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the reasons we brought in the minimum wage and why every Government tried to bring those at the bottom of the range in terms of wages and salaries out of the tax net was to soften the bridge between unemployment and employment.  We had reached the point at one stage where people might have been better off on the dole, as there was no incentive to get work.  However, what we have started to do now is reduce the incentive for people to get on the first rung of the ladder.  People are for the first time querying whether it is worth their while to get themselves into the tax net.  It is a disincentive, at a time when we are trying to create employment.</P>
        <P>The other extraordinarily bad decision, which will also impact on employment, is the increase in the VAT rate.  It is was already extraordinarily high and was brought in as an emergency measure, as I recall.  To increase it to 21.5% will have a very negative impact.  With all of this we are creating further disadvantages within society.</P>
        <P>The Minister said yesterday &mdash; it has been echoed today by many &mdash; that the Government forecasts unemployment will exceed 7%, which is extraordinary.  However, these things happen and I do not join the general chorus in blaming the Government for all that has gone wrong.  That is not my style.  All governments make mistakes, the global impact is a fact and I believe the regulator is more right than wrong in terms of what he has said about the safety of our <Col N="508" />banks and their capitalisation.  Those who say otherwise should offer us the proof.  I do not come from the stable of having a go just for the sake of it.  Mistakes have been made, but the reality is that we have now created an enormous number of angry people, including those over 70 years of age, parents and teachers, whose fury is aimed in the wrong direction.  It does not help the unemployment issue or create the employment opportunities or support structures that we need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, CECDE, had originated from the view that the blackspots of unemployment coincided with the underprivileged areas.  In order to break the cycle of underprivilege, it was felt that early intervention was necessary.  It was felt that my children, say, and those of the Minister of State, coming from homes which were not dysfunctional, and with space etc., did not need the same start, but that early childhood intervention for the disadvantaged was enormously important in order to get people into a position of readiness to learn.  CECDE was set up to break the cycle of underprivilege and get children into education, which was the bridge to employment.  The proposal to abolish it is a very regressive initiative, although I recognise that politics is politics and we cannot always do things that we want.  However, these are issues which are taking us backwards.</P>
        <P>There might be a case for an increase in the size of classes if we had extraordinarily low class sizes.  We now have the largest class sizes in Europe.  It is a regressive measure at a time when we are trying to sell ourselves internationally on the basis of a solid, progressive, successful educational system and structures.  I guarantee the Minister of State that if <i>The Economist </i>passes a comment on the educational aspect of the budget next week, it will not support it and will say this is the wrong way to go.  We must think about the long term.  The Government said we must think about the long term, that this would not happen in a year, that this was a plan for a number of years and that we must defer certain things, which I understood.  However, this is going backwards and it will take us years to pick up.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department will be at the forefront of dealing with unemployment and this will be of no help to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am puzzled by the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement in regard to what we are doing about unemployment.  I did not find any justification for some of the assertions made in the statement.  In bringing forward the budget by six weeks, the Government recognises that further measures will need to be taken to bring further stability to the economy.  I do not see where we are going by bringing forward the budget by two months.  Are further measures, in addition to those in the budget, to be taken?  I do not see anything in the budget which helps the unemployment situation.</P>
        <P>We had chronic unemployment in the 1980s.  The only way that was resolved was by creating the underlying conditions for a competitive economy, for export-led growth and for a low inflation economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to call a quorum.  I noted there was no Government speaker when the last Senator finished speaking.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interests of procedures of the House, the Minister of State should not be worried about the time I have been allocated, or will take, to relay the few comments I wish to make on this issue.</P>
        <P>The basis of the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement was that the way to deal with unemployment was through lifelong learning, our education system, etc.  There is no basis for that statement because when one considers the cutbacks on the education front in the budget, we are going <Col N="509" />backwards in terms of providing the investment in human capital which laid the basis for resolving the chronic unemployment we faced in the 1980s.</P>
        <P>In regard to promoting enterprise, it is a self-evident proposition that investment in research and development is essential for any developing economy.  It should be no surprise that we continue the process of investing in research and development.  There is nothing new there.</P>
        <P>The 12.5% corporation tax, which is so important for attracting foreign direct investment and which was introduced by the John Bruton-Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn led Government, was criticised at the time by the Opposition, including Deputy Bertie Ahern and Charlie McCreevy, as a negative.  However, it was subsequently adopted and agreed with the European Commission.  That low corporate tax regime has been fundamental to attracting inward investment.</P>
        <P>In regard to every other aspect, we seem intent on undermining the competitiveness of this economy which is fundamental to continuing the process of attracting further investment.  By the Government&rsquo;s own admission, this budget will add 1.1% to inflation.   The cutbacks for local authorities will create a situation where various stealth taxes will be necessary in the coming years to sustain the public finances.</P>
        <P>I refer to the conditions necessary to prevent a growing unemployment rate.  All the forecasts indicate the unemployment rate will increase significantly in the coming years.  What we now have is similar to the chronic situation in the 1980s where we are borrowing for current spending.  Despite the cutbacks in the budget, there will be an increase in borrowing in 2009.  We have a doubling of the national debt, which affects the entire credit rating of the country, and we have a budget, which is deflationary and contributes to reduced growth.  Therefore, I do not see the basis for the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement.  It is very selective and sets out no propositions that suggest the Government is adopting measures that will do anything to reduce unemployment or moderate the rate of increase in it.  It is back to the bad old days of Charlie Haughey and spendthrift Governments where the public finances are out of control.  That is the biggest obstacle to creating the conditions for a competitive economy and reduced unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the contributions of Senators.  I have only a short time to sum up on the discussion.  The gross national product is estimated to contract by approximately 1% next year, unemployment is expected to average approximately 7.3% and inflation is expected to ease to 2.5%.  I say this in the context of what we face next year and to explain why the budget was brought forward this year.  It was to address these concerns and to get our fiscal policies in place to ensure we did not let the situation spiral out of control.  Were we to have allowed the situation to have continued, we would have had an enormous hole in the national budget, the deficit would have been extraordinary and we would have been playing catch-up for longer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We began to take prudent decisions in this regard some time ago.  As early as last July when I came to this House, I spoke about the measures necessary in the context of paring back more than &euro;400 million in this year&rsquo;s budget and of making savings next year of approximately &euro;1 billion.  We have now brought forward the budget, which is financially responsible and outlines a clear pattern for what we are trying to achieve.  Let us be under no illusion that what we face in coming years in global economic terms with the downturn in the world economy, potential global recession, credit difficulties and lack of finance availability for companies means we are in a very difficult situation.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to some of the points made.  A simplistic assertion and criticism is often made of the construction industry.  The perception is that everyone in the construction industry is coining it.  In excess of 14% of the labour force was actively employed in the construction <Col N="510" />industry in recent years, it was a vibrant part of our overall economy and provided long-term sustainable employment for many people, especially those in the crafts and labouring sectors.  It is, therefore, facile to make the flippant, throwaway remark that the construction industry was a burden on society and the economy.  It cheapens the debate we want to have.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt we were overly reliant on the sector.  It was estimated we would need approximately 55,000 housing units year on year.  In 2007, the number of units built crept up to almost 90,000 units.  We were, therefore, over-supplying the market.  That said, the cheap credit available through the European Central Bank and the euro was also a major factor in escalating house prices.  Affordability existed because people were earning good salaries and cheap credit was available.  This was coupled with extraordinary prices paid for land in some cases.  The lack of zoned land in critical areas was another factor.</P>
        <P>These issues were outlined as far back as when I was a Member of this House from 1992 to 1997.  The Bacon report and others pointed out the concerns at the time regarding increasing densities, availability of housing land, investment in infrastructure, etc.  The difficulty was at the early stages then, but it increased rapidly owing to cheap credit following our involvement in the euro.  This is something we never acknowledge, but it was a critical factor in escalating house prices.  We are now in a situation where demand has dropped off, but this also has a global context.</P>
        <P>The Government has made a decision and will bring forward legislation tomorrow with regard to the guarantee for the banks.  It is important we send out a clear message to the banks.  I will watch all banks to ensure they do not send out credit hounds to collect from small businesses struggling with overdrafts, etc. and that they look at the most productive sides of the economy and ensure credit is available to them.  I will hound the banks until I know they are looking at the positive aspects of the economy where there are employment opportunities and to which they would make credit available, such as small businesses that may be suffering because of the credit squeeze, rather than looking at the balance sheets and bad debts in the context of inflated property prices and drawing on the current accounts of small businesses to ensure the books look good for the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>I urge Senators to be conscious and sensitive to that and wherever they see the opportunity, to encourage the banks to listen.  The situation has changed and there is a new relationship between the Oireachtas, the Government, the people and the banks.  In my experience and judging from what has happened in previous global downturns and credit squeezes in other countries, the banks send out their credit hounds to small companies, pull the current account overdraft facilities and the companies fold.  This happens because the banks want to get money in to ensure their books look good in the context of deflating property prices.  I urge Senators to be aware of this whenever they have the opportunity to speak to banking people and during debates in the House.</P>
        <P>I would like to go through each point made by Senators, but do not have time to deal with all the valuable contributions made.  I agree with Senator Regan and others with regard to research and development, our competitiveness and attracting foreign direct investment.  Every Government since the 1950s has acknowledged that corporation tax is a fundamental plank to attracting foreign direct investment into the country.  For that reason, we have been very successful in that regard.  Our low corporation tax, coupled with investment in education, access to third level, high quality graduates and recent infrastructural investment have brought foreign direct investment into the country.  Senators should be under no illusion, however, that if we are not competitive in the context of our cost base, we will lose the foreign investors.  I am concerned too much emphasis may be placed on the research and development side and we <Col N="511" />will lose sight of the fact that manufacturing is a fundamental plank to ensuring we have strong employment growth.</P>
        <P>Over the next few years we should try to link the two factors.  Not only should we send out positive messages internationally about us being available for research and development, having high end third and fourth level graduates and high quality engineers in the life sciences and other areas, we should also send out the message that we have a highly motivated skilled workforce.  We must send out not only the message that we can do the research and development, but also the message that we are able to compete on the manufacturing side.  We will never be able to sustain the growth and employment we need for our current demographics if we do not have a manufacturing base.  We should not lose sight of this nor dismiss manufacturing as something that is no longer possible in this country.  Manufacturing is a fundamental plank.  One can have five or six high-end engineers designing a product, but one needs approximately 1,000 to manufacture the product for market.  We should try to gel the two areas together and I am confident this can be done.</P>
        <P>The issue of work-life balance was raised.  It is important to have flexibility in the workplace, not just from the point of view of employers and large companies that may have peaks and troughs in production and demand, but also to ensure there is flexibility for employees so they are content in the workplace and they have the flexibility to deal with their families.  Each year we have a work-life balance day, generally in February.  We have also set up a panel of experts to advise companies on how to bring forward policies and procedures in the workplace that are family friendly.  This is something that has benefited companies and on which there is greater emphasis.  Issues such as pressure of travel at peak traffic times, child care costs etc. come into play as well.  There are many reasons, therefore, work-life balance should be considered positively by companies and actively embraced.  I urge them to take up that offer in the context of the availability of the expert panel, and to bring forward ideas and policies for improving work-life balance.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Community employment schemes are an important part of society.  We must make sure we have a commitment that people in long-term unemployment do not descend into a black hole and become removed from society.  They must be part of the community and a productive part of society.  There are 2,500 places available on community employment schemes and they are fundamental in ensuring that people can remain in the labour market and can progress.  They are an active labour market progression mechanism.  We also must be conscious of the fact that some people who are currently in employment schemes may not progress to the active labour market and seek employment.  We must have this debate.  Are community employment schemes just active labour market mechanisms or are they also social employment schemes?  We need to sit down and have that debate because these are fundamentally different concepts.  Some people will continue to the full-time labour market while others never will.</P>
        <P>We will listen intently to the views of Senators in the context of the budget.  The debate on this is currently ongoing in the other House, and I know there also will be a debate in the Seanad.  These are challenging times.  We must ensure that tight budgetary policies are pursued and that we obtain value for money.  In this way we as a Government and as a people &mdash; but as an Oireachtas as well &mdash; can ensure that Ireland remains a competitive nation.  Senator Regan may be right in stating that from time to time we fluctuate, but we are still at the top end of the global competitiveness scale.  We should not lose sight of that.</P>
        <P>The social partners came together recently to discuss a national pay deal, which is being voted upon by the various stakeholders in partnership.  Industrial harmony and peace is another important selling point that we have.  We do not lose a large number of days or weeks to <Col N="512" />industrial disputes, as is happening in other countries.  We should be conscious of that when we speak out nationally and internationally.  As the Minister said yesterday, it is time to be patriotic.  It is time to put the flag around ourselves and put our best foot forward in ensuring that Ireland goes through this turbulent time with everybody&rsquo;s assistance.</P>

    <Title>Budget Statement 2009: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget for 2009 needed to be formulated against the backdrop of a strong downturn in the domestic and much of the global economy and the recent worldwide crisis in financial confidence.  Decisive Government action has been needed to arrest the deterioration on both fronts.</P>
        <P>With regard to the banking crisis, the Government&rsquo;s leadership in giving guarantees of liabilities under a scheme now approved by the European Commission and the co-ordinated reduction in interest rates by central banks around the world, together with the framework declaration by leaders of the eurozone in Paris last Tuesday, whereby member states may also, depending on circumstances, provide greater liquidity and, where necessary, capitalisation, have all been focused on underpinning the financial institutions without which modern society cannot function and which are essential to the viability of this or any other independent state.</P>
        <P>The budget is designed to stabilise the public finances in the interests of securing jobs, living standards and essential public services where a large gap has opened up between income and expenditure as a consequence of the fall in growth of 1.5 % of gross domestic product in 2008, reflecting the sharp decline in housing construction, weakened consumer activity and rising unemployment.  For the first time in more than 20 years, even after budget measures, borrowing will amount to more than &euro;12 billion, which is 6.5% of GDP, while the debt to GDP ratio will rise to 43%.  The aim is to bring the deficit back within agreed EU parameters of less than 3% of GDP by 2011.</P>
        <P>The right balance needed to be struck so as not, on the one hand, to allow our debt to balloon rapidly to unsustainable levels through lack of action, requiring far more severe measures later, but equally not to exacerbate the problems by driving the economy into a deep depression.  Even so, more action and follow-ups will be needed in the future as signalled in the budget on a number of fronts.  In macroeconomic terms, we are allowing automatic stabilisers, such as increased social welfare payments, to operate, but we have no scope, outside of a few targeted interventions, to stimulate the economy across the board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the current situation, every sector of the community, but especially those better placed to do so, is being asked to contribute something.  While individually and in isolation most of the tax increases and most of the cost-saving measures are to be regretted, they are necessary and parties who criticise or complain about them need to put forward a coherent alternative concept.  We have been through a period of exceptional growth, exceptional increases in employment and for many people exceptional improvements in living standards and the range and quality of public services, notwithstanding remaining gaps.  Our objective is to hold on to as many of these gains as possible, even where one step backwards may be needed to take two steps forwards later.</P>
        <P>On the specifics, there is a social welfare package of more than &euro;500 million, with spending increased by 8.4% to &euro;19.6 billion, which includes State pension and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits and allowances increasing by 3% or more, just ahead of the anticipated rate of inflation.  In much better times, the welfare increases in the 1995 budget of the rainbow coalition were only<?oasys _jy ?>2.5%.  Next year&rsquo;s increases include a &euro;7 per week increase in the State contributory pension <Col N="513" />to &euro;230.30 per week.  There is also a two-week extension to 32 weeks in the fuel allowance and a &euro;2 per week increase in the payment.  Payments to carers are also being increased.  The phasing out of child benefit over the age of 18 and the trimming back of the early child care supplement by six months with compensating measures for social welfare and low-income families are reasonable changes pending a more fundamental review of child benefit payments.</P>
        <P>The provision without means test of medical cards to all pensioners over 70 unfortunately has proved a bridge too far in current financial circumstances.  The medical organisations demanded and obtained conditions which are unsustainable.  However, as the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il this morning, the majority of people over 70 will be eligible for a medical card, GP-only card or annual grant payment.</P>
        <P>On income tax, people on the minimum wage stay outside the tax net and those on the average industrial wage remain on the standard rate because of indexation.  The income levy is only a token contribution at lower income levels and excludes social welfare payments.  In infinitely poorer times, people contributed for a patriotic purpose a penny a month to the Catholic Association to help achieve emancipation.  The levy, which rises to 2% on gross income at higher levels, will collect much larger amounts from those on higher incomes and has precedents under different Governments in the 1980s and 1990s and is less permanent than a rise in income tax rates.  Capital gains tax has risen to 22% in tandem.  There is a tax on second homes and on more expensive cars.  No one can say that the higher paid are not contributing more, and the highest reaches of the public service &mdash; secretaries general, Ministers and Ministers of State &mdash; are taking 10% pay cuts.  The public service, as broadly defined, will be included among those paying &euro;200 for city car parking spaces.</P>
        <P>The 8 cent on a litre of petrol in a context of falling prices will raise revenue but also encourage a switch over to more environmentally friendly diesel.  A 0.5% increase in the standard rate of VAT is marginal compared with very large increases of up to 5% at one time in some budgets of the 1980s.  While excise duties on cigarettes and wine are being increased, the 50% reduction in excise on lower alcohol beer and cider is very welcome from a social, safety and employment point of view.</P>
        <P>An important strong statement for inward investment was made by the Minister against this backdrop that there would be no upward shift in the rate of corporation tax in the lifetime of the Government.  The improvement in research and development credits will in fact lower the effective rate for companies.  The three-year tax exemption for start-up companies will also help create employment in small businesses.  In these circumstances, the once-off shift in the preliminary tax payment dates for large companies is reasonable.  In terms of the tax and social welfare system, the cost of employing people and of conducting business in Ireland remains very competitive.</P>
        <P>The continued priority given to education, research and infrastructure is very welcome, and a high level of public investment is being maintained even if some elements in the national development plan will take longer than originally envisaged.</P>
        <P>The fall in house prices, the recent reduction in interest rates, the restructuring of interest relief to help more new and recent purchases, improvements in the local authority mortgage scheme and perhaps the tax on second homes should all help young buyers.  The reduction in stamp duty from 9% to 6% will help the commercial end of the market.</P>
        <P>The budget also contains many environmentally beneficial measures in terms of transport, the home energy saving scheme and the clean-up of large toxic facilities.  I was also pleased to be able to inform the Development Committee of the World Bank in Washington this weekend that Ireland is the sixth largest <i>per capita</i> donor of development aid, and will be contributing <Col N="514" />0.56% of GNP next year, and also of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to hold to the 2012 target of 0.7%.</P>
        <P>I would now like to review areas for which my office has been given responsibility, in particular a major reform of procurement management in the public service through the National Public Procurement Policy Unit in the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works.  Over the last few years, the main focus of reform has been on construction procurement, with the introduction of new fixed price lump sum contracts and standard conditions for the engagement of construction consultants.  All non-commercial State bodies will be required to develop and implement corporate procurement plans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is clearly a strong economic reason for North-South co-operation on procurement.  The National Public Procurement Policy Unit in the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Central Procurement Directorate based in Belfast, and the cross-Border body InterTradelreland, have been working together to develop expertise, so as to take advantage of business opportunities on an all-island basis.  It is important to build on these contacts for mutual benefit across the island.  With an estimated all-island spend on public procurement of &euro;15 billion annually, the pooling of knowledge on more strategic approaches to procurement is essential.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that the Government has reviewed the decentralisation programme, and has identified priority elements on which implementation will proceed at this time.  A capital expenditure envelope of up to &euro;72 million in 2009 and &euro;90 million in 2010 will be provided for the completion of projects going ahead.  Projects proceeding will include a major PPP project to provide, under a single contract, new headquarters for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar, together with a new facility for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Carlow.  A successful tenderer has already been chosen and full planning permission has been granted in respect of the Portlaoise and Mullingar developments.  When completed, the total numbers to be employed at these three locations will be in the region of 1,500.</P>
        <P>I am glad to say that work is well advanced by the OPW in bringing to tender stage other construction projects referred to in yesterday&rsquo;s announcement.  These involve new buildings in the towns of Claremorris, Roscommon, and Tipperary.  Also, and very importantly, this next phase of the programme will include construction of new headquarters for the Defence Forces at the Curragh and for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on a site to be acquired in Charlestown.</P>
        <P>To date, expenditure of approximately &euro;250 million has been incurred on the programme.  This covers the acquisition of development sites, construction of offices and the leasing of accommodation.  Against this expenditure, the OPW has realised approximately &euro;575 million for the Exchequer through the sales of surplus property to the market, which realised &euro;375 million, joint venture deals to the value of &euro;125 million, and the transfer of properties to the Affordable Housing Initiative which realised &euro;75 million.</P>
        <P>The completion of these projects, coupled with the progress already made, will bring 6,000 public service jobs to over 40 locations outside of Dublin.  The 6,000 posts that are moving are primarily Civil Service posts, with a small number of State agency posts. They include 2,500 posts that have already moved, together with an additional 3,500 posts, which are in train.</P>
        <P>The main arguments for decentralisation remain valid.  Decentralisation relieves congestion in the capital.  It provides high-quality jobs for the regions.  It has obvious advantages for securing a better regional balance.  It helps the economic and social development of the chosen <Col N="515" />centres and their catchment areas, as well as providing a further boost to the provision of infrastructure in the regions.  It also has the potential over time, and sometimes immediately, to attract other investment and services, and acts as an incentive to entrepreneurs to develop businesses in the regions, thus creating positive knock-on effects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Flood events which occurred earlier this year leave us in no doubt about the ever-increasing threat which severe weather poses, both to businesses and to householders.  Within OPW&rsquo;s allocation, measures to relieve existing flood risk and to prevent the creation of future flood risk will be prioritised.  Provisions in the Estimates will allow the three flood relief schemes, which are currently on site in Ennis, Clonmel and Mallow, to proceed to completion next year, and will also allow the design of the next phases of those schemes to proceed as planned.</P>
        <P>Likewise, there is good news for potential flood victims in Dublin, Waterford, Arklow, Bray, Carlow, Fermoy, Mornington, Tullow, Enniscorthy and Tullamore.  Our provision will enable the OPW to continue to work with local authorities to deal with problems which, though smaller in overall scale, are nonetheless very significant for the people who are affected by them.</P>
        <P>The Heritage Services of the OPW are now responsible for managing and maintaining over 750 national monuments and a range of historic properties throughout the country.  We provide full interpretative facilities and guide service at over 60 sites which attract over 2.5 million fee-paying visitors annually.  Our heritage is a source of pride and inspiration for all our citizens and a cornerstone of our thriving tourism industry, the beneficial effects of which are felt nationally, regionally and locally.</P>
        <P>The future for the heritage service is one of consolidation.  It will continue to play its role in tourism, but will concentrate on reinvesting in existing facilities and exhibition, and, where appropriate, as a performance venue, developing links with local communities and interests by fostering greater use, and funding will be available for these most important tasks.</P>
        <P>The arts allocation, while reduced, maintains most of the gains of recent years.  The Arts Council current allocation, which is only slightly reduced, will help maintain a broad range of cultural activity and employment.  There has been tremendous investment in recent years in the national cultural institutions, in large projects such as the Wexford Opera House, the Royal Hibernian Academy, the extension to the Gate Theatre, the Cork Opera House refurbishment, as well as in ACCESS projects around the country, beneficiaries of which include the Excel Theatre in Tipperary and the Strand Theatre in Carrick-on-Suir.  Work on the PPPs for the National Concert Hall and the Abbey Theatre will continue as planned.  The Government in the budget recognises that the arts are not an optional extra or a dispensable luxury in difficult times, but integral to the well-being and identity of our society.</P>
        <P>I look forward to listening to the views of Senators on the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no acknowledgment by the Ministers, or anyone in the Cabinet, of the people who are responsible for getting us into this mess, and who have effectively destroyed our public finances over the last number of years.  This morning the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, was so out of touch she thought that the only people who would be affected by the withdrawal of the over-70s medical card would be GPs.  It is true that GPs will see a loss of income; however they will not be as affected by the withdrawal of the over-70s medical card as greatly as the patients.  It shows how little regard the Minister has for people over 70, and the lack of understanding she has of her own Department, when medical cards are withdrawn in that manner.  </P>
        <P>If one does not have a medical card, there is no entitlement to services from the HSE.  There is no entitlement to a home care package or to a public health nurse to come and change <Col N="516" />dressings.  Also, one has to pay in-patient charges in hospital and other in-service charges for long-term care as well.  The patients who will lose their medical cards will be extremely put out by what the Minister has done.  To try and laugh it off by saying only the GPs are affected shows her arrogance and ignorance towards the patients who will be affected.</P>
        <P>The Minister is making it up as she goes along.  She stated that between 5% and 6% of people will be affected by this move because of the other conditions she has brought in.  The Government could not work out how many people would receive an over-70s medical card seven years ago.  The Minister can put her hand on her heart today and tell us how much income and how many assets people over 70 have, to the point that only 5% or 6% of people will be affected.  She has no notion how many people will be affected, and she should admit that.  This is what happens when one is in power too long.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance softened up parents in regard to acting on child benefit next year.  I do not know if he will withdraw it or tax it.  However, it was strongly indicated that is next in the Government&rsquo;s firing line.  Elderly citizens who will hold their &euro;2 increase in their cold hands during the winter will appreciate their call to patriotic duty by the Minister for Finance, who is nicely cushioned in the back of his Mercedes earning more than &euro;4,000 a week.  When he eventually retires, he will have a pension of in excess of &euro;3,000 per week.  Government Members should not insult every man and woman by pretending they are suffering, as they are not suffering at all.  It is a minor inconvenience to them but ordinary people who will pay these additional taxes will suffer greatly in the coming years.  Government Members should not try to align themselves with such people because they are too far out of touch to even consider themselves to be in that position.</P>
        <P>They are the so-called guardians of the tiger but the reality is they have destroyed our economy and they want ordinary people to pay for it.  The 1% income levy is a tax, not a levy, while many of those in double income households will be subject to a 2% tax increase.  They are double income households because house prices were driven daft by Government policy and couples had to have two jobs to buy a house.  The former Taoiseach said it would be unpatriotic if they did anything else other than pay extravagant prices for their homes.  That is why they are in the mess.  They are faced with negative equity and they must pay more for petrol and motor tax and increased VAT.  However, these charges do not apply to the same fat cat Ministers who are calling us all to our patriotic duty.  Their cars are free, they do not pay motor tax nor do they pay for petrol or for the service bills for their Mercedes.  They are completely immune to these increases but they call us all to our patriotic duty.  According to Ministers and Fianna F&aacute;il, the little people, not anybody else and certainly not them, must answer this call.</P>
        <P>How many Ministers will pay the &euro;200 urban car parking space charge?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We will wait for the rest of the Ministers to line up.</P>
        <P>The conditions and pay of Ministers have been enhanced considerably over the past eight years and they are out of touch with ordinary people.  The budget has this written all over it.  It is not fair and the Government was out to hammer people for whatever it could get out of them.  It is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>How does the budget seek to secure the gains that have been made?  The Minister of State admitted there is a lack of flexibility in the public service and said this would have to change but how will that happen?  The Minister for Finance did not bother getting around to it yesterday nor did his predecessor in previous years.  The decentralisation programme is dead, other <Col N="517" />than where contracts are agreed.  However, it is feared large, empty buildings will be scattered across towns throughout the State, for which the Minster of State is responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I assure the Senator they are full in Tipperary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure they are given that every Minister looks after his own patch but what will happen elsewhere?  All the Minister for Finance said he would do is produce a few reports and see what will happen.  Perhaps he will examine the issue again in 2011 but who knows?  The Government does not have a clue what it is doing.</P>
        <P>The scale of borrowing is frightening and this has not hit home with people yet.  It is an admission that, in a short period, the Government has blown a sound economy with public expenditure going awry.  The Minister for Finance stated he is taxing everybody because he needs to restore order and stability to the public finances.  Senator MacSharry will ask what Fine Gael would do about it.  Sadly, as our economy goes up in flames, he is one of the boys in charge.  We have announced what we would do and he can look that up.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il and its partners are in charge and its members must resolve the problem.</P>
        <P>The cutbacks in funding to local authorities will put services such as firefighting at risk.  The reduction in local authority budgets is massive and, at local level, this will create even more problems because, without the transformation we expected to happen in the public service over the past few years, local authorities have only one way to address the shortfall, which is to increase the rates and charges they apply for services.  That will put more pressure on small businesses.  That is the reason the Government was expected to introduce reform and make hard decisions yesterday.  It blew the opportunity and it cannot admit that.</P>
        <P>The Government parties are too cosy and nothing in yesterday&rsquo;s budget would give any Opposition Member even the coldest of comfort that they will sort out the economic problems we face over the next number of years.  There are issues with the public finances and a number of officials have tried to make great strides to address them but when the Minister stated he would not give in to vested interests, he meant he would not take them on.  He will do nothing to introduce the change required.  He will make ordinary people who have been fooled by the Government parties over the past few years pay for their mistakes.</P>
        <P>If one lives a clean life, one will get away with many taxes but many people like a drink, a cigarette, with which I do not agree, a bet and to travel.  The Government&rsquo;s policy is to get them every which way they turn.  I am disappointed by the way the Government parties handled the budget.  They have no shame about taking us back to where we were in the 1980s or before the Celtic tiger.  They have no problems boasting about ratcheting up public debt to 43% of GDP in a short time.  They said they do not want to destabilise the economy and that is why they are borrowing so much money.  While there may be a need for the borrowing, there is a greater need to make sure the money is spent properly.  There is no indication that the message has gotten through to Government politicians.  I am worried, therefore, that they will also fail to make the hard decisions needed to address the banking crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We live in a time of almost unprecedented economic uncertainty and while I usually begin with a retort to Senator Twomey, I will leave that to the end of my contribution.  A number of potential downside risks to the economy were identified in last year&rsquo;s budget and all of them materialised.  They included weaker growth, increased commodity prices, currency appreciation, spillover effects from financial markets and lower housing output.  The upheaval in global financial markets, especially in recent weeks, is unparalleled and it is difficult to know how this will ultimately impact on economic development.  There is no upside to these developments.</P><Col N="518" />
        <P>Ireland is also experiencing a housing market adjustment.  Lower output this year will reduce economic growth by 4%.  The difficulties and issues in the housing market have spread to other sectors of the economy by impacting on employment, confidence and taxation revenue.  Reflecting these developments, the economy has moved into recession and growth for the year will be negative with a cumulative decline in output of 2% over the next two years.  While positive growth is expected to be relatively weak in 2010, the economy is expected to be back on a more sustainable growth path in 2011.</P>
        <P>Lower growth and, in particular, the contraction in consumption and house building have had a major impact on tax revenue, which is 10.5% lower this year.  The increase in unemployment has put pressure on spending, with the result that a general Government deficit of 5.5% of GDP is in prospect this year and it will reach 6.5% next year.  This turnaround in the public finances from a surplus in 2007 is unprecedented in the EMU.  Unemployment has increased.  Averaging 4.5% last year, the forecast for 2009 is 7.3%.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey focused on our economic fundamentals, many of which remain strong.  Our population in the early 1990s was 3.6 million, but it is now 4.4 million.  Where there was a workforce of 1.2 million, that figure is now 2.2 million.  For some of the reasons I have outlined, one would obviously acknowledge that the level is rapidly decreasing.  GNP in the early 1990s was &euro;66 billion, but it is now &euro;160 billion.  GNP <i>per capita</i> was &euro;10,800, but is now &euro;36,100.  The rate of unemployment was 16% and is heading for 7% now.  The debt to GDP ratio was 95%, but is currently 25%.  While it will increase to 43%, this is well below the EU average of 60%.</P>
        <P>When heading into the difficulties of the mid to late 1980s, my father, Ray MacSharry, did not have economic fundamentals as strong as these when delivering his budget in 1987 to lay foundations, which we are now attempting to do to position ourselves to maximise potential benefits from the upturn.  It was necessary to take tough decisions when preparing this budget, the aims of which are to bring order and stability to the public finances, to enhance productive capacity, to ensure fairness in public spending and, importantly, to protect the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like Senator Hanafin, I am proud to stand on this side of the House and welcome the increases in social welfare in the context of our current economic difficulties and tax revenue.  The Minister of State referred to some of them, but they are worth noting again.  The non-contributory and contributory pensions increased by &euro;7 to &euro;219 and &euro;230, respectively, per week.  The qualified adult allowance rate increased by &euro;6.30 for those aged 66 years and over and &euro;4.60 for those aged under 66 years.  The fuel allowance has increased by two weeks with an extra &euro;2 per week.  Carer's allowance and carer's benefit increased by &euro;6.50 per week.  The lowest full adult social welfare rate increased by &euro;6.50 to &euro;204.30.  The qualified child rate has increased by &euro;2 to &euro;26.  The threshold for the family income supplement increased by &euro;10 per child per week.  The minimum maternity benefit and adoptive benefit rates increased by &euro;8.50 to &euro;230.  Some &euro;20 million extra has been allocated to fund school therapists and psychologists, &euro;10 million each for the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.  Some &euro;55 million extra has been allocated to implemented the fair deal for nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The budget has been financed against a background of the most challenging fiscal and economic situation for a generation.  In particular, we are confronted by severe budgetary pressures and negative economic growth.  The budget&rsquo;s aim is to restore order and stability to the public finances with fairness in mind, to increase productivity and competitiveness and to protect to the greatest extent possible the position of the most vulnerable.  Against the uncertain international and domestic economic background, the Government is determined to pursue prudent and sustainable policies that will help everyone through this challenging period.</P><Col N="519" />
        <P Just="Left">There is no question but that the budget was tough.  Listening to various broadcasters and reading the print media today, one could feel a sense of anger, fear and worry about the toughness of some measures.  There are concerns about the 1% and 2% levies.  As Senator Twomey mentioned, there are concerns about the over-70s medical card.  As the Taoiseach mentioned, only 6% of people will be without those cards when one takes into consideration the other measures.  I understand the fear and anger in this respect, but I am confident the Minister will take these concerns into consideration.</P>
        <P>I also understand the natural level of frustration with the 1% levy on all income.  However, it is vital that we all shoulder a burden proportionate to our means.  As a rebuttal to Senator Twomey&rsquo;s comment that this is a 1% levy on the poorest, tax on the poorest was 20 times as high when his party was in government.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The budget will look after the most vulnerable.  The 8.4% increase in social welfare spending is welcome.  I also welcome the fact that we will maintain capital investment to ensure we continue to build momentum in our capital projects.  It is important that we do so strategically, focusing on projects that will increase our marketability in terms of foreign direct investment and assist the development of indigenous enterprise and industry and on public transportation, thereby making a significant contribution.</P>
        <P>Next year, overall expenditure will be almost &euro;57 billion, a 3.6% increase to ensure that we improve services in education, health, social welfare and so on.  These are large figures at a time when all of us agree we are in unprecedented circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we all shoulder burdens proportionate to our means.  The budget has sought to provide for such in a fair and balanced way.  There is no easy way to take tough decisions.  Politics is not about popularity &mdash; it is about leadership.  At a difficult time like this, leadership requires difficult decisions.  In the presentation of this budget, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and their ministerial colleagues have proved they are prepared to take the necessary steps to ensure we are on the right road to recovery.  However, it is but a step.</P>
        <P>Given international circumstances, the banking scheme and the budget are welcome as steps in the right direction, but further steps are necessary.  The Government has shown that it is prepared to take them.  I look forward to it.  We must maintain our ability to move and react quickly if we are to come out the other side of these difficult economic times.</P>

	<P>I welcome the debate.  Like most other Senators, I received approximately 20 submissions from Age Action Ireland, Action on Suicide, Chambers Ireland, the Carers Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland, which attended the Mansion House to point out that &euro;83 million had disappeared while being redirected through the HSE.  Several of the federation&rsquo;s members asked to have their stolen money returned to them.  These are the types of issue we must address.</P>
        <P>D&oacute;chas, which represents 40 organisations, is reasonably satisfied that the 0.7% target for overseas development aid is still on track.  I received a submission from the Irish Cancer Society &mdash; it is regrettable that only 50 cent has been added to each packet of cigarettes, since it could have been &euro;2 &mdash; and Inclusion Ireland.  As children with disabilities have a statutory entitlement to assessments by therapists and so on, therapists have been drawn away.  As a consequence of these staffing restrictions, there is a serious lack of professionals to provide ongoing therapy.  Each area has its own difficulties.</P>
        <P>I also received submissions from the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Deaf Society, Focus Ireland, the IFA, the National Youth Council of Ireland, One Family, OPEN, Schizophrenia Ireland, the Irish Senior Citizens&rsquo; Parliament, the Simon Community and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I am not an economist but I know one simple thing, that money is the symbolic representation of energy.  In the old days one received a sack of corn if one worked for a farmer.  One was then given a gold ducat, a ten bob note, a promissory note, then something else.  The problem internationally is that the symbol has become detached from reality.  We are now into international casino financing and I am disturbed that the Minister&rsquo;s colleague is considering licensing casinos and, in particular, making accessible to Irish gamblers the kind of terminals described throughout Europe as the crack cocaine of gambling.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State in respect of the 1% levy.  It is a disgrace.  Those of us here can afford it.  I do not mind paying 2% but surely people earning under &euro;35,000 should pay nothing at all.  These people are already on the edge.  Those earning between &euro;35,000-50,000 should pay 0.5%.  I have written to the Minister for Finance appealing to him and I will table a recommendation at the appropriate time.  It is important to examine this and it would be very popular if the Minister agreed to it.  I imagine the amount of money gained is quite small.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the situation of the poor.  Liquid fuels have risen by 47% in the past 12 months, other fuels by 39%, gas  by 17-19% and the ESB seeks a 17% increase.  In respect of food, in the 12 months to May the price of flour has risen 39%, bread by 17%, milk by 30%, butter by 17% and tea by 11%.  That shows how near the margins are these people.  I can suggest one practical measure from one of the briefings I was at, given by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It suggests front-loading the fuel allowance, especially for those using oil, who tend to be people in the country.  I welcome the increase to &euro;20 but oil companies will not deliver on the basis of that sum.  If it is paid in two equal parts of &euro;510 in October and then January it will cost the Exchequer nothing but will help the people involved.</P>
        <P>The medical card situation regarding those over the age of 75 is a mess and should never have been implemented.  I approve of means testing but, on the other hand, people have been seduced out of the VHI and are now dumped.  They may not get cover again.</P>
        <P>The merging of the rights agencies is a mean one because there are no savings.  We know that the Combat Poverty Agency will be absorbed into the Office of Social Inclusion and will lose its independence and its capacity for independent research.  There is no saving in this move.  This month, a motion was passed in the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs asking that this would not be done.  The Minister knows the text of this.</P><Col N="521" />
        <P>I refer to the Equality Authority and the Data Protection Commissioner, who are being decentralised.  There is no saving.  This is being done to deprive the poorest of the only voice they had and that is shameful.  The Minister should examine this again.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Many of us on these benches, one of whom is Senator Norris, would have liked to have co-operated and welcomed this budget and the coming Finance Bill.  There was a sense that we were in a state of financial emergency and that we should rally around and not be ultra-critical of everything that occurs.  It is very easy to be critical and it is easy to be in opposition in this period because any cuts will be unpopular and will give politicians plenty of openings and the possibility to champion some cause.  Many of us have supported difficult decisions this Government has made in the past.</P>
        <P>It is a pity that Senator MacSharry invoked the name of his father because this Government is turning its back on some of the great Ministers for Finance that Fianna F&aacute;il has produced.  I include Mr. MacSharry, Albert Reynolds, Bertie Ahern and Charlie McCreevy.  This budget is so badly thought out in its strategy that we are entitled to criticise it on strategic grounds.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why there is such an extraordinary emphasis on tax and such a small emphasis on cuts.  The decision to introduce an income tax of 1% up to &euro;100,000 and 2% up to &euro;200,000 smacks of laziness and easy figures.  It raises &euro;1 billion.  One can see the civil servants or the Cabinet sitting around thinking it is great to get &euro;1 billion that way.  It is the most extraordinarily crude instrument I have seen any Government introduce in any Finance Bill or budget.  It is unfair and is crude in every way when it makes no exceptions of that sort.</P>
        <P>It is fair enough in a state of national emergency to ask well-off people to pay more than those who are  badly off but it is not fair to say that those who have benefitted from the Celtic tiger should be those who are penalised the greatest.  A great number of those who benefitted from the Celtic tiger are those who worked the hardest.  We should not regard this as punishment or a penalty for it.  These people must be recognised.  The Celtic tiger was built, to some extent, on the sweat of the middle classes, who do not deserve to be punished.  We should not hold them up as easy meat and fat cats who did not work for it.  They did work for it.</P>
        <P>There are increases in income tax and capital gains tax, from which the Minister hopes to raise &euro;160 million.  God knows how this will be done because there is no capital gains tax on shares or property.  I do not know how he expects to raise that sum of money.  There are increases in VAT and DIRT in a move to hit the savers and depositors, those who have had a tough time.  I do not understand the strategy behind this except that it is easy mathematics, whereby they know approximately what they will get and tax it.</P>
        <P>There was an alternative, to rebalance this by saying we would make serious cuts.  Let us ask the question why F&Aacute;S is untouched.  The &euro;1 billion allocated is a nice neat figure that the Government could have examined.  The sum remains and some feeble excuse is given in the explanatory memorandum.  What about Enterprise Ireland?  According to the budget document, Enterprise Ireland receives a grant for administrative and general expenses of &euro;98 million and gives &euro;56 million in grants to industry.  It costs more to run it than what it gives in grants.  The IDA is almost exactly the opposite way around, giving grants of &euro;90 million while it costs &euro;43 million to administer.  There must be massive waste in Enterprise Ireland and State agencies.  The Government has not tackled the so-called commercial, State-sponsored bodies either.  I am disappointed that all the emphasis is on tax and so little on spending.  The Government has messed it up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what Senator Ross says in terms of taking a strategic approach in terms of whether one accepts or rejects what is proposed in this budget.  That is preferable to the usual knee-jerk reaction that accompanies debates like this.  Senator Ross&rsquo;s contribution <Col N="522" />was based on a particular economic view of how we should be proceeding.  I do not claim to be an expert on Marx but a Marxist slogan goes, &ldquo;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&rdquo;.  I refer to this in the context of the levy proposal.</P>
        <P>We have had levies before and there is a debate as to whether they are an effective instrument.  When levies were introduced by the rainbow Government, there was no minimum wage, full PRSI was paid on wages and those on the lowest wages were fully in the tax net.  That rate of approximately 30% was an effective tax rate for people at that time, little more than ten years ago.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge the difference between the introduction of a levy then and the introduction of a 1% levy now.  Of the workforce, 36% are not in the tax net, 44% are at the standard level and 20% are at the highest level.  The levy does not apply to social welfare recipients.  We should debate whether those on the lowest wage levels, which are unacceptably low, have a capability and whether we should have this principle of contribution.  We should also debate whether an appropriate contribution is being given by those at the highest level.  This is where I disagree with Senator Ross.  Raising capital gains tax in order to assert the principle that people should pay the same tax on income they receive from capital as they do from income on work should be an intrinsic part of our taxation system.</P>
        <P>I welcome the standardisation of tax relief in respect of medical expenses.  People were getting higher benefit from the tax system by having a higher income yet they were receiving the same medical treatment.  That was an injustice in our tax system and we had to get rid of it.  I welcome the moves towards pensions relief being brought down in respect of the kind of contribution that people can put in and from which they can receive benefit.  It is not acceptable that this State continues to forgo more in tax by subsidising private pensions than we pay in the State pension.  That is not social justice.</P>
        <P>I can accept that the taxation measures may not have been thought out in a strategic way but it is a start and will be added to when we have the report next year from the Commission on Taxation.  We must be honest and admit that this is only one of similar budgets that will be introduced in years to come.  We are talking about a climate where the economy is estimated to have shrunk by 1.5% this year with an estimate that it will shrink by a further 0.75% next year.  This means we will have a similar budget then, with further difficult and unpopular decisions.  It is the business of Government to make those decisions.</P>
        <P>The second point concerns the removal of medical cards from people over 70 years of age.  This measure was introduced with the best of intentions, albeit with an eye towards achieving a certain political advantage.  It was brought in on a rushed basis with no particular knowledge of what the cost might be or its proper social effect.  There was a need to re-adjust that.  I am not too sure whether it has been done properly but at least we know that people over 70 years of age with incomes of &euro;650 per week will still be in receipt of either a full medical card, a doctor-only medical card or a &euro;400 grant towards their medical costs in a year.  If anyone in the Opposition would like to argue that someone aged over 70 with an income in excess of &euro;650 per week should receive some type of support from the State I would like to hear that argument.</P>
        <P>Some of us would like to have a universal health system but we have neither the means nor the resources.  There are some of us who would like to see a universal medical insurance system in place but that will not happen in a budget like this one.  We must make short-term difficult decisions and run the risk of the unpopularity that follows.  As a member of a Government, I have made that choice, my party has made it and so has the Government in which we serve. <Col N="523" /> How it falls out and whether it may be adjusted in future legislation is something we will discover.</P>
        <P>I have always argued, even as an Opposition spokesperson, that we placed too heavy a reliance on the construction industry over the past ten years, in terms of our economic strength.  If the 2007 level of construction were to be maintained in 2008 we would have an economic growth rate of 2.5% this year and 3.5% next year.  The reality is that we were never going to build 90,000 houses year in, year out.  We need a diversified economy.  Circumstances will force us to bring about that outcome and there will be economic pain.  In the long term, however, that is not a bad thing if we can diversify the economy and make sure there is a sustained and sustainable approach to economics in the future.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are a number of measures that the Opposition have claimed amount to support for the construction industry.  They are nothing of the sort.  The housing finance agency loan scheme from which I benefited in purchasing my house in 1987 to the tune of IR&pound;17,500, has been increased to offer &euro;285,000.  That is a 92% grant, offering the possibility of buying a house worth &euro;310,000 to &euro;315,000, a below average house price.  The equity release scheme is a combination of already existing schemes and will allow people who are purchasing through shared ownership to do so in terms of affordable housing.  This scheme is not moving as it is and is causing a capital drain for local authorities.</P>
        <P>Measures have been taken in the budget to allow public resources be used in a more effective and socially just way.  I hope members of the Opposition will look at the budget in a less peevish and churlish way, that they stop concentrating on knee-jerk newspaper headlines, look at the details and see where such balance is being achieved.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I do not follow the last speaker&rsquo;s slightly patronising tone.</P>
        <P>This budget will be the Waterloo for this Government and for this generation of Fianna F&aacute;il.  For the past couple of months, the people of this country were led up the garden path into believing this Government would deliver a tough but fair budget.  Their understanding was that this Minister for Finance was different from his predecessors, Deputies Cowen and McCreevey, and that the pain would be shared by those who gained most from the development of our bubble economy, namely, the builders, speculators and bankers and the high level earners.</P>
        <P>That was folly because this Minister is not different and the budget is all over the place and lacks coherence.  It ruthlessly targets the middle income PAYE family.  It protects the benefactors of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the wealthy and fails to take any significant steps to help those most in need during the sharpest downturn in our economic history.  Although increasing numbers of people are signing on the live register, there is not even one good idea in the entire Budget Statement concerning job protection and the re-energising of people through training and back to work schemes.  This is despite the fact that there are 80,000 more on the dole queues.</P>
        <P>I live among the people who will suffer most from this budget, the lower and middle income families, many in their 30s, 40s and 50s. They are already under severe pressure from savage mortgages and increased overheads.  They are teachers, nurses, tradesmen, factory line workers and shopworkers.  They woke up this morning wondering how they will pay for it all. Hospital charges have gone up and so have medical bills.  There is a return of university fees for the charges announced are fees through the back door.  There are changes in child benefit and child supplement along with increases in a plethora of indirect taxes.  These families will pay more in tax and must pay more for a range of public services.  We learn more about this as the hours go by.</P><Col N="524" />
        <P Just="Left">Like many colleagues and, I presume, the Minister of State, I have received many calls from constituents  I will take this opportunity to tell Members about a few of them.  One was from an old age pensioner who was concerned about the withdrawal of the old age medical card for those over 70 years of age.  As a consequence of having received the card this person did not maintain VHI cover and now does not know what coverage he will have in case of illness, nor how long the wait must be before reclaiming a benefit from the VHI, if that membership is renewed.  This person feels isolated and marooned by the Government.  By all accounts this could still end up in the courts.  I had to explain to this person that the Government could not negotiate a good deal with the GPs in the first place and the consequence is that such people are the ones to suffer.</P>
        <P>Another call came from a friend who has two children in college and another doing the leaving certificate.  This family has a modest income and does not get grants from the local authority.  They must now face up to having to pay registration fees of up to &euro;1,600 a year as well as paying the ancillary costs of sending children to college.  They will also be hit with the reduction and withdrawal of child benefit and thereby experience a double whammy.  Education is a universal right and yesterday the Minister for Finance took it away.  I recently addressed 5,000 students in Cork on this issue and I can tell the Minister fo State that this is one that will return to bite.</P>
        <P>I also took a number of calls from teachers who are irate about the cutbacks in education.  It is clear the Minister is intent on looking after rich kids only.  The increase in class sizes is a disgrace and one of the worst elements of the budget.  School transport costs will be increased and the number of specialised teachers cut.  When I was in primary school in the 1980s, parents used to substitute when teachers were off sick.  Is it not unbelievable that we will return to such circumstances as a result of the Government&rsquo;s decision not to provide sick cover?</P>
        <P>Ministers state that primary teachers will not lose their jobs under this scheme and will be redeployed.  They should tell that to the graduates of St. Patrick&rsquo;s and Mary Immaculate training colleges.  Only last year, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party promised 4,000 extra teachers and a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1.  Under the budget, the pupil-teacher ratio will climb from 27:1 to 28:1.  These measures are cutting back on our children&rsquo;s education.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a retired person who works two days per week to supplement his income.  He will now have to pay 1% tax on income from a 12-hour week.  The 1% tax levy imposed indiscriminately on all incomes is scandalous.  Why did the Minister not exclude from the measure those who are not currently in the tax net?  I fundamentally disagree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s inaccurate comments on the rainbow Government.  The Minister of State should not launch into a diatribe on the levy being the most efficient administrative method of imposing the tax.  It is a quick tax win imposed by the Government on the most vulnerable.  Anyone on fixed social welfare or a pension who works a few hours here and there to make a few bob will have to pay part of his or her income in tax.</P>
        <P>I listened to Ministers state that the levy was introduced because all of us must play our part.  Are they seriously arguing that those in the income bracket I have described, especially retirees on fixed pensions, can afford to pay the levy?  It is not widely recognised that 30% of those in poverty are in homes headed by a person in some form of employment.  The proposed new tax will make their circumstances worse.  Lenihan&rsquo;s levy is a disgrace and will define the Government&rsquo;s attitude towards equity.  Middle income families view it as a direct income tax which, alongside the raising of the earnings ceiling for PRSI, was aimed at them.  No amount of camouflage on pay packets will hide the fact that these families were the Minister&rsquo;s target.</P><Col N="525" />
        <P>The budget savages those who need health services.  The changeover to the standard rate for tax relief on medical expenses will hit middle income families hard because they fall between two stools.  They are not rich and need to use this relief to claw back some of the substantial health care costs for families.  Not only has tax relief on medical expenses been slashed, the minimum threshold for the drug payment scheme has increased by &euro;10 to &euro;100 per month and the qualifying age for disability allowance has been raised from 16 years to 18 years for new claimants.  This latter measure was an example of pure savagery.</P>
        <P>The duration of the illness benefit scheme is to be limited to two years and the number of contributions required increased from 52 to 104.  The list of such measures goes on.  For example, insane charges are being imposed across public hospitals.  Accident and emergency charges will increase from &euro;66 to &euro;100.  Health professionals inform me that they struggle to secure payment of the &euro;66 charge.  How will they get people to pay the &euro;100 charge?  I question this Government&rsquo;s understanding of the internal ramifications of the increased charge and the internal politics of health.  I predict the general practitioner co-operatives we are encouraging members of the public to use to stop clogging up accident and emergency departments will increase their prices with the result that savings will not be made and the taxpayer will be ripped off again.</P>
        <P>Hospital in-charges are to increase from &euro;66 to &euro;75, while long-stay charges are to increase by &euro;31.44 per week.  These measures are being taken by a Government which has shown it does not have a long-term strategy for public hospitals and refuses to support to them.  The increases in hospital charges will prevent people from accessing the medical care they need.</P>
        <P>Vulnerable people have been dealt a major blow by the Government.  They face significant increases in the cost of food and energy and while the Minister provided a modest increase in the fuel allowance, he must know people are suffering greatly from food poverty.  Increases in social welfare payments do not match inflation and the plethora of new, indirect taxes and excise duties will wipe away whatever meagre gains were given.  The increase in pensions is also derisory.  It should be noted that VAT accounts for 14.5% of income among the bottom 10% of earners, whereas it accounts for only 6.8% of the income of those in the top 10% income bracket.  The increase in VAT to 21.5% will accentuate this disparity.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest examples of waste during the so-called Celtic tiger years was the failure of the Government to address the child care issue by establishing a proper child care system.  In Ireland families pay up to 26% of their household income on child care, whereas the figure in many other European Union countries is as low as 5%.  What has the Minister done?  He reduced the upper age threshold for early child care supplement, one of the few benefits available to families, from six years to five and a half years.  The Minister for Finance was the Minister of State with responsibility for children when the supplement was introduced.  How did he arrive at the new threshold of five and a half years?  He was simply seeking another quick tax win.</P>
        <P>As I indicated, the budget includes few measures to protect jobs.  It seems the Government wants us to return to the era of having long-term unemployed.  The budget attacks those seeking to return to work by reducing the period for which jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is paid from 12 months to nine months for those with fewer than 260 contributions and from 15 months to 12 months for those with 260 or more contributions.  The number of social welfare contributions needed for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is to increase from 52 to 104.</P>
        <P>I have spoken on many occasions in the House about the need to stimulate the economy in the area of high value jobs.  Again, the Government has not gone far enough.  Where are the incentives and strategies for the development of high-tech industry or to facilitate the develop<Col N="526" />ment of small and medium size enterprises into larger exporting companies?  This sector is being strangled.</P>
        <P>Why, in the name of God, has the Government not made proper provision in the national development plan for next generation broadband?  How will we ever re-stimulate the economy while we remain the laughing stock of Europe in this area?  The Government should have made provision to address this key infrastructural issue which has been strangling the development of business for years.</P>
        <P>The budget confirms the failure of the decentralisation policy.  In addition, the Government has not produced any new measures in the area of public sector reform.  I hope the Health Service Executive redundancy programme will not be based, even in part, on the unpublished Teamwork reports into acute care.  The voluntary early retirement programme must not be applied to front-line staff and needs to be targeted at middle management.</P>
        <P>Consistency is required in carrying out public sector reform and we do not need change for the sake of it.  Reform must be top down, which will require examining the layer of boards and top level management in the public service and scrutinising the work done for the ridiculous salaries some individuals receive.  I learned recently that a small number of top earning public servants received &euro;3 million in bonuses this year, an insane figure.  The performance management and development system, PMDS, applied in the public service, to which I have alluded in the House on a number of occasions, should also be reviewed.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider or amend the &euro;10 euro departure tax proposed for air travel.  The levy will have a significant impact on tourism at a time when it is facing an uphill battle to maintain the visitor numbers and revenue to which we have become accustomed.  It will also have a detrimental impact on airports, especially regional airports.  If, as it appears, the proposed levy will discriminate against Shannon, Cork and Kerry airports as a result of the distance criteria applied to the two proposed rates, it should be reviewed.  Shannon and Cork airports have suffered enough blows this year.</P>
        <P>This is a dreadful budget which will enter the annals for the severity of the cuts it imposes on families in the PAYE sector, its lack of protection for the vulnerable and lack of investment in children&rsquo;s future, its decimation of the health system and the absence of focus on the need to develop indigenous industry in parallel with inward investment in high value services.  In short, it has no coherence.  The Minister stated he wanted to get the country moving again.  Unfortunately, I worry he will stall it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, has made a manful attempt to put a good gloss on the budget, he has been unable to make it better than it is.  I wish I could support the budget or the Opposition&rsquo;s criticism of it but I can do neither because both sides failed to deal with its core failure, namely, the failure to reform the public sector.  <i>The Irish Times</i> cut to the chase this morning when it described this as the central failure of the budget and stated it was beyond comprehension that in a time of crisis in the public finances a Minister would kick public sector reform into the long grass.</P>
        <P>It was not the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who did this.  He has had many calls in recent times and must not have had any sleep because the dead hand of the Civil Service is all over the budget.  I will give three examples, ranging from minor to major.  First, if civil and public servants are being asked voluntarily to give up 10% of their salaries, by virtue of the same voluntary principle, why are medical card holders not being allowed voluntarily to give up their medical cards?</P><Col N="527" />
        <P>Second, we have been informed that the pain is spread equally across society.  It is a palpable lie to pretend that people in permanent pensionable jobs will endure the same pain during the recession, however long it lasts, as those employed in the private sector.  I spent 20 years in the public sector and 18 years in the private sector and there is no comparison between them.  Life is hard, cruel and difficult in the private sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This brings me to the third problem.  Although the private sector is the one that is not looked after in the budget, it is that sector which alone creates wealth and jobs.  The public sector creates many fine things and gives us many great services, not least the Office of Public Works which comes under the remit of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  We have had great civil servants.  Dr. TK Whitaker was one such civil servant who delivered us from the bane of the Civil Service which had crushed Irish creativity for so long, as was pointed out by Tom Garvin.  However, the current generation of civil servants shows no signs of such creativity and the number of them increases all the time.  Mr. Dermot Gleeson pointed out in Killarney last weekend that public sector numbers have grown by 30% since 2000.  That is 30 new public servants for every 100 in the sector.</P>
        <P>I wish I could support the Opposition but yesterday I did not hear any central criticism from Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party or Sinn F&eacute;in of the core issue of the need for public sector reform.  Why is that the case?  This is where an Independent Senator comes into his or her own.  It is because every party in this country is petrified of the public sector and of the political consequences of taking it on and dealing with it.  This is because the public servants are the real rulers of this country.  It is a case of public sector rules okay, but it is not okay.</P>
        <P>Because of the dead hand of the Civil Service, we did not get the budget we needed.  What we needed was a business budget of tax cuts to allow private sector entrepreneurs and workers to spend, consume and create jobs and we needed spending cuts in the public sector &mdash; it would not have mattered whether such redundancies would have been voluntary or compulsory &mdash; to finance a business budget.  We did not need a &ldquo;sit on your butts&rdquo; budget, as it were, which is what we got from the Civil Service mandarins who drew this up.  I cannot believe the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was completely wide awake when he rubber-stamped this to allow it to go through.  I have huge respect for him but this is a deadly budget rather than a dynamic one.  It is a book-keeper&rsquo;s budget, not a business one.  It is not a budget to bring us out of the decline in the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard nothing coherent from the Opposition in the way of criticism of the budget, except for Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn who had the courage to point out the public sector-private sector apartheid that is growing.  He called for solidarity between public and private sector workers.  I heard nothing from the Labour Party or Fine Gael.  I did not even hear a criticism from Fine Gael of the medical card proposal from the point of view of the exorbitant fees paid to doctors.  Why do its members not demand a cut in the doctors&rsquo; fees?</P>
        <P>I wish I could support this budget or say I could support a coherent Opposition criticism of it, but the central issue, the need for reform of the public service and the need for investment and a dynamic private sector, has not been confronted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome Senator Harris back to the House following his recent illness.  I genuinely welcome him back to the state of independence which he had enjoyed up to 12 months ago.  That was an outstanding contribution by him; it was fearless, brave and informative.  However, regarding his comments concerning the Opposition parties, in particular Fine Gael, I am disappointed he did not notice the contribution by our spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, last week in his document, Recovery through Reform &mdash; A Budget Perspective, in which he majored strongly on the question of the public service.  The Senator would have noted from that document that Fine <Col N="528" />Gael put forward a set of proposals, including a proposed redundancy programme across the public service to reduce its ever growing numbers, for whom the taxpayers have to pay.  The question of public service reform is an issue we will have to revisit.  The colour of the Fine Gael money is on the table.  We proposed a cutback of at least 5,000 jobs in the public service.</P>
        <P>What was introduced yesterday was a tough budget.  People were expecting a tough one and, from a political perspective, there was a willingness from the body politic to take on board the difficult measures required to turn around the economic ship of State.  However, we were hoping those measures would focus on what is very much the kernel of the problem and solution, namely, putting people back to work.  When we had the all-night debate on the banks a fortnight ago, on that same day the most dramatic figure on the economy was released &mdash; the unemployment figure &mdash; which showed a 50% increase in unemployment over the past 12 months.  That is the most dramatic economic indicator we have seen, not only in the past 12 months but probably in the past two or three decades.  Any debate on the budget or the economy must focus on the question of job creation.  It is only through creating jobs, putting people back to work and allowing them to contribute to rather than take from society that we will turn around the economic indicators which have become so disappointing in recent years, if we are blunt about it.</P>
        <P>We must concede that there is no magic solution in terms of the meeting the required economic criteria.  I have said in this House during the past 12 months that in the period from autumn 2006 to the general election date in May 2007, the main Government party succeeded admirably in selling message that Fianna F&aacute;il had a magic formula for economic growth and development and that it was only through that party being in power that our economy could thrive and succeed.  We now know to our cost that there is no magic bullet or magic Fianna F&aacute;il formula and we have to start looking for new answers, hopefully, from new people in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to refer to a number of the budgetary measures introduced yesterday.  The one that has grabbed the public attention most dramatically is the 1% income levy.  It is a crude and regressive measure from a taxation perspective and is not entirely based on ability to pay.  It is quite unlike Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Minister of State present had a long tradition not only of public service but of having an interest in the history of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Probably for the first time in the history of the State, on the basis of the so-called cute politics, of which perhaps the Opposition is sometimes jealous of Fianna F&aacute;il, it has got it spectacularly wrong.  It is introducing a taxation measure &mdash; it can call it a levy but it is a tax &mdash; which will be paid by virtually every citizen of this State, regardless of his or her ability to pay.  That is very unlike Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is almost as unlike Fianna F&aacute;il as the removal from the elderly of the medical cards it granted amid a fanfare of trumpets some years ago.</P>
        <P>I take on board the criticism levelled by Senator Harris regarding the granting of medical cards to all those over the age of 70.  When that measure was introduced it probably required much more thought and regulation from the perspective of what it cost the State by way of the additional premium general practitioners received.  I am no expert on the measure but I am told that a GP receives a higher fee for a medical card patient under the over 70s scheme than he or she receives from a medical card holder in his or her 40s, 50s or 60s. That should never have been the case.  We have given people this benefit and it is difficult to take it away from them.  It will cause a great deal of political difficulty.  That is the Minister of State&rsquo;s problem.  Nevertheless, people are genuinely worried that their medical card and access to reasonably free health care have been removed.  The practicalities of this measure are that when the process is completed, the majority of people over 70 years of age will retain their medical card.</P><Col N="529" />
        <P>However, severe and unnecessary worry has been caused to many people during the past 24 hours.  Urgent clarification is needed.  Apparently a letter will be issued to every medical card holder over the age of 70.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the language used in those letters will be couched not in cold, vague Civil Service speak but in user-friendly informative terms in order that they will aid and support rather than frighten people.  I concede that the majority of people over 70 will eventually retain their medical card but we want to ensure they are not frightened in the interim period.</P>

	<P>This measure to remove the entitlement of a medical card to all those over the age of 70 might turn out to be the Government&rsquo;s footwear and clothing measure.  It will hang around the Government&rsquo;s neck politically and even though a case can be made on pure equality grounds, it will cause administrative chaos and genuine worry and fear among people.  We could speak for much longer on this measure.</P>
        <P>Another budgetary measure is the residential property tax.  I am sure it has a nicer title than that.  I refer to the &euro;200 fee that will levied on the owners of second houses.  Again one could have a philosophical reason for supporting such a measure.  However, if we want to be real about local government and local taxation, let us be real.  Let us produce the work required to look at how local government will be funded into the future, whether there will be need for local taxes, and if so, how this may be balanced against lesser taxes at national level.  We all know that the &euro;200 on the so-called second residence will become &euro;250 next year, &euro;300 the year after and again I am not sure as regards the cost of administration.  Will it be worth the effort?</P>
        <P>The VAT increase appears to be modest, at 0.5%.  However, if we are trying to keep costs down as well as inflation and assist job creation, the VAT increases are quite aggressive.  As regards the change in capital gains tax, the Minister of State would have been involved in the administrative rather than the political side of the Government in 1997&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;-when former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, boldly proclaimed &mdash; probably with some merit &mdash; that the reduction in capital gains tax had produced wonders for the economy.  We are now seeing a reversal of that, albeit small, at a time when enterprise, initiative and effort need to be rewarded.  It is somewhat worrying that taxation is being increased.  I appreciate that money has to be found, and I do not have the magic bullet.  We are having this debate in the aftermath of the budget.  From the viewpoint of future planning, we all get submissions from various interest groups and write pretty meaningless letters to Ministers for Finance in advance of budget day.  Much greater political debate is needed on the economic choices, in advance of the budget.  We are aware that Cabinet confidentiality has to apply, but we must have much more vigorous public debate about the choices that exist.  Even if there is little money, there is always a degree of political choice to be had.</P>
        <P>We are bolting the stable door after the horse has gone.  In the next few months, the economic statistics will not change dramatically.  We need to keep up the dialogue and debate on the economy and consider the alternatives.  Clearly, there is an alternative to this budget.  It will have to centre around real reform of the public service as well as value for money for the taxpayer, giving back choice to people by tax reduction rather than increases.  A good deal of debate is required.</P><Col N="530" />
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I am aware of the enormous responsibility on him and his senior colleagues in Cabinet.  This economy is floundering.  International factors have obviously played a part, but the statistics available for the past two years clearly show that given the boom in property and other areas, as well as the growth in public service numbers and the wastage of money in too many schemes, many of the problems the Government is now trying to correct should never have happened.  We need to redouble our efforts to be more politically and economically vigilant.</P>

        <P LI="1">Viewed in the context of the total requirement to finance the State&rsquo;s activities, an extra levy of this kind cannot be regarded as a huge change in taxation or as something that will make a very big difference to the overall spread of the burden taxation.  I am, therefore, introducing a temporary 1 per cent levy on income.  It will apply to the same income categories and will be collected in the same manner as the youth employment levy introduced last year.  This should yield &pound;47 million in 1983 and about &pound;80 million in a full year.</P>

	<P>People were fearful as regards the 2009 budget because of the deep concern over the finances of the State, mainly due to international circumstances, which have affected its coffers and income.  The Minister for Finance and the Cabinet have put together a comprehensive package.  Where possible, they have protected the vulnerable and continued investment in countrywide infrastructure.  The Government has also given tremendous example in the decision to reduce by 10%  the income of those in ministerial positions.  It is not adopting the Kenny, but rather the Lenihan tax, and we are adopting the 1% and 2%, as appropriate, in this official budget.  We do not believe in solo runs for publicity purposes, as exercised at the weekend, and which I note has not been followed by 99% of the parliamentary party of Fine Gael, and certainly not by the Labour Party. </P>
        <P>I was particularly  glad to note that the decentralisation of the Property Registration Authority of Ireland to Roscommon town will continue as planned.  I have repeatedly emphasised the benefits of moving State agencies to various regions throughout the country.  These benefits take the form of bringing Government investment to rural areas and giving civil servants the opportunity to return to work in their home towns.  This applies only to those agencies which do not, in this age of technology, need to be in a centralised location.  The Property Registration Authority of Ireland, formerly the Land Registry, is a fine example.  While some moves inevitably will need to be postponed in the current economic conditions, it is important that the momentum of decentralisation is maintained and this budget demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I made this case to the Minister of State at our think-in in Galway and I am delighted that Roscommon has been retained and that the building will proceed, with 174 extra jobs being provided in the town.  We shall try to provide accommodation from the number of houses now available in the town at a very keen price.  Some 84 staff have already located there.  I was delighted the Minister of State was appointed to his portfolio because of his tremendous experience in public life.  He knows how to manage that portfolio and I am delighted he is going ahead with so many of the decentralisation schemes.  It was never Fine Gael policy to decentralise.</P>

I was a Member of the D&aacute;il at that time and I opposed the measure.  He begged the late Deputy Jim Kemmy to support it and his refusal brought down the Government.

It is very important the Minister ring-fences that money.</P>
        <P>The 1% levy does not apply to social welfare recipients, contrary to what is being alleged.  I have listened to the radio all day but no one has made that point.

	<P>I refer to the medical cards for the over 70s.  The doctors and the Irish Medical Organisation destroyed the case for them with the charges they imposed.  They called them the golden medical cards and, by God, they made gold out of them.  Few people need to have fears in this regard.  I have checked the means test for the medical card and I am quite confident most people who now qualify will continue to qualify for it.  The problem was new people coming into the scheme.  It was costing too much money and the State could not afford it, so it will be means-tested.  The means test has not been revised since 2006, so will the Minister increase it to take into account the current difficulties?</P>
        <P>I call for a non-resident tax on those who have made millions and billions out of this State and who allegedly do not live here but who appear often enough in the newspapers.

	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Ivana Bacik.  Each year in this debate I usually act as a school teacher examining the pupil&rsquo;s examination results and say: &ldquo;Could do better&rdquo;, but I will not do that today.  Today I will regard the Minister as a grocer giving bad news to his customers and staff and saying: &ldquo;We are having a tough time and we will have to make some tough decisions.&rdquo;  That grocer might say there is bad news but if it is given with clarity and honesty, it will be accepted.  Did the Minister do that?  I believe he made a valiant effort to do so but he did not paint a realistic picture of how he sees the challenge.  He was far too optimistic in his forecasts.  The figures for next year will be worse than he forecasts.  The need to cut current spending is essential.  The forecast is an increase of 7% but that is too much to take.  He did not do what was needed and what the country was willing to take, that is, a cut in current expenditure.</P>
        <P>That grocer would explain to his audience that he had to tackle costs.  The cost of the public service in Ireland is excessive yet when the Minister referred to the Health Service Executive redundancy scheme, he said that discussions were under way on the development of such a scheme.  That was a weak move at a time when we have such high expenditure.  Public sector pay and pensions equal 50% of current spending.  We did not give the people the opportunity to say they will accept the bad news.</P><Col N="534" />
        <P>Look at what happened in Cappoquin Chickens last week.  That great company in County Waterford ran into difficulty.  The new owners went to the workers and said they could not survive unless they took a reduction in pay.  Almost everyone took the reduction in pay.  The country was willing to accept something like that and the public service would have had to do so.</P>
        <P>Look at the performance bonuses paid.  As far as I can see from the figures published last week on performance bonuses paid to senior civil servants, almost everybody got one, although not the same amount.  Performance bonuses are paid for exceptional work or work over and above what one is expected to do in one&rsquo;s normal duties.  That is what we should have tackled yesterday.</P>
        <P>That grocer would have done something daring and imaginative to encourage customers to stay.  Who are our principal customers?  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that he was bringing forward a number of measures to support jobs, encourage enterprise and enhance our productive capacity.  Although the steps he took were welcome, they were mild and not very exciting.</P>
        <P>If the Minister was running a shop and if he had a problem, he would ensure that while he was giving all the bad news, he would give the customers some good news about a special offer which would draw their attention to something about which they could do something.  I did not see any sign of that or of holding out any hope to our customers.  When the late Charles Haughey was Minister for Health in 1979, he had no money to do anything but he gave everybody a toothbrush.  I was reminded of that yesterday by a 39 year old who said the one thing they remembered about Mr. Haughey was that toothbrush.  It was not very much but he had the imagination to distract attention from the very limited budget he had.  I did not see the Minister showing imagination.</P>
        <P>In his debate with Senator Barack Obama a couple of weeks ago, Senator John McCain made a slip of the tongue.  When referring to Senator Obama&rsquo;s wish to increase tax, he said Ireland increased the amount of money it took in when it reduced corporation tax to 11%.  We do not have an 11% corporation tax rate but a 12.5% one.  It was a slip-up on Senator John McCain&rsquo;s part.  Would it not have been imaginative if we had said to our biggest customers, who are the foreign direct investors, that this is an opportunity to reduce the rate of tax?  All the evidence suggests that each time we reduce the rate of tax, we take in more money.  That is the type of imaginative step we could have taken.  I am not criticising all the steps the Minister has taken but I would have preferred to have seen more imagination and more daring in this area.</P>
        <P>I will comment on the one tax which I do not believe anyone else has.  Foreign direct investment is important and I was delighted the Minister said that there is no question of the 12.5% corporation tax being increased but he has increased capital gains tax.  There will be no capital gains for the next couple of years anyway but this will frighten those foreign direct investors.  I would have preferred to have seen more imagination in this budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me.  I would like to put forward some reasons the budget should be criticised and opposed.  We all accept the Government is in dire financial circumstances.  There is no question about that.  However, many of us would say the Government must bear some responsibility for the state of the economy.  That is the least we can expect, given it has held uninterrupted power for the past 11 years.  Despite this, in his speech yesterday the Minister for Finance asked all of us to make a common sacrifice and bear an equal part of the burden in what he described as a patriotic call to action.</P><Col N="535" />
        <P>The programme of cutbacks and closures will not call on everyone to make equal sacrifices.  Rather, it will bear most heavily on the most vulnerable.  Numerous criticisms were made on this side of the House, and elsewhere, with regard to how the budget will bear heavily on the poor and disadvantaged, which is regrettable.  It is a regressive budget because of that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has increased a range of taxes, direct and indirect, in a variety of areas of human activity, including hospitals, travel, education, child care and an across-the-board increase on VAT.  He has also increased the tax on wine, cigarettes and petrol.  If one could be permitted a moment of levity in the gloomy and bleak prospect of this budget, one might wonder why the Government seems to approve of beer-drinking cyclists who take their holidays at home as long as they do not actually own a holiday home here.  Bizarrely, beer and spirits have not attracted tax increases similar to those on wine, cigarettes and petrol.</P>
        <P>The Minister could have considered other ways of raising revenue.  Senator Quinn spoke of imaginative measures.  This was the time for imagination and creativity.  We and many environmentalists expected and hoped more progressive measures would be introduced to reduce our carbon emissions, which are appallingly high.  We have not come close to meeting our Kyoto targets, yet the Minister has deferred the introduction of a carbon tax.</P>
        <P>Other than the small charge for second homes, there is no attempt in the budget to introduce any sort of real property tax.  Instead, the Minister has taken the easy option of increasing other taxes across the board, most significantly income tax.  He has described the increase as a levy &mdash; it has been termed the Lenihan levy &mdash; but we all know it is an income tax and that it will bear disproportionately on the poor.  A levy of 1% will be based on gross income up to &euro;100,000 and 2% above that.  The biggest problem in this regard is there is no minimum threshold.  This is something that will be debated further in the Houses.  There should be a minimum threshold and those who earn below a certain level should not have to pay 1% of their income.  Few of us could disagree that those who earn over &euro;100,000 should pay more, but it wrong and regressive to introduce minimum wage earners into the taxation net.</P>
        <P>Will there be any winners as a result of the changes in taxation?  The only notable tax that brings about a win is one for developers, namely, the significant concession made with the reduction in stamp duty on commercial property.  Apart from that, we are all losers.  We are losers too in the area for which the Minister of State has responsibility, arts and culture, where there are enormous and swingeing cuts for cultural institutions and the arts generally.  We are all losers too in terms of the cutbacks to be imposed on human rights bodies, the Equality Authority and a range of other agencies that do important work.  The body that has been working on early childhood education will be closed and numerous other closures and cutbacks are to be imposed.  We will all be the losers from that.</P>
        <P>We are all losers as a result of the Government&rsquo;s new policy of abolishing or cutting back significantly on universal benefits, for example, the loss of child care supplement for children over five and a half years of age and the loss of child benefit for young adults over 18 in full-time education.  What is of concern also is the sinister signal the Minister has sent that he will ask the commission on taxation to examine the payment of universal child benefit more generally.  All of these moves are of great concern because they signal a regressive movement towards means testing for every State benefit.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether that is the case?  If it is, we will see greater inequality and a deepening of the already serious divide between rich and poor.</P>
        <P>If we see means testing introduced for every benefit, we will see greater segregation in terms of education and health care.  We have already got a two-tier health service, but we will now see two-tier education and child care systems in place, which is most regressive.  The question has been asked as to why millionaires&rsquo; children should get free fees.  Why not if it means their <Col N="536" />children go to the same schools as those on social welfare?  There is a greater good to be served by universal provision.  The budget is most regressive in that it encroaches on and undermines that principle.</P>

	<P>I am surprised to hear Senator Bacik give out about means testing because what it does is target resources at those who need them most.  The Senator must recognise that resources are limited.  I would have thought means testing was something she would advocate.  I do not mean to pick on the Senator, but she was most unfair in her comment that as a result of this budget, the burden falls most heavily on the poor.  It falls on everybody and that is the problem.  Everybody is being asked to pay their bit.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not fair to say it bears most heavily on the poor.  It is regrettable that people of limited and fixed means will have to make a contribution, but the Government in its wisdom has decided that everyone must make a contribution, however great or small.  I was delighted to see Senator Harris back in the House and listened to him with great interest.  I agree with him that part of the problem is the required public sector reform.  I agree too with Senator Ross that it is unfair that people who became a success or benefited from the Celtic tiger are being vilified.  It should be acknowledged that these people took risks and made investments on behalf of the country.</P>
        <P>With dramatically reduced revenue available, the challenge for the Government is to meet the cost of running public services.  These services have seen significant investment during recent buoyant times.  It is regrettable that we must scale back some of these services and delay targets such as reduced teacher-pupil ratios.  However, we must act now to contain further decline and arrest the decline in public finances.  That is the reason we needed this tough budget, which is only the beginning of the plan to restore the economy and put it on a sound footing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the prosperous years the economy delivered resources which allowed successive Governments to invest heavily in enhanced public services to which we have all got used.  There is, however, no easy way to make tough decisions.  I listened to Fine Gael&rsquo;s response and felt there was an element of disingenuousness in it and in its proposal to reduce borrowing further from &euro;6.5 billion to &euro;5.5 billion.  This would involve, in addition to the measures outlined in the budget, sacking 10,000 public service workers before Christmas or cutting 500,000 medical cards from poor people.  That is the reality of such decisions.  Fine Gael should acknowledge that is the case.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey made the point earlier that it is not Fine Gael&rsquo;s responsibility to come up with the good solutions because it is the Government that is in charge.  We must be responsible and consistent.  We cannot say on one side we would not cut public expenditure and at the same time criticise the Government for doing such a thing.  The situation is difficult and the Government has a tightrope to dance.  Perhaps Fine Gael will learn about that one day.</P>
        <P>Rationalisation of the public service must be carried out sooner rather than later.  The Minister has indicated that in a matter of months he will set to work on reducing public service numbers.  We need to establish where the cuts are needed and how to redeploy people.  If nurses or therapists are needed in the community rather than in a hospital, we need to have flexibility and co-operation from them so that they will work where required.  I am concerned by the chasm that is growing between workers in the public and private sector and the level of resentment that could boil over if public sector reform does not take place.  The public sector represents 17% of the workforce.  It is paid for by the resources generated by the other 83%, <Col N="537" />the private sector.  The public service cannot be allowed to operate in a different sphere.  It will damage itself enormously if it is perceived to be immune to the vagaries of the economy, particularly by the people who finance it in the private sector.  The public sector is not immune and cannot remain immune.  The change required in the public sector is not a demonstration of the capacity to change and be flexible by imposing performance and productivity targets on itself.  It must convince the public at large and the private sector &mdash; the people who pay for it &mdash; that it can operate in a way that makes sense.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows, and demonstrated in the budgetary arithmetic he presented yesterday, that he is not in a position to delay this reform.  I understand he is about to undertake reform, which needs to get under way sooner rather than later.  Ultimately, the public will not support sustaining an inflexible public service which is not affordable.  As a Government, we need to send out that message.  I look forward to the reforms that are under way and which will go a long way to restoring the public finances to where they were in previous years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  As we all know, he was a Member of the last Seanad.</P>
        <P>The measures in this budget come as no great surprise but the severity of it has disappointed many of us.  It is only now that the chickens are coming home to roost and the ordinary compliant taxpayers, the hard-working families, are paying for the decades of cute-hoorism.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, talked about the need to restore calm in the public finances and to bring back some type of order.  However, we should not forget that it was this Government that brought about the mess that represents the financial capability of this country &mdash; the lack of money and the state of public finances.  The budget has mercilessly attacked middle-income families.  It has gone after those people with a vengeance.  It has failed to protect those it sought to protect &mdash; those whom the spin says it is protecting &mdash; and has left the super-wealthy free of contributing their fair share to the recovery of our economy.</P>
        <P>Despite that fact that we are seeing the most serious increase in the numbers out of work in recent times &mdash; there has been a mammoth increase &mdash; there is not one initiative in the budget to deal with the number of job losses or to deal adequately with those who lose their jobs by providing education and training.  The people who will suffer most as a result of this budget will be the nurse, the teacher, the garda or the skilled tradesman &mdash; people who are struggling to make ends meet, pay mortgages or child care costs or send their children to university.  These families will pay more in tax and more for the range of public services, and the full extent of these charges will not be clear for a number of days.  The social welfare package is only half of what was announced in last year&rsquo;s budget and it is clear that those at the bottom of the pile are going to fall even further behind.  The Government has inflicted the maximum possible pain on middle-income families and done nothing to ensure that those who have made vast fortunes out of the Celtic tiger are contributing to the recovery of the economy.</P>
        <P>This budget has done little to encourage younger people to join the agricultural sector.  The measures announced to extend the farm stock relief and stamp duty relief schemes for trained young farmers are welcome, but they could have been bolder in bringing the over-35s into the equation with regard to stamp duty.  The suspension of further entry into the young farmer installation scheme sends a clear message from the Government to those who might enter the sector to stay away.  In order for farming to be viable we need young blood.  We need young people and new people to come into it.  That is not happening.</P>
        <P>The protection of the vulnerable in the area of social affairs has failed to materialise.  The budget is &euro;515 million, half of what it was last year.  The general increase of &euro;6 in social welfare payments will do little to offset the increases in food costs and the general inflation-based increase of 4.3%.  It misses the point in terms of protecting the vulnerable.  People are now <Col N="538" />finding themselves on the dole queues after years of economic prosperity and jobs for everybody.  Last night the standard entitlement to unemployment benefit was cut from 15 months to 12 months.  These cuts have been applied to people who are already on the live register and who have effectively been hit with a double whammy.  Why?  It is because in the first instance they have had the misfortune of losing their jobs at the beginning of a very difficult recession, and now they find they cannot even rely on the welfare income to which they thought they were entitled &mdash; the same welfare income to which they had been contributing while they were working.  This aspect of the budget has all the hallmarks of a move to encourage emigration.  That is despicable and disgraceful.</P>
        <P>With regard to the removal of the entitlement to medical cards for those over 70, we must go beyond the spin put on the by Government.  Let us begin with the inception of the scheme.  The scheme, termed the &ldquo;gold card&rdquo; because of the fees being paid to GPs, which was four times what they were being paid under the ordinary medical card scheme, was introduced in 2001.  The political thinking behind that move was to win the 2002 general election.  There was nothing else.  The Minister who introduced it, former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, would have been well advised by civil servants, colleagues and others, if he consulted with them, of the financial implications of the move.  However, it was political opportunism at its worst.  Now the Government wants to withdraw it.  It wants to take people out of the scheme and put them back in a means-tested system.  These are the people who have the greatest need of health care &mdash; those who depend and rely on this card for a wide range of services, including access to public health nurses, GPs and therapists.</P>
        <P>My telephone has been hopping and I am sure every public representative, whether Government or Opposition, has been contacted by people who are now fearful of losing their medical cards.  Research has already indicated that people who cannot afford a GP and who do not have a medical card will stay away from their GPs.  This will contribute to ill health among that section of society.  It is despicable.  This move was first leaked to the media two or three weeks ago and became a talking point.  The spin was that only those over a certain limit &mdash; the retired bankers, consultants or barristers who could well afford to do without it &mdash; would lose it, so there was not much sympathy.  Thus, a spin campaign was begun to ease people into the knowledge that the scheme was being ended.  However, we now realise that many more people than we originally thought will lose their cards.  Fear has been created among these people, and that is unforgivable.</P>
        <P>Third level fees, registration costs or whatever one wants to call them are an expense for those attending third level institutions.  I got a call yesterday evening from a constituent who was attending University College Cork and was already living hand to mouth.  I will say no more other than that this is a genuine case of hardship.  He now has to countenance a payment of &euro;1,500 which he does not have.  It is because the Government is intent on reversing the brave and visionary decision of the rainbow Government under the stewardship of Niamh Bhreathnach when she was Minister for Education, to abolish third level fees.  This Government is intent on reintroducing third level fees.  We have seen a number of Ministers fly the flag on their reintroduction, including the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who was bailed out by Deputy Harney, and more recently the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who relied on a golf-playing dental economist, who must be very adept at education economics, to push the case for reintroducing them.</P>
        <P>The Government is sneakily doing it through the back door.  The charge of &euro;1,500 is a scandal and a disgrace. The descendants of the visionary education Minister, the late Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, who abolished second level fees, must be appalled by this move.  What will be next on the Government&rsquo;s agenda for education?  Will costs and fees for second level education be intro<Col N="539" />duced?  Why is it so against third level education?  Why is it so opposed to people from less well off backgrounds going to university?  These are the people on whom we will rely to reboot the economy and to provide the services and qualifications needed to keep this country vibrant and turn the corner from the recession.</P>
        <P>We were promised 4,000 extra teachers by the Government.  What has it done?  It has slashed 400 teaching jobs.  We were promised 20 pupils per teacher.  We all know the classroom size issue.  Every single candidate who contested the general election last year would have been lobbied extensively by educationalists about this matter.  What has happened?  The ratio has increased from 27:1 to 28:1.  Is that not some indictment of the Government&rsquo;s educational policy?  School transport fees have gone up to &euro;300, an increase of 150%.  Of all the moves, taking the medical cards from the over 70s and registration fees are the most despicable.</P>
        <P>I conclude on a point I made on the Order of Business this morning.  The Government should be honest and call the income levy what it is.  It is an increase in the income tax levels from 20% to 21% and from 41% to 42%.  We got a distorted political lesson from a colleague in this House a while ago, who supported the income levy being introduced, but opposed the one introduced because of dire financial consequences in the 1980s brought about by reckless spending on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il after the 1977 general election.  Senators should bear in mind there are no allowances or reliefs for this particular taxation.  The Government should be honest and call it what it is.  It is not an income levy; it is an increase in taxation.  Throughout this debate, the Government Senators will support and the Opposition will oppose.  I am dumbfounded that any Senator could possibly ride both horses in this Chamber this evening.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleagues have commented well and forcefully on the impressions that will be created by this budget.  Two points are most apparent and most upsetting to the families and those who will be paying these new taxes and dealing with the new economic reality we all face.  The first is the imposition of an income levy that does not discriminate or differentiate between someone earning &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 a year and someone earning &euro;95,000 a year.  The second is the withdrawal of medical cards for those over 70 years of age.  The granting of those cards was a clear symbol of the existence of universal benefits in the country.  Our movement away from it, regardless of the economic circumstances we are facing, will cause great worry and upset for many families.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>However, I wish to discuss the Government&rsquo;s objective, which it has stated many times, to bring order to the public finances.  I wish to examine how it claims it will do that.  Even a cursory examination of the assumptions the Government has outlined regarding how the budget will perform shows it is culpable of the most profound economic negligence that puts everything it has done up to this point into the shade.  When this House debated the budget, we said that the assumptions on which it was based were flawed.  We talked about the number of house builds on which last year&rsquo;s budget was predicated and we pointed out that no economist or anybody with a real understanding of how the economy is performing expected those houses to be built, which is what happened.  That budget was built upon flawed assumptions that nobody believed would happen.  Even if we had not encountered what are, I accept, exceptional global circumstances the mere development of the kind of economy we were witnessing last year would have meant that the budgetary assumptions of last year would never happen.</P>
        <P>We can see exactly the same thing happening now.  Government Members talk about social solidarity and the need for everybody to make sacrifices.  They claim to have a plan and if it is to work they need everybody to undergo hardship and make sacrifices now.  However, there are two assumptions in all this that are very likely to undercut everything they talk about.  The first assumption the Government made is that the recession will end in 2009.  It believes that <Col N="540" />unemployment will peak next year at approximately 7% to 8%.  It then believes that from 2010 to 2011 the average rate of national income growth will be between 3% and 3.5%.  I challenge the Government to produce a group or even a single credible economist who will make that forecast and believe it will happen.  The truth is that any organisation or single economist trying to predict the future can only envisage an uncertain global economy and can only expect that the national income of countries like ours will be squeezed.</P>
        <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Government believes that our national income will rebound from where it is now to growing next year and by 3% for the subsequent years.  This is storing up even greater difficulties in the years ahead.  The Government is hoping that the current global economic circumstances will rebound and that rebounding will save it hard choices.  That was the assumption it made last year and it has not happened.  In the plan to restore so-called order to the public finances it claims this will happen by 2011.  By 2011 on its own figures there will be a &euro;3 billion gap between where it expects the deficit to be and the deficit required to be delivered under Stability and Growth Pact.  Some &euro;3 billion needs to be raised through either raising taxes or cutting services, for which we have no plan.</P>
        <P>My other colleagues have made very forceful points about the impact the budget will have on families here and now.  They are pressing problems and already coming home to roost.  The entire budget relies on a set of economic circumstances that are so optimistic that even if the economy gets back to normal growth next year, which is unfortunately unlikely, those assumptions will not be met.  It means that even the kinds of sacrifices, solidarity and suffering the Minister of State suggests people need to show now in order to enjoy a return to a good economy at some point in the future will not make that happen.  Given the Government&rsquo;s track record of making rosy economic assumptions, those assumptions not being met and it blaming somebody else for their failure to be met, I fear we will see the same happen again in the future.  We are witnessing the same kinds of rosy assumptions being made on the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government must take responsibility for how the economy has been managed in the past ten years.  The standard way to manage an economy that is going very well is not to allow it to overheat and to save money for a rainy day, provide tax cuts when needed and lower interest rates when needed.  The big question the Government must answer alongside many others is why, given that we have reached the rainy day, is the war chest empty?  After enjoying rates of economic growth of 6%, 7% and 8% year on year, why is it that the moment people turn to the Government seeking help it can give no help?  That question must be answered.  As we work through the difficult times ahead we need to look to the past and ask what we can learn from the lessons of the past.  All I can see in this budget is the mistakes of the past being made again, being compounded and made on a worse scale.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley rightly pointed out that Fine Gael had not been in government recently.  Perhaps if we get into government at some point in the future &mdash; I am certain we will &mdash; we would have had the opportunity to learn the experiences the Government parties have.  I am envious of any politician in any party that has the term of Government that Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s party has had.  The lessons we need to learn are minor by comparison with the lessons the Government needs to learn in looking to the future, making responsible and prudent decisions and then having the honesty to communicate that to the people.  That has not happened here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have listened to the various contributions to this budget debate with great interest.  I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate at a time when the global economy and the world financial markets are in a state of freefall.  The collapsed economy and financial markets are such that the various attempts by governments, the European Union and institutions do not seem to have had any real impact to date.</P><Col N="541" />
        <P>The uncertainty in the international economy and the financial environment places us in a very difficult position, but we have to assess and meet that challenge head-on.  We are fortunate, due to our economic success over recent years, to be in a strong position with a fairly solid foundation.  Let us not lose sight of what has been achieved.  Our country has been transformed.  We have all gainfully witnessed an unprecedented and hugely successful economic period.  Ireland is now seen internationally as an attractive place to do business.  We enjoy a great reputation of being confident, dynamic and highly qualified.  As a result, success has been built and sustained and given the particular turbulent global challenges we face today, one does not have to be a rocket scientist to know how difficult it will be to sustain hope and confidence in the face of current daily challenges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No one is immune to the challenges ahead, and each one of us needs to deal with the competing realities of our aspirations to improve the quality of life for all.  Listening to some of the Opposition, they paint a defeated and sad outlook from a desperate last cry of wolf, barely standing on their last legs.  They have helped to do one good thing with their desperate cries; that is, they have highlighted that the odds are stacked against Government, mainly due to forces outside our control due to the global economic and financial turmoil.  They have jumped on the easy fix gravy train and joined in the chorus of outcries on all the unpopular decisions.</P>
        <P>I have a simple message.  Life and circumstances change, but one cannot give up.  We have to find new ways, a new vision and reposition ourselves.  The essential difference between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Opposition is that the Fianna F&aacute;il approach and record is positive and the Opposition&rsquo;s is one of negativity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and his ministerial team are endeavouring to protect the progress we have made.  They are  determined to stabilise the current situation, correct our fiscal imbalances and position us to benefit when the upturn comes.  This has necessitated a significant reduction in Government expenditure, revenue generation and the imposition of certain other measures across the board.  The public have seen clearly that what must be done is being done.  There is a genuine appreciation of what is required, while not necessarily agreement on all aspects on how to achieve our target.  We are, by no means, out of our difficulties yet, but there is almost a tangible acceptance of the need to proceed and a determination to get through this period and back to a destiny that Fianna F&aacute;il is capable of delivering, as proven over the past decade.</P>
        <P>We need to make tough, but correct, macro-fiscal decisions.  We have come from a position where we enjoyed cash surpluses for the past number of years, to a serious deficit situation, where we now have to borrow.  I support, in principle, the prioritisation that the budget for 2009 contains.  The &euro;57 billion spend is based on the delivery of long-term economic and social improvements, through a combination of focused targets, and paves the way for a brighter future for all.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach stated:  &ldquo;We are determined to keep our focus on making sure that we come out of these difficult times as quickly and as strongly as possible&rdquo;.  The budget reflects the Government&rsquo;s focus on reducing expenditure on non-essentials and to spend moneys in areas of greatest priority.  I do not have the opportunity in the time left to discuss some issues I wanted to raise on expenditure on non-essentials and expenditure on areas of priority.  I hope I will have the opportunity at some point to put those on record.</P>
        <P>I welcome that this budget continues to heavily invest in areas of priority, in particular the national development plan, transport and communications, the environmental services and research and development, which will help to drive the future economic progress of this country.  I equally welcome the &euro;20 million spend, and the numerous improvements and increases <Col N="542" />in social welfare, in particular the extra &euro;166 million package of supports for older people, especially the weekly payment increases, along with the &euro;30 million energy package, with an extension of the fuel allowance season to 32 weeks and an increase in the fuel payment to &euro;20 per week.</P>
        <P>To a great extent, this year&rsquo;s budget is overshadowed by the income levy and the withdrawal of the medical card.  I am concerned that the withdrawal of the eligibility criteria for the medical card is referred to as affecting those over 70.  Fianna F&aacute;il philosophy has always been caring and compassionate to our older people, which is reflected in the number of unique and innovative feature contained in our health and social welfare services.  I have a proposal but I do not have time to put it on the record.  I wish to advise the Minister of State that the issue of the withdrawal of medical cards needs to be revisited.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State came to this House with the reality behind and in front of him that he and the Government have hit the ordinary people of Ireland, in a budget where the people have been once again asked to bail out him and his colleagues.  Any critique or analysis of this budget can only paint one picture.  It contains savage cuts, regressive taxation and taxes the elderly and those on low incomes.  It is socially unjust.  Above all, the legacy and the imprint Fianna F&aacute;il has left today in the homes of Ireland are that the poor, the vulnerable and the middle income earners have been left on their own.  Fianna F&aacute;il has turned its backs on them.  The untruths of the general election have come home to roost and now the fraud it has perpetrated has been exposed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s Government has not looked after the vulnerable members of society.  They have been let down.  This is a savage budget with savage cuts which hurt people and will make the recession deeper.  Senator Callely spoke on economic affairs outside our control, but this budget, in the current economic situation, is a missed opportunity.  Senator Harris spoke of public service reform but there is none.  There is no innovation or new ideas.  The Government had an opportunity to end decentralisation and it funked it.</P>
        <P>The cuts to be imposed mean less money and fewer services.  The Government has taxed the people.  Members of the Government cannot mention Ernest Blythe, or John Bruton and children&rsquo;s footwear and clothing.  The Government has done much worse.

The Minister of State referred to emancipation, which means freedom.  Is the Minister of State&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; taxing the elderly, bringing the low paid into the tax net, increasing <Col N="543" />class sizes, increasing the cost of secondary school annual bus tickets, abolishing medical cards for the over 70s, increasing college registration and denying education to people and halving child benefit for over 18s?

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Buttimer.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil go leor le r&aacute; aige ar an cheist seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; iontach bu&iacute;och gur roinn s&eacute; a chuid ama liom.</P>
        <P>The budget is terrible and it has rightly gone down badly in the community.  The Government parties had to make cutbacks and manage the public finances but they have got it all wrong.  They promised us they would look after the most vulnerable but they did not.  They stated they would ensure the top earners would pay their fair share but they did not.  The also promised that front-line health and education services would be protected but this did not happen.</P>
        <P>The Government failed to tackle the crisis in education in the budget.  It is astonishing that the parties have opted to increase class sizes and slash the funding for primary school buildings.  Everyone knew they had moved away from their commitment in the programme for Government to reduce class sizes.  However, no one expected it to be completely abandoned in favour of an increase in class sizes.  This move is a kick in the teeth to all the voters who took Fianna F&aacute;il at its word when it promised to reduce class sizes during the general election campaign in 2007.  More than 1,400 schools are covered by the schools building programme, yet the Government has slashed funding for the primary sector.  The Minister announced an additional &euro;79 million for the programme but it is all being invested in third level institutions.  It is unbelievable that the Government is considering a 5% reduction in funding for primary school buildings.</P>
        <P>The increase in the registration fee for third level students from &euro;900 to &euro;1,500 will place a huge burden on students subject to high rents and other education costs.  The Government promised that the capitation grant would be doubled but it will only increase by 13%, which will do nothing for schools that are &euro;84 million in debt and which must be funded through cake sales, race nights and so on.  An opportunity was missed.  I welcome a number of small measures the Government got right but, in general, this is a bad budget and it needs to be revisited through amendments to the Finance Bill.  The Government parties need to do the right thing and acknowledge they got the budget wrong.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome our former colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  This is the first time I have been in the House in his presence.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Opposition parties over recent months have referred to the need to secure an economic and social future for our country and they said the budget should be designed to do that.  In my lifetime, I have never known the Cabinet to sit for so many long hours to put the budget together.  I have not known Ministers to work around the clock all weekend to do so.  This reflects the bad economic state in which the country finds itself.  Two weeks ago the House worked through the night to pass emergency legislation when the Government had to guarantee financial institutions to the tune of &euro;400 billion.</P>
        <P>This is a great budget and it is designed to secure the economic and social future of our country.  I congratulate the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  RTE&rsquo;s chief reporter stated on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; earlier that the budget did not go far enough and it could have been much tougher but it is designed as part of a three-year programme and it <Col N="544" />will get tougher next year and the year after.  He also said we are all in this together and everyone must take their share of the pain.</P>
        <P>I refer to health issues.  A number of Opposition Members stated they received 20 or 30 e-mails.  I received two e-mails, one from a cancer research organisation complaining that the increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes was not sufficient and another from Age Action Ireland.  On the Order of Business, Opposition Members said old people had been left in the lurch and they are in no man&rsquo;s land because they had cancelled their VHI policy when they received a free medical card.  I went to the trouble of ringing the VHI to ask how many people left the organisation when they received the card.  I was told there had been no noticeable decrease in the number of over 70s.  In 2001 before the change was made, the VHI had 88,989 members aged over 70 whereas today the number stands at 120,776.  The VHI will take back the customers who left in 2002 and they will not be asked to wait ten years if they have a complaint, as was pointed out on the Order of Business.  They will be recognised as full members provided they pay the premia they missed.  This is done in the interests of present customers, which is fair enough.  The VHI also said they would ask them to become members before 1 January next.  However, this involves only a small number of people.</P>
        <P>A total of 80% of over 70s will still be covered by the medical card because those in receipt of the basic pension will retain their medical card going forward.  Following the budget, 15% of over 70s will receive a cash grant of &euro;400 annually per person.  An additional &euro;454 million will be invested in health services next year.  Doctors are the biggest losers in the health area as their funding is reduced by &euro;85 million and that is no bad thing.</P>

	<P>Our over 70s will take what is coming when they know the great savings that will result for the economy.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael proposed &euro;700 million in savings, which would result in the closure of three hospitals and the loss of 10,000 jobs immediately.  I am glad we are not doing that.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 1% income levy. I have three children employed at the lower end of the salary bracket &mdash; they are all in training.  None of the three have told me that the levy is a bad tax because it is not.  My daughter pointed out that it is &euro;1 in every &euro;100.  As they would not normally pay tax, they do not mind paying the levy.  I imagine that my children are no different than anyone else&rsquo;s and that there are many more young people like them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>To add to Senator Feeney&rsquo;s point, someone earning &euro;98,000 will pay a 1% levy, the same rate as someone on the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>While cautiously welcoming the small increase in social welfare payments, some of the measures to save money, such as the removal of medical cards from the over 70s, the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, the removal of children&rsquo;s allowance for youngsters over 18 years of age and the increase in college fees, will negatively impact on  lower income families.  The increase in the pupil-teacher ratio should have been untouchable by the Minister for Education and Science.  We will now officially move to a ratio of 28:1, the largest primary school pupil-teacher ratio in the EU.  The cruellest part is that it will affect our children&rsquo;s chances of learning and their life chances in an increasingly competitive world.  Consequently, there will be no jobs for 400 new teachers.</P>
        <P>While recognising that we are in difficult times and a recession, it is regrettable that the Minister has chosen to step back from a progressive policy towards young people aged 18 years and over in full-time education by withdrawing the child benefit for this age group.  It will lead <Col N="545" />to earlier school leaving because parents will find it more difficult to fund their children&rsquo;s education.  The increase of &euro;600 in registration fees for third level students is, as Senator McCarthy stated, essentially re-introducing fees, making it impossible for people from lower socio-economic groups to obtain third level qualifications.</P>
        <P>While there was a basic increase in social welfare payments, what is &euro;6.50?  It would buy one pound of mince and half a dozen eggs.  Given inflation, it does not add up to much.  Likewise, the meagre increase of &euro;2 in the qualified child allowance is not sufficient to help parents meet their children&rsquo;s needs.  It beggars belief that our &euro;6 billion surplus of last year was turned into a &euro;15 billion deficit.</P>
        <P>The 1% levy on incomes under &euro;100,000, including those on the minimum wage, is a scandal and is the harshest aspect of this budget along with the abolition of the universal medical card for those over 70 years of age.  On average, families will lose out to the value of &euro;2,500 per annum, which will have a knock-on effect for small businesses.  People will not have that &euro;2,500 in their pockets to spend, thereby putting small businesses at risk.  It was stated in the House how important small business and employing people in them are for the economy.</P>
        <P>The spatial strategy was also given the kick.  The gateway towns and innovation fund were scrapped.  In Athlone, we were awaiting significant money for infrastructure projects, but it is gone.  The reduction of 5% in the local government fund is another slight on communities and small businesses.  There will need to be rates and increases in refuse and recycling charges.  Small businesses must already endure the increase in energy costs.  It is almost impossible to survive in small business in this downturn, but it will be impossible with the extra cuts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This morning, Age Action Ireland made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  The group spoke about fuel poverty, a matter that we have debated, and its effects on older people.  The delegates expressed considerable disappointment with the removal of the medical card for those over 70 years of age and the 1% income levy.  The &euro;2 increase in the fuel allowance and its extension by two weeks is a pittance because &euro;2 would not even buy half a bale of briquettes.  Elderly people go to bed early to keep warm and to cut their energy bills or stay out with their friends in warm shopping centres.  It is no way to treat people who have contributed to the economy by paying taxes all of their working lives.  It is cruel and harsh.  Every year, an extra 1,500 to 2,000 people die during the winter in comparison to the summer months.  The stark reality is that we have the highest percentage increase in winter deaths in Europe.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of housing aid for the elderly, now administered by local authorities, the scheme having being transferred from the HSE.  Given the 5% cut in local government funding, I question how local authorities will be able to implement the scheme.  In County Westmeath, there is a &euro;600,000 shortfall in the housing budget for essential repairs and DPGs.  I have serious doubts concerning how we will look after the elderly.  People are in acute hospital beds waiting to go home.  Age Action Ireland highlighted the need for a fuel poverty strategy, which we do not currently have.  There must be joined-up action by all Departments to ensure that fewer elderly people die from fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>The budget will make the country worse and lead us into a depression.  We are going to borrow more this year, doubling our national debt.  While everyone accepts that there is a downturn, other countries are not as badly off as we are.  The Government has failed in the budget.  Why were there no wage freezes, redundancy packages or serious levies placed on bank CEOs as promised?</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the disgraceful closure of Connolly Barracks in Longford at a time when the town needs to be supported by those working in the barracks and when real estate has devalued.  It is a foolhardy fire brigade action.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="546" />
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In framing the budget, the Minister sought balance, equity and fairness.  At an unprecedented time in financial markets, the Minister gave a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a balanced budget in terms of tax, borrowing and savings.  The 1% levy is necessary given the reality of our taxation code, which meant that those on the lowest incomes were not in a position to offset any tax increases at the lower band.  However, there were people who, through exemptions, pension rights, section 48 and section 23 provisions, film rights and other positive measures, paid nothing.  This was unjust.  The 1% levy means that the very wealthy will pay, an example set by Ministers when they took 10% pay cuts.  They should be commended on doing so on top of the other taxation that everyone must bear.</P>
        <P>The strategy to reduce spending was important in the context of a different financial situation, a matter that relates to borrowing.  Our borrowing is nothing more than a modulation of the past 11 years.  It is sound business practice that in the good years one puts away money and in the bad years, rather than causing deflation, one does not take too much money from the economy.  This is what the Minister has done.  He was prudent in managing the funds available.</P>
        <P>We have promoted industry in this budget by way of increased exemptions for research and development investment, new start-up businesses and no capital gains tax or corporation tax below a certain income level.  We have also ensured the income of enterprise boards has increased, meaning that small business will again benefit.  In the most difficult times, the Minister has managed to promote industry and balance taxation.  In doing so he increased the litre of petrol by 8 cent but that will hardly be noticed at the pumps because the increase will equal the decrease in the price of oil in the past few weeks, which is down to $72 a barrel today.  The Arabs tell us that the real price of oil is $60 to $70 a barrel.  Other positive developments in the past few weeks include the reduction in interest rates, so repayments on our national debt will be lower.  Markets appear to have stabilised and we should take credit in this country because the first in Europe to underpin its banks was Ireland, followed by Greece, Portugal, Denmark and Austria until every country made sure the banks were underpinned or nationalised, as in the UK.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a balanced budget in terms of looking after people.  Of the &euro;55.8 billion of budget moneys, 78% will be spent on social welfare, education and health.  The increases in social welfare, at 3% and 3.1%, are over what is expected to be the inflation rate.  Inflation may be lower because commodity prices fall in recessionary times.  It is a balanced budget in terms of taxation, borrowing, savings, looking to the future and ensuring the less well-off are looked after.  It was with particular pride that I heard of the &euro;2.6 billion increase to &euro;19.6 billion allocation to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is &euro;7 extra per week for old people, an extra &euro;2 in the fuel allowance and an extension in the number of weeks.  People of working age get an extra &euro;6.50 in all working age payments, which includes jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, disability allowance and one parent family payments.  Families with children have seen an increase, with &euro;56 million of improvements in support of families and children.  The qualified children&rsquo;s increase goes from &euro;2 to &euro;26 per week.  All family income supplement thresholds are increased by &euro;10 per week per child.</P>
        <P>This is a budget geared to the times.  It looks to the future, will not be deflationary and is committed to ensuring a viable building sector, which has had a battering in the past few weeks.  The Government is committed to ensuring the national development programme continues to proceed, with all major cities linked to the capital by motorways, the upgraded M50 and the Atlantic corridor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tax relief was provided to first-time buyers of new properties.  The budget suited the times that were in it and will lead us out of the perfect storm in the financial markets and will see <Col N="547" />Ireland as a safe and good place to invest.  People will say that sound management was balanced with the needs of the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Senator Regan.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It goes to show how Government spin and bluster changes over the years.  Any of us here long enough to remember famous speeches by various Ministers for Finance know that they always went back to 1997 and compared what the Government led by Fine Gael and Labour gave and what the Government was then giving in respect of increases.  The Minister of State did not go back to 1997 but to 1995.  In an outrageous speech, Senator Leyden went back to 1983.  It is amazing that he voted against the 1% levy at that time but it would not be the first time Fianna F&aacute;il Members, while in opposition, voted against good proposals by Fine Gael and Labour.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement and the 1% levy, which was needed at the time, are examples.</P>
        <P>This budget is an attack on the poor, the low paid and the farmers.  I have not heard much about the farmers this evening but this is a major attack on them, as it is on those who have to go to accident and emergency units, medical card holders and rural people who need a car.  Despite the comments of Senator Hanafin on the 8 cent per litre increase, this amounts to nearly 40 cent per gallon, an outrageous increase.  Those who must pay this are people who need cars, people in rural areas with no public transport or no prospect of it being introduced.</P>
        <P>Where has it all gone wrong?  A few years ago, we had a massive surplus of &euro;3 to &euro;4 billion per year and there is now a deficit of &euro;15 billion.  Where has the money gone and how could it happen so quickly?  There is no explanation from the Government but it is clear that the signs were there before the last general election, and for the past number of years, but the Government did nothing about it.  If it had done something we would not be in the mess we are in today.</P>
        <P>We sold Eircom for a massive amount of money, along with the TSB and Aer Lingus.  The OPW, for which the Minster of State is responsible, sold various pieces of property over the past year and a half.  We sold the jewels in the crown, semi-State bodies built up by hard-pressed taxpayers over the years.  That money has been squandered over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>Fixed contracts were introduced in the past two years.  This has been removed, according to the speech of the Minister of State.  Does it apply to the projects outlined in the decentralisation project?  Some are going ahead and some are PPPs.  Are these still on fixed contracts, is this clause removed and will they have to reach another arrangement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State claims that the budget is designed to stabilise public finances.  It may be designed to do that but it does not do so.  We will borrow an extra &euro;2 billion next year in order to subsidise current spending.  Looking back, that is the situation we were in when the man with whom the Minister of State worked, Charlie Haughey, brought the country to near penury in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I find some elements of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to be quite cynical.  We talk about &ldquo;automatic stabilisers&rdquo;, a phrase that has a meaning in economic terms.  It was suggested that social welfare increases act as automatic stabilisers.  However, due to the spending spree over the past eleven years there is no facility for automatic stabilisers and counter cyclical measures because the money has been spent.  We have now borrowed so much that we will double the national debt in a very short time and will return to the types of figures we saw in the 1980s.</P>
        <P>We are being very self-congratulatory now as we were earlier today.  The fact is that the Government gave free medical cards to those aged over 70 and then expects a clap on the back when these are taken away.  It created quangos and when some of them are amalgamated <Col N="548" />members of Government congratulate one another.  The Government gave tax reductions and then imposes on gross income across the board an income levy and income taxes.  It takes a brass neck to have made some of the speeches today congratulating the Government and claiming credit for correcting the problems that it created over the past 11 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State for dealing with a very tough budget.  We all knew this one would be difficult because we were facing a huge hole in our finances.  It was necessary to take hard decisions, to be decisive and to show leadership and I believe we have done that.  It was important that we made a major decision in July that gave savings of up to &euro;400 million.  That was far seeing and corrective at a time when we did not realise our finances were going to be in poor shape.  We did it, however, and it was very important.</P>
        <P>That concerned 2008 and we now look forward to balancing the books in 2009.  There is &euro;1 billion in 2009.  The rationalisation of State agencies was long overdue.  In this budget 41 agencies were dealt with, which will save substantial amounts of money. We must look at some others.</P>
        <P>The bank guarantee and support for the financial institutions was another issue that we dealt with very swiftly and we now have a banking system that is credible.  The new legislation to come before the House tomorrow will give the banks important credibility in the European and world context.  It means that we are now open for business in this country and the Government is behind the institutions of our banking system and is committed to them.  We cannot run a country without a good and reliable banking system.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that we put strong investment into education for the future, as this budget does.  There is also a substantial amount in the budget for social and affordable housing which needs support.  We have done that in this budget and have also put aside substantial amounts for research and development.  That will be important for ensuring new job creation projects for small firms.</P>
        <P>When the proposals on banking come before the House tomorrow it is important that we have a package&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This budget is a corrective measure and is part of the solution.  We must see it in the European context.  Our bubble has burst in terms of the construction industry but when we look at countries such as Germany whose bubble was not in that industry we see that it must now examine the bubble burst in its economy, namely, the car industry.  Today General Motors looked for a major bail-out from the Government in the United States. <Col N="549" /> Although we are not in great shape on this island, the situation is global and we are dealing with it in our own way.</P>
        <P>The budget has taken corrective measures that have hurt everybody.  Let us be honest about that and admit it has hurt people across the spectrum.  Everybody is playing a part in this.  We spoke about working together and this is an example of how we can do that.  It has cost everybody and those who can afford to pay more are paying more.  That is fair.  I commend the Minister of State for what has been done in this regard and I also thank those Opposition spokespersons who see the necessity for this budget.  We look forward to the new legislation coming before the House and I shall have more to say then about the housing sector, which I consider to be most important.

	<P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate on the budget and I will respond to some points.  First, for the information of the House, while we have been speaking, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has published the scheme which is subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Ross and Quinn raised the issue of capital gains tax and were of the opinion that there would be no such tax worth talking about levied on shares and property next year and so therefore the rise to 22% was academic.  The gain is, of course, computed on the difference between sale proceeds and cost price.  Many assets will have been held for longer periods and the appreciation of those assets will by no means have been cancelled out by recent falls.  It will have been in some cases but not in others.  The capital gains tax increase is directly related to the reduction in stamp duty on commercial property and to the combination of income tax and income levies.</P>
        <P>Senator Alan Kelly did not give adequate account of the tax credit for research and development, which is being raised from 20% to 25% and will be a positive development from the point of view of attracting companies that will engage in research and development.  The measure will also reduce the effective rate of corporation tax, which stands at 12.5%.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross, not for the first time, attacked F&Aacute;S.  Community employment programmes are extremely important around the country and many worthwhile local organisations, sports clubs and cultural organisations would find it difficult to continue without them.  They also provide valuable employment for older people who might find it difficult to secure alternative useful employment.</P>
        <P>I will now dwell a little on history.  An income levy was first introduced by Alan Dukes in 1983 and cancelled in 1986.  The second time an income levy was introduced was at the beginning of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party coalition when Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister for Finance.  The levy was the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance </i>of the Labour Party&rsquo;s contribution to the budget.  One must take this into account when considering comments from the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>In the case of a person on a low income earning &euro;60 per week in part-time employment, the levy will be only 60 cent per week.  If a person is earning &euro;98,000, the example cited by Senator O&rsquo;Malley, the levy will amount to &euro;980 per annum.  The criticism of the levy is, therefore, over the top.</P><Col N="550" />
        <P>Senator McFadden raised the issue of rural dwellers and cars.  If people were to switch to vehicles with diesel engines, they would not pay extra.  On the assets sold or privatised under various Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations, which was also raised, the rainbow coalition sold very cheaply the second mobile telephone licence and even more cheaply the Irish Steel company, the closure of which caused such environmental problems.</P>
        <P>I was amazed that Senator Kelly, in his supplied script, referred to PRSI.  Given that the PRSI ceiling was only index linked for 2.5%, as has happened in practically every budget under every Government over the past 20 years, I do not understand to what it is he takes exception in the measure.  The changes in child care payments must be taken in the context of the substantial improvements there have been in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>On another point of history raised by Senator Quinn, Mr. Haughey, as Minister for Health, had substantial increases in budgets in 1978 and 1979.  It was not the case that he could only produce a toothbrush.</P>
        <P>I was amused when Senator Leyden effectively proposed an absentee tax, which used to be proposed every year in the old Irish Parliament.  He also wanted to introduce a star chamber or what the French would call a <i>chambre de justice</i> for tribunal lawyers.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, the demand for third level fees is coming from the university heads.  The question of whether third level education should be free, particularly at higher income levels, is a matter for debate.</P>
        <P>Approximately 2,000 teachers have been recruited since July 2007.  When considering the pupil-teacher ratio one also needs to take into account the many additional special needs assistants and resource teachers who have removed some of the burden on teachers.</P>
        <P>A question was raised about assumptions on growth.  By 2010 it is calculated that the housing contraction will have worked its way out of the system.  This has had an effect of reducing expected growth by 4% of GDP.</P>
        <P>Decentralisation was cancelled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 1981 and 1983.  Since this was a matter of dispute, I want to give the facts.  The construction contracts &mdash; public-private partnerships &mdash; for decentralisation will be carried out on a fixed term basis.</P>

	<P>I am responding to the Senator rather than attacking him.</P>
        <P>One thing I missed in the debate, except through hints, was an absence of a constructive alternative.  Points were made about the different measures, including for example, that taxation and expenditure will cause pain.  As Senator Butler said, that is true.  The only alternative I heard was explicitly stated by Senator Harris and was implicit in one or two other contributions, particularly from Fine Gael Senators.  The proposed alternative is to slash public service numbers and repudiate social partnership.  This is what Deputy Varadkar argued with me in the late night debate yesterday.  The Government is not taking that route because we value the contribution social partnership has made to the economy.</P>
        <P>The public service accounts for only 10.5% of the workforce, a low figure by international standards.  Even if one includes school and hospital employees, the figure increases to only 14.5%.  While I welcome Senator Harris back in the House, I do not agree with his attack on what he described as the &ldquo;dead hand&rdquo; of the Civil Service.</P>
        <P>I spent four days, from Friday until Monday when the Minister was formulating his budget, at the IMF-World Bank meeting in Washington.  The world is facing a financial crisis, with only a few countries being relatively spared, while others have been extremely hard hit.  As Senators will be aware, Ireland faced a critical situation a couple of weeks ago.  In addition to the leadership given by the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, the public servants concerned in the Central Bank and Department of Finance gave magnificent service to this country.  Some people who speak in this House and some who write newspaper articles have no understanding of the quality and input of some of our senior public servants without whom this country would be a very different place.  I sometimes think there is an ideological element involved.</P>
        <P>Prior to being appointed a Minister of State, I had a debate with Senator Regan in a different context when the situation was more favourable about whether the Taosieach and Ministers deserved their salaries.  We all have taken a 10% cut in our salaries.  One of the questions I asked the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was effectively how many people were better paid than the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  It was about 13,000 and if there were half a dozen who came from the public sector, I would be surprised.  This debate is sometimes put in the context that the public sector is on the pig&rsquo;s back and the private sector is hard-pressed.</P>
        <P>Some of the financial problems in the world have come, as we all know, from overpaid executives in certain financial institutions in certain countries.  We ought to have balance in this debate.  Is it the case that a teacher who helps to produce a well rounded student is less valuable than a farmer who rears a bullock or a baker who produces a loaf of bread or a cake?  Is it the case that somebody who drives a public service bus is less valuable than somebody who works for a private bus owner?  Many generalisations are paid that are not particularly valid.</P>
        <P>Public service reform is needed.  It is promised.  I do not dispute that.</P>

    <Title>State Airports. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware that Cork Airport Authority has a vacancy for the position of the cathaoirleach or chairperson of that authority.  This vacancy arises from the resignation of Mr. Joe Gantly.  Associated with it is a milieu of issues surrounding Cork Airport, namely, its debt, the fact that it has not had a chairperson since the middle of the summer, that a business plan for it has not been published and that the separation of the three State airports, Dublin, Shannon and Cork, has not taken place.</P>
        <P>Cork Airport is central to the growth of not only of Cork but the Munster region.  The economic vibrancy and vitality of the region is very much dependent on it.  Tourism in Cork needs not only a strong airport but one that is marketed well, driven by its board and that has leadership.  The attraction of business to the region requires that Cork Airport is sustainable into the future and that it has a competitive executive that manages it.  However, what have we got?  The airport has no chairperson, no business plan has been published, there has not been a separation of Cork Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and Cork Airport has been laden with a debt.</P>
        <P>When the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was in Cork in September he said he could not appoint a new chairperson to the authority because he had not received the business plan for it from Dublin Airport Authority.  Surely the Minister who presides over aviation policy for the country can demand or request from Dublin Airport Authority a business plan for Cork Airport.  A number of questions arise.  Are we serious about securing the future of Cork Airport, protecting the jobs of the staff there, attracting the opening up of new routes out of it, making it viable <Col N="553" />and sustaining the growth of the passenger numbers about which we hear so much?  Is there anybody in government prepared to show leadership on this matter?</P>
        <P>I contend the Government has neglected the board of Cork Airport Authority.  It has refused to appoint a chairperson to the authority.  It has forced the board to accept a debt that it did not want to accept.  Dublin Airport Authority is setting out the plans for the aviation sector, with a business plan for Cork Airport, and it is setting the tone of what happens with the result that Cork and Shannon airports are suffering.</P>
        <P>A proactive approach by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is needed, not excuses.  The Dublin Airport Authority comes under his remit.  I hope I am not pre-empting the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply but it is important that the business plan for Cork Airport is released.  The Minister said that a chairperson for the airport cannot be appointed until he has sight of the business plan for it.  How long must we wait for a chairperson to be appointed?  It is ridiculous that no chairperson of Cork Airport Authority has been appointed at a time of economic crisis and recession in this country when the board needs a leader to bring it forward and give it direction and impetus.</P>
        <P>This is not a time for inaction but for being proactive.  It is time to show support and solidarity with the people of Cork, the board of Cork Airport and the workers who have made a major contribution to the development of that airport.  I was in Cork Airport last Sunday and one could drive a bus through the terminal it was so quiet.  Is that what we want?</P>

        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s Government has already told us that Cork Airport will have no debt, but it has been laden with a debt.  We need action and answers from the Minister of State tonight.  It may not come under his direct area of responsibility, but I hope he will have positive news for the workers of Cork Airport and the people of Cork tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Buttimer will be aware, Joe Gantly recently stepped down from his position as the chairman of Cork Airport.  He held the position since 2004 and I would like to record in this House my appreciation for the work he did in that post and to wish him well in the future.</P>
        <P>Under the stewardship of Joe Gantly, Cork Airport greatly expanded its passenger base.  Last year was the 15th consecutive year for aviation growth at Cork Airport and between 2003 and 2007 passenger numbers increased from 2.2 million to 3.2 million.  That makes a lie of some of the accusations the Senator made.  It is obvious that Cork Airport has been a vibrant airport and has done great work to boost tourism in the area.</P>
        <P>Such growth and expansion requires a dynamic and experienced chairman.  I can assure the House that the person to be appointed will bring these qualities to the job, and the position is to be filled very shortly.  Under the State Airports Act 2004 the boards of Cork and Shannon airports are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.</P>
        <P>All three airport business plans have to be co-ordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance.  Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of the three State airports.  It has always been the Government&rsquo;s position that the resolution of the debt issue at Cork Airport would have to ensure that the debt burden to be undertaken by Cork would be manageable and that it would form a reasonable basis for Cork Airport&rsquo;s autonomy, without in any way putting at risk its commercial future.</P><Col N="554" />
        <P>However, it is also the Government&rsquo;s position that the sharing of the Cork debt &mdash; much of which was incurred in financing the new terminal and other infrastructural works at Cork Airport &mdash; between the Cork and Dublin airport authorities will have to take account not only of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport, but also what is commercially and financially feasible for the Dublin Airport Authority.  Most of that debt was spent in putting the infrastructure into Cork.</P>
        <P>In order to break the logjam between the DAA and the Cork Airport Authority on the equity of the debt, Mr Peter Cassells was appointed earlier this year to mediate between the two parties with a view to reaching agreement on a level of debt that was acceptable to both sides.  Mr. Cassells&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations were the outcome of that dialogue with both parties.  The recommendation is that the CAA takes responsibility for debt of &euro;113 million in return for the transfer of net assets of &euro;220 million on separation.  The board of the CAA has accepted this recommendation.</P>
        <P>I have already received the Cork and Shannon business plans and I expect shortly to receive a finalised commentary on those plans by the DAA when it submits its business plan.  I would expect the DAA&rsquo;s commentary to address recent trends in the aviation market, the challenges facing the State airports and the financial and operational aspects of restructuring.</P>
        <P>As to the question of publication of business plans, I do not foresee publication because the content is commercially sensitive.  In any case, I will need to consider the DAA&rsquo;s commentary and the implications of the individual business plans for the future operation of our State airports before deciding on the best way forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is disappointing.  In saying that it is hoped a person will be appointed shortly, is he talking of weeks or months?  In his reply, he is factually incorrect.  A clear commitment was given by his predecessors to the effect that there would be no debt on Cork Airport, and that the Government would honour that, yet it has not. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know, but I believe &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; means weeks rather than months.  However, the key point, regardless of what was said a couple of years ago, is that the board of Cork Airport is taking on a debt of &euro;113 million and getting assets of &euro;220 million.  Most of the debt was accrued or built up from building infrastructure at Cork.</P>

      <sTitle>Cycling Facilities.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This Adjournment motion is about the need for the Government to improve facilities for cyclists in Dublin city.  I am aware that the Minister is issuing what he <Col N="555" />calls a sustainable travel and transport plan and will be bringing it to Cabinet in the coming weeks.  It is a very ambitious plan to put 150,000 commuters on the roads, and substitute them for cars by 2020.  However, it is a plan that will be very difficult to implement, particularly if the past record of care for cyclists by successive Governments and Dublin City Council is maintained.  I will quote David Maher of the Dublin Cycling Campaign, which welcomed the initiative, from an article in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, of last Sunday, 12 October, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I would say that 10% of all trips by 2020 is completely achievable, but we have found in the past that there is no follow through from policy to reality on the ground.  You can make all the cycle tracks you want, but if the garda&iacute; are going to allow people to park all over them, they are more of a hazard than a help.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The promotion of cycling has been more aspirational than a matter of delivering factual and concrete facilities for cyclists, and I shall give the Minister of State a few examples.  I believe there are only 200 km of cycle lanes in Dublin city, which is grossly inadequate if we are to achieve the type of objectives the Minister has already outlined.  Where they exist, they are dangerous &mdash; because there are potholes which are not looked after and they are cut off in many cases throughout Dublin and lead nowhere.  They are dangerous because cars are left parking on them for hours and cyclists cannot pass them.  They are also dangerous because taxis often use them and because garda&iacute; often do not enforce the law in respect of cycle lanes.  Cyclists believe that whereas the bicycle is everybody&rsquo;s favourite vehicle to champion, it is ignored in reality.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, there are several types of cycle lane.  They carry with them different rights and nobody, beyond cyclists themselves, is aware of those rights, and certainly not the drivers of other vehicles.  The different rights attaching to cycle lanes are not carried in the rules of the road, which need updating so that people become familiar with the rights of cyclists in various lanes.  The data on cyclists and the accidents they have had, as a direct result in some cases I suggest because of neglect of the maintenance of cycling lanes, have not been updated since 2006.  We need new ones, but there are fatalities between cars and bicycles, at the rate of at least three a year.  There were 86 injuries involving bicycles in 2006, an unacceptable number.</P>
        <P>I should like to indicate some examples for the Minister of State of places that badly need cycling lanes and do not have them.  There is a large amount of space around the Guinness hop store, for example, where there is no cycle lane, and which is very dangerous for cyclists.  There are enormous potholes on the Lower Leeson Street cycle lanes and the only alternative is for cyclists to cycle in the bus lanes, with the buses coming in the opposite direction.  This makes life extremely hazardous for cyclists as well.  There is a great deal of room along Parliament Street on the approach to the City Offices, yet there are no, or very few, cycle lanes on offer.</P>
        <P>It would be appropriate if the Minister of State could give me some assurances that this matter is now a priority, not just for the safety of cyclists, but for the environment.  I know he will probably say there was a grant in the budget yesterday, which gave &euro;1,000 under a new cycling to work scheme.  That is an encouragement to people to cycle but they are not going to do so if the lanes are dangerous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter for the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and will set out his ambition for cycling as a sustainable travel mode throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As Senator Ross knows, it is regrettable that reliance on cycling has diminished considerably over a number of years.  He mentioned that a unit in the Department is working on a sustainable transport and travel action plan which is due to be published before the end of the year.  Census returns demonstrate a significant decline in cycling.  On a national basis, in 1986 more than 7% <Col N="556" />of commuting trips were made by bicycle.  This figure declined to 5.7% in the early 1990s, to 4.2% in 1996, to 2.3% in 2001 and to 2% in 2006.  The reasons for this decline in commuter trips by bicycle are manifold.  Perhaps it is partly due to the fact people live further from their places of work.</P>
        <P>Reliance on the bicycle in Dublin has also declined but perhaps not to the same degree as nationally.  There is some evidence of a resurgence in cycling in the capital but its modal share remains very low despite the fact there are 300 km of cycle facilities in the greater Dublin area.  I believe Senator Ross said 200 km.  In recent years, even with the additional cycle facilities, the share of commuter trips has gone down.  Obviously, more than cycle facilities are needed.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has been beavering away and it spent more than &euro;300,000 on the provision of public cycle parking stands.  It also approved further projects in Dublin city in late 2007, including cycle parking in more than 21 schools, a further 150 cycle parking stands in key city centre locations and cycle lanes in Gardiner Street and Parnell Street.</P>
        <P>The Department commissioned research into a potential national cycling policy.  The outputs of this research hold out the prospect of a culture of cycling in Ireland by 2020, with 10% of all trips by bicycle.  It is one thing to have that as a policy but it is another to make it happen.  Increasing the modal share enjoyed by the bicycle to 10% would be a huge shift and would move as many people on to bikes as the public transport element of Transport 21 could accommodate.  To do that, we plan to spend at least &euro;16 billion.  The potential of success with the bicycle is enormous if it can be achieved.</P>
        <P>Much action is required, including training school children in safe cycling.  A start has been made in that through widening our support for the green schools travel module which, next year, will reach more than 100,000 children; providing safe cycle routes to schools, colleges and workplaces; re-prioritising existing roadspace in favour of cyclists and walkers and designing new roadspace with cyclists&rsquo; needs in mind; and ensuring that those involved in traffic planning and management are supported in becoming fully skilled in prioritising both cyclist and pedestrians as the preferred modes of travel in Dublin.</P>
        <P>As I said, it is the intention to publish the Department&rsquo;s action plan, which is its vision for cycling, by the end of the year.  As Senator Ross said, it is significant that support, through the taxation system, for the provision of bicycles and safety equipment for employees was mentioned in yesterday&rsquo;s budget as well as a charge for carpark places.  It was good to hear Senator Ross raise the matter.  Yesterday when those items were mentioned in the D&aacute;il, there was general laughter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise that.  It was good to hear Senator Ross&rsquo;s support for the measures.  While many people talk about the need for cycling, when something was done yesterday, it was the cause of a bit of merriment.  It was good to lighten the mood and to hear a few giggles because much of the Minister&rsquo;s speech was probably not very interesting news.  While we all say nice things about cycling, it is unfortunate that when something is being done, it is regarded as a bit of a joke.  That was the general response yesterday.</P>
        <P>Facilities, money, ideas and vision are needed as well as a change in the culture.  I hope many of those measures will be set in train when the plan is published.  There was a time when cycling was a widely used mode of transport.  Perhaps I am showing my age but 40 or 50 years ago, there would be five or six lanes of bicycles.  We will not return to those days but we need to get back to greater use of bicycles because we cannot cater for all the cars.  From the point of <Col N="557" />view of vehicle emissions and what was done yesterday, the new plan has the potential to change the culture in a significant way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I believe his heart is in the right place.  He said that achieving a shift to the bicycle of this magnitude will require actions.  That is pretty flabby.  Are there commitments to carry out these actions or are they aspirations?  Will they be carried out?  Is the money there for them or are they simply what the Department of Transport has listed as requirements if it is to get from here to where we want to get to by 2020?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of them are already happening such as the green schools travel module.  It is reaching many school children and is one way to change the culture and to get young people to use bicycles.  That has been hugely successful.  I hope the plan will go to Cabinet and will be more than a list of aspirations.  I cannot speak too authoritatively about that at this stage.  It is visionary in many ways but I hope it will indicate how things are to happen rather than a wish list of what we would like to happen.</P>

I welcome the fact the programme has been up and running since 1 September but there was an announcement that Letterkenny General Hospital would not accept any new referrals for the cervical screening programme from 5 September onwards.  The hospital continues to treat patients within the hospital.</P>
        <P>The people of Donegal, elected representatives from all sides, patients and people who have been through the system demand that Letterkenny General Hospital be designated as one of the hospitals that will receive referrals from CervicalCheck and that the hospital be recognised as one of the hospitals that will be given priority.  While I understand there are difficulties with regard to bringing the hospital up to the required standards, no Minister has given the reassurance required that Letterkenny General Hospital will be one of the centres to which patients can be referred.  When the announcement was made and the Health Service Executive was asked why the hospital was not among the 11 centres, mention was made of international best practice, a phrase that is beginning to be hated in Donegal because we hear it in terms of cancer services and all the rest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no excuse for not having a service in Donegal.  What is being suggested is that patients transfer to Sligo General Hospital.  If patients live in my area, that will require a four-hour round trip.  If they live where Senator Cecelia Keaveney lives, the journey will be 240 km.  If we are to have a screening programme, we must ensure people avail of it and we must make it simple and easy to use.  That is the reason the service is retained and that a statement needs to be made on the issue in the House tonight.</P>
        <P>A campaign is being led in Donegal, not by politicians but by an action group called Donegal Action for Cancer Care.  I commend that group for the effort it has made, in co-operation with Cancer Care Northwest, to ensure the issue is dealt with effectively.  The postcards the group has sent to all of us say it all: &ldquo;Will I die because of you?  We the people of Donegal demand <Col N="558" />a public colposcopy clinic be retained in Letterkenny General Hospital.&rdquo;  That is our demand tonight.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Doherty for sharing his time with me.  I had put forward a motion that the Minister for Health and Children should outline the outstanding issues that remain for the colposcopy service at Letterkenny to attain national cancer screening service, NCSS, recognition and how these issues can be overcome.  I must begin by declaring my interest because I could well be the woman, never mind the politician, who might need these services in the near future.  However, this is not a female issue as such because most households comprise both males and females and, therefore, the issue cuts across the board.</P>
        <P>The problem is the uncertainty with regard to the withdrawal of a health facility.  I have made various representations on the issue, but I get the same type of response all the time.  I am told that Letterkenny was not one of the initial 11 centres, but that the door is not closed to having other situations recognised.  I am told too that the NCSS is looking to recognise other facilities, including in the north west, and will be in the north west to look at Letterkenny General Hospital and that discussions are ongoing in that regard.</P>
        <P>The reasons for our concern are clear.  The current uncertainty has frightened people and has led to them resorting to contacting us via postcards.  I welcome the number of people who have contacted me but I wish they put their address on the postcards so I could respond to them individually.  As matters stand, I am trying to get my message out and I rely on the media and press releases to carry that message.</P>
        <P>The NCSS has identified 11 colposcopy services to support cervical check initially.  The colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital has not been identified for referrals.  However, in the interim, Letterkenny General Hospital will continue to provide colposcopy services to women already attending or awaiting colposcopy.  The hospital requires a number of enhancements to meet the quality assurance standards defined by the NCSS, but no matter how often I ask the questions or to whom I address them, I cannot get the answer on the specifics.  What are the problems?  Are they medical, clinical or is it a matter of support staff.  Is it a staffing or competence issue?</P>
        <P>Ultimately, I want the best service for the area and believe Letterkenny General Hospital can deliver that service.  I hope the meaningful negotiations I am told are ongoing between the hospital and the NCSS clearly define the issues.  Whatever the issues, we as constituents and representatives of the area want to see the problems overcome and the hospital designated as a centre.  When the representatives of the NCSS visit Letterkenny General Hospital in the coming days, we want the good work being carried out there and the increasing work of the north-west centre of excellence for cancer to be recognised and we want to ensure the uncertainty and fear in the area are overcome.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State has the answer to some of my questions tonight.  I commend those who have championed this issue, but Senator Doherty and I have also championed the cause.  It is just as possible that we may be the patients in question in the future.  There but for the grace of God go any of us.</P>

	<P>I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  Senators Doherty and Keaveney seem to be up to speed on what is happening, so I am not sure this reply will provide them with any additional information.  I understand the ongoing discussions are about quality assurance standards and as Senator Keaveney said, further discussions are to take place this week.</P><Col N="559" />
        <P>The national cancer screening service, NCSS, is responsible for the implementation of CervicalCheck, the national cervical screening programme.  Colposcopy services are an integral part of a population-based cervical screening programme, but a colposcopy service is not a cancer service.  Colposcopy services are provided as a dedicated number of hours or sessions within the wider gynaecology clinic.  Women who have pre-cancerous cell changes detected by their smear test are referred for colposcopy.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons for establishing a national, population-based, cervical screening programme is to end the need for opportunistic screening and ensure women are screened at the appropriate intervals.  To date, much screening has been carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and women have been offered varying structures and processes of care in addition to sometimes lengthy waiting times.  The NCSS is responsible for the monitoring and audit of colposcopy services provided under the programme to ensure the quality assured standards, based on those defined by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, are adhered to.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of CervicalCheck has provided an opportunity to focus on the development and organisation of colposcopy services in Ireland.  The NCSS is making a significant investment to enhance colposcopy services and this will ensure timely access to a quality assured colposcopy service for women who require further investigation.  In preparation for the launch of the national cervical screening programme, the NCSS, in co-operation with the National Hospitals Office of the HSE, completed a baseline analysis of existing colposcopy services in Ireland.  This service-by-service analysis examined facilities, staffing, systems management, information management, information technology and governance.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that as part of CervicalCheck, women can access colposcopy services within international best practice timeframes based on adherence to quality assured clinical practice and the achievement of best clinical outcomes for women.  The purpose of identifying and investing in these colposcopy services is to ensure this is the case for all women, regardless of which location they are referred to.</P>
        <P>Existing services are at different stages of operational development.  Using the baseline analysis, the NCSS has identified 11 colposcopy services to support CervicalCheck initially.  The colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital has not been identified for initial referrals of women.  However, in the interim, Letterkenny will continue to provide colposcopy services to women already attending or awaiting colposcopy.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional colposcopy services to women in the north west is being examined.  The colposcopy service at Letterkenny General Hospital requires a number of enhancements to meet the quality assurance standards defined by the NCSS.  The National Cancer Screening Service is working with the hospital on this issue.  The question of the hospital&rsquo;s future participation in the colposcopy service for CervicalCheck will be considered in this context.  Discussions between the hospital and the NCSS are due to take place this week.</P>
        <P>This is an answer to the question of what the discussions are about.  I hope the discussions taking place this week will move matters on and that the service will be organised in a way that offers the best outcomes for all women, including those in the north west.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am not happy with it and I do not believe the people of Donegal will be happy with it either.  What we should have got from the Minister was not just a statement that colposcopy at Letterkenny General Hospital was being examined but a commitment that Letterkenny General Hospital would be included in the list of recognised colposcopy services subject to the enhancements being made.  There is nothing concrete here.</P><Col N="560" />
        <P>The Minister of State stated in his reply that Letterkenny General Hospital &ldquo;will continue to provide colposcopy services to women already attending or awaiting colposcopy&rdquo;.  Can he clarify whether new referrals of patients for colposcopy as a result of a smear test will be to Sligo or to Letterkenny?  Are those on the waiting list and those already attending at Letterkenny the only ones who will be accommodated there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Although 11 colposcopy services have been recognised, I am still asking the same question with which I started.  Perhaps the Minister of State could obtain for me an explanation of the outstanding issues that are preventing the colposcopy service at Letterkenny from attaining recognition and how these can be overcome.  One of the statements made again and again over the last number of weeks is that there has been a significant investment to enhance colposcopy services.  If it is an investment issue, we need an assurance that we are going to invest in Letterkenny, but if it is an issue within the hospital it is important we know that.  All I am asking at the moment is what are the outstanding issues and how they can be addressed.  In addressing them we will gain what we are looking for, which is recognition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only pass on the queries of the Senators to the Minister for Health and Children.  There were one or two paragraphs in my reply that would seem to provide the answers.  I cannot give &mdash; and I do not think the Minister will give &mdash; the outcome of the discussions that are taking place locally.  That is where the issue will be resolved.  If it is a matter of reaching the required standards with regard to the different categories I listed in my reply &mdash; facilities, staffing, systems management, information management, information technology and governance &mdash; there must be some aspects of the service under these headings which have not been clarified to the satisfaction of the NCSS.  Whether the discussions taking place this week resolve the matter or not, I hope the issues will be dealt with satisfactorily and that Letterkenny can be added to the list.  However, I can only pass on to the Minister the issues of concern to the Senators.  I understand their points of view but I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Harney, will have the answers either.  She is probably waiting to hear the results of the discussions taking place locally this week.</P>
