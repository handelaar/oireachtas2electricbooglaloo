	<P>I have notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to indicate his immediate plans to reduce substantially the waiting time for scrutiny of long-term residency applications, currently circa two years from date of application, and if he will consider an amnesty for those who find themselves in this situation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to continue the support services grant provided to Protestant fee-paying schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the campaign of the National Employment Rights Authority to review the pay and conditions records of employees in the restaurant sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage (Resumed) and the House to adjourn no later than 2.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday in the House, a number of speakers said the Opposition was not realistic about the economic situation.  I asked the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, whether the Government was realistic about the economic situation given the discussions and agreement at the social partnership talks some weeks ago.  The Minister responded that she felt the economic situation had deteriorated further in those few weeks.</P>
        <P>As I have said in the House in recent days, it is death by a thousand cutbacks.  Today, the cervical cancer vaccination programme has been cut by the Minister for Health and Children.  The Government is a like a headless chicken.  It is a cutback here and a cutback there and is <Col N="1078"/>all very arbitrary.  Where is the grand plan for economic recovery and to give hope to people in this country?  Where is the plan to give the sense the Government is in charge instead of this constant stream of cutbacks here and there?</P>
        <P>In the case of the withdrawal of the cervical cancer vaccination programme, three months ago the Health Service Executive suggested one approach while the Minister suggested another, and now the Minister has changed her mind again this morning.  We see complete vacillation from one decision to another.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said the economy faces an extremely difficult time.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said the figures that came in earlier this week were more or less on target.  It is very difficult to get any sense of a coherent plan from the Government and if we are finding it difficult here, what is it like for the public, who see decisions that are affecting frontline services but as yet no economic recovery plan?  This morning on RTE we heard the details of this decision, which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.  We heard the HSE saying one thing and the Minister doing something else.</P>
        <P>Yesterday many Senators called for debates on the economy and equality issues.  I hope they will be on the schedule for the Seanad next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should note that we had a good debate here last night on green energy.  I ask the Leader to explain to the House why, having allocated time for such an important issue, the main Government party, Fianna F&aacute;il, only put forward one speaker.  This is embarrassing for the House.  I was left wondering why the full amount of time was not used to discuss such an important issue.  The Leader is wont to make similar comments on other occasions about other groups.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to go firmly on the record on this issue.  Yesterday the Leader raised the issue of energy costs.  He made a fair point and this is an issue that should be considered.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources provided an opportunity to discuss this and what we discovered is that the real issue is with the wholesalers, such as Whitegate oil refinery, which supply the wholesale market in Ireland.  They determine the prices.  Whereas we always consider the price of crude oil when discussing the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps, what we should be looking at is the price of crude oil on the world market in comparison with the wholesale price at which it is being supplied to Irish retailers.  I have checked out this issue since it was raised yesterday and have found that it cuts across two committees &mdash; the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which deals with pricing issues.  There may be a need to investigate this as a special issue under an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.  This is something in which many people are interested and we should move forward on it.</P>
        <P>A number of comments were made yesterday about the banks.  I would like to go back to a comment I made almost three weeks ago in the House.  Whatever AIB said yesterday, it confirmed that its capitalisation was as required.  There was much debate here previously about whether the banks were properly capitalised.  We do not know that and we have not seen the figures.  I pointed out previously that the Financial Regulator said they were capitalised.  AIB is currently capitalised to the required amount and is deciding it needs further capitalisation, as are the European and US banks.  What it got wrong was its forecast three months ago.  It is not the case that the banks are more at risk today than they were yesterday.  They are not.  The first bit of information we have received confirms what the regulator has been saying.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement that the European Central Bank is to reduce the interest rate by 50 basis points.  That will mean an extra &euro;250 million in home-owners&rsquo; pockets.  I am also glad to see that the Bank of England is to reduce its interest rates by 1% later today.  The UK is one of our biggest markets and that will increase consumer confidence there, which should lead to benefits here.  The benefits will only be felt, however, if these cuts are passed on by the lending institutions to homeowners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the rate was cut in October one institution, ICS Building Society, passed on only 60% of the cut, keeping 40% for itself.  This cannot go on.  I urge these institutions to pass on cuts to homeowners.</P>
        <P>President-elect Obama has started to put his team together and already the Russians have confronted him about the possibility that the US will place missile defence shields in Poland and the Czech Republic.  They said that unless the US changes its intentions in this regard Russia will place missiles in Kaliningrad which, as we know, is surrounded by European Union countries.  This is sheer sabre-rattling on the part of President Medvedev.  Kaliningrad is only 300 miles from Copenhagen.  That is how close it is to one of our capital cities.  I ask the Leader to pass on to the Minister a request that we bring in Ambassador Rachmanin as soon as possible and tell him in the strongest terms that this is unacceptable behaviour from a neighbour.</P>
        <P>Like other speakers, I was glad to see the turn-out at this week&rsquo;s presidential elections in the US.  We all saw the lines of people queueing up to cast their votes.  It was more reminiscent of a developing nation than of a mature democracy.  Almost 140 million people voted and the turn-out was the highest in 100 years.  It is a clear example of active citizenship on the part of United States citizens.  Two years ago the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, set up the task force on active citizenship.  Members will remember that at the time much work was done in this area.  Meetings were held around the country and there was lots of enthusiasm from our citizens.  A task force report was published very quickly, in March 2007, but since then very little has happened.  Yesterday the steering group met the Taoiseach, but its budget has been cut from &euro;200 million in 2008 to &euro;56 million in 2009.  How is it to implement any of the recommendations contained in the task force report?  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House to tell us how he expects to implement the findings in view of the fact that the budget has been cut by 72%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision by the Government that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, are to get together to resolve the ongoing problems with the natural gas project at Bellanaboy, County Mayo.  It is vital and in the national interest that this gas is brought ashore and distributed without further undue delay.  It is an important national asset.  We need the energy and all concerned should come together to resolve this issue.  The Government must have this gas distributed without further delay.  It is a good natural asset and it is vital we get it out quickly.</P>
        <P>I also call on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to carry out a survey of unused water mills on fast-flowing rivers throughout the country, which can provide energy with low environmental impact.  For instance, in Athleague in County Roscommon, on the River Suck, unutilised, untapped energy is flowing through every day and no effort has been made to use the river for green energy production.  The Department should be more proactive in this regard.  It should get involved in doing something practical and provide support and assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity Senator Leyden was not here last night when this was being discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>People have other roles in this House too, by the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions should be directed to the Leader through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should let people sort out their own agendas.</P>
        <P>This is something the Department should examine.  It should carry out a survey to see what support can be given to the owners of these mills to provide the necessary turbines to produce energy for the locality.  That would be a positive step forward in a difficult time in which we need to maximise energy production.  Millions of gallons of water flow through fast-flowing rivers, including the River Suck, and not one electricity unit is generated from it.  The Minister should be more proactive and, where necessary, he should use the power of the State by compulsorily purchasing mills if the owners are not prepared to utilise this wasted energy when we need it so badly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the issue of the manufacturing industry in Ireland.  I emphasise again the unemployment figures, which are rising steadily by the day, the week and the month.  Since last month an extra 15,800 people have joined the live register.  That is not just a statistic.  Behind every one of these numbers there are families, adults and children, who are very concerned about their future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Parliament, we cannot ignore or neglect reality.  Christmas is coming and there are mortgages to be paid, children to be sent to school and health to be looked after.  In Waterford alone over recent years, Waterford Crystal has lost 3,000 jobs.  It has been a flagship company for Waterford and Ireland &mdash; I raised this matter on a number of occasions here.  Honeywell, a well established manufacturing industry in Waterford, will lose more than 200 jobs.  These are good jobs that have gone down the drain.  The Government has no strategy or plan to address the rapidly accelerating problem of unemployment.  We have not heard any plans for upskilling, reskilling or alternative employment.  If we do not wake up, address this quickly and look for plans and solutions, we will be in serious trouble.</P>
        <P>The indigenous industry of agriculture, something this country prided itself on, is being ignored.  Young farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a viable, sustainable living from the land.  I ask for a debate on the Government&rsquo;s plans to support agriculture and farming.  The recent budget will adversely affect farming.  It will drive people off the land because farming is not viable and if there is no viability there is no future.  That is message I hear from Government and I would like to hear otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to come to House to debate, before Christmas, the promotion of a Buy Irish campaign within the confines of EU rules.  There are many positive things we can do.  I am encouraged that the price of oil is falling, interest rates are falling &mdash; there is a cut of 0.5% due by the ECB this week, to be followed by another 0.5% &mdash; and the significant amount of money given in the budget to county enterprise boards and Leader schemes to promote indigenous industry.  </P>
        <P>It is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  Even if things begin to look better, it is still important that we continue to support Irish jobs in any way we can and perhaps take a lead in this House.  A visit from the Minister would generate focus and an opportunity for Members of this House and the Department to explain the direction we are taking on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1081"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I renew my call for an answer to my question on when the debate on the Climate Protection Bill 2008 can be resumed.  This is the third day I have asked the question.  I asked the Deputy Leader the question on Tuesday and was given an ambiguous answer on the resumption of the debate.  I am anxious to have the debate resumed.  It is timely in a week when a US President has been elected who is committed to reducing emissions in the US by 80% by 2050 and the British Parliament passed a law last week which will have the same effect.  It is timely that we have a debate on this Bill, which aims to achieve the same result in Ireland.  I ask the Leader for a less ambiguous response or I will have to call next week for an amendment to the Order of Business on this matter.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate on the cutbacks to human rights and equality bodies, in particular the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.  The severe cuts represent a quiet coup that undermines and neuters these two very important bodies.  There had been, prior to the budget, a well publicised proposal that the bodies might be merged, but, happily, that was not done.  The effect of the serious cutbacks in funding provided for the bodies next year will have a similar effect of neutering voices that were justifiably critical of certain Government policies.</P>
        <P>At a time when there are severe rises in unemployment, with a record rise of 15,000 in the last month alone, we need real protections for the vulnerable and disadvantage in our society.  It is very short-sighted to cut funding for human rights and the Equality Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s views on Irish jobs.  It is an issue I already raised in the House.  Senator Hanafin is correct on the importance of a debate on this issue at which the Minister will be present in the House.  I concur with Senator Coffey&rsquo;s comments on the need for upskilling for those who may change employment in the current climate.  I congratulate F&Aacute;S and Skillnets on the programmes they make available to assist those who wish to upskill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to the tremendous army of frontline service providers in our health and social services, the doctors, nurses, emergency services such as fire, ambulance and garda personnel, carers, meals on wheels providers, home helps, public health nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  The majority of these service providers go far beyond their call of duty and make an enormous contribution to individuals and communities.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the supports available to the HSE structure.  In the past I expressed my concerns on this matter.  I am deeply concerned about the continual changes in the structures in which these personnel work and to whom they report.  The morale of these service providers should be taken into account.  I understand the HSE is changing the structures we had in place in previous years back to the system in place prior to the HSE.  We will now have regional structures similar to the old health board structure.</P>
        <P>It is very important we receive appropriate briefing on this issue and that we are aware of the structures, supports and reporting procedures that are in place for the service personnel to whom I referred.  I hope the Leader will obtain that information as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In the budget the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced the closure of four barracks, two in Donegal, one in Longford and one in Monaghan.  He suggested it would help the national finances.  Far from helping the finances, extra costs will be accrued as a result of this announcement.  There will be an extra cost of &euro;2 million per annum for the change of station allowances, &euro;600,000 extra for security and maintenance of these barracks and the cost of providing permanent and temporary building works to accommodate people when they are transferred to new locations, which will amount to approximately &euro;30 million.  </P><Col N="1082"/>
        <P>What are the savings?  We need the Minister to come in and spell out the savings that will result from this announcement.  It will cost the country money rather than save it.  To announce the closure of barracks and that personnel must leave the barracks before 31 January, when we have seen previous barracks closures that have not yet been sold, is unacceptable.  It is an example of an ill thought-out budget.  It is a mess.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, or the Minister for Finance to the House to explain where the savings will be made.  It is a bad move.  The barracks are far from my area, but, given the costs that will be accrued to transfer people, it is a dreadful exercise in economics.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the matter of the electoral register, which is of interest to all politicians, irrespective of the level at which they serve.  Applications to be added to the voters' register must be made by 24 November.  I ask that a concerted effort be made by third level institutions to ensure that their students are registered.  In the past students have been reluctant to register, either at college or at home, and in view of the number of young people who became involved in the American election it would be an opportunity for young people here to become involved in politics, particularly in terms of voting in the local elections next year.</P>
        <P>Is there a possibility of having a debate on transport and the way we proceed in the future with the development of our transport infrastructure?  If we do not continue to develop our infrastructure &mdash; road, rail, air and all the other transport needs, we could see it go back into decline.  We are all aware that the consequences of that after an economic upturn, which we all hope will come sooner rather than later, could have a devastating effect, especially on rural areas and the west in particular, which still has a major transport infrastructure deficit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s remarks about the deferment or cancellation of the cervical cancer vaccination programme.  That is regrettable because it could, apparently, save the lives of 200 young women every year, or at least prevent them from getting cancer.  It is a simple regime involving three injections, but at &euro;600 it is costly.  That means that, once again, the wealthy people in our society will avail of it and the disadvantaged will be further hurt.  </P>
        <P>There appears to have been a lack of coherent thinking on this issue.  The programme was announced but we now know from the freedom of information inquiry RTE made that the Health Service Executive felt it would be virtually impossible to roll it out before 2010 at the latest.  There is a significant problem, therefore, in that respect.  A woman who had been successfully treated for cervical cancer was on a television programme last night.  She was naturally apprehensive about her daughter and felt very aggrieved that this vaccination programme would not go ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday, we spoke in glowing terms about President-elect Obama and I have not changed my mind, but yesterday was a day for celebration and praise, which was very justified, and we all felt elated.  President-elect Obama has shown himself to be judicious and restrained, qualities I admire but do not always emulate, and that was clear throughout the election.  However, there were one or two occasions on which I was concerned.  For example, he said he would authorise military intervention in another sovereign state without notification &mdash; I refer to Pakistan.  That is a big mistake.  I believe that was said because a type of Dutch auction on military options was induced by the McCain camp, but that is a dangerous way to proceed.  He was shown in a clip last night saying, &ldquo;I will kill Osama bin Laden and I will destroy al-Qaeda.&rdquo; <Col N="1083"/> That is inflammatory rhetoric.  I hope he will, in practice, go back to being judicious because it is not a question of the name, the colour or the personality of the person, it is a question of the policies, and if he goes on with that kind of approach I will oppose President-elect Obama as much as I opposed George Bush, not that he will be aware of it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, there is somebody here who will be aware of my   comments and with whom I usually agree, namely, Senator Hannigan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Russian matter &mdash; it is all tied in with Obama &mdash; and its decision regarding a possible siting of military equipment in the Kaliningrad area, we have never tried to understand the Russians.  There has been no attempt to do that.  It has all been completely one-sided.  It is very useful in these areas to look at the mirror image or reverse it and see what the position would be if the boot was on the other foot.  If, for example, what the Americans and NATO have been doing with regard to Russia had been attempted by the Warsaw Pact, if they had put missiles in places like Mexico, Venezuela and so on &mdash; they tried it in Cuba &mdash; and enlisted them into the Warsaw Pact, there would have been hysteria from the Americans.</P>

	<P>I would like our Leader, Senator Donie Cassidy, to urgently request the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to come into the House urgently to discuss the rising unemployment level and advise us on how the Government intends to address it.  We read in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that 260,000 people are unemployed, and the figure is rising relentlessly towards 300,000 and possibly 500,000.  A total of 15,800 people have become unemployed in the period September-October and men make up 70% of that figure, indicating that the construction industry is shedding workers rapidly.  Women make up 1,400 of that figure.  That is the first indication that the services sector is affected also.</P>
        <P>Last night I attended the Irish exports awards at which the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, made an inspirational speech.  He lauded the companies which were up for awards on the dynamism and energy they put into exporting and competing around the world.  I draw attention to some points in his speech and to the Central Bank quarterly report, which refers to something I have pleaded for here, namely, that our Government develop a strategy on improving our competitiveness internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless we get a better economic competitive environment, our exporting companies will not succeed.  I advise my colleagues, who may not be aware of this, that our industrial energy costs are the highest in the European Union and are 34% higher than the EU average.  How can our companies compete in those circumstances?</P>
        <P>Last night, the president of the Irish Exporters Association told the Taoiseach that his members will compete if the Government gives them a chance.  He said they will lower their costs, improve their added value and lower their prices.  It is as simple as that.  I call on the Taoiseach to apply that simple approach to the public sector.  It will require leadership and courage.  I do not ask that he cuts back on public services but to eliminate the waste and <Col N="1084"/>inefficiency because no private company in this country could survive and continue to export abroad and employ people in present circumstances.  We must cherish our companies, which are the creators of employment.  With our competitive base being continuously eroded and our tax bill, which pays for the public sector, we demand that the public sector becomes efficient and that its costs are reduced.  I know what I am talking about because I worked in both the private and the public sectors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made the point well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The people who work in the public sector are outstanding but that sector does not apply the same management techniques on a day by day and hour by hour business that a private company must apply to survive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in asking the Leader to make time available for an urgent debate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on rising unemployment figures.  There was an increase of 15,800 in one month of the numbers on the live register.  We are not merely discussing statistics, we are talking about people and their families.  It is important that a debate take place in respect of this subject.</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s plan in this regard?  Its approach appears to involve cutting services, slashing funding, borrowing more money, running for the hills and then performing a few U-turns.  The Government has said nothing with regard to retraining or upskilling people.  I take Senator Mary White&rsquo;s point in respect of the cost of doing business.  Representatives of the Irish Hotels Federation came before the relevant Oireachtas committee to discuss this matter yesterday.  The Leader is a business owner and he will be aware that those who own small businesses such as coffee shops and restaurants are opting to keep their premises closed at weekends because of the costs involved.  In that context, the Leader should invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come before the House to discuss the forthcoming local government estimates.  I hope that commercial rates will not, as a result of mistakes made by the Government, be used to penalise small businesses.   We have reached the stage where many businesses in cities and towns will opt to remain closed at weekends on foot of the prohibitive costs involved.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader make time available for an urgent debate on Northern Ireland?  An impasse has been reached in the North in respect of the power-sharing Executive.  Those of us who support everything that has taken place in Northern Ireland want a debate on that matter in the House.  It is not acceptable that the multi-party power-sharing Executive has not met in months.  There is a vacuum and everyone knows what will happen if that vacuum is allowed to remain.  The Leader should invite either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach, who has engaged in discussions with Northern Ireland politicians, to come before the House to debate this matter.</P>

	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Cummins in respect of Army barracks, particularly the two in Donegal.  I discussed this matter with the Minister for Defence who assured me that there are savings to be made.  I would be happy for him to repeat what he said in the House.  If he comes before the Seanad, I will take the opportunity to follow up on the matter I raised on the Adjournment last night in respect of Ballykinlar internment camp, County Down, which has been converted into an interpretative centre.  I was informed on last night&rsquo;s Adjournment that the relevant records are held by the Department of Defence in the UK and that the land relating to the barracks at Ballykinlar is owned by the British authorities.  Perhaps the Minister for Defence will consider that matter and we can discuss it with him when he comes before the House to discuss the issue of Army barracks.</P><Col N="1085"/>
        <P>On the Adjournment last night also Senator Wilson raised the matter of the banning of BZP, or the party pill, and received an extremely positive reply.  It is accepted that this is a dangerous drug and legislation must be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter is not relevant.  It was the subject of a lengthy reply on the Adjournment last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand legislation is due to be introduced prior to March 2009.  Like Senator Wilson, however, I am of the view that the matter should be expedited.  I previously served as Chairman of the Oireachtas committee charged with dealing with the issue of drugs.  Members of that committee visited New Zealand, where the so-called party pill has become a scourge and where serious problems have arisen.  The key players in the New Zealand judiciary and police service are extremely concerned with regard to what occurred there.  This drug is only beginning to become popular here and we should not allow it to gain a foothold.  Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to expedite the introduction of legislation to which I refer?</P>
        <P>Will the Leader also make time available for a debate on infection control services?  It has been brought to my attention that people &mdash; young children, adults and the elderly &mdash; who contract MRSA in hospitals are being released from care and their families are obliged to fight in order to have them screened and treated.  Those responsible for infection control services appear to be of the view that once a person has been discharged from hospital, his or her illness is then a matter to be dealt with by the community at large.  If one contracts MRSA while in hospital and if one is discharged, one will end up passing that infection on to others in the community.  It is the responsibility of those who run the services within the HSE to ensure that people who acquire infections in hospitals must be screened and treated until such time as they can be given the all clear.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader make time available for the debate to which I refer?  Will he also ask the HSE to ensure that people who contract infections while in hospital and their families will be screened and treated in order that they will not become a danger to their communities?  Ongoing screening and treatment for these individuals will allay the concerns of others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to take up a point made by Senator Hannigan.  The Leader promised to make time available for regular debates on the banking industry.  Within the next two hours, the European Central Bank is set to reduce its rates by 0.5%.  That should be a case for great rejoicing in this House and throughout Europe because it is meant to give a boost to the economies of member states, particularly Ireland.  However, the evidence is that the first people who will rejoice will be those who run the Irish banks.  My remarks are not intended to be flippant.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan correctly pointed out that the previous cut in rates was not passed on by the ICS Building Society.  In addition, Permanent TSB did not pass it on to new first-time buyers.  Other banks played ducks and drakes with the reduction by not passing it on to those with loan-to-value and other mortgages.  Despite immense Government pressure exerted shortly after the announcement of the guarantee scheme and the ECB rate reduction on 8 October, the banks did not capitulate.  They passed on the reduction in some cases but not in others.</P>
        <P>I contend that the new 0.5% reduction will not be passed on to customers.  The banks are using the European Central Bank&rsquo;s cuts in interest rates to pay for the cost of the guarantee scheme.  They are actually stealing from customers in order to pay for the guarantee scheme, which is something they were not meant to do.  As a result of inquiries made yesterday by my office, the indications are that the banks are not going to pass on the new reduction in its <Col N="1086"/>entirety and that they will instead use it to either recapitalise their operations or increase their profits.  This means that customers are already paying for the guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>I suggest the Leader take a message to the Minister for Finance to the effect that the pressure the latter maintains he will exert on the banks by placing people on their boards is already failing to have an effect.  The banks have got away with murder.  They went cap in hand to the Minister and promised to behave.  However, they have already returned to their own tricks and are playing ducks and drakes with the ECB rate reductions.</P>
        <P>When this matter was raised in July some of the banks &mdash; I can name them if the House desires &mdash; raised their interest rates by more than the increase recommended by the ECB.  They took advantage because they were of the view that people would not really notice.  If the ECB&rsquo;s 8 October rate reduction, which was meant to boost the global economy, and the new reduction continue to be exploited by those who caused the financial crisis, we will be back to square one and the banks will be better off than they were in the first instance.</P>

	<P>Senator Mary White also referred to competitiveness, the fiscal position and costs relating to the public service.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely referred to a return to some form of regional structure within the HSE.  That matter is probably worthy of a debate.  As someone who expressed reservations in writing to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children in respect of the HSE&rsquo;s corporate governance model when it was initially put in place, I am of the view that if there is a possibility of strengthening existing structures, we should debate this matter in the House.  I urge the Leader to arrange for such a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the inquiry in Northern Ireland into Bloody Sunday and the statement by Lord Saville yesterday to the victims that it will be the autumn of next year before that report is issued.  He gave the reasons for that.  It is important that emphasis is put on such issues and that they are brought to a speedy conclusion in the interests of all those who suffered during that terrible period.  Although the Seanad did not have a debate on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other such atrocities, the D&aacute;il did and it called on the House of Commons to participate in generating co-operation from the British Government with the inquiries we have conducted and, in particular, to make available all the information it has on collusion, which shows the extent of the criminal activity in Northern Ireland by the security forces and possibly by the political and public service establishment.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this.  We should maintain an emphasis on this issue so the avoidance by the British authorities of responding and co-operating is not allowed to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the issue of universal entitlement?  This should be based on what is happening not just in regard to the medical cards but also in regard to the cervical vaccine for young girls.  This is incredibly important.  It was a great achievement to produce such a vaccine; it is probably the only vaccine the world has against <Col N="1087"/>cancer.  We are denying it to our young people.  It was a short-sighted step by the Minister, who is saving &euro;10 million by not rolling out this scheme.  It would not take until 2010 to roll it out.  It could be rolled out in three months if the HSE put its mind to it and was genuine about providing a vaccine against cancer in the Irish health care service.  It is amazing.  There are also knock-on effects in terms of encouraging prevention and health promotion among young people when we get them into the surgeries.</P>
        <P>The short-sightedness is unbelievable.  It is just as short-sighted as trying to take medical cards from people over 70.  It is time the House had a debate on the universal entitlements available to people in this country.  Our universal entitlements are not as good or generous as those available in other first world countries, particularly in the EU.  Ireland is quite far behind in the provision of universal entitlements.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware of the economic issues and I call on the Leader to hold proper debates on the economy.  I accept the comments of other Members about competitiveness and what is happening on the jobs front, but we are talking about these matters as if they were somebody else&rsquo;s problem.  We should have good debates on these issues.  The debate we had yesterday with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, was one of the better debates in this House.  It focused on the clear differences in our perspectives for the future.  However, too often in this House we see Members just covering all the boxes or corners.  I will not name anybody but Members on the Government side are talking as if they are sitting on this side of the House.  They are not making any contribution to the future of the country by just criticising things and saying they are wrong.</P>
        <P>We must hold debates to discuss what we can do about issues.  I ask the Leader to arrange such debates, and Members on the other side should take it on the chin if they get abuse from this side of the House.  They walked themselves into this problem but they can get themselves out of it by having mature debates.</P>

	<P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator Wilson, for raising the issue of BZP on the Adjournment last night.  Like Senator Keaveney, I welcome the commitment to introduce legislation on this matter before March.  However, last night Senator Wilson also raised another underlying issue.  Time passes quickly but new drugs and new forms of illicit substances that can give people a chemical high are introduced even more quickly.  This can raise a dilemma for the garda&iacute; and anybody else who has to deal with the problem.  Not only must they counter the detrimental impact these substances have on users&rsquo; physical and psychological well-being but in trying to control the supply of the substances they run into a problem if the substances are not listed under the schedule of illicit drugs.  It is most frustrating.  The BZP issue is particularly frustrating for the garda&iacute;, who are proactive in dealing with it.  When they make seizures they are forced to let the people involved go without being charged.  They can do nothing about it.  Will the Leader find out if this legislation can be introduced before March as a matter of urgency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions this morning about unemployment struck a chord with many of us, particularly Senator Mary White who spoke about competitiveness.  It is interesting to look at what the founder of O&rsquo;Briens Sandwich Bars said yesterday in Cork.  He said that because of regulations that were passed during the good years &mdash; he referred particularly to the National Employment Rights Authority and its regulations &mdash; he has had to close a number of his sandwich bars in Ireland.  There are 136 such bars but he has had to close a number of them because he is forced to pay double time to employees who work on a Sunday.</P>
        <P>I do not understand where this regulation originated.  Perhaps in the good years it was possible to provide for the highest minimum wages in Europe and to tell employers they must not <Col N="1088"/>employ people unless they pay them double for Sunday work.  This man could employ 60 more full-time employees if these regulations did not apply.  I do not understand how we can insist on regulations continuing in force when we are inhibiting opportunities to create jobs.  Senator Mary White and Senator Coffey asked that the T&aacute;naiste be invited to the House to discuss what she is doing about jobs.  One option is to dismantle some of the regulations we introduced in previous years in order to create more jobs now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently I raised the issue of the direct intervention by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in local planning matters.  At a very useful meeting of the environment committee this week, departmental officials confirmed that there had been six such direct interventions by a Minister since the introduction of the Act.  Four of the interventions have taken place in the past 12 months under the current Minister, Deputy John Gormley.  One of the most important tasks of local councillors is the adoption of the local town or county plan.  There is a certain nervousness at present because many counties are in the process of completing such plans.  The situation in Mayo has been very well covered in the media and there appears to be hope of progress there.  I asked the Leader at the time to invite the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to the Seanad to outline his perspective on the planning Act and how he believes his powers should be properly utilised.  It is regressive to allow a situation arise whereby councillors draft a plan over a number of months and sign off on it only to discover a month later that the Minister has his own plan.  If that is the case, the Department should do the planning from start to finish and save councillors the trouble.  I again ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to come to the Seanad as a matter of urgency to outline his perspective on this issue.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Callely, Norris, Walsh and Twomey expressed their serious concerns about issues relating to cancer screening.  Members heard the Minister on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; radio programme this morning give a full and frank interview about this.  I welcome the &euro;30 million that has been invested in the programme, which started in September, to screen all females for this dangerous cancer.  Last August the Minister did an interview during which the interviewer was very aggressively trying to make a point.  However, the Minister quite correctly pointed out that everything was subject to funding.  Senator Twomey is a member of the medical profession and I am always very careful to listen to members of every profession in this House.  However, he and everyone else must welcome the &euro;30 million that is being spent and the screening programme that started in September.  The Minister said this morning that she will do everything she possibly can to ensure the vaccination programme begins at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on her attendance in the House yesterday.  It was extremely uplifting to hear her being so open.  She stayed for half an hour longer than scheduled for a question and answer session.  We have being trying to introduce question and answer sessions in this House, with the co-operation of Ministers and Ministers of State, at the end of Ministerial presentations.  It has been working quite successfully but yesterday was a watershed in terms of a commitment to this House by a Minister.  I must compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, on her contribution here yesterday and on sharing her wide-ranging views openly and candidly with Members.</P>

        <P>We all know the world is in financial crisis and as Senator Frances Fitzgerald has said, three months ago all Governments in the world were of a the same view.  Today, however, that view has changed.  I outlined to the House yesterday that when the Governor of Virginia, Mr. Tim Kaine visited the House in June, he told me that his administration had reviewed the State&rsquo;s financial position three times in the first six months of this year.  That indicates that the economic situation is changing by the month, if not by the week.  Unfortunately, the volatility will continue for some time, although hopefully not for as long as some political commentators suggest.  Hopefully, the election of Senator Obama, which has been uplifting for the western world, will improve matters.  We all look forward to his contribution and hope he will play a major role in restoring confidence in the financial system in the United States of America.  Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Bank, the global economy has taken a serious turn for the worse, particularly in the banking area.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross pointed out that the ECB is likely to reduce interest rates again today, which I welcome.  It is also expected that the United Kingdom will reduce its interest rates.  We will monitor, on a daily basis, those banks to whom the State has given a guarantee, to ensure they pass on any reductions in interest rates to their customers.  I call on all Members to inform the House during the Order of Business next Tuesday of any bank that does not do so.  Such banks will be named in this House during the Order of Business because we owe it to the Irish people, to those who have worked hard to make our country what it is today, to do so.  We also owe it to the younger generation, some of whom are in the Public Gallery as I speak.  They are very welcome to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We must all play our part and I expect the financial institutions to do so, particularly as they benefited most from the Celtic tiger, parts one and two.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of energy costs and the difficulties being experienced by many.  Senators Coffey, Callely, Mary White, Buttimer, Walsh, Twomey and Quinn all expressed their serious concern at the additional 15,000 people on the live register.  The situation is very serious as the most recent unemployment figures are the same as those that pertained in 1997.  Unfortunately, the rise in unemployment will probably continue for another few months or so.  In the United Kingdom, which has a population of 60 million, almost 2 million are currently unemployed.  That illustrates that the downturn is worldwide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have often said before, business is not about turnover but about overheads.  In that context, current energy costs are unacceptable.  I have asked Senators who are members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to meet me after the Order of Business to discuss energy costs.  I also invite members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment to that meeting and any other Senators who wish to attend.  The meeting will be short as I am aware that there are other meetings scheduled to begin at 12.00 p.m. today.  The aim of the meeting is to determine how we can play our part in dealing with the challenging price increases from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, as well as the price paid at the pumps for petrol and diesel.  We played a substantial role in reducing insurance costs by our review of the insurance industry.  We can play a similar role during the lifetime of this Seanad with regard to energy costs.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have called for a debate on agriculture, which I hope will take place during the last week of November.  Senators Hanafin and Callely raised the issue of unemployment and requested that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment be invited to the House to discuss the challenges facing her Department, particularly with regard to job creation and maintaining existing jobs.  In the latter context, Senator Quinn referred to the fact that many service sector businesses, particularly hotels and restaurants, are closing their doors on Sundays because they cannot afford to pay their staff double time.  The regulations in this regard were introduced in very good times, as Senator Quinn said.  It is now time to revisit this matter to see if the regulations can be dismantled in the short term in order that businesses <Col N="1090"/>can keep their doors open and staff can get an extra day&rsquo;s pay.  We can put this matter to the T&aacute;naiste when she visits the House.  I ask Members to raise this issue at their weekly parliamentary party meetings.  I undertake to raise the matter at the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting next Tuesday.  It is unacceptable that businesses are losing out because of a regulation that no longer reflects the economic climate.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked for clarification regarding the status of the climate change Bill.  I will do my best to see how we can progress that matter.  The Senator also raised the issue of funding for various bodies, which can be debated in the House when the Minister is present, at a future date.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins and Keaveney asked that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Defence be invited to the House to discuss the proposed closure of certain army barracks.  I have no difficulty in acceding to that request.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis raised the issue of the register of electors.  The new closing date for registering to vote is 24 November.  I support the Senator&rsquo;s call for young people at third level institutions to become actively involved in politics.  Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s election campaign started in university campuses in the United States of America and what a difference young people&rsquo;s involvement made to that campaign.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis called for a debate on transport, which I will facilitate.  I welcome the opening yesterday of the Eiscir Riada fly over on the N4 and N6 routes.  For those of us who used the road when travelling last night and this morning it was a great surprise.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and Walsh called for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I gave a commitment to this already on the Order of Business yesterday.  I will pass on to the relevant Minister Senator Walsh&rsquo;s strong views on the Bloody Sunday tragedy and his call for the need to maintain pressure in regard to the matter.  Senator Keaveney expressed strong views on the state of infectious control services and related matters.  I will allow statements or a debate on the matter in the House at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senators Corrigan and Keaveney passed on their good wishes to the Chief Whip on the Government side of the House, Senator Wilson, concerning the issues raised in the House last night and I share those good wishes also.</P>

        <P>Senators Hannigan, O&rsquo;Toole and Ross called for a debate on banking.  I made my views known on the matter this morning.  There is a debate once every month on the economy, which includes banking.  This debate may take place in the last week in November, but the Finance Bill 2008 is due on 3rd December and perhaps at the leaders&rsquo; meeting next week we can discuss the timing of the debate with a view to postponing it for one week, by which time we will know the contents of the Finance Bill 2008, which would be more beneficial.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris expressed strong views on Russia and the activities associated with the Bush administration in the USA.  I recognise the Senator has steadfastly held these views for some time, which we respect.  Senator Leyden passed on his best wishes to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in their deliberations and their new initiative to address the activities off the coast of County Mayo.  It is of the utmost urgency to <Col N="1091"/>the economy and the nation that the significant gas find there is allowed to proceed.  I wish all concerned well in their new deliberations.  Senator Leyden spoke of harnessing energy in rivers, especially around the Athleague area which he knows well.  The area is part of his constituency and includes the River Suck, about which we have heard year after year from colleagues from the west of Ireland.  The suggestions made by Senator Leyden are worthwhile and it may be possible for extra energy to be harnessed with no cost to the nation or without issues relating to ownership of the mills.  We can examine the possibilities in this area and I have no difficulty in holding a discussion on the matter at some stage in the future.</P>

	<P>We were discussing lack of consultation in the process.  This is an Opposition amendment and I wish to express my disquiet regarding the lack of consultation.  I cannot comment on behalf of Fenit, County Kerry, or other places but I can comment on behalf of Bantry, County Cork.  The kernel of some of the amendments which I have proposed later in section 18 could be resolved if the issues regarding lack of consultation were resolved.  I refer to a letter sent to the then chairman of the board of Bantry Harbour on 16 September 2004, signed by the then Minister of State with special responsibility for the marine, Deputy John Browne. The letter might elucidate in better terms the problem I have with the system of consultation.  It was written by Vivian O&rsquo;Callaghan, a former Member of this House.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Chairman,  As agreed at our meeting on 6 September last, I am writing to set out my understanding of the outcome of the meeting and of how to ensure that the dialogue between the Department and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners can be progressed in the future on a positive basis.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As stated at the meeting, the interruption of the dialogue with the Commissioners and the referral of the matter to the Attorney General was a direct consequence of the unilateral decision by the Commissioners to place a contract while discussions with the Department on the viability of the project were ongoing.  Up to the point of interruption of the dialogue, the Department had been satisfied that a project was viable and would not have resulted in serious financial harm to the Commissioners.  For this reason, Department officials were most surprised at the decision taken by the Commissioners at the time to enter into the contract in March 2002,  [That is historic now.  I am not saying the commissioners were wrong or right on that occasion, but I am talking about the area of consultation and dialogue.] given that there was not a shared understanding of the viability of the project, in respect of which the Department was asked to provide support.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am keen that the Commissioners and the Department re-engage in a constructive and fruitful manner, having regard to previous expressions of support for the project.  I can assure the Commissioners that the service of the Department and myself will be applied positively to this end.</P><Col N="1092"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">From our discussions, I understand that the Commissioners believe that the business environment for the project has shifted from that originally envisaged.  As you are aware, the project costs have escalated since the consideration of Exchequer support of &euro;1.9 million by the former Minister.  [That was announced in April 2002, but of course it was never spent.]  Furthermore, no progress appears to have been made and the conditions contained in the former Minister&rsquo;s letter of 15 May 2002 (copy attached) which letter expressly instructed the Commissioners not to enter into any contractual commitments, pending a report on progress in relation to the two stipulated conditions.  (In the event, the contract had already been placed.)  Accordingly, I would propose that the project be reviewed in terms of its viability, the financial implications for the Commissioners of increased borrowings for the project due to its escalated cost and the risks to the project posed by the dominant position of the terminal operator.  To this end, I invite the Commissioners to submit for consideration a fully detailed updated proposal for the project, including a comprehensive business plan with financial projections.  The Department is available to assist the Commissioners in elaborating its requirements in terms of the proposal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I was a member of the board at the time, and much of what happened was due to the over-enthusiasm of the Bantry Harbour Commissioners to pursue this project.  I am trying to convey to the Minister the importance of the consultation and dialogue and linking it to what is currently happening, which is a <i>volte face</i>.</P>
        <P>The letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">You will be aware that the Oireachtas decided in 1996, through the passage of the Harbours Act 1996, that the latter represented the best legislative model within which a commercial port should operate.  It is thus a matter of long-standing policy that the Harbours Act 1946 is no longer regarded as a suitable instrument for the management of State harbours.  Accordingly, it is proposed over time to effect the dissolution of all the harbour authorities currently operating under the Act, and where appropriate, to transfer responsibility for the control and management of each harbour to a local authority or to a port company.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I regard Bantry Harbour as a significant port in terms of business and location in the south west.  It is therefore firm policy to maintain the harbour, and where possible and appropriate, to develop it.  Consideration has been given to the best means of ensuring that Bantry harbour is positioned and equipped to fulfil its commercial port functions in a modern, professional way.  It is essential, in that context, that Bantry has available to it the best marketing, project management and technical and general management skills as befits its importance and potential.  [This will be very important when I get to my own amendments later.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It is my view that the harbour should be operated within the provisions of the Harbours Act 1996.  This Act, together with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, will provide the necessary framework to ensure the effective corporate governance of the State body concerned.  It is the Department&rsquo;s view that the business associated with the harbour falls below the minimum level of activity necessary to justify the establishment of a new company when compared to the alternative available to the State and that the Port of Cork Company is ideally positioned to ensure that Bantry has access to the best regional port management expertise, marketing skills and strategic development planning.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I would urge the Commissioners to assess fully the pros and cons of the options mentioned above and to explore fully with the Port of Cork the conditions which might surround any amalgamation of Cork and Bantry, which would protect the interests of Bantry.  I fully appreciate that the Commissioners will enter any discussions with the Port of Cork Company <Col N="1093"/>on a &lsquo;without prejudice&rsquo; basis and I can assure the Commissioners that no final decision will be taken other than in full consultation with them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Again we are hearing the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  That consultation process consisted of very brief meetings with the Port of Cork Company in Bantry.  We were told that when the due diligence report was done, that everybody would sit down together, including the Minister.  That consultation has now been hijacked.  We were told that the consultation would take place, but I am saying it has not taken place.  The publication of this Bill clearly tells us that the Department is not interested in consultation, or if it is interested, it will shoot first and ask questions later.  That is the perception of the general public in the area I represent and the perception of the 11 board members, who do no want a shot-gun marriage with the Port of Cork Company unless there is consultation.</P>
        <P>The town commissioners sold off the railway pier for less than market value to the harbour commissioner, while the owner of the main pier, Cork County Council, has not been consulted.  Last weekend I had an opportunity to meet with the manager for west Cork, who I shall not name.  I met her about a different issue, but I brought up this matter and she was amazed at how this was proceeding.  She said that the council own the pier and has a specific interest in the development of Bantry.  She had set up a consultation process and a strategy whereby the town council, the county council and the harbour commissioners would work together with the Department in developing the inner harbour and the pier.  If this Bill is enacted, we are in the lap of the gods as to when the Port of Cork Company will take us over.</P>
        <P>I apologise to the Leas-Chathaoirleach for being leadr&aacute;nach, but this is a critical issue.  I compliment Senator Donohoe from Fine Gael on raising the matter.  He probably did so under a completely different context, but it acted as a catalyst for my grey matter.</P>
        <P>The letter goes on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">As was agreed at our meeting, Mr Michael Guilfoyle, Assistant Secretary General, will work with the Commissioners in identifying the issues to be addressed in relation to the pier development and the future of the harbour.  He would envisage, as agreed at our meeting, meeting the existing Board again (or a subgroup) on these issues at an early date.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What meetings have taken place since this letter was issued, either with a sub-committee of the Bantry board or otherwise?  That is a critical matter.  With all due respect, my view is that if such meetings took place they were on other issues, not on the critical issue of Bantry being nicely put into bed with Cork Port, for reasons of corporate governance or suitability.  It does not suit those concerned.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The letter continues: &ldquo;Prior to that meeting, it would be useful and productive if the Commissioners had progressed a project plan for the pier development and had some discussions with the Port of Cork.&rdquo;  Those discussions took place.  In all the consultations with regard to the port of Cork, it amazed me that on the area of due diligence the port of Cork seemed to know what was going on daily and monthly.  The harbour commissioners in Bantry were told nothing by the Department while, at the same time, this was what was happening in tentative meetings.  The port of Cork could tell us what was happening, yet the Bantry harbour commissioners were in the dark.  I attended a specific meeting to which certain Oireachtas Members were invited to state what was happening.  That is another example of the lack of consultation involved.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must forgive me for saying that there was a premeditated decision based on bad reports of what was happening in Bantry in the 1980s and 1990s, when the port was a dead duck in the water.  If this deal had been offered to us at that time we would probably <Col N="1094"/>have taken it, but from approximately 1994 onwards Bantry has emerged as a profit-making port of some significance.  However, a premeditated decision has been taken by someone, either politically or otherwise, to get rid of Bantry Port for whatever reason.  They want to move irrespective of consultation, but that sticks in my throat.</P>
        <P>The letter goes on to discuss by-laws in Bantry, as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">As you are aware, the powers of harbour authorities to make bye-laws for the good rule and government of a harbour are set out in section 60 of the Harbours Act 1946.  Specifically, in relation to pilotage bye-laws, the Attorney General advises my Department that no further bye-laws can be made under the Pilotage Act 1913 following its repeal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Pilotage in Bantry is critical because large tankers are bringing crude oil, bunker oil and diesel into the bay.  The knowledge of local pilots is therefore crucial.  Apart from Whiddy Island, the pilotage situation is critical.  I will refer in my subsequent amendments to a legal issue which has not been addressed.  With reference to the costs arising from the Whiddy Island disaster, the area of pilotage and harbour safety is critical.</P>
        <P>My forefathers sought to sell stone excavated from Hungry Hill and ship it abroad.  The greatest exportation of stone from the Thirty-two Counties is from Bantry Bay.  Pilotage is important in this respect because big ships take the crushed rock from the local mountain in Leighale, near Adrigole on the northern shore of Bantry Bay, to England and sometimes to mainland Europe for road building.</P>
        <P>The letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">In relation to past proposals of the harbour authority for bye-laws to be made under section 60 of the Harbours Act 1946, the Department&rsquo;s file indicates that there has been ongoing correspondence between the harbour authority and the Coastal Zone Management Division of the Department. [I referred to them earlier, although I do not know where that division has gone in this debate].  Arising out of this process, the Commissioners were invited in August 2003 to submit redrafted bye-laws taking into account objections received and changes agreed with the Coastal Zone Management Division.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Has all that been sorted out?  Have the coastal zone management and bye-laws for Bantry inner harbour or bay been resolved?  Bye-laws are critical in respect of where boats can be moored, be they large yachts or small punts, in addition to tourism-related water sports such as water-skiing and surfing.</P>
        <P>The letter from the former Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, to the then chairman of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, Mr. Vivian O&rsquo;Callaghan, who is no longer on the board, continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">I can assure you that we will deal expeditiously and constructively with any resubmitted bye-laws and will address concerns regarding pilotage in that context. [This is all to do with consultation on pilotage and bye-laws]. You should contact [a named person] Assistant Principal, at ...</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not want to go into that because it is just a contact number.  The letter concludes by referring to the proposed sale of foreshore at the inner harbour.  This again comes down to bye-laws.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">As the Commissioners are aware, under section 159 of the Harbours Act 1946, the sale of surplus land requires Ministerial consent.  Also directly applicable is section 5 of the Code of <Col N="1095"/>Practice for the Governance of State Bodies which deals with disposal of assets and access to assets by third parties.  Specifically, the Code states that it should be standard practice that the disposal of assets with an anticipated value at or above a threshold of &euro;70,000 should be by auction or competitive tendering process, other than in exceptional circumstances.  The Code provides guidance in relation to the determination of the anticipated value.  A copy of section 5 of the Code is attached for ease of reference.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The letter also states that some other person in the Department, who shall remain nameless, can deal with any queries.  It continues: &ldquo;I wish the Commissioners well in their remaining endeavours; I assure them of my continuing support and thank them for their important contribution to making the Harbour a successful and strategic element in the State&rsquo;s port infrastructure.&rdquo;  That letter was sent out on 16 September 2004, which is not 100 years ago, to the then chairman on certain issues.  Perhaps the reason the letter was sent out is not the one I am discussing, but in most paragraphs it refers to the area of consultation.  The final paragraph of the letter concerns consultation.  I accept that some of the Bantry harbour commissioners are not professional, but they did not act maliciously.  In one instance, which is referred to in the letter, they purchased a piece of foreshore, which was critical.  The status of the foreshore of Bantry Bay is something which sticks in my craw because it should not be the case.  The issue of who owned what rights also arose in the case of Lismore, County Waterford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like ground rent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Earl of Bantry and Bantry House estate own all the foreshore, about 60 miles of it, from Sheep&rsquo;s Head.  The purchase of the foreshore was critical for any development in the inner harbour at Bantry.  Currently, the council is taking sewerage one mile out of the town to be treated, which should have been done years ago.  The council had to obtain foreshore rights for that because some of the pipes ran along the foreshore so the harbour board decided to buy foreshore rights.  I think I am correct in saying that they went ahead and bought the foreshore rights innocently without prior consultation.  They did so in good faith but they bought the rights for &euro;170,000.</P>
        <P>This all concerns negotiation and consultation.  Two local developers were interested in the foreshore rights for their own purposes.  A new hotel has been built and there are plans for a marina development.  I attended a meeting and intervened in good faith, as a broker, with one of the developers.  I said they were competing against the harbour commissioners to buy the foreshore rights.  What they are doing is for the good of Bantry, including harbour development, dredging and extending the pier.  We had a heated meeting with the then chairman, who shall remain nameless &mdash; he is no longer in the country &mdash; and a particular contractor-developer.  They paid approximately &euro;170,000 but if it went to a Dutch auction and they were outbidding each other, the harbour commissioners could very well have paid close to &euro;1 million for those foreshore rights.  They should have been given for nothing.  In 1981, some of the foreshore was given over by the Bantry House estate for &pound;1.  The people running Bantry House are very decent people and I felt that should have been the same because the harbour commissioners were doing something good for the town and the surrounding area.</P>
        <P>I may be deviating slightly from the issue but had the harbour commissioners gone about it the right way and sought permission from the Minister by way of the Department and under corporate governance and Part V, I am sure there would have been no lack of consent or co-operation by the Department at that stage.  I stress the importance of local harbours and local knowledge.  The harbour commissioners, the town council and the developer decided not to have a Dutch auction.  That bit of ground was worth a lot of money and my worry is that Cork Port will have the benefit of it.  The developer stood back and the harbour board bought the <Col N="1096"/>ground.  If it had gone to a full auction involving auctioneers and bidders outbidding each other, it could have trebled or quadrupled the price that was paid.  The harbour board in Bantry was given a slap on the wrist because it did things incorrectly and I accept that.  Members of harbour boards are people of different professions and they are not familiar with all the rules, regulations and by-laws.  They act in good faith on most occasions.</P>
        <P>I have another three or four pages in that communication on the issue.  I also wish to put on the record of the House a letter which was written about consultation.  The writing is very small and I may need glasses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no fear of the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The optics are confusing me a bit.  This is a letter written to me in 2002 by the then Minister, Deputy Frank Fahey.  It is a short letter dealing with consultation and what action can be taken about Bantry: &ldquo;I am writing to inform you that I will approve Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners&rsquo; application for 33.3% grant aid for a new pier development.&rdquo;  The important fact is the figure of 33.3%.  The letter goes on to say that negotiations were to take place to deal with the development of Bantry harbour.  I will need to revisit many of those issues because I have a ream of paper to read into the record of the House when I come to speak on my own amendments.  There are only seven or eight reports but I must do it because this is an issue that goes to the bottom of my heart and I wear my heart on my sleeve when I am talking about Bantry harbour.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State may wish to reply but I may have to contribute again.  If the consultation as promised in this letter, which was written in 2004, only three or four years&rsquo; ago, had taken place, if the commitment by Ministers and Ministers of State, who were probably my own people, in the past seven to eight years had been honoured, and if the consultation, with Cork Port especially, had taken place, and some individuals have said privately that they did not want to be the dominant partner and would rather work with Bantry, we might not be at this stage now.  Consultation should have applied also to local Oireachtas Members because there are only four or five of us in Cork South West.  Although some of us probably would have had a greater interest than others, that aside, they should all have been notified.</P>
        <P>I will not name the individuals but a clear commitment was given to me by at least three Ministers or Ministers of State when they told me that not one thing could happen with Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  We all knew something was in the pipeline without the Minister of State, the harbour board, the town council or Cork County Council, who are all players in this situation, being consulted.  It would be a funny set-up if Cork Port were to try to do something on Bantry pier which is owned by Cork County Council.  The old railway pier from the time when we had a train going into Bantry was owned by the town council and it passed it on in good faith to the harbour commissioners saying it would be in a position to help them out if they wanted to do something with it.</P>
        <P>That consultation and the commitments given to me were not politically honoured.  I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, but he has inherited this particular situation.  I am not saying that Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and the town council did not make mistakes.  I was a member of the harbour board for many years and it was the unanimous agreement of the representatives of the town council, the county council, the trade unions and the chamber of commerce, and of the Minister&rsquo;s appointees that whatever was to happen Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, they did not wish to entertain a scenario whereby Cork Port would be their governing body.</P><Col N="1097"/>
        <P>This is about consultation, which is dealt with in section 18.  That consultation process, if it existed at all, was negligible and at the fringes, and that is wrong.  If I understand it correctly, the 1996 Act or one of the Acts refers to the consent and <i>imprimatur </i>of the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I should not mention the Department because I must be careful in how I phrase this in case people say I am having a go at officials which is not my job and is not proper to do.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Transport can, under the existing legislation, with the stroke of a pen and without consulting any Oireachtas Members or the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, lump us in with Cork County Council and put it in charge.  If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Transport can do that, it is a unilateral, non-consultative process.  This power is in the Act as I understand it.  This has its merits and demerits.</P>
        <P>On the question of consultation, in case it is thought that the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners sat back and decided to do nothing, it had difficult meetings with the then manager of west Cork whom I will not name but whom Senator McCarthy will know and who is a decent man.  He attended some meetings and we looked at the options at my request when I was a member of the board.  We asked what the consultation process would be if Cork County Council were to take over the board.  The council was concerned not to take over a harbour board where many things remained to be done and where it and, ultimately, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, would end up spending money on extending the pier, dredging and other important infrastructural works in the inner harbour.  This is all to do with consultation and the consultation process was engaged in.</P>
        <P>To be fair to members of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners or the Bantry board &mdash; whatever one wants to call them &mdash; following from the letter I read into the record, which was sent in September 2004, they met and had informal chats with Cork port as to how or if they could move on this process.  They were cordial meetings and there was no abrasion.  The Bantry representatives did not say, &ldquo;Hands off.  How dare you?&rdquo; and, to the best of my knowledge, there was no attempt by the Cork port representatives to say, &ldquo;We are here.  We do not particularly want you but we are going to swallow you up.  We will take what we can from Bantry Bay and we will invest little or nothing.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I thought &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; &mdash; that famous term &mdash; had been concluded.  I was under the impression that this would proceed once the legal problems holding up the purchase of the foreshore rights were sorted out and the registration of the title was complete, which I believe it is.  The Department, its officials and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, or perhaps the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, were involved in trying to speed up that process.  There were difficulties but these were legal and were not the fault of the Bantry harbour board or its solicitors.</P>
        <P>I am worried with regard to consultation, on which Senator Donohoe put down an amendment.  That process has failed the Bantry harbour board.  As I said earlier in the debate, and not in a flippant manner because it is not comparing like with like, there were years of consultation and negotiation behind the scenes with regard to the situation in Northern Ireland.  That did not happen in this case.</P>
        <P>It galls me to note that this Bill is enabling legislation &mdash; Senator McCarthy may agree or disagree.  Under the Bill, the Minister has another string to his bow so that, whether it is 2009, 2010, 2011 or another time, with the stroke of a pen he can decide to take over and manage Bantry harbour.  This will include its assets and its not too great liabilities &mdash; Bantry Bay is valued nationally and billions of euro would not pay for it.  If that bay were in the United States, South America or Saudi Arabia, a value could not be put on it.  From an ecological <Col N="1098"/>perspective, Bantry Bay, which is 23 miles long and eight miles wide, is the second finest bay in the world.</P>
        <P>If the Bill is passed, we are hostages to fortune and consultation will be gone out the window as far as Bantry is concerned.  While the Minister of State may correct me on this, the position in the existing Act of 1996 is that if the Minister for Transport and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come together, they can decide at the stroke of a pen that Cork County Council will take over Bantry.  If this happens, we will be a lame duck.  We will be like a dodo &mdash; we will not be able to fly and we will become extinct.</P>
        <P>If the Bill is enacted and we do not want Cork County Council to take control, but it is decided that Cork port would take us over, where do we go?  In May 2002, we came within hours of becoming a corporate identity &mdash; it may be phrased differently in the Bill &mdash; in order that we could manage our own affairs.  All sorts of reports were drawn up by PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG, as well as private reports by Mr. Raymond Burke and two other reports, all explaining what is right and what is not right. When this arose, I said we should wait because if the port has a stand-alone corporate identity and does not make enough money &mdash; unfortunately, we are somewhat hamstrung in that the main funding source is the harbour dues paid by Conoco Phillips &mdash; we could not go begging to the Department because it would say, &ldquo;Hold on, you went down that road, you can stand on your own and we will not give you a penny, one way or another&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I referred on Second Stage to bodies such as Cork County Council, which owns the pier, and to the harbour commissioners.  We all sometimes look down on local authorities, harbour boards and so on but they have a role and are a means of contact with the local people.  We must not forget Bantry inner harbour is unique.  Were the 20 or so Whiddy Island people still left on the island consulted, and if not, why not?  They have rights and traditions.  I am sure if a constitutional point were made, those people would ask whether they were consulted.  Whether going to town to shop, to go to church or to go to national or secondary school, they must come to the mainland.  Have they been consulted about what is happening?  Unfortunately, they have not been, which is regrettable.</P>
        <P>They are a small island group I admire but who sometimes live in difficult circumstances.  We have beauty in west Cork, with seven inhabited islands, as Senator McCarthy noted.  Were the people of Whiddy Island consulted?  Of course, they were not consulted the night of the famous explosion, when they ran, some of them in their underwear, and fled from the island fearing that the whole place was going to blow up around them.  I would not blame them for that.  They ran and sought shelter.</P>
        <P>Have the shrimp, oyster and mussel fishermen in Bantry been consulted in this process?  These are small operators &mdash; poor shadow lads.  I accept the number of Cork port directors is being reduced from 11 to eight, with possibly one from Bantry.  With all due respect, politicians, whether councillors or otherwise, will no longer have a say.  Cork County Council will have two or three directors on the board and Cork City Council will have three or four.  The board is gone but who in Cork port will come down and serve?</P>
        <P>I do not know why we have all these overlapping Departments.  What will we do with these fellows with their oyster beds?  A group of islanders have aquaculture licences to fish for scallop and other species from most of the islands and Bantry is the capital of line-grown mussels.  Have these fishermen been consulted?  I have written to the two companies that export mussels and to some of the people harvesting them.  This is all on my back although I do not know why I should be doing all this.  I had a meeting with the Irish Shellfish Association, a national association which has a major interest in parts of Waterford and other counties, and covers all <Col N="1099"/>kinds of shellfish, not just mussels, but oysters, clams, periwinkles and other shellfish.  It has not been consulted.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a consultation process.  If Cork port took us over, perhaps the Minister would tell me that has nothing to do with him.  With all due respect, it has.  One cannot take over Bantry Bay and then cherry pick and say Whiddy Island will make money for Cork port because it will give an annual income and that the chances are, with the uncertainty of the world oil markets, it will be increasingly used.  We are told that in 50 years&rsquo; time oil will be replaced by some other means, whether nuclear power, wind power or another type of energy.  Although I have no guarantee, I hope with the Lord&rsquo;s help to fight two or three more elections and that I will get another 20 or 25 years out of it, if He spares me.  In my lifetime, I hope I will see a use and a purpose for Whiddy Island.  It is like <i>contra proferentem regius</i> in the days of Magna Carta.  It is against the wishes of the people who make a living from or have a duty or responsibility to Bantry Bay if they are not consulted on this.  Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners have had several run-ins with the local mussel, lobster and shrimp fishermen on where aquaculture licences and fishing lines should go to keep shipping lanes open.  There is no provision in the Bill to ensure the Port of Cork Authority will do the same job.  I do not think it will, and it would be a dereliction of my duty and responsibility as the area&rsquo;s representative not to say so.  These guys are the hewers of wood and drawers of water, serfs of the soil but decent people.  I am here as their voice.</P>
        <P>Has any thought being given to the Costello tribunal report on the Whiddy Island disaster in Bantry Bay in 1979?  The report criticised the Department, the then Minister in a subtle way, and the lack of powers vested in the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  They subsequently received the powers but in the mid-1990s it was decided to get rid of them.  There must be local control of Bantry Bay, whether it is Whiddy Island or Garinish Island.  What if the Cork port authority decided to charge boat dues on tourists going to Garinish Island?  I presume the Department with responsibility for the islands would get a few bob as well.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, there is a possibility that owing to interference by another State agency and to a toxin related issue, the mussel industry and other types of fish processing in Bantry Bay may collapse.  The fish and shellfish harvested in Bantry Bay are the same as those from Chile, the Bay of Biscay and Holland.  The threat of toxins in fisheries is the same the world over but because of over-diligence on our side in monitoring our own &mdash; we are great Europeans in that respect &mdash; if an incident occurred, who would pay the compensation?  Due to the amount invested in Bantry Bay in mussel lines and onshore facilities, and with the decommissioning of fishing vessels, those who could be affected would want &euro;50 million plus in compensation for the loss of their industry.  Will the Cork port authority pay or will the Department of Transport?</P>
        <P>Consultation is important.  I will never buy into the notion that this is an enabling Act to give possible powers and, once enacted, there will be all manner of consultation.  The passing of this Bill will sound the death knell for Bantry Bay.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will respond to all the points I have made.  I do not want to be putting the gun to his head because we have only another two hours for this debate.  The Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were castigated by the Department because they did not consult with it or made mistakes.  They put their hands up but were told to stand outside the classroom like bold boys in school until they learned their lesson.  Consultation with the commissioners did not occur.  This legislation is proposing a shotgun marriage where Bantry Bay, lock stock and barrel, will be handed over to the Port of Cork Authority.</P>
        <P>Was Conoco Phillips consulted?  It is a major player which owns the terminal at Whiddy Island and built a replacement jetty that cost millions of euro.  In the past eight years, it has spent over &euro;50 million on upgrading and ensuring safety standards at the Whiddy Island facili<Col N="1100"/>ties.  Up to 40 people have been directly employed with another 20 as subcontractors.  As it will have to pay harbour dues, has it been consulted on this legislation?  I did not consult it but it is an important player.</P>
        <P>There has always been a debate in Bantry as to what is the most important industry to the town.  In the 1960s some felt the oil terminal was the only industry to sustain the town.  Like other multinationals, however, the oil industry left, leaving a terrible legacy of 50 deaths on 8 January 1979.  With the emergence of the mussel, crayfish, oyster, prawn and inshore fisheries, the fishing industry was then considered important.  However, the tourism industry was also considered.  I recall a Belgian businessman who wanted to build holiday homes on Whiddy Island but could not because the terminal did not make the spot attractive.  I always believed, as a public representative, that each of the industries should live and let live and consult each other.  There has to be respect for the ongoing maintenance and sustenance of fishing, whether it be fish farming, aquaculture, trawling, potting or whatever.</P>
        <P>In addition, tourism is critical to the region.  Leaving out Garnish Island, we have Sheep&rsquo;s Head, the Beara Way and other attractions.  Tourism, as my colleague Senator McCarthy will confirm, is a major issue for people in the area.  We had to have consultation.  With regard to the control and operation of the harbour in Bantry, people seem to forget that in the 1970s we had some major oil spills which were national and environmental disasters.  This is why the harbour board was set up from day one.  In addition to the tragedy in which the <i>Betelgeuse</i> blew up in Bantry Bay, there were major disasters including one in 1974 in which several million barrels of crude oil were spilled.  If it happened nowadays, with Sky and CNN and the way in which stories are promulgated by the media internationally, there would be war.  There would be multi-million euro claims from fishermen, salmon farmers, mussel line farmers and so on.</P>
        <P>In those days nobody wanted to know Bantry.  With due respect, the man responsible was from the other side of the House &mdash; the then Minister for Transport and Power, former Deputy Peter Barry.  A song was made about it, although I had better not recite it.  It was along the lines that Peter Barry would feel quite sorry he was Minister for power.  Mr. Barry came down and intervened, stating that all the spillages could not go on.  He was the catalyst for putting a harbour board in Bantry.  When it was set up first it was a lame duck as it had no powers, and now that it has powers they are trying to trip us up again.</P>
        <P>If consultation is taking place it is not transparent or open.  This concerns the area of consultation.  I compliment Senator Donohoe on raising this when he was last here because arising from the <i>Betelgeuse</i> tragedy in Bantry, which resulted in a public inquiry, came the Costello report.  I urge any of my colleagues to read it, or at least read the conclusion and the synopsis.  It was a damning indictment of lack of control in Bantry.  There was a lack of response.  It was lucky that more were not killed on the night of the disaster.  Controls had to be brought in.  What Peter Barry was doing at the time perhaps involved no consultation.  The company involved was Gulf Oil, which was a big international company.  Its operations were controlled in the United States but when it came to Bantry Bay its controls were on a &ldquo;take it as it comes&rdquo; basis.  It made up the rules as it went along.  That is why a board was set up in Bantry.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that Cork Port in many ways has expertise that we probably lack in Bantry.  The reason, if I am to be frank, is that the Department, through the Minister, is saying for political reasons that it placed Bantry Port, without any consultation, under the remit of Cork County Council.  That is stated in the 1996 Act as far as I know.  The Minister might respond to that.  However, if Cork Port has additional power and, perhaps, greater experience and professionalism with regard to issues such as pilotage, I can name 20 other areas of relevance <Col N="1101"/>to Bantry Bay in which it has no experience &mdash; perhaps it does not want it &mdash; and no professional expertise.</P>
        <P>On the issue of consultation &mdash; this is something on which I will elaborate in detail later &mdash; has there been consultation about the pier extension?  There were two announcements in this regard.  On 14 June 2000 the then Minister, Deputy Frank Fahey, arrived in Bantry and we had a big night out.  I was supposed to go to the Killarney races that evening and I cancelled everything.  We were told we were getting &pound;1.5 million, in punts.  We went into a hostelry to celebrate and we thanked the Minister.  We said before he left that maybe &pound;1.5 million would not be enough and that we might need a bit more.  This equated to &euro;1.9 million.  It could not be spent at the time because it was putting the cart before the horse.  There was planning to be done, and then the harbour commissioners, against my better judgment, went in a different direction and planned something else.  In the heel of the hunt, with all this consultation, we have no pier.  In breach of the recommendations in the Costello report, we do not have a facility in Bantry to allow a fire brigade or ambulance to reach the site of an emergency if one were to occur at Whiddy.  When one is dealing with combustibles such as bunker fuel, diesel oil and gasoline, fire is likely.</P>
        <P>Let us be realistic.  In half tides and low water &mdash; I am not talking about full tides &mdash; most decent vessels take 1 to 2 metres of water.  These are small vessels.  Some of the ocean-going tugboats that used to come in to the pier when I was a young fellow had a draft of 5 metres.  With all that, we still have a situation in which, if a fisherman wants to go out at 8 o&rsquo;clock in very low water he must go down at five minutes to eight to pull out the boat because if he goes down at eight he cannot go fishing.  This still pertains in 2008.  Where is the consultation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was a lovely gentleman who was T&aacute;naiste back in 1989-90, although I do not have the precise dates.  He is now gone to the terminal ward.  I refer to former Deputy John Wilson, who was a great Member of the other House.  He came down to see the harbour and he was appalled at the set-up.  He saw it at low water when the islanders were coming in to go to mass, and they had to climb across other boats along a length similar to that between here and the monitor.  People were being lifted up and down.  He could not understand why we did not have a pier extension and why we had not carried out dredging.  We did not have the basic facilities.  I can never forget these visions when I take a walk down the harbour in Bantry at low water.  I look out and the boats are all dry.  I am a small man &mdash; about 172 cm.</P>

	<P>The Acting Chairman may be able to envisage a layer of silt and gravel two and a half times my height.  That is what has to be dredged.  Then we can bring in boats and make Bantry an operating facility.</P>
        <P>I cannot forget the Costello report.  I will bring it in the next day and read a good part of the contents because it is a historic report.  Legally, we cannot ignore it because somebody will be back before the courts again on the issue.  It is appalling that in the event of an emergency we will not be able to bring out the required vehicles.  People will come back to me and say they have a loan of a facility, a Mickey Mouse set-up whereby they can go down to the airstrip near Bantry and drive across the gravel.  It will be like the last world war, during the final assault of the Allied forces against the Germans, when they had to go across beaches and half of them were shot.  It will be something similar.  They are building slipways now, but as it currently stands that is what we will have to do.  I must refer to a person who broke her leg in Whiddy Island and had to go through a large amount of hassle and trouble.  Perhaps in this day and age we could provide a helicopter and have her airlifted.  Perhaps she would want that.</P><Col N="1102"/>
        <P Just="Left">We talk about consultation and the lack of it, but there has been the greatest dearth of consultation with regard to Bantry over the years.  I use the word &ldquo;dearth&rdquo; in capital letters.  Some of it was the fault of the board.  The oil spillages resulted in the setting up of the original harbour board by Peter Barry.  He did that much, in fairness to him.  It is fine to be critical but I will not be, because he is a gentleman.  It had to be done.  The Costello report found the harbour board had no controls.  It could not send a pilot or tug boat to tell a tanker that it was unsafe to land and discharge its cargo.  That was what happened in the <i>Betelgeuse</i> case.  The boat should not have landed on the night in question.  It was sent away from a Spanish port.  They thought they could go to Bantry and if it blew up, only a few local people would be killed.  They did not realise 44 Frenchmen would also be killed.</P>
        <P>It is all to do with consultation.  Mr. Peter Barry took one step.  The Whiddy disaster followed and it was found the harbour board had no powers either to raise revenue or to impose controls, such as a harbour master.  A harbour master could tell people they could not attach themselves to the single point mooring buoy because there was a five metre swell.  That can be done now and as far as I am aware, the pilots still go out.  That happened as a result of the Costello report.  It found the set up in Bantry Bay was a disgrace.  It may not have used the word &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; but it gave the political system a rap on the knuckles.</P>
        <P>The Costello report was efficient and cost the State &pound;500,000.  I wish modern tribunals would take note of it.  One of its conclusions was that the harbour board should have powers so that it could be efficient and have controls.  The harbour board had to have teeth to ensure another Betelgeuse disaster did not occur.</P>
        <P>We all fell asleep, politically and otherwise, after the Betelgeuse disaster on 8 January 1979 in which 50 lives were lost.  Now we are discussing again the lack of consultation in Bantry.  Consultation is important, both in the Chamber and outside it.</P>
        <P>Gulf Oil pulled out of Bantry when the Suez Canal opened and it found it did not have to build large tankers to go around the Cape of Good Hope because it could go through the Suez Canal instead.  This meant Bantry was surplus to requirements.  When the company pulled out, it compensated the State, not just once but twice.  Millions of pounds were paid to the State.  Was one million spent in Bantry?  We begged for a handout and we were like the boy in the Dickens novel asking for more.  We did not get a bob.  A sum of &pound;300,000 or &pound;400,000 was supposed to have been set aside for a community centre in Bantry and extensions to the pier were promised which did not take place.</P>
        <P>Now we are being asked to trust the same will not happen again.  I have a lack of trust and confidence.  Another disaster could happen and we are totally unprepared.  There are emergency response services such as the fire brigade.  Recently in the town there were squad cars, helicopters flying around, ambulances and fire brigades.  The facilities are more appropriate to the Second World War when they landed on the beaches in France.</P>
        <P>The Costello report has been ignored in this Bill.  We took our eye off the ball.  Gulf Oil pulled out of Whiddy and nothing happened for many years.  The harbour board was there in name only.  The island facilities were sold twice and Conoco Phillips came in.  It was an Irish-American company and it did a lot of work in Whiddy, such as refurbishing tanks, some of which were built in the 1960s and were becoming rusty.</P>
        <P>We fell asleep for years and no consultation was needed.  Consultation and diligence in Bantry Bay are important because we now have a single point mooring buoy.  I was out on a fishing boat when a rolling swell came and although there was no wind, it was so high we lost sight of a tanker anchored two miles away.  As a result, we took for the shore at four in the morning.  I have a fear that if a tanker had an emergency on a bad night and it was in a heavy <Col N="1103"/>swell, it might tie up to the single point mooring buoy.  If it drifted to shore or damage was done to the ecology of Bantry Bay or Garinish Island, where would the Costello report fit in, as it were?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has copious notes for his response but I will be coming in again because I have covered only a small amount of what I want to say about consultation.  The Minister of State might say that is another argument, but consultation has a central role.  I was not consulted and the board was only consulted peripherally, if at all.  There is a lot of anger, which has not yet been seen but might be when I, especially, as Government party member, and Senator McCarthy go knocking on doors in a few years in Bantry, Glengarriff, Beara, Durrus, Goats Path or Gerhies and people say to us that we are the men who oversaw the handover of control Bantry Bay and harbour to Cork.</P>
        <P>There are different ports and scenarios.  What if Waterford, Rosslare and New Ross were to marry and Rosslare were to object?  New Ross and Waterford would be glad of the financial accounts we have.  If they were making, <i>pro rata, </i>the tonnage per capita as Bantry is making they would be happy.  I was asked by a senior figure in Cork County Council last week why the Bill does not propose that Baltimore and Kinsale be governed by Cork County Council.  What is happening to Arklow?  I do not like being singled out in Bantry as a maverick.</P>
      
        <P>I cannot comment on the position in Fenit, I cannot comment on how it is run or its corporate governance but I put it to the Minister of State that as of now there has been little or no consultation, and this amendment is concerned with the consultation process.  I put it to the Minister that the consultation process envisaged was not followed, particularly in the letter to which I refer.  I have great respect for the then Minister of State, Deputy Browne.  I am sure he wrote the letter in good faith in terms of prior consultation, due diligence and so on.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There was a time when we all believed that certain factions in Northern Ireland of different religious backgrounds and political persuasions could never sit down together and talk, but they did that eventually and, thankfully, a peace process is now in place.  However, I envisage all hell breaking loose in Bantry Port.  It would be very easy to blockade Bantry Port and stop a tanker attaching itself to the SPM.  Fishermen do it.  I am not advocating that but disbanding the Bantry Harbour Board is envisaged in the Bill, regardless of whether we like it.  It is stated that it is an enabling measure and that it might not happen for a few years, but because of lack of consultation at council and local authority level I envisage resignations from the Bantry Harbour Board.  I envisage major disruption taking place.  One could argue that this could be for better or worse &mdash; perhaps in time to come it might be good &mdash; but we cannot put a gun to people&rsquo;s heads and tell them that we are disbanding Bantry Harbour Board.  The Bill may not state that, but that is what is envisaged, yet there has been no consultation whatsoever on this issue.</P>

	<P>I accept the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s point but I will return to this subject.</P>
        <P>Barack Obama had a dream and his dream is fulfilled.  People in Bantry had a dream also.  I want to read into the record a press release that appeared in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in January <Col N="1104"/>1985.  I was a mere gars&uacute;n then.  That was the year I first got elected to Cork County Council.  It was written by an eminent reporter with <i>The Cork Examiner</i> who would have been familiar with Bantry for many years, the late Jim Cluskey, God be good to him.  I want to quote the article because it is about the dream for Bantry and the fact that there has been no consultation.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A Consultant engineer, who is one of the country&rsquo;s top experts in marine construction, was yesterday enthusiastic about the results of initial tests that could lead to a major development in Bantry&rsquo;s inner harbour.</P>
        <P LI="1">Mr. Derry Nestor [whom I do not know] of Cork &mdash; who masterminded the Neptune Sports Centre &mdash; said that trial holes dug yesterday showed that rock would not be encountered.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was to do with a proposal for which we got money for the pier and harbour but nothing happened.  The article further states: &ldquo;This meant, he said, that the shape of the inner pool could be moulded simply by removing material.&rdquo;  That is the dredging we spoke about, and again there has been no consultation because Cork Port will come in and dredge it overnight.  It further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The situation would also facilitate the building of a sea wall, the length of which would be governed only by cost.</P>
        <P LI="1">An ad hoc committee has been set up in Bantry with the aim of creating a yachting marina and creating a flood control system for Bantry town.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That has been sorted out because the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did works there on the flood control system.  It further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">It would also, according to Committee Chairman, Mr. Bill O&rsquo;Donnell&mdash;&mdash;</P>
        <P FLI="0">God be good to him.  He is still going strong.  He is a great character who had a dream for Bantry.  He was involved in the harbour area all his life and I hope he will live to see this project fulfilled.</P>
        <P LI="1">&mdash;&mdash;destroy the eyesore that has been around this community for 140 years &mdash; seven-and-a-half acres of grey slobland.</P>
        <P LI="1">Speaking of the estimated cost of &pound;1 1/4m for the project, Committee Press Secretary, Ms. Grainne O&rsquo;Mahony, was confident that the money was available &ldquo;and it was just a question of tapping it&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Money was promised following the Betelgeuse disaster but one could say there was a lack of interest in Bantry.  It further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">There were, she said, categories of EEC funding for such projects and they would also be hoping for a share of the &pound;1m which the Chevron Oil Co., which has taken over Gulf Oil [I forgot about Chevron; I spoke about Gulf earlier] had pledged to the Government for the development of Bantry Bay.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are back to the question of there being no consultation.  Where did that &pound;1 million go?  It would have done a great deal in 1985.  Bantry did not benefit from any of it.  I remind the House that a golf course was sorted out in Bandon, which is 40 miles away.  They know nothing about it.  A golf course was done in Castletownbere but not one cent was spent in Bantry Harbour.  That is a disgrace, regardless of who was in charge of it.  To be fair, they know nothing <Col N="1105"/>about consultation or a lack of it.  We got kicked in the arse and kicked in the teeth all my lifetime.  These were the issues that were relevant at the time.  We come in here and talk about consultation.  I am saying clearly there has not been consultation.  I digress somewhat but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should be careful about using unparliamentary language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The article further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">She said the tests carried out yesterday would be used as a basis for making a submission to the EEC, and within 15 months, a scale model, costing about &pound;20,000, would be submitted.  It was hoped that the construction of the model would be carried out as a UCC post-graduate project.</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;What is being done today will lead to an analysis and from there to proper costings&rdquo;, she added.  &ldquo;After that the project will be put to the people of the town&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This Bill is not being put to the people of the town or to the harbour board.</P>
        <P LI="1">Ms. O&rsquo;Mahony saw prospects of a marina establishing Bantry as an off-season resort.  It&rsquo;s bread and butter income would be from providing winter moorings for yachts of 40 ft. and over, and the cream would be the handling of ocean-going yachts.</P>
        <P LI="1">Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell visualised that if the project were supported it could earn Bantry &ldquo;a very, very conservative&rdquo; &pound;90,000 a year, as well as creating temporary employment for young people.</P>
        <P LI="1">Yesterday was marked by two gestures of goodwill for the venture &mdash; O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s plant hire dug the test holes free of charge, and the work was supervised, also voluntarily, by Quantity Surveyor Mr. Andrew Moore, of the contracting firm of Murnane and O&rsquo;Shea.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I place this information on record because it is evidence of what certain people envisioned in 1985.</P>
        <P>If I was on the other side of the House, I would have a rip-roaring go in respect of this matter, particularly as it relates to the lack of consultation.  When Gulf Oil moved out and Chevron came in, the State benefited on both occasions.  There was a clear political commitment to spend money in Bantry.  At the time the project cost &pound;250,000 and the then Government made a commitment that money would be spent.  That commitment was never honoured, which is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>More than 20 years later it has been decided to transfer control to the Cork Port Company, which I do not trust.  It does not matter what any Minister in the Government states, I am of the view that Cork Port Company will not honour the commitments that were given by different Departments.  I am seriously concerned because such commitments to the people of Bantry, whom I represent, have not been honoured by successive Governments.</P>
        <P>Progress and money have been made during the past ten years and there has been extremely good co-operation at Department level.  Now that we are on our feet, however, the rug is being pulled from under us.</P>
        <P>I will be obliged to speak further on this issue when the Minister of State has replied.  In the interim, however, I must locate extremely important information from a number of consultants.  There are six or seven reports available, all of which I could read into the record of the House.  However, I will not be able to do so in the time remaining today.  This is my final bite at the cherry on behalf of Bantry harbour.  If I lose on this one, I will be obliged to tell the people of <Col N="1106"/>Bantry that I was on watch when their harbour was sold off.  That is a matter about which I am concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>People may be of the view that there is nothing much left to be said following Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s contribution.  However, I wish to place this matter in context.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 10 to 12, inclusive, are grouped for the purposes of discussion.  My name, along with that of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, is appended to some of those amendments.  I will certainly not repeat the extremely salient points made by the Senator.</P>
        <P>In respect of section 18, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Under the Harbours Act 1996, provision is made for the transfer of harbour authorities to local authority control by Ministerial order in cases where there is little or no commercial traffic.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Ports Policy Statement provides that in cases where there is significant commercial traffic, consideration will be given to bringing the relevant harbours under the control of a port company.  This is relevant to two harbour authorities: Bantry Bay and Tralee and Fenit.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The amendment I have tabled proposes the deletion of the new subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister may by order appoint a day as the transfer day for the purposes of this section in respect of Bantry Bay Harbour and, with effect from that day, the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners are dissolved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In fairness, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has been championing the cause in respect of this issue since long before the legislation was initiated.  He tried to encourage some element of consultation between the Minister, the Department and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  I have in my possession a letter addressed to and received by the chairman of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners on 9 September 2008.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Chairman</P>
        <P LI="1">I refer to your letter dated 21 August 2008 requesting a meeting with members of Bantry Bay Harbour Commission. [That is not an unrealistic request on the part of any group.]</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As you are aware, Bantry Bay Harbour Commission operates under the Harbours Act 1946.  Policy in relation to such harbour authorities is as set out in the Ports Policy Statement published in 2005.  [That was the policy statement in respect of which no one, not least local authorities or Bantry Bay harbour commissioners, was consulted.]  This indicates that the continued operation of the harbour authorities, under the outdated provisions of the Harbour Act 1946, is unsustainable on the grounds of good corporate governance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not believe anyone disagrees with the notion of good corporate governance.  If, however, the dismantling of local government is a direct implication of good corporate governance, then we should consider what is meant by the latter.  In order to be good corporate governors, must we abolish local authorities?  The letter to which I refer also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">You are also aware that my Department is of the view that the best way forward for Bantry Bay Harbour is amalgamation with the Port of Cork Company.  This would help the future development of the harbour by giving it access to the best regional port management expertise and marketing skills.  The Port of Cork Company is waiting to finalise a due diligence process into an amalgamation with Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  I understand that a <Col N="1107"/>land registry issue that has delayed completion of the due diligence report is close to resolution.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Once the due diligence report has been completed, officials from my Department will arrange a meeting with representatives of the harbour commission as soon as is convenient.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The latter statement represents the crux of the letter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As already stated, the letter in question was received by Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners on 9 September.  We are engaged in a debate on Committee Stage of the legislation but there still has not been any contact.  Various commitments were given to the people of Bantry that such contact would occur.  This is all relevant to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s amendment, which makes specific reference to consultation.</P>
        <P>Far be it from me to lecture anyone in the Bill&rsquo;s Office, but I am of the view that the amendment I am discussing should also have been grouped with Nos. 8, 9 and 13 to 17, inclusive, which all refer to Bantry Bay.  It is my intention, therefore, to take this opportunity to say as much as possible in respect of the latter amendments.  It might be time efficient if I were to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should confine his remarks to the amendments in this group and no others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that the amendments are similar.  I will speak only in respect of the amendments currently under discussion.  However, when the others arise for discussion, I will already have my contribution made because the points relating to both groups are the same.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is present.  However, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, should be here to answer questions in respect of consultation and the commitments given to people in Bantry.  Has the Department engaged in consultation with or received correspondence from the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland, AMAI, or the Association of County and City Councils, ACCC, in respect of the Bill this week?</P>
        <P>If we are intent on passing legislation that is good for the country, the least we should do is to consult people.  This matter is critically important and it could prove to be of major economic and social benefit to Bantry and the least the Minister should offer to do is meet the Bantry Bay harbour commissioners to discuss it.  Most people are reasonable.  If everyone sat down around a table and discussed the circumstances and issues at hand, a consensus might be reached.  At the very least, however, such a meeting would involve consultation.  The Minister could indicate to the people of Bantry what it is intended to do and ask if they have any recommendations.</P>
        <P>I am not happy with what has happened to date.  I am most disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, gave commitments to Bantry Bay harbour commissioners and did not follow through on them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, did not introduce the legislation or provide commitments.  However, he is obliged to deal with this part of the Committee Stage debate.  I will be interested to discover whether correspondence has been received from the AMAI or the ACCC.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment was tabled in order that we might deal with the lack of consultation that has been associated with the Bill from the outset.  This is a cause of great concern not only to the people of Bantry and Fenit but also to local representatives and Oireachtas Members.  Two Members of the D&aacute;il, Deputy P. J. Sheehan and Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, are champing at the bit to deal with this legislation when it goes to the D&aacute;il.  I respect <Col N="1108"/>the bona fides of the sentiments expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan in this regard and on the issue of lack of consultation.  For goodness sake, if a Minister introduces a Bill without consultation with the parties involved, he should know he will run into trouble with this attitude.  I am not referring to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  The senior Minister has not lived up to his responsibilities where consultation is concerned.  This appears to be an operation by diktat rather than through consultation.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy referred to correspondence from the Association of County and City Councils.  I received correspondence yesterday relating to the issue I addressed in depth last week, that is, the proposal to reduce the number of local authority members from three to a possibility of one and possibly abolish local authority membership, as a result of the report of some experts in this area.  Again, consultation is the key word and there was no consultation with anybody in that regard, be it the Association of County and City Councils or the other association representing local authority members.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Donohoe on putting forward this amendment.  Even if it is not accepted by the Minister, it is important that the issue of lack of consultation about this Bill is discussed.  Certainly, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has given the matter a good airing over the past hour or so and I am sure he has more to say.  I now know more about Bantry Bay and harbour than about all the bays and inlets around the coastline.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for that information and his expertise on the subject.</P>
        <P>This amendment was put down to highlight the lack of consultation by the Minister.  The Minister is including flexibility in the legislation to provide for the transfer of small harbours to the control of either the local authority or the local port companies.  One cannot impose flexibility; it is earned after consultation.  The Minister is remiss in this area and the lack of consultation will get a considerably greater airing.  However, he should be afforded the opportunity of replying to the amendment and the many points raised in the past hour or so on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 18 provides an enabling power for a ministerial order to be made which could permit the transfer of responsibility for Bantry Bay to the port of Cork and the transfer of responsibility for Tralee and Fenit harbours to the Shannon Foynes company.  The amendment seeks to insert a provision to ensure that any ministerial order relating to Bantry or Tralee must be subject to public consultation and would have regard to that consultation.</P>
        <P>The proposal is to include an enabling provision.  The proposal to do that has been the subject of extensive and lengthy consultation over almost ten years.  As I mentioned on the last occasion, a review of the State&rsquo;s regional harbours in 1999 proposed, with regard to Bantry and Tralee, that a merger with a relevant port company should be explored to maximise the commercial potential at each harbour.  The 1999 report was the subject of an extensive local, regional and national consultative process.  Following that there was a high level review of the State&rsquo;s commercial ports which was published in 2003.  That also proposed that a merger between these two harbours and a relevant port company would best suit their continued development.  The high level review was also subject to an extensive and wide ranging consultative process.  All this fed into the development of the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement which was published in 2005.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the proposals in regard to Bantry and Tralee have already been subject to consultation at all levels.  Their inclusion in the Bill is not an attempt to force any type of shotgun wedding on the two harbours.  It is the logical conclusion to a consultative process which has taken place over eight or ten years.  That has been recognised by people on the <Col N="1109"/>ground.  In the 2006 annual report of Bantry Harbour commissioners the chairman said that once the due diligence report was completed the commissioners should take the opportunity to discuss the matter of amalgamation further.  That is the current position.  Nobody has back-tracked on any commitment given in a letter.  The situation is clear.</P>
        <P>This is an enabling provision, although Members seem to avoid this issue almost immediately.  It deals with something that could happen.  Obviously, prior to such an order being made it would be common sense that further consultation with local interest groups would take place.  That could include the various bodies that were mentioned during the debate, such as the county council, town council, inland fisheries, islanders, fishermen and everybody up to Uncle Tom Cobley.  The question is about the consultation that was always promised.  I am saying it is common sense that it would take place.  I fully accept that it would be very foolish to do something without consultation.  The question is whether Members accept that guarantee or wish to see it formalised in some way or other.</P>
        <P>The crucial issue is that this is enabling legislation.  At present, there are a couple of options that can be taken with regard to the harbour commissioners.  The legislation is just broadening the options.  Only one option would be taken. One could establish a private company in respect of any of these harbours or transfer control of them to the relevant port company or local authority.  The ports policy statement indicated that the continued operation of the country&rsquo;s regional harbours, under the 1946 Act, is not really sustainable into the future and it is a case of trying to handle that.</P>
        <P>The 1996 Act provides for the transfer of regional harbours to local authority control by means of a ministerial order.  In response to a question from Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, that could have been done at any time since 1996.  However, it would not have been done on the stroke of a pen.  The enabling power has been there to transfer any of the harbours to a local authority or to set up a private company, as has been done in several cases.  In any of the cases where it has been done, however, it was not done at the stroke of a pen.  While the legislation may allow it to be done at the stroke of a pen, one has ample consultation with all relevant parties before it is done.  Just because one has the power does not mean one exercises that power willy nilly.  Common sense comes into it, apart from what is contained in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Harbours Act 1996 was subject to a wide-ranging and extensive consultation process.  It is important to note that any transfer made under that Act has been subject to wide-ranging consultation with all the relevant parties and different models have emerged.  Among the harbours that have been transferred, Sligo Harbour is one of those located in a large population centre.  In that case, the commissioners who were in place prior to transfer and a committee of interested parties is still liaising with the county council and has an input on relevant issues.  It was not a case of abolishing a board and not taking its views into account on an ongoing basis.  Different models can emerge from the consultation process whereby local interest groups can agree to have an input, not under the original legislation but as part of whatever is agreed.  That is what the consultation process is all about.  One cannot provide for all that in legislation because different models emerge in different places based on specific circumstances and needs. The 1996 Act also provides for the establishment of a private company in respect of the regional harbours, although that clause has never been utilised anywhere.</P>
        <P>It is true that the Department previously indicated to Bantry Bay commissioners that further consultation would take place between all sides upon completion of the due diligence process by the harbour commissioners.  I listened with interest to the commitments referred to by the Senator and the letters he read out, but it was widely known that all the consultations were due to take place after the due diligence process had been completed.  That process has not <Col N="1110"/>been completed yet, although all parties are doing their best in that regard.  The foreshore issue has been successfully addressed and the due diligence report will be completed very soon.</P>
        <P>The Senator may argue that the consultation process to which I referred was high level stuff related to overall policy, but it was always intended that the specific issues relating to the Bantry transfer, how it would be handled and managed and the processes and procedures that would be adopted to implement the dream into the future, would have to be agreed between the parties.  That is common sense and that remains the position.  All the necessary consultation will take place.</P>
        <P>This Bill simply includes an additional enabling provision to add to the other enabling provision in the 1996 Act that could have been used any time in the past 12 years.  Bantry Bay could have been transferred to the local authority, although not at the stroke of a pen, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan suggested.  Some harbours have been transferred to local authority control under the 1996 Act.</P>
        <P>The position is that when the due diligence report is completed the consultation process will begin.  It is wrong to suggest that there has been no contact between the Bantry Bay Harbour commissioners and the Department.  Meetings take place on an ongoing basis to deal with various matters, including day-to-day issues such as the remedial works and so forth.  Formal discussion and consultation has not taken place because the due diligence report has not been finalised.  However, all the consultation required is bound to take place.</P>
        <P>To return to the amendment, it is a case of Senators either accepting that this is the way things are and that common sense dictates that consultation will take place or formalising it in the Bill.  If the Senators wish to formalise the process in the Bill, I am prepared to consider that.  I would have to examine the wording and speak to the Parliamentary Counsel on the issue, but if Senators want the process to be formalised, we can consider that.  Consultations were always going to happen.  I have not been there for the history of 50 years of trust or mistrust and must accept what others say in that regard.  However, if Senators want the process to be formalised, I am prepared to look at that in principle.  The amendment proposes to lay down in legislation that there be a formal consultation process prior to any transfer, whether it be to the local authority or the port of Cork.  In such a formal process, everybody can have their say, including Whiddy Islanders, fishermen, inland fisheries representatives, town commissioners, county councillors and so forth.  Everyone can have an input, whether through formal submissions or round table discussions.  I am prepared to accept the principle of the amendment tabled and to revert to Senators at a later date on the matter.</P>
        <P>I stress again that the necessary consultation would always have taken place.  Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and McCarthy spoke about the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the people of the Bantry Bay area.  We would all like to see those dreams materialise but it is a question of how we help areas such as Bantry to realise their full potential.  We must determine how best to give a small harbour board, like the one in Bantry, the management expertise to develop the facility.</P>
        <P>There has been no back-tracking and no withdrawal of a commitment given.  Senators referred to other harbours in the same area, including Baltimore and Kinsale.  It is proposed that they too will eventually be transferred to the local authority after local consultations.  A number of other harbours will also be transferred.  I signed an order a number of weeks ago for Moy Harbour near Ballina to be transferred to the control of the local authority.  There was ample consultation involving different interest groups, some of which are bigger than others.  This happened with several groups and the transfer process is ongoing.  It applies whether harbours deal with a level of commercial freight such as the harbours at Bantry and <Col N="1111"/>Fenit.  The suggestion in the policy document was to transfer control of the harbours to a port company.  Another suggestion was to put them under the aegis of the local authority.  There will be no lack of consultation.  All commitments given relating to consultation would have been realised after due diligence was carried out.  This legislation serves to add another option or enabling provision, which is merely another choice.  The proposed change could happen subject to other types of consultation, but it adds to the option that has been in place since 1996.  There is nothing bigger or stronger than that and all consultation would take place anyway.</P>
        <P>I revert to the amendment under discussion.  I accept the principle that the consultation process should be specified in legislation and am prepared to return next time with an amendment to take account of it.  However, consultation would always have taken place and would always have been sufficient.  No one can foresee how many different groups will have an interest in a given matter.  I have heard it suggested that different groups may seek the option to make a submission, but I cannot force people to do so or to raise the matter.  I am aware of the suggestions made and it seems right and proper that the opportunity is provided to any of those local groups who seek to make a submission, which would have happened.  It happened in cases where other harbours transferred to the local authority without consultation having a statutory basis.  The amendment specifies a statutory basis for consultation and I am prepared to examine this and revert to the House.  I am not against the idea in principle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, and I am glad of his response.  However, it is like the tale, <i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</i>.  Eventually people are asleep when the wolf comes and then the sheep are gone.  The Minister of State referred in his response to the 1999 report, A Review of State Regional Ports and Harbours, also known as the KPMG report.  There was another report, namely, the Baxter Eadie study, which specifically mentions the harbours at Cork and Bantry.  I do not doubt these reports were produced.  The Minister of State maintains these reports refer to maximising the potential of Bantry.  I do not doubt the veracity of his comments on consultation.</P>
        <P>I do not mean to be jocose but let us consider a sporting phenomenon, for example, the County Carlow hurling team.  It aspires to win the All-Ireland hurling final, but the reality is different.  This is why I refer to the matter of consultation.  This has been ongoing for 40 years and nothing has happened.  I do not care who was in Government, whether it was Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party or whoever.</P>
        <P>Before his assassination, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of his dream.  Perhaps, the President-elect of the USA will now realise that dream.  There has been a dream in Bantry for 40 years.  We suffered devastating commercial, financial and human loss following the disaster in 1979.  Everyone came together and agreed what would be done.  Two changes were requested <i>ad nauseam</i> in Bantry, namely, the extension of the pier and dredging, neither of which happened.  The Minister of State asks us to accept another layer of enabling bureaucracy.  I do not trust any enabling legislation, and I have historical reasons for this position.  When the Whiddy Island disaster occurred, a first cousin of mine and two of my school classmates died in the tragedy.  Two family members were working that night and I went in the middle of the night to see if they were okay.  We can never forget those events.  People fled from the island.  The commercial devastation, the loss of jobs and the pall that hung over Bantry and the surrounding area for days, weeks and months afterward was appalling.</P>
        <P>There followed the famous package, which is the reason I refer to the matter of consultation.  The former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Dick Spring, and several others arrived in the West Lodge Hotel, Bantry, in 1985, or perhaps 1986.  The Bantry package, including money provided to Bantry, was announced.  Some of it was allocated to sports and other matters that had nothing to do with the people in Bantry, especially those who lost their jobs such as the tug men, the fisher<Col N="1112"/>men, and the local 70 or 80 men with families to support.  What did they get from the package?  This is why I refer to the lack of consultation.  Earlier, I referred to commitments to spend &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million.  Two simple measures were promised for Bantry &mdash; I attended the press conference in 1986 &mdash; and I am not having a cut at Mr. Dick Spring as that was the political decision on the matter and he was in Government at the time.  I praised the former Deputy, Mr. Peter Barry, for his efforts.  However, those commitments were not honoured.</P>
        <P>There may be a consultation process, but Cork County Council wants nothing to do with us because there is a plan to extend the pier, so that a person from Whiddy Island with access rights to access the town can travel in all tides.  There have been several tragedies in the inner harbour.  People close to my heart were lost there.  We set up an inshore rescue boat with local fund-raising and with little help from the Government or other sources.  One man&rsquo;s boat capsized, he swam many hours and, unfortunately, could not climb the wall.  I could name 20 young men who were lost at Whiddy Island.  These were tragedies.  However, I can see those remaining on the island still go to mass on Sunday morning or come and go from the town.  I know of one man born there and he was so in love with the island that he returned there with his young children.  They are great little hurlers.  Mr. Mark Foley trains the young lads in Bantry.  They play sports and must come and go several times each week.  However, at certain times, depending on the tides, they cannot land at the pier.  I will read the whole report from Mr. Justice Declan Costello, maybe not today put perhaps the next time.  This paper in my hands is only an extract from it.  The report runs to 400 pages with comments on Bantry, Whiddy Island and so on.</P>
        <P>I do not trust the assertion that this is enabling legislation and that there will be consultation after the event.  I maintain consultation should take place now.  Why was there not consultation previously?  If the messages and the yearnings of the people of Bantry and the surrounding area was listened to back in the 1980s, the pier could have been upgraded and the dredging carried out for possibly less than &pound;1 million.</P>
        <P>I arranged for Ministers to visit the area and examine the situation, including the former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. John Wilson, God be good to him.  Hydrographic surveys were carried out.  We have so many reports and surveys at this stage that I could fill a double axle wheelbarrow with them all and not be able to get into the House.  I have in my hands only a synopsis of one but I have several with me.  It might be only a small one but wait until I start reading it into the record.  These are all related to the Bill and the report.  I do not doubt the veracity of the Minister of State but this matter must be revisited apart from any commitment to consultation.</P>
        <P>Why must we go down this road?  Why not leave well enough alone?  What is happening at departmental and governmental level with regard to Bantry is such that for the first time in my political and actual lifetime, we are making progress.  We have plans that can be realised.  If the situation is not broken, then why fix it?  No one on Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners or the town council is asking the Minister for Transport to proceed with the enabling legislation.  When the enabling legislation is in force, we will consult.  Let us say that the consultations with the fishermen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If that is the pressure being put on me, I have another way out of it by calling a vote and then taking a stance.  However, I gave a commitment yesterday that I would not do that today.  The Minister of State should not tempt fate because I feel very strongly about this.  I will not be silenced, a Chathaoirligh, with all due respect.  I am responding to the points made by the Minister of State, with which I do not agree.  I do not doubt his sincerity.</P>
        <P>Why did the Government not wait to publish this Bill until the due diligence report was complete?  I believe the report has virtually been completed anyway.  Part of the delay in the report was due to work done in good faith.  If the Bantry Harbour commissioners wanted to be flippant and refuse to get involved, they could have done so, but they still got involved.  The situation regarding the foreshore rights was held up due to legal reasons.  That registration of title is now complete and has been communicated to the Department.  The Port of Cork Company is aware of this.  We are now discussing the issue of due diligence, whereas I had only spoken of the consultation issue, so I am not repeating myself.  The due diligence report was raised by the Minister of State.  If due diligence is pivotal to section 7 of the Bill and to the purpose of forcing Bantry into a marriage of convenience with the Port of Cork Company, let us talk about it now.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are being blamed for the delay of due diligence, but why should we not let the process take place?  If we are that close to its completion, we should look at what it will deliver.  The due diligence report is an engagement between the Port of Cork Company and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners to find some common ground on certain issues.  We are not at war with the Port of Cork Company.  We do not want to go to war with the Minister of State or the Department.  I can quote monetary commitments that were given to Bantry that were not honoured, for whatever reason.  I have no problem with due diligence, but this Bill should not take priority before the due diligence report is complete.  That is wrong.  Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were asked three years ago to go ahead with due diligence, and that is more or less complete.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy read out a letter of 9 May 2007.  The final paragraph states: &ldquo;An early meeting between the Commissioners and the Department would facilitate the process, and we would be happy to arrange such a meeting.&rdquo;  However, I have been told that such a meeting did not take place.  Yet we are being asked to trust a Department when in my lifetime we have only seen neglect in the inner harbour of Bantry.  The dredging of the inner harbour and the extension of the pier are very important.  Bantry has no potential without either of those developments, even though the Minister of State spoke about maximising the harbour&rsquo;s potential.  Neither of these developments has been dealt with in the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
        <P>The letter I read out referred to Mr. Bill O&rsquo;Donnell and his dream, but sometimes dreams must become a reality.  We have been fobbed off too many times about commitments and reports.  Some of the reports date from the 1980s or early 1990s, when the board in Bantry had no teeth.  If the board in Bantry can be taken over by the stroke of a pen, I must speak on this issue.  The Minister of State spoke about consultation after the Bill is passed and said that he might give a commitment that something will happen.  What if the consultation is not to the liking of one party or the other?  It is incumbent on the Minister to make a decision, whether we like it.</P><Col N="1114"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>If due diligence was that important, why is section 18 of the Bill not excluded?  It could be brought in again.  The positions of the commissioners in Bantry are up for review in October 2009.  The next review will be five years later.  Why do we not let things stand until 2014 and let us work through what has started in Bantry?  I know the public is sceptical about the whole thing.</P>
        <P>I would like to read into the record a couple of paragraphs of the Costello report.  Judge Costello was an eminent judge who compiled a report of the Whiddy Island disaster in 1979.  In his report, he referred to what went on at the harbour board.  To ignore the Costello report would be to ignore one of the finest reports arising from a tribunal set up by the Oireachtas.  There were two tribunals of inquiry that justified their status.  One of them was the report on the Whiddy disaster, while the other was the report on the Stardust tragedy, in which there was major loss of life.  The introduction to the Costello report states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Resolutions passed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas directed this tribunal to make &ldquo;such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Tribunal is conscious that a number of the recommendations which follow are not within the competence of the Irish Government or Parliament to implement.  Their implementation would depend on action taken by authorities in other states. There are, however, a number of international organisations which are concerned specifically with tanker safety and safety at oil terminals, such as IMCO, the International Chamber of Shipping, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum and the International Association of Classification Societies.  It is recommended that, if these recommendations are found to be acceptable by the Government, it should invite the appropriate international organisation to consider them with a view to assisting in their implementation.  [That is because 50 lives were lost.]</P>
       <P LI="1" el="0">Assistance might also be sought from the appropriate institutions of the European Economic Community.  Some of the recommendations which follow, if found to be acceptable, can be implemented by means of regulations under the Dangerous Substances Act 1972.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It was submitted by counsel instructed on behalf of the Attorney General [on behalf of this State at that time] that the adequacy or otherwise of the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations 1979, did not form part of the considerations of the inquiry being undertaken by the tribunal because the resolutions passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas referred to the establishment of a tribunal which would inquire, <i>inter alia</i>, into &ldquo;measures, and their adequacy, taken on or before the 8th January, 1979&rdquo;.  As the 1979 regulations came into force after that date it was submitted that their &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; could not be considered by the tribunal.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The tribunal considers that as it can make any recommendations which it thinks fit having regard to its findings, it has power to make recommendations on means of strengthening the statutory control and supervision of oil terminals, even if such recommendations will involve the amendment and extension of the 1979 regulations.  The tribunal did not understand counsel for the Attorney General to submit otherwise.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is just the preamble, but there is a lot more.  The Costello report compelled the then Government to act on Bantry Harbour because before that it was a free for all.  They set up the original harbour which is now subject to being disbanded.  I referred earlier to access to Whiddy Island in the event of a fire.  It is currently under the control of the harbour board in Bantry.</P><Col N="1115"/>
        <P>Sub-paragraph 37 of chapter 23 of the Costello report states: &ldquo;For the purposes of fighting fire, Whiddy Island when, or if, re-opened [it has reopened, but was closed for many years after the disaster] as an oil terminal [which it is] should be completely self-sufficient, with a back-up from the mainland only for medical treatment of injuries.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;with a back-up from the mainland&rdquo; is not adequate because of the onshore facilities.  Sub-paragraph 43 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Regular inspections of oil terminals, at least on an annual basis, should be carried out by the responsible State authority.  [I am not sure if that is the Department].  Inspectors and surveyors should be properly experienced and trained.  As appears in the next paragraph they should be supplemented by outside expert consultants.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is critical, as the most important facility in Bantry Bay is the oil terminal.  This is a report by an eminent judge of a tribunal established by the Oireachtas in 1979.</P>
        <P>Sub-paragraph 44 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The present situation in law is that responsibility for supervising and inspecting different aspects of the safety of oil jetties is vested in different State authorities, namely, harbour authorities, fire brigade authorities, planning authorities and Government Departments. [It was all over the shop].  This division of responsibility can easily lead to confusion &mdash; a point that was alluded to in a closing submission made to the tribunal.  The present situation is an undesirable one and could lead to inadequate standards of inspection.  The tribunal considers that a single State authority should be responsible for licensing oil jetties throughout the country, and that this single authority should likewise be responsible for the regular inspection of all oil jetties.  It is recommended that the single State authority be a Government Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I accept that much progress has been made since then, but it is still a foundation stone.  The Costello report on the disaster of 8 January 1979 continues, in sub-paragraph 44, as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">This recommendation is made not merely to avoid the possible confusion that can arise under a system of divided responsibility.  [I am worried that the responsibilities are still somewhat divided]. To ensure that proper standards of safety are maintained, experts in different specialties (such as explosive substances, electrical engineering, and tanker operations) must be employed to carry out regular inspections.  Harbour authorities and other local authorities would not have such experts in their regular employment and would have to employ outside consultants if they had legal responsibility for regular surveys of jetties in their functional areas.  This could result in different standards being employed in different parts of the country &mdash; an eventuality which could be avoided if a single Government Department was responsible for inspecting all aspects of all jetties throughout the country.  A centralised system would have the further advantage in that it would, in time, build up a body of expertise, a development which would undoubtedly help in maintaining high standards of inspection.  It should be recognised that highly specialist knowledge and experience is required to ensure the maintenance of proper standards of safety, and outside consultants should be employed by the responsible Government Department both in the preparation and up-dating of statutory regulations and in specialist aspects of the Department&rsquo;s supervisory functions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister of State might confirm that in his reply, although I acknowledge that a lot has happened since then.  Sub-paragraph 45 of the Costello report states: &ldquo;Legislation should be enacted to change the present anomalous situation under which planning authorities and fire brigade authorities have no jurisdiction over oil jetties if they are situated in the sea beyond <Col N="1116"/>the low water mark.&rdquo;  There is a lot more in the Costello report, but I do not have time to go into it today.  In essence, however, Judge Costello said one of the main reasons for the 1979 disaster was a lack of coherence and responsibility as regards what happened in Bantry.</P>
        <P>Arising from that report, the Bantry Harbour Board was set up under the old 1946 Act, but what has moved on since then?  The 30th anniversary of the tragedy will be marked on 8 January 2009.  We may talk about due diligence and consultation but, as of today, the onshore facilities at Bantry Harbour have not moved on.  People may criticise me on that, but as somebody who lives there, I am afraid that if there were another such disaster, while we may be more professional and advanced in technology, the necessary infrastructure to take a fire tender or ambulance there is still lacking.  The Act states that such facilities should be on the island, but there is more to Whiddy Island than the terminal.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may say that has nothing to do with this section of the Bill, but he referred to the potential of Bantry.  That has been talked about for 40 years, yet I am not satisfied that this Bill will advance that potential in any way.  I respect the Minister of State&rsquo;s view that we will examine the area of consultation, but I may have to revert to this matter again.  My simple argument is that the consultation should have occurred by now.  There have been numerous reports in the past ten years, but more could have been achieved by proper consultation between Bantry Harbour Board, Cork County Council and the Cork Port Authority.  Such a meeting could have thrashed out matters and subsequently set down due diligence prior to the introduction of this Bill.  We could then see some realism in it, but as of now it is like saying a novena to St. Jude, the patron saint of hopeless cases.  We might get there some day, but I will probably be in my grave.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I compliment Senator O&rsquo;Donovan on his contributions to date, which reveal his obvious passion for this subject.  I would like to explore further what the Minister of State said in his response.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan with regard to due diligence, to which the Minister of State referred.  It seems the section, if not the entire Bill, could have been postponed for a brief period if the completion of due diligence between Cork Port and the Bantry Harbour Commissioners is so near to completion.  I do not see why it could not have been accommodated.  Be that as it may, the Minister of State in his reply said he was prepared to insert the consultation process formally into the text of the Bill.  I ask for a direct answer from him to know if I am correct in this assumption and that he intends submitting amendments on Report Stage to that effect.  If this is the case, I would be more than happy to withdraw the amendment at this stage if he proposes to bring forward alternative Government amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate there was always going to be consultation, as has been the case with other harbours which have transferred to local authorities.  Any of the commitments given previously would have been confirmed but in line with the idea behind the amendment, I hope to table amendments on Report Stage.  I will need to consult the Parliamentary Counsel but it is my intention to table an amendment which will give legislative back-up to a consultation process.  I accept the principle of the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion.</P>
        <P>I do not believe we should be too prescriptive about these matters after that.  There has been ample consultation in the case of the other harbours which have transferred to local authorities and everybody with a view has had ample opportunity to express those views and to come to some agreement.  For instance, Sligo has an advisory group in place which is more or less the old harbour commissioners and that role is still being fulfilled in a different way.  I will bring <Col N="1117"/>forward an amendment which accepts that principle and which formalises or gives legislative weight to a consultation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take what the Minister of State says in good faith.  We are talking about a horse of a different colour.  The Department&rsquo;s ports policy statement was published in 2005.  The harbours listed are: Annagassan Harbour, Arklow Harbour, Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour, Kinsale Harbour, the River Moy Harbour, to which the Minister of State referred and which is under way, Sligo Harbour, Westport Harbour, Wexford Harbour, Youghal, Kilrush, Tralee and Fenit and Bantry.  I cannot say for definite that all of these harbours are in the same situation but subject to correction, I believe that the Kinsale Harbour Commissioners &mdash; perhaps not all the members &mdash; and Baltimore are, by and large, accepting their fate that they will be taken over by Cork County Council.  They are not being totally isolated because they will have representation.  The Kinsale area is represented by a number of councillors from all parties, as are the Skibbereen and Baltimore areas.</P>
        <P>However, Bantry is different in many respects because Bantry Harbour is unique.  I may have been wrong at the time but a vote was taken a few years ago and I was one of three who suggested that we should consider exploring the possibilities with Cork County Council.  I cannot speak for Fenit in that regard but I know there were historic issues with Sligo to do with relocation and there was a lot of consultation.  I do not see any other Member from Sligo or from other areas coming in to this House with the same agenda that I have with regard to consultation because Bantry is unique.</P>
        <P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, we are putting the cart before the horse.  I am fairly satisfied that with regard to the harbours I listed, there is probably a desire on the part of the local ports to say they are currently in limbo.  I know there is frustration in Baltimore and some frustration in Kinsale and, therefore, under Cork County Council they would find a home where they could move forward together because sometimes these ports are somewhat isolated.  Bantry is unique because of its set-up and because of the business we transact.  Bantry Harbour and Bantry Bay cannot be compared with any other location in Ireland.  We are the second finest bay &mdash; not fjord &mdash; in the world.  The other one is in South America.  One cannot put the River Moy Harbour and Baltimore in the same category.</P>
        <P>I again implore the Minister of State to stand back from this precipice.  He is talking about consultation but I would prefer to have the consultation first and postpone the legislation or this aspect of the legislation affecting Bantry.  I am not speaking for the other ports.  I am making a specific case for Bantry.  I have grave reservations and doubts that consultation, which I consider to be after the event, will be effective.</P>
        <P>Nobody knows more than me the intricacies within Bantry.  Whoever is responsible in future will encounter it.  When proposals were put forward to extend Bantry pier and to carry out dredging, there were issues concerning inshore fishermen.  They have traditional historic rights going back for 300 years to mend their nets on certain parts of the quays and these were respected by the courts.  These rights cannot be ignored.  All we need is one guy to come along and say he mends his nets at a certain place once a year. These rights are unique to Bantry.</P>
        <P>I may not have made this point earlier about the complexities of the inner harbour in Bantry where many of the moorings are controlled by the harbour master and these are for small yachts and pleasure boats.  He will probably kill me for saying this but it is controlled in a higgedly piggedly fashion because one just puts down an anchor to moor.  There are so many wheels within wheels in regard to Bantry and the inner harbour that, with all due respect, it cannot be compared with places like the River Moy Harbour and other harbours.  I am subject <Col N="1118"/>to correction but in many of these cases they are so isolated that they would probably be glad to come under the umbrella of the local authority.  Bantry should be given unique attention because it is unique.  It has its difficulties as well as its salient features.  It has its adversities as well as its assets of geographic location and other tangible assets.  When we come back on Report Stage, the Minister of State might, subject to consultation with the draftsmen, consider what will become, in the short to medium term, of the railway pier, the dredging, the extension to the existing pier owned by Cork County Council, support for the mussel industry and the ongoing support for Whiddy Island?</P>
        <P>I will not list the other harbours on the list but Bantry Bay is in many ways unique and, while it is beautiful, its situation is complex.  I am seriously concerned.  When will due diligence be complete?  I thought it was complete and would like to know from the Minister of State whether it will be complete before January.  I would have been happier if this had been done first and if the consultation with the various groups had happened before now.  Certainty should be given so we know if the date for the hand-over to Cork Port or Cork County Council is 2010, 2015 or 2017, if it is to occur.  There is much uncertainty.  I am speaking for the people I represent, who are deeply concerned that I make my viewpoint known.</P>
        <P>There are a number of issues I still want to address in detail.  I compliment the Minister and the Department.  The slipway on Whiddy Island has been completed, which should have been done years ago and was one of the recommendations in the Costello report.  This might be hard on the Minister but I compliment him on that completion.  If I am correct &mdash; the Minister of State might address this point &mdash; the contract for the corresponding slipway on the mainland at the abbey is due to be signed shortly.  This would ease my mind greatly with regard to access to and from Whiddy in the event of an oil industry disaster and it would also allow a farmer to take off a lorry load of sheep or cattle, which would be another important feature.  The Department has been working closely with the harbour board in progressing these issues, which is a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>Reference is made to the future of Bantry, on which there is an issue I cannot ignore.  When the debate resumes the Minister of State might confirm where is the &euro;1.9 million which was committed in 2000 and recommitted in May 2002.  I do not want to blame the Minister of State and I want to be fair in my comments.  The funding was committed in good faith at that time and this commitment was received with great aplomb.  However, the necessary planning was apparently not in place and the harbour board, against my judgment at the time, went off on a different tangent and decided to build another pier out from the railway pier, which has since been abandoned.</P>
        <P>These moneys have been discussed.  Perhaps we could get commitments that the pier extension and the dredging will be progressed one way or other.  While I do not want an answer today, perhaps the Minister of State will confirm that the &euro;3 million allocated by the then Minister for Finance in May 2002 is in place and is being progressed.  Will he explain in whose control is the foreshore on Whiddy Island?  What will become of the railway pier?  Will it be used as part of the process of dredging whereby it and its surrounding area will be affected?  I am deeply concerned about these issues.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, wishes to address this amendment and, as the adjournment of the debate is drawing nigh, I will allow him in.  However, with all due respect, this issue needs more than revisiting.  I want it put back until due diligence is complete.  Let those aspects be dealt with first and this area could possibly then be revisited.</P><Col N="1119"/>
        <P>The burnt child dreads the fire and the people of Bantry have been burned so many times, although I am not suggesting it is the Minister of State&rsquo;s fault.  I could write a book.  I am passionate about this because my father and forefathers fished in Bantry Bay going back to the times before the Famine.  Close associates of mine were lost in the bay, whether fishing or in other ways.  For 40 years others in different parties, and I in my 25 years in public life, have failed, so it is difficult to say &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; because the horse will be a bag of bones by the time we get the grass.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am slow to intervene because it is clear Senator O&rsquo;Donovan will have a great deal more to say on this in the coming days and possibly weeks.  I want to refer to the situation in Fenit for fear that our silence in that respect indicates that we are happy in Kerry.  I share the views of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan in all he has said in regard to Bantry, particularly with regard to prior consultation.  Neither of the two ports that it is envisaged will merge, Fenit Port and Shannon-Foynes Port, the board of which I was director for 16 years, asked for this marriage and neither welcomes it.  I was contacted as late as two hours ago by the chairman and directors of the board of Fenit Port, whom we will meet very soon in Leinster House.</P>
        <P>I can speak authoritatively about Shannon-Foynes because I was a director when this proposal was first put to us.  Struggling as we were with very serious difficulties on that port, with which I am sure the Minister of State and his Department will be aware &mdash; matters of a legal and human resources nature &mdash; and at the same time trying to focus on being one of the biggest bulk handling ports in Europe with all the attendant problems, we were aghast to be asked to consider running a port which was entirely different from our operation.</P>
        <P>Shannon-Foynes Port and Fenit Port are in no way homogenous.  The Fenit operation is almost entirely based on fishing or  leisure craft.  There is one niche industrial client, Liebherr Container Cranes of Killarney, which has a long association with Fenit and has a rapport with the directors of the board.  It is more than business, it is personal and almost family.  The Liebherr family have been exceptionally good to Kerry down through the years.  Were the future of the management of Fenit to be brought into question, I would be very surprised if the Liebherr concern did not look to alternative methods of port use, and the business would not fall to Shannon-Foynes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Recent cases concerning delays in the processing of long-term residency permit applications have been brought to my attention.  In one case, a girl from my area has been six years resident in Ireland which allows her to apply for a long-term residency permit.  When she made her application, she was informed it would take two years to process. <Col N="1120"/> It is unacceptable that a person, as in this case, who has given a long-term commitment to the country and has resided in it for the 60 months necessary must then wait a further 24 months before her application is processed.  It is unfair and unjust.</P>
        <P>If the Government wants to be a little more fair, it could allow applicants to apply after three years of residency in order that the application could be processed in a timely manner.  I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the backlog in this area is addressed as soon as possible.  I assume it is down to a lack of manpower in the Department to deal with these applications.  I hope whatever changes to staffing arrangements are needed will be made.</P>
        <P>Those who have made the application legitimately and meet the criteria as laid down by the Department should have their applications for long-term residency permits dealt with in a speedy manner.  After asking people to put their lives on hold for five years and be resident in the country in order to be eligible for a residency permit, it is unfair to ask them to do so for a further two years while their applications are being processed.  This is disgraceful.  It appears to come down to just the matter of resources.  While I accept resources are scarce at this time, we are dealing with people&rsquo;s lives, not just the applicants but their friends, loved ones and families.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, inform the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the frustrations I, and many people in the process, are experiencing with the administrative backlog?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is otherwise occupied.</P>
        <P>The current long-term residence scheme operates on an administrative basis.  However, one of the most important proposals in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 is the introduction of a new, enhanced and statutory long-term resident status.  This status will be available to those who have completed at least five years satisfactory residence in the State and can meet certain conditions.  These include the requirement the foreign national be of good character, tax compliant, can demonstrate a reasonable competence in the Irish or English language, has made reasonable efforts to integrate and has been supporting him or herself and any dependants without recourse to publicly-funded services.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides a mechanism for a fast track to long-term residence in certain circumstances.  It is intended green card holders will be able to apply for long-term residence after two years, by any standards a very generous approach.  Long-term resident status will confer rights that approach those of Irish nationals and bring with it access, for the foreign national and his or her qualifying dependants, to the employment market and State-funded services and benefits.  The benefits enjoyed by holders of this status are an acknowledgement that, over time, those who migrate to Ireland contribute increasingly to society and to the economy and have earned this status and the stability it brings.</P>
        <P>Long-term residency, as an administrative scheme, was introduced in May 2004.  It is focused on persons who have been legally resident in the State for more than five years on the basis of work permit, work authorisation or work visa conditions.  Such persons may apply to the immigration division of the Department for a five-year residency extension.  In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for more than five years, may also apply for long-term residency.  However, this long-term permission does not grant an exemption <Col N="1121"/>from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long-term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long-term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure his or her permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  During processing, each application is examined to verify the applicant meets the residency criteria.  Should an applicant meet this criteria, a character reference check is then carried out with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ascertain if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There also may be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.</P>
        <P>The applications received by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service are diverse in nature.  Processing times vary considerably according to the nature and circumstances of the scheme in question.  In all instances, processing arrangements are kept under ongoing review and steps are taken to reduce waiting times where this is feasible, having regard to available resources and overall priorities.  I understand the Department is currently processing applications received in January 2007.  This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in recent years.</P>
        <P>INIS has allocated some additional resources to the processing of applications for long-term residency and, having regard to the many demands on the service, will keep the resource allocation under review.  INIS has taken this step with a view to providing an improved customer service to applicants for long-term residency and, incrementally, an improvement in processing times.  I am advised that there are no plans to offer an amnesty to existing applicants for long-term residency.</P>
        <P>I understand from cases in my own constituency that there are delays such as this.  Yet the number of staff in the Department has probably increased significantly in recent years.  Many of them are working on asylum-related cases and perhaps when one section is less busy than another some people might be moved across.  Some applicants might end up not qualifying because their initial years here were as students or they did not have qualifying years here.  It can be frustrating.  It is not a simple process; there is a lot of paperwork involved and it takes time and resources.  I presume the Deputy has raised the particular case with the Department directly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific case, yes.  I thank the Minister of State for his response, which does not contain much by way of good news for me.  In the specific instance to which I refer the person has waited for more than five years and is now being told the application will take at least two more years to process, which is unacceptable in this day and age.  That is why I raised the issue on the Adjournment.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s last sentence.  I raised the idea of an amnesty for people in the system who meet the criteria.  It is my understanding that the previous Minister was actively considering the idea of an amnesty for people who qualified.  Obviously it would not work across the board but there could be an amnesty for people who met the criteria.  The current Minister seems to have rejected the notion of an amnesty, based on what the Minister of State has said here.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would bring my concerns to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, and thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter regarding the budget cuts that will affect Protestant schools.  As the Minister of State knows, many of our Protestant secondary schools are rural voluntary schools.  I am talking about schools such as Bandon Grammar School and Midleton College in Cork.  These have been specifically targeted by the mid-year withdrawal of the support services grant, which amounts to a smash-and-grab raid on our schools and their resources.  Twenty-one schools are affected nationally by this cut of about &euro;2.8 million, which is not an major amount in the overall budget of the Department.</P>
        <P>When free education was introduced in 1968, the Government agreed that schools such as those I mentioned would not be included in the free scheme.  This special grant was in recognition of the fact that we as a State could not provide an appropriate education for people of the Protestant faith, particularly as these children were few in number and the Protestant community was dispersed.  It is important that we allow all children to be educated under an ethos of their choosing.  This sum of &euro;2.8 million annually is not a major amount in the overall scheme.  Many of the schools are fee-paying and the grant is used as a step-up support grant to families who in some cases are unable to pay.</P>
        <P>We are at a crossroads with these schools.  Many of them will close.  What will be the response of the State in this case?  Will the State provide funding for schools under Protestant management such as those in Bandon and Midleton?  The imposition of this cut was done without consultation, which is a regressive move.  We are talking about a minority grouping of people with a distinct faith who are part of our State and who have a right to be educated in their own denomination.  We need to take cognisance of that.  This move also has implications for those who cannot afford to pay fees.  What happens to them?  Cuts in the budget have affected people across the board.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister in his reply to take note of what I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for giving me some of his time to address this subject.  It is a sensitive but important subject because it says a lot about the attitude of the State towards its minorities.  I have had several representations from Protestant schools and schools with a Protestant ethos which are dumbstruck that the Minister would go to such trouble to retrieve &euro;2.8 million, despite the difficulty it will cause to so many families.</P>
        <P>The grant, as Senator Buttimer said, was a demonstration of the liberal tolerance of former Deputy Donogh O&rsquo;Malley when he gave out, initially, two sets of grants to Protestant schools 40 years ago.  The special services support grant, which the Minister has cut, amounts to only &euro;2.8 million but its withdrawal will have a dramatic effect on certain Protestant schools.  The <Col N="1123"/>effects are likely to be that, at the very least, one teacher will be lost in each of these schools in order to save money and, second, that fees will increase.  The result of an increase in fees in schools such as these will be that certain parents of Protestant backgrounds will not be able to send their children to the schools of their choice.  I am in favour of parents being able to educate their children together if that is what they want, or sending their children to Protestant schools, Roman Catholic schools or whatever they like.  However, the withdrawal of this grant says the State no longer fosters that liberal ethos.  It says that people should no longer be allowed to make that choice but that the State will in effect, by limiting the finances available, dictate to parents where their children go to school, and that the choice of ethos, whether it is Roman Catholic, Protestant, or any other, will be made by the State rather than by the parents.</P>
        <P>It is important not just in terms of the &euro;2.8 million &mdash; which is important to certain parents as it will force their hands if it is withdrawn &mdash; and not just in terms of education, but in terms of the ethos of people who want to pursue a particular minority way of life.  This is not a denominational matter.  It is a matter of the State&rsquo;s taking a liberal attitude and the Minister deciding that the &euro;2.8 million remains the way it was.  I heard the excuses being given in the debate in the D&aacute;il, and the weakest of all was that the Attorney General had given some sort of advice that this is discriminatory.  How in the name of God was this only mentioned at the time of the budget?  If it is discriminatory now in favour of a minority religion, it has been discriminatory for 40 years.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to be given the opportunity to clarify for the House the position with regard to the withdrawal of certain grants from Protestant fee-paying schools.</P>
        <P>The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, acknowledges the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging international economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources.</P>
        <P>With regard to the removal of certain support services grants received by Protestant fee-charging schools, the Minister wishes to re-emphasise that the Protestant block grant remains in place.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, this grant which amounts to &euro;6.25 million in the current school year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  It is distributed by the secondary education committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority, which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil need.  The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance the Government continues to attach to ensuring students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.</P>
        <P>In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Mr. Donagh O&rsquo;Malley.  At the time, it was the payment of the block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from those Catholic schools that chose to continue to charge fees.  It is estimated that savings of &euro;2.8 million will accrue to the Department as a result of the withdrawal of support services grants from Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.  It is <Col N="1124"/>important to note that the purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  Rather, they covered a range of support services.</P>
        <P>The Minister has had to take decisions on a number of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant block grant remaining in place, the Minister can see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, especially given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question at all.  Once again, I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is totally unsatisfactory.  He is giving no credence to this special ethos.  Will he ask the Minister for Education and Science what are the economic benefits of this &euro;2.8 million saving.  Economies of scale must enter the equation, particularly as some Protestant schools are very small and other schools are much larger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to address the Senator&rsquo;s question.  The Minister answered oral parliamentary questions on the matter in the D&aacute;il this week.  He said there is a constitutional issue and he is setting up a meeting with the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but it is disappointing.  In meeting the Archbishop, would the Minister of State also include Bishop Colton of Cork?  What happens to those who cannot afford to pay fees?  What happens if a school loses a teacher?  Will the State provide education?  That has not been addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will forward the additional questions to the Minister.  I am sure there will be further debate on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn on the Order of Business raised the matter of sharing time on this matter.  If he comes in, I will share time with him.</P>
        <P>This issue is the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment to make a statement on the campaign of the National Employment Rights Authority to review the pay and conditions records of employees in the restaurants sector.  This issue, which has arisen suddenly and is affecting small businesses greatly, is as a result of the agreement between the social partners and, I assume, the National Employment Rights Authority which was set up to protect the rights of employees.  While that is a laudable objective, the authority has taken unto itself certain powers, which it is entitled to do, and is exercising them in a manner which is suppressing and damaging small businesses, one of the most obvious examples being O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Sandwiches.  There is an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>  today which addresses this problem.  While the decision of the NERA to travel the country at random, audit small businesses and see how their employees are treated may be well intentioned, it has had the effect of putting one or two businesses out of action and is causing great difficulty to others which are threatening to close shortly.</P>
        <P>The problem is that two separate and anomalous employment rights orders were issued under the Act by the joint labour committee system.  One applies to Dublin and the other applies to areas outside Dublin.  They state specifically that employers must pay one and one third of the wage rate in Dublin, and double outside Dublin on Sundays.  That is strange.  It would be very nice if everyone could get double pay on Sundays and there is nothing wrong with that as an aspiration.  When businesses are compelled by law to pay double pay and are <Col N="1125"/>unable to do so, however, they will collapse.  The result will be that employees will be laid off.  That has happened in at least one case of O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s and will happen in others.</P>
         <P>What struck me as strange is that if this is a social partnership issue, under the employment rights order there is no clause for inability to pay.  There usually is, even if it may not be used to great effect or may have been used disingenuously in the past.  If employers cannot make a profit because they must pay double to their employees on Sundays, why can they not plead inability to pay?  Several employers have told me their employees are happy to be paid the same rate as on weekdays, but this is not permitted under this order.  Both parties are in an unsatisfactory situation.  The employer must close their business and the employee is out of a job.  That is a real danger.</P>
      <P>Sunday trading is becoming a normal part of activity in this country, as it is in the United States, the UK and Europe.  The idea that employers should have to pay double rates for Sunday trading is outdated.  If a business wishes to open and employ people and the employees wish, as is the case in O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s, to work for those rates, it is reasonable.  The Minister of State will have seen, as we all will have, the appalling unemployment figures yesterday.  It is illogical that there are willing employers and employees and yet businesses are closing down.</P>
     
        <P>I ask the Minister to take action to ensure the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority do not have the effect of closing businesses whose employees are treated well, by agreement, and where bona fide employees and employers are unable to participate in a mutually profitable joint venture.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue, which has been raised by Deputies and Senators in both Houses.  It is an issue that is causing disquiet among employers and employees who have found it difficult to retain jobs because of the downturn.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The T&aacute;naiste and myself are fully aware of the pressures on small businesses in the current economic climate.  It is important that I outline the backdrop against which NERA came about.  It came about because there was exploitation of workers which involved a number of high profile cases in particular, including GAMA and Irish Ferries.  The social partners entered into discussions.  A commitment came out of social partnership that would establish the National Employment Rights Authority.  There is a full chapter in Towards 2016 on the establishment of that authority.</P>
        <P>The authority was set up on an interim basis in 2007.  A labour inspectorate was appointed and recruitment took place.  Many Deputies in the other House consistently highlighted the fact that the Government was not fulfilling its obligations under Towards 2016 to have the 90 labour inspectors appointed by the end of December 2007.  Time has moved on and 81 labour inspectors are in place.  There are language inspectors also to enforce the employment rights.</P>
        <P>I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.  I have met with various representative organisations &mdash; the Irish Hotels Federation, the vintners and others &mdash; who are being affected by enforcement of the regulations orders, which are the law of the land.  While NERA was established to enforce minimum statutory employment rights, it is obligated under its charter to ensure it enforces employment rights.  NERA is not the issue.  The issue is the rates of pay being struck by the joint labour committees, JLCs.</P>
        <P>I have been examining this issue.  There is also a commitment in Towards 2016 to streamline the number of JLCs.  We have one for Dublin-D&uacute;n Laoghaire and one for the rest of the country.  We hope to have an amalgamation of JLCs and to make the process more streamlined <Col N="1126"/>but the rate for Sunday work is time plus one third in Dublin-D&uacute;n Laoghaire and double time in rural areas, and that is creating major difficulty.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that NERA has enforced the rates of pay.  Until then it was obvious that the employees were not receiving double time on Sundays.  Having said that, many people were satisfied with the rate of pay they received on Sundays simply because it was casual work.  It suited people in rural areas to work in small restaurants, pubs providing Sunday lunch, etc.  There is a substantial body of evidence available, not only anecdotal but from Deputies and Senators on all sides of both Houses who raised the issue, of restaurants and pubs no longer serving Sunday lunches because of the enforcement of the employment regulation order.</P>
        <P>There is a view that it is NERA that is causing the difficulties.  I urge Senators and Deputies, when they meet with representative organisations who are highlighting their difficulties in meeting the new pay and conditions that are being enforced, to get them to speak to their members who are on the JLCs.  A JLC is made up primarily of those who represent the employers and the employees, and there is an independent chair.  I urge all to highlight this issue and to speak to the employer representatives.  They may also want to speak to the employee representative because the Senator is right, people are losing their jobs.</P>
        <P>The Senator mentioned the article in <i>The Irish Examiner</i> today.  It was also acknowledged that NERA is only doing its job.  It is obligated to enforce the law of the land.  These are only minimum statutory entitlements.  Nobody would encourage abuse of workers, and that is primarily the reason the NERA was set up in the first place.</P>
        <P>NERA has dramatically increased the number of inspections recently.  I will give the House some statistics to indicate how active it has been in this area.  NERA has been active in implementing its remit as evidenced by the number of inspections undertaken which, at the end of October of this year, stood at 25,155.  The number of inspections in the corresponding period in 2007 was 11,000; it has more than doubled the number of inspections that took place so far in 2008 compared to 2007.</P>
        <P>Of those inspections to date in 2008, breaches were detected in 4,212 cases.  In the same period in 2007, breaches were detected in 2,037 cases.  Statistically and percentage-wise, it is approximately the same as the figure for 2007 to 2008.  To date in 2008, &euro;2.53 million in underpayments of wages due to employees has been recovered by NERA inspection services compared to &euro;2.25 million in the corresponding period in 2007.</P>
        <P>The significant increase in inspection activity in the catering sector in 2008 was a result of NERA&rsquo;s targeted campaign.  It has targeted campaigns in other areas also.  The construction sector was targeted, and rates of pay are struck by registered employment agreements by the JLCs.  Rates of pay for a substantial body of employees are struck by the machinery of social partnership and the industrial relations process.  That has evolved since the Industrial Relations Act 1946.</P>
        <P>I share and fully understand the concerns expressed by Senator Ross.  There are restaurants in my own constituency that no longer serve Sunday lunches.  I assure the Senator they did not make that decision lightly.  Many of the staff involved would have worked with them for a number of years, and no business likes to inform people they no longer can afford to pay the double rate of pay now being enforced by NERA.</P>
        <P>We must try to streamline the JLCs and get their representative bodies to assess the new conditions in the context of the downturn in the economy and the fact that businesses heretofore were not paying the full rate.  There should be some mechanism of reflecting the reality of what is happening in the real world, so to speak.</P><Col N="1127"/>
        <P>This issue has been raised consistently.  It was previously raised in the context of an accusation that the Government reneged on its commitment to appoint the labour inspectors.  Some people are now saying the labour inspectors are too enthusiastic in enforcing the law, but the Senator would not stand over a situation whereby people were being exploited.  The fundamental purpose of NERA is to enforce statutory minimum entitlements of pay and conditions.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to representatives of NERA on many occasions.  I met the chief executive officer, Ger Deering, on a number of occasions.  I have spoken to the staff.  I attended a recent conference of the inspectors and urged them to embrace the idea of enforcement and the spirit of education and information, not only in terms of employees but employers also.  In fairness, NERA has rolled out an education and information programme for employes as well as employees.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns but the JLCs strike the rate which is the law of the land and NERA, like any other statutory body, is obliged to enforce the law as it is part of its charter under Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The compliance Bill, which will give statutory effect to NERA, was published in March.  It is hoped it will come before the D&aacute;il towards the end of this year or early next year.  That will set up NERA on a statutory footing.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.  They have been relayed to the various representative groups on the JLCs.  It is they who will have to discuss and reflect on the new realities in the context of a downturn in the economy and, more importantly, the fact that the rates are now being enforced and employers are obliged to not only pay the new rates but reimburse back pay, which is putting major pressure on some companies.  However, the Senator would not expect me to condone the exploitation of workers or the non-payment of wages to which they are entitled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State about the exploitation of workers and the setting up of the NERA to stop that.  There is no question but that is laudable, but it is somewhat of a red herring in this context.  If the JLCs have it in their power to change the rates, will the Minister of State and the Government bring the same pressure on them to do so as we, as Members of the House, can do because they have far more clout than us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should never underestimate his own clout.  The JLCs are representative of the industry.  I am sure the employers&rsquo; representatives on the JLCs have raised this matter.  I understand it was raised last April and can be raised again within six months.  I urge the representatives on both sides to come together and reflect on the difficulties being experienced by businesses in the context of the double-hour rate that applies on Sundays in places outside the Dublin-D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.</P>
        <P>I assure the Senator that I have received many representations, not only from employers but also from employees in small towns and villages who have been let go and who have no possibility of obtaining any form of work on Sundays.  Most employees were quite satisfied with the rates of pay of which they were previously in receipt prior to the instigation of the inspection process.  The JLCs have statutory power to strike the rates and if they agree new rates, these must be implemented under the employment regulation orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a major sense of urgency with this matter.  Some people have been told to comply by 21 November.  Does the Government realise that some companies will go under if they are obliged to pay back money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Some companies will be obliged to pay back money.  If officials of NERA inspect businesses and discover that pay and conditions are not up to standard and that back money is due, the employers concerned are obliged to pay such back money.  I tried to <Col N="1128"/>highlight this issue previously.  I met representative groups and tried to encourage them to see that if changes are made, the industry can continue to operate and levels of employment will be maintained in rural areas where it is difficult to obtain a number of hours work on Sundays.</P>
        <P>Restaurants are closing or are ceasing to trade on Sundays.  I am aware of a number of pubs which previously served lunch on Sundays but which have stopped doing so because it is no longer profitable.  The people who would have worked in these establishments each Sunday are being let go.</P>
