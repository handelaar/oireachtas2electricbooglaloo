	<P>I have notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish the report of the Cork Docklands Forum on the Cork docklands.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on school building projects (details supplied) and to outline when each project will progress.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to state whether in regard to Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg, County Donegal, which applied for an extension 11 years ago, an electrical contractor has concluded that the electrics are very unsafe, there is no fire alarm system in the school and the electrical consumer board does not have proper tripping protection.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to improve services for cyclists in Dublin city centre.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Buttimer, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Doherty and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to adjourn not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded, with spokespersons having 15 minutes, all other Senators ten minutes, and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House; No. 3, Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second <Col N="292"/>Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1, with spokespersons having 12 minutes, all other Senators ten minutes, and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House; and No. 23, motion 21 re investment in education, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3.  The business of the House will be interrupted from 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>Colleagues will note there is a change in the Order of Business.  I propose to take the Harbours (Amendment) Bill in place of the statements on banking.  We expect the regulations when the Government has concluded its deliberations.  I will inform the House accordingly as we proceed day by day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It would appear from what the Leader has said that we will not receive the scheme and regulations to underline the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 this week.  Given the urgency with which the issue was dealt with last week in both Houses, many people on this side of the House will be very concerned that the scheme has not been completed by Government and that it is not being presented to the Houses this week.  Will the Leader make a statement on that and bring us up to date on when these regulations will be introduced to the D&aacute;il and Seanad?  It is critical that taxpayers feel protected.  An undertaking was given to Fine Gael and Labour in both Houses that the regulations and the scheme would be presented to both Houses and that we would have an opportunity to respond to them.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom Government has dealt with the matter overnight.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance would come to the House to explain why the scheme is not ready and to give Members an indication of the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the matter, the duration of the expected delay and when we can expect to hear from Government that the scheme will be presented to both Houses.  It is in taxpayers&rsquo; interests that we have the detail of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, the United Kingdom has placed a cap on bankers&rsquo; salaries, for example, a move that was rejected by the Government.  Many people feel the area of remuneration was not dealt with adequately last week and needs to be dealt with under the scheme.  We need a presentation on the details.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in order to hear from the Minister on the exact position.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Leader about the recommendations contained in the recent reports from the Morris tribunal, including the somewhat surprising findings in regard to two of our colleagues who felt they were acting in the public interest.  What is the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations in the Morris tribunal report on Deputies or Senators receiving anonymous information and how that is acted upon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is reasonable to ask for the Government to outline its position on the scheme.  A commitment was given to bring in the regulation this week.  While supporting the call for an explanation, I am not saying the Government should rush the delivery of the scheme.  If I were in Government, I would favour examining the detail some more.  However, if there has been a change of mind by the Government on the timing of the publication of the scheme, we are entitled to be informed because we discussed the matter at length and, in that regard, the request of Senator Fitzgerald is reasonable.</P>
        <P>Despite the significant intervention by the UK Government, amounting to some &pound;60 billion sterling, the UK markets dropped this morning.  The reason for this is clear.  It was an admission by the UK Government that their banks are undercapitalised.  Our Financial Regulator has said consistently, and he is not the only person, that our banks are not undercapitalised.  The Minister for Finance said the same thing in the House last week.  That is a solid position if we hold it and it should not mean anything to the people in the market who trade on the basis of <Col N="293"/>supply and demand and dropping prices.  However, the matter is interesting.  The UK Government made another intervention this morning.  Apart from the intervention just mentioned, it copied the Irish Government by providing a guarantee on deposits and other activities.  It will be interesting to see how the markets respond.  However, it seems nothing will impact on the markets as there is merely a lack of confidence and it will take time to restore it.  We should not be rushing after the markets and we must try to deal with the matter as cleverly as we can.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; motion deals with education and I look forward to discussing it.  However, there is a specific issue on which I wish to comment.  Every month the Cathaoirleach receives a deluge of requests seeking an update on the progress of schools building projects.  The issue is not related to a quantum or sum of money, rather it is a question of how business is done.  I have dealt with buildings for primary education for more than 30 years and the problem is that no one in the D&aacute;il or Seanad, including myself, can explain to an ordinary punter or school management board what is happening with a given school building project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are bands which determine the order of priority of applications, there are stages of building, there are teams which are changed at will, and there is ministerial intervention built into the process without any criteria.  The system is opaque and there is a lack of transparency and understanding.  Will the Minister for Education and Science come to the Seanad to discuss the matter without discussing a particular school and we promise not to ask questions about specific schools?  The Minister could explain to us how the system works from the moment an application is submitted, how an application goes from band to band, which does not happen, how an application is assigned a band, and how it proceeds from bands to stages, since no one has ever been told this happens automatically.  How does an application proceed automatically through stages one, two, three, four and five up to stages eight and nine?  It is not unreasonable to demand an explanation for this.</P>
        <P>The system is opaque and I have asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate the matter because I believe there is poor value for money in this area.  Most applicants would be prepared to wait if they knew the position, but what drives applicants mad is not knowing.  They write and telephone us asking if we can find out and we cannot provide the information.  There is a significant problem if elected Members of the Oireachtas cannot find the information to satisfy themselves.  People will not necessarily be happy with the outcome but we at least should know the answers.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support and agree with the concerns expressed about the delay in bringing forward the scheme which the Minister for Finance said would come to both Houses.  We have seen what happened this morning in the UK.  I respectfully disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in that I do not believe it is accurate to say the UK Government has copied the Irish Government.  That is not true.  The UK Government has taken preference shares in the banks it has proposed to assist and it has included a requirement that any bank wishing to participate in the scheme must sign up to an agreement on executive pay and dividends.  There are many other differences between the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal and what has been done here.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has said there is no difficulty with the capitalisation of the Irish banks.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, as in the past, believes we should accept that statement.  However, we have been asked to accept other statements from and about the banks in recent months which have proven to be not true.  I note a nuance in the comments of the Minister for Finance this morning.  He said, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned, he does not believe there is a difficulty with <Col N="294"/>undercapitalisation.  However, the Minister for Finance, rather ominously, stated things are changing by the day.  Therefore, it is not at all clear that there is not a difficulty with undercapitalisation in Irish banks.</P>
        <P>I agree with the comments of Senator Fitzgerald and I ask the Leader to reflect on this matter.  What is the current position in Ireland with respect to the guarantee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no guarantee is the answer.  The Minister for Finance and the Government announced an intention to provide a guarantee, which was a plan for the future, but there is no guarantee for today.  This is a serious situation of which I do not make light as a talking point for debate.  However, the seriousness of the situation is increased with a further delay in the presentation of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The delay also raises the question of what we were doing here last week in the overnight session.  What was the point of it?  We passed enabling legislation which has not been acted upon.  Therefore, apart from the amendments to the competition legislation which, although important, are marginal, the content of the legislation, the scheme and the guarantee are meaningless because nothing has been carried out.  What were we doing here overnight last week?  I do not have any difficulty with making myself available, nor do my colleagues.  However, the sum total of our efforts adds to nothing because it has changed nothing.  Our job is not to provide an overnight supporters&rsquo; rally for the work of the Government or the Minister for Finance.  We are legislators and we are constitutionally required to scrutinise proposed legislation.  The scheme was supposed to be brought before the Houses.  Unless and until this happens, there is no Irish guarantee; it simply does not exist yet.  This is a reflection of the seriousness of the matter.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s intentions are becoming less, rather than more, clear with each day.  The Minister for Finance has now indicated, perhaps correctly, the possibility of a limit on the amount of deposits banks can take on.  I do not claim he has no basis for the comments, but it shows how unclear things are for us as legislators.  The developments in the UK this morning will have implications for foreign owned banks operating in Ireland.  They may well be covered by the UK guarantee.  That will have implications for what we do with our scheme and there is the wider EU context.  The situation is sliding by the day.  As for all the talk and congratulations we indulged in last week for being first into the breach, it looks like we may well be one of the last into the breach in completing a proper scheme to put before the Houses and implement a guarantee.  I repeat, and I ask the Leader to agree or disagree with me whether I am right, at present, there is no Irish guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At the outset I will comment on the scheme, which it is hoped will come to the House next week.  The developments in the UK this morning are welcome.  As Senator Alex White said, there are implications in that scheme for us.  Despite the dithering in the United States of America and other European countries in recent weeks, I am glad we came out last week with decisive action.  We passed enabling legislation which provides the template for the various State agencies involved and the Cabinet to design the optimum scheme which is best for the Irish economy and banking system.  Perhaps we have learned from the mistakes and dithering of these other countries.  I am pleased, as is Senator O&rsquo;Toole, that we are taking time over this to ensure we get it absolutely right.</P>
        <P>There are aspects of the British scheme which I favour.  There is to be a cap on executive salaries and the UK Government is taking preference shares.  While there is not a clear indica<Col N="295"/>tion in the legislation that we will go down that route in our scheme, the Act does provide that the Minister for Finance and the Government could go down that route.</P>
        <P>There is a precarious international situation.  We must continue to be agile and remain in a position to act as necessary.  We played a very important role in putting the legislation in place last week which allows the Government the necessary freedom and agility.  It is a most unusual situation, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  We have finally had decisive action from the United Kingdom Government yet the markets continue to fall in the UK this morning.  Time will be the ultimate healer in that regard and we must give it that time.  I am sure the Leader will clarify the position this morning by giving us an update on the scheme and when the details will be laid before the House but I welcome the fact that we are taking the appropriate time, and not rushing matters, to ensure we have the optimum scheme.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the Health Service Executive as a matter of the utmost urgency, particularly in the context of plans the Department of Health and Children may have to re-regionalise.  That is important because many of us are unhappy with the way the HSE has been operating in recent months and we could do with clarification as to future plans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Such a debate might also give us an opportunity to debate the issue of BreastCheck, which I mentioned in the House last week, and the disgraceful way the people in the north west are being discriminated against, despite numerous undertakings from the chief executive of BreastCheck, and aspects of the HSE, that the service would be up and running by the end of 2006.  That is not the case.  As we heard from Senator McCarthy last week, people who are deceased are being called for mammograms in the south.  In the north west, the living are most anxious to be called to have these mammograms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a disgraceful service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to come before the House as a matter of the utmost urgency to clarify a variety of issues to do with the HSE and the most important issue of BreastCheck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We must have a serious debate on the banking sector.  A major sense of urgency was created last week that has metamorphosised into a degree of incompetence and insecurity about what we are supposed to be doing this week.  People may want to fool themselves into thinking we are doing the right thing here but what we must watch are the markets.  The Irish stock market crashed on the last two Monday mornings.  That is creating a sense of uncertainty in the market.  I ask the Leader of the House to face up to what we must do here.  We must have a proper debate.  I am not sure if the Leader is paying attention.  He is probably sick talking about banking but there is a need to discuss this matter seriously.  Investors in the Irish stock market have no confidence in this country.  We have seen the stock market crash on the last two Mondays and we are still congratulating ourselves on what we did last week.  Nothing was done here last week.  I agree with Senator Alex White on that.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that we must have continuous discussion on this issue and the Government must wake up to what is going on.  It is a complicated issue.  The scheme may not be introduced this week or even next week but we must have a continuing discussion as to what is going on with the Minister involved and let the general public know what is going on because uncertainty is being created and that will continue to hit the markets and confidence in the Irish banking sector if we do not do something about it.  Those discussions should continue with or without the introduction of the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader clarify the time the debate on the Harbours (Amendment) Bill will begin?  If I heard him correctly, he said it would be at the conclusion <Col N="296"/>of No. 1, which is 2 p.m. but the schedule indicates 2.30 p.m.  I would appreciate it if the Leader would clarify that.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole who raised the issue of the school buildings programme.  I attended a meeting on Monday night regarding a particular school in Kinsale and heard all the jargon used by the Department in regard to bands, design stage and the different stages involved in the process of delivering the various programmes.  It is very difficult to face parents, the board of management, teachers and staff and tell them that I do not know when the school will be delivered.  Along with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I believe the manner in which the Department delivers these schemes must be debated.  We must know the timeframe involved when the process moves from one stage to the next and what the local people on the ground need to do to advance that.  That is important.  As we see no improvement in the current economic climate it is more important than ever that we ensure this country has a decent education infrastructure to deliver the graduates of the future who are required not only to reboot the economy but to keep the economy going.</P>
        <P>I want to raise the issue of a national insulation scheme.  Given the current economic turmoil this country and other European Union member states are going through, it is important that we have, first, an economic strategy to reboot the economy.  Second, an issue put forward by my party on many occasions which is proactive, positive and important in the week before the Minister frames his first budget is the introduction of a national insulation scheme.  There are a number of benefits to such a scheme.  First, it produces more energy efficient homes.  Second, it provides employment for those who have lost their jobs due to the downturn in the construction industry and, third, it takes people off social welfare and gets them back to contributing tax revenues to the State.  It is one important policy the Government would not be doing any harm by implementing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is only one issue in regard to the banking crisis we have talked about but it is the issue the Minister is avoiding on every occasion, namely, capitalisation.  The Minister said in Brussels after the ECOFIN meeting that the issue of recapitalisation of banks was being considered by some EU states but he did not believe that policy was necessary in Ireland, although he considered that events were moving very quickly.  Events are moving very quickly and the action by the UK authorities is an indication of that.  The statement from the Minister, however, shows that he does not understand the banking crisis and that he does not make the distinction between liquidity and solvency.  He does not realise that the State guarantee cannot resolve the issue of capitalisation and that Irish banks are no different from banks in the United Kingdom or on continental Europe.  The fact is that the State guarantee promulgated last week has been overtaken by events.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal to amend the Order of Business because the Minister must make a statement on this issue.  If he does not understand the situation it is well set out by Patrick Honohan, professor of international financial economics at the department of economics in Trinity College Dublin today in <i>The Irish Times</i> and by David McWilliams in <i>The Independent</i>.  We must recapitalise our banks if the banks are to play a role in avoiding a protracted recession.  I ask that the Minister make a statement on that.  There is an issue of further intervention by the Government.  There are legislative frameworks in place to deal with that, such as the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001.  The Minister must seriously address this issue.</P><Col N="297"/>
        <P>I want to raise the issue of the report to the Oireachtas from the Morris tribunal and the statement in that report on the two public representatives, Jim Higgins MEP and Deputy Brendan Howlin, whose intervention unearthed the enormous injustice done to the McBrearty family.  It is beyond me how the chairman of the tribunal could work into the script such negative statements about those two Opposition politicians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair, unreasonable and perverse.  We should follow the recommendation in the tribunal and the Oireachtas should review the way public representatives deal with allegations that are passed to them, but to suggest, with all respects to the chairman of that tribunal, that two public representatives, by passing on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform unedited the information they had received, were wrong is absurd.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Perverse&rdquo; is the word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should follow up on that recommendation.  While the two public representatives have legal redress, the Oireachtas should examine that matter because we are all at a loss as to what we should do when we receive allegations against public bodies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo what my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, said about the need for a debate on the system whereby schools are approved for works and the current opaque system but I would like to ask specifically for a debate on the state of our schools.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right.  We come into this House with specific requests for explanations on the Adjournment about the plans for particular schools but in many ways we believe we are engaging in some kind of pretence because in raising the matter on the Adjournment we get stock answers.  Whole sections of responses to Adjournment matters appear to have been cut and pasted whereby the Minister thanks the person raising the matter for the opportunity to explain what the Department of Education and Science is doing in regard to schools.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>One could mention many cases.  When I visited a school for approximately 90 minutes a few months ago, I witnessed the appalling state of affairs there.  I have since learned that, on the resumption of the school year, a teacher in the school was close to tears as, yet again, she had to mop up after floods and get rid of insects.  I could mention all sorts of circumstances, which are contrary to human dignity, in which we are educating the next generation.  I ask for a debate not just on the issue Senator O&rsquo;Toole has raised, but also on the specific issue of the state of our schools.  Now that we are in a downturn, do we intend to neglect the next generation, which comprise the most important section of society?  I refer in particular to those who have to endure appalling and disrespectful conditions in our schools.</P>
        <P>Speaking of disrespect, I would like to mention an issue that has been raised by Deputies Higgins and Shortall in the D&aacute;il.  I refer to the treatment of some people by immigration officials as they try to enter the State.  We are all aware of what happened to Fr. John Achebe recently.  The responses given by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when this case was raised in the D&aacute;il were not adequate.  We have to be concerned about this human dignity issue.  How are people treated when they come to this State?  If people are essentially dealt with on the basis of the colour of their skin, does the potential not exist for some form of veiled racism?  I do not accuse all immigration officials of racism.  Some people are essentially treated as suspect.  If the slightest misunderstanding develops, they are sent to Cloverhill Prison.  A man from India was treated in this manner after he won a holiday in Ireland as part of a tourism promotion initiative.  Is that any way to deal with human beings?  When questions are raised, is it acceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator has made his point.  We do not want a Second Stage speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to debate whether it is acceptable for Government responses to contain such spin.  For example, when one asks a question, one is told that the approximately 3,000 people who are refused permission to enter the State each year account for just 0.012% of the 25 million passengers who pass through our airports annually.  That is simply spin.  It shows a lack of respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader agrees to a debate, such matters can be discussed.  We do not want Second Stage speeches on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>It has come to my attention that the problems being experienced by the banks are leading to a scarcity of credit being available to this country&rsquo;s small and medium sized businesses.  Perhaps the Leader can take up this issue.  The lack of credit is exacerbating the other problems associated with the recession.  Over 1 million people are employed by small businesses.  A proper line of credit should be available to businesses which are entering difficult times to ensure they can maintain current staffing levels.  I agree with Senator Regan that the Minister will probably have to take a number of steps.  However, it is disgraceful to say that he does not understand the situation.</P>

Now that we have guaranteed the banks, we have to ensure that a special package is agreed for small businesses.  It is important that a credit lifeline is made available through the small business associations.  Small businesses employ many people.  We need employment more than ever.  The <Col N="299"/>banks have a major role to play.  We have a role in providing leadership.  The Government has shown extremely good leadership on this issue.  We should not rush into decisions.  It is important to see how things are panning out on a day-to-day basis.  We have put a number of measures in place.  It is important to ensure that the banks come clean on their books.  We may have to consider the possibility of the books being re-evaluated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for the Leader to make a statement on the regulations which are to be made under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  The Leader and the other Members of the House did all we could to expedite the passage of the legislation in question last week.  We all understood the urgency associated with it.  We did what needed to be done.  Time is of the essence.  We urgently need closure on this issue.</P>
        <P>It has clearly been pointed out that no guarantee scheme is in place.  That was supposed to be the most significant aspect of the legislation.  We gave the Minister and the Government a blank cheque.  We took it in good faith.  Nature abhors a vacuum, as we know.  The markets are exploiting the vacuum that exists.  With respect to Senator Butler, we do not have time to delay further.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s concern for small business.  Everything he says in that respect is correct.  We won admiration last week for the bold and decisive manner in which we acted.  It would be a frightful pity if we were to be tardy in following through on last week&rsquo;s actions and lose it all.  Nothing has been done to remove any of the bad apples or ensure that proper practices are put in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>We should compliment Mr. Justice Morris on the comprehensive and meticulous work he has done.  He has done the State and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a lot of good.  We have one of the finest police forces in the world.  It was particularly important to restore confidence in the Garda.  I am sure the members of the force would agree.  I was surprised that the report contained negative comments about two public representatives, Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, and Deputy Howlin.  In some ways, those comments overshadowed the pivotal role they played in the establishment of the tribunal in the first instance.</P>

	<P>It behoves us all, as public representatives, to appreciate that we have a pretty privileged role to play.  We must be able to respond to what we hear from our constituents.  In this case, the manner in which the information was presented is separate from the more important issue of the essence of what was presented.  I do not mean to detract in any way from the excellent report which has been made available to us.  It will become a reference document for many years to come.  We will rely on it when we are trying to ensure we can be guided at all times by the trust and confidence we have in the Garda, or any other arm of the State.  Mr. Justice Morris has served the State by dealing with this issue, which has been the subject of significant public interest, for over five years.  Throughout that period, he has done a job we can be particularly pleased with and proud of.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what my colleague, Senator Alex White, said earlier.  Some Senators have queried the levels of understanding within this House about the banking crisis.  I cannot understand how we will be expected to vote on a budget next week without having seen the details of the scheme.  We do not have details of how much it will cost the country.  We do not know anything about contingencies.  How does the Minister expect us to vote on his budget without seeing the details of the scheme?  I agree with other Senators who have called for the Minister to attend the House and make a statement on this.</P>
        <P>It was revealed in a newspaper article this morning that 20% of students who appeal their leaving certificate results are successful.  This rate varies from subject to subject.  For example, there is a 20% chance of an upgrade in biology, and a 30% chance in geography.  These are factual subjects and I would have thought that one is right or wrong in the first place.  The problem with such high levels of success is that they will impact on confidence in the system.  Any student who does not get the grade that he or she hoped for will appeal, as this is now the sensible thing to do.  That can clog up the system and leads to difficulties at the beginning of college terms.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister to review the whole process of how we mark these papers.  It is vital that we restore confidence to the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader, during the debate on the banking crisis, the difficulties with liquidity in the market place and the involvement of the Government, that we pay particular reference to how arrears are handled within the banks and how repossessions are handled.  Having worked with a financial institution for 17 years, it became apparent that it is very bad business for banks to be involved in repossessions, not only because of the human cost, but ironically because of the financial cost as well.  There are legal costs, maintenance costs for the house, security costs and the cost of selling it off at a much discounted rate.</P>
        <P>However, there are other options.  Some banks stay away from repossessions as a policy.  It makes good business sense to do so.  These other options include a holiday from payments, equity interest in the house or some other method which would allow the people to live on in the house while they are getting over their difficulties.  Now that the Government has taken on the responsibility to ensure that the banks have liquidity, we have a responsibility for any people who have had their homes repossessed.  This proves the point that the worst possible option is often the most expensive.  With our immediate interest in the banks, we should ensure that repossessions are the very last option undertaken by any of the banks, not just because it is wrong, but because it is bad business.</P><Col N="301"/>

	<P>While the debate on the financial turmoil continues, there are still human issues to be addressed, one of which is the roll out of BreastCheck.  Waterford city, with a population of over 50,000, is one of the largest urban centres of the country.  Senator MacSharry referred to the commitment of the HSE, but in a letter to the South Eastern Cancer Foundation just before the general election in May 2007, the then Taoiseach wrote to say that BreastCheck would be rolled out by the end of 2007 in Waterford city.  The Minister for Health and Children also stated in this House that BreastCheck would be rolled out by the end of this year, yet still there is no sign of it.  That is a reflection of the accountability and the responsibility of the Government regarding health issues in this country.  Will the Leader to ask the Minister to attend the House to discuss health care in general, but especially primary health care and screening programmes like BreastCheck.</P>
        <P>The women of Waterford, calling themselves WOW, are taking to the streets on 15 October, pleading for this much needed service to be rolled out.  It is a disgrace that the women have to come on to the streets and campaign in order to get this essential service.  It is an indictment of our health system, and the Minister should be held accountable.  I ask the Leader to bring her before the House to answer for it.</P>
        <P>I call for a general debate on primary health care.  We are always talking about the acute situation in hospitals and the lack of beds.  If the primary health service in this country was developed so that preventative medicine can be fully adopted in GP practices, we would go a long way to preventing many of the serious diseases that are affecting our nation.</P>

	<P>I also support the comments that Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made earlier today on the Morris tribunal.   Oireachtas Members have a privileged position where we get information from people and we are asked to do things about it.  I regret the comments that were made about the honourable step taken by former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin.  We need to have a debate in both Houses about the status of Members of the Houses and what is expected of them when they receive information like that.  I heard Deputy Howlin speak yesterday about it, and he was deeply confused as to what was expected of him.  Most people would agree that he did the honourable thing in speaking quietly to the Minister.</P>
        <P>The level of inquiry that is afforded these Houses and their committees is constantly being eroded.  We need to establish once and for all what can be expected of us.  I would like a debate on the issue.  Perhaps such a debate is one for the commission rather than for the Chamber, but I would like to be advised as to what we can do in establishing the rights and the legitimate function of Members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We will have to return to the international financial crisis.  I am confused because Senator Butler stated that it was a disgrace for Fine Gael to say that the Minister did not understand the situation, then he accused Fine Gael of not understanding the situation either.  I am not fully sure I understand the situation, or that I have heard anybody who has given a clear, comprehensive view of how we can get out of it.  I am somewhat reassured, having listened to my distinguished colleague, Senator Ross, on &ldquo;Today With Pat Kenny&rdquo;, on how to cope with the situation.  He was joined by Mr. Nick Leeson, who agreed with him that there should be a bloodletting at the top of the banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>He has some form there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the banks were guilty of the irresponsible leverage situation.  When I heard those two voices agreeing, I said to myself that there is no need for me to worry because I am happy to admit my lack of understanding.  However, I now believe the problem is capitalisation, as several people here have indicated.  There is now a discordance between the regulator on the one hand, who has said that the banks are properly capitalised, and the instinct of the stock market on the other hand, which clearly does not believe him.  This is a matter of confidence and if we are to restore such confidence, it behoves the regulator to come out with more clear, solid factual information.  If he is right, this will restore confidence.  If he is not right, then we should know it now.  Various European governments, having criticised Ireland for the action it took last week, are now all following us.  That suggests we have done the right thing.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Morris tribunal, I welcome the report of the very distinguished judge but like some other colleagues, I was very surprised by his comments in the report.  He referred to wild claims, but there were wild acts.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were planting bombs, mixing sodium chlorate in coffee grinders, suborning witnesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am asking that we should discuss this and I am giving my reasons, such as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na planting bombs and lying on oath and so on.  Mr. Justice Morris suggested it was wrong to go to the Minister; I think it was very responsible indeed.  They did not come into the Oireachtas and use privilege and destroy the reputations of people by name.  They went to the Minister.  There is a precedent for that which was referred to on the radio last night, when Mr. Liam Cosgrave went to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, when he was given information about the importation of arms.  Mr. Justice Morris appeared to me to suggest that the Members should have investigated this themselves.  How could they?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have the resources.  We have barely enough resources to cope with our workload.  We are not an investigative agency and it took the Morris tribunal however many years, however many millions of euro and however many barristers to produce this report.  How on earth does Mr. Justice Morris think two honourable, decent representatives could be expected to do the same?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this point.  Deputy Howlin made the point that he was given this information by a senior barrister with 22 years&rsquo; criminal experience at the Bar and he believed it.  It was appropriate to pass on this information to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns about immigration as expressed by various speakers, including Senator Mullen.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which will come to the House shortly, is quite defective.  I attended a briefing in the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make this point because it is in anticipation of the Bill.

The briefing will be held in the audio-visual room at the end of the month.</P>

Will the Leader clarify there will not be a change of plan regarding the budget?  As others Senators have said, it is difficult to vote for something and then have a budget when we do not have the cost factor.</P>
        <P>I join other speakers in raising the issue of political responsibility.  It is important we have a debate on our duty as public representatives in light of the Morris tribunal findings.

Where do we go to?  They went to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  What do we do?  To whom do we talk?

        <P>In reply to Senators Hanafin and O&rsquo;Malley, the Labour Party is very happy with its position on this issue and we sleep soundly in our beds, happy with the course we have taken.  Many people are very concerned about the charges to be levied on banks.  Unless there is some equity involved, many people do not believe that the banks will be dealt with in a manner which the majority of us believe they should be.  It is fascinating the Progressive Democrats Party is criticising the Labour Party for the actions it is taking.  It sounds like the last call from a dying party, the party of deregulation that is now finally coming around to our way of thinking and advocating regulation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree wholeheartedly with people across the House who have raised the issue of the Morris tribunal.  It is a very good report but unfortunately overshadowed by something which in my view is fundamentally wrong.  The way in which these two former Members of this House were treated in the report is quite worrying.  All Members receive information from time to time.  If such information is of such a magnitude, how do we deal with it?  Whom do we go to and how do we act responsibly?  We need to discuss these questions.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Leader this question before<b> </b>and he might indulge me and get some answers.  There is a major debate, especially for the Government, regarding the public finances.  Sometimes there is a fixation on the public finances as opposed to the real economy.  Instead of discussing numbers in many areas, especially those at the lower scales in the civil and public service, the Leader might ask the Department of Finance, through his Government, to conduct an audit of the number of buildings throughout the country proposed for State bodies and the Civil Service<b> </b>so as to highlight the waste.</P>
        <P>A performance management process was introduced under the last pay deal and it has been conducted across the public service.  The Leader might ask the Department of Finance to conduct an audit of how performance management is being applied to senior managers and chief executives through the chairpersons of boards, etc.  Is it being conducted?  My information is that, in many cases, it is not.  At a time when taxpayers expect value for money and good service delivery and those on the lower levels within the civil and public service must work under this system, senior managers should do so as well.</P>

        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, MacSharry, Twomey, Regan, Buttimer, Coghlan, Hannigan, O&rsquo;Malley, Norris, Kelly and Butler expressed their concerns about the forthcoming regulations and issues concerning the ongoing banking situation.  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il this morning that work on the scheme for the guaranteed banking scheme is being carried out by officials from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator with a view to finalising it as quickly as possible.  The board of the Central Bank and Financial <Col N="305"/>Services Authority of Ireland discussed the scheme on Monday evening and it will feed its recommendations into the finalisation of the scheme.  It is emphasised that there will be a need for discussions on the draft scheme later this week between the Irish authorities and the European Commission with regard to state aid and competition requirements.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that the Minister for Finance met the European Commissioner for competition on Monday evening to discuss the Government&rsquo;s approach and contacts are ongoing as the work proceeds.  The issues discussed at the meeting between Commissioner Kroes and the Minister for Finance are being factored into the drafting of the scheme.  A particular priority in this regard is to ensure the scheme appropriately addresses the issues of subsidiaries of overseas parent companies operating in Ireland with a substantial main street retail presence.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that it is a priority to ensure the scheme will be laid before both Houses as soon as possible.  The Taoiseach said the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Commissioner agreed it was important to take steps to guard against undue distortions of financial flows and the Minister indicated that these concerns would be addressed through the implementing measures currently being drafted which will provide for behavioural and quantitative balance sheet controls.  That is the up-to-date position as the Taoiseach has informed the D&aacute;il just a few moments ago.  I will update the House daily as we are sitting.  Tomorrow morning I will have a further update on the timeframe for the proposed regulations for the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senators correctly pointed out their concerns regarding the Morris tribunal report.  I will discuss this with party leaders after today&rsquo;s Order of Business to see how we may progress the matter and what we can do concerning this fine report.  At the same time, we must see how we can assist public representatives, particularly former Members of this House, who acted decently and honourably in the discharge of their duties.</P>
        <P>Senators McCarthy, O&rsquo;Toole, Mullen and Hannigan sought clarity on the programme for schools building projects.  I well remember that when Deputy Noel Dempsey was the Minister for Education and Science he got to terms with this matter.  We all had a clear understanding of where schools in our constituencies stood in order of priority.

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who I know supports me on this, can then ask the Minister if we can return to the situation as it pertained when Deputy Dempsey held that portfolio.  As a former teacher, he would have known about the pressures involved.  Now is the time when we can get tremendous value for money from school building projects and hopefully this matter can be included in the Government&rsquo;s budgetary deliberations.  </P>
        <P>Senators MacSharry and Coffey sought clarification of media reports that the HSE is to be regionalised.  We will pursue this matter.  The excellent BreastCheck service is not available everywhere, so we hope it can be prioritised by the HSE.  I will arrange for such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, present.</P>
        <P>I will convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Senator Mullen&rsquo;s views on the treatment of persons entering the State.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler, who has enormous experience in public life, referred to the availability of credit.  This is an important issue given the announcement this morning by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Darling.  The current difficulty in the commercial world is that banks have stopped loaning to each other.  This is the biggest single issue because we can come to <Col N="306"/>terms with the economic downturn as soon as everyone allows the system to work.  If banks continue their policy of not loaning to each other, however, everything will gradually come to a standstill.  This is the driving factor for all governments that are currently trying to come to terms with the problems in the banking sector.</P>
        <P>My own view is that the fall in share values is down to high interest rates.  I look forward to an interest rate reduction in the United Kingdom, which will affect most of us in Ireland, but particularly from the midlands to Antrim because it concerns Border county business.  The activities of the Ulster Bank and the Bank of Scotland are very important to us because those brand names operate quite successfully across the island of Ireland.  I also look forward to a substantial interest rate reduction in the EU, which would restore confidence and kick-start firms that have been providing employment for generations.</P>
        <P>I will convey to the Minister for Finance Senator Kelly&rsquo;s views on the public finances and an audit on State buildings.  We can also discuss these matters in the House when we have a debate on the budget.  I will try to facilitate the Senator&rsquo;s request at my next meeting with the party Leaders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The purpose of this Bill is to improve housing services and many of the sections are most welcome.  Section 11 provides that housing authorities should provide and maintain services ancillary to housing development, including roads, shops, playgrounds, places of worship and sites for various facilities.  It is important that this be done, especially in large urban areas.  Too often in the past there were housing developments which did not even include a green space where children could play.  That leads to anti-social behaviour since the children have no place to burn off energy.  There should be areas in housing schemes where children and young people can play football, hurling and other sports.  That is most important so I welcome this section.  When the Bill is passed I hope local authorities will ensure that these services are put in place.</P>
        <P>Under section 14 the elected members of local authorities are obliged to make housing available and to put plans in that regard in place.  I note with satisfaction that a time frame of six months is included in the section for a plan to be put in place and implemented.  It is worth noting that elected members along with the management have an input into devising the plan.  With elected members involved, the plans will have a greater connection with members of the public.  After all, it is the elected members whom the public approach in the first instance about anything related to housing, be it securing housing, rent increases and so forth.  It is good that the elected members are being given more power in this regard.</P>
        <P>Section 22 deals with the rental accommodation scheme, which I welcome.  It gives people an opportunity to get into the property market and own a house.  However, over the years I have had a gripe with local authorities over one issue.  When people get an increase in their social welfare payment in the budget the councils usually increase rents when preparing their estimates.  That is wrong.  The Government should put a cap on rents to prevent councils, when <Col N="308"/>social welfare recipients get an increase in their social welfare payment, imposing an extra charge on them because of that increase.</P>
        <P>I compliment my local county council.  Over the years it has tackled people who behave in an anti-social manner in housing estates.  I am delighted there is a section in the Bill which deals with this issue.  County councils should be more proactive in ensuring that when people get a house in an estate they will not cause trouble in that estate or, perhaps, cause other people in the estate to have to leave it.  My local council has done this in a number of cases.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this comprehensive Bill.  When it is passed I hope it will be implemented by the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a few comments on this important Bill.  First, I welcome the Minister back to this House, with which he was so familiar in the past and to which he paid great tribute in his speech.  The first note he struck did not surprise me, given my knowledge of his character.  He spoke about the human dimension of the housing situation and the financial downturn we are facing.</P>
        <P>I will reiterate something I had been saying for a considerable number of months before this recession, which is very worrying, had its major impact.  It relates to repossessions.  I accept this is not directly addressed in the Bill, nor would it be appropriate for it to do so.  However, if there is a steep increase in repossessions, we may find that people who are the victims in that situation will apply for the type of housing envisaged in this scheme.  It is important that the Minister use his influence with his colleagues to ensure a return for the support being given to the banks by the taxpayer.  The sudden recent steep increase in repossession orders, about which I have spoken over the last six months and which was noted a couple of days ago by a senior judge in court, should be drawn to the attention of the banks and it should be indicated to them that this is not a positive way for them to behave in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>Housing is a sensitive area and is a human need.  It is important that it is addressed.  The Minister referred to an investment of &euro;2.5 billion in social and affordable housing in 2008 to meet the needs of 20,000 households.  Presumably, a significant proportion of that budget has already been spent, given that this is the end of 2008.  How much of it has been spent?  If the remaining figure is substantial, to what extent is it protected?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are budget cuts.  Earlier, I attended a pre-budget briefing by the Carers Association.  I spoke to a couple of elderly people who were concerned about matters that are relevant to this legislation.  They were concerned about the possibility of the removal by local authorities of special grants for people over 70 years of age to carry out maintenance and certain running repairs on their housing.  One woman mentioned the problem of broken windows.  It might appear to be a small matter and not a huge economic drain, but for people who have tight budgetary margins it can be significant because they might not be able to afford to carry out those repairs.  That creates a knock-on cost for the Exchequer.  What will these people do about heat?  If they have broken windows, the heat will escape so they will either turn up the heat and get into debt or live with the problem and end up in hospital.  It would be prudent to examine these issues carefully.  I hope these people will be safe.</P>
      
        <P>There are some new developments with regard to assessing housing needs and matching individual needs to the housing stock available.  Like many of my colleagues, I receive a number of pleas from citizens throughout the country who have problems getting the type of housing they need.  Assessing the need is very important.  The Minister spoke about strengthening local democracy by reinforcing the role of elected members.  If possible, I hope he will elaborate on that.  I would be interested to see this spelt out a little more, if possible. It could be positive but it also could be negative in that one does not want too much clientelism or people getting <Col N="309"/>a house simply at the nod of a local representative.  However, it is useful for a local representative to be able to bring specific needs forcibly to the attention of local authorities.  I have never been a member of a local authority but have written to many around the country because really critical human circumstances, which apparently have  been ignored, have been brought to my attention.  It is noticeable that a letter on Oireachtas notepaper sometimes helps to ease circumstances.</P>
        <P>Let me refer to certain circumstances I have encountered.  I am not sure they are directly relevant to this Bill, except in terms of the psychology of officialdom.  I have just been dealing with a case that has been resolved concerning a person who has been in the country for quite a number of years, contributed to the economy through work and applied for citizenship.  The person was a victim of persecution and, tragically, has now acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  The person has a wealth of letters from medical personnel and social workers stating a particular kind of accommodation is absolutely vital.  One of the letters in the person&rsquo;s file was from a housing official who stated the authorities examined the file and decided there was no reason the person deserved the required housing.  Furthermore, the official stated the case was being closed, which was astonishingly abrupt and arbitrary.  We need to monitor this kind of response and ensure a certain sensitivity applies and that, where there is strong professional representation from both the social services and medical authorities, cases will not be pushed to one side brusquely by someone who does not have complete qualifications in this area.  The Minister of State referred to strengthening the link between local needs and the provision of resources and consistency.  This is exactly what I was talking about.</P>
        <P>I welcome the incremental purchase acquisition scheme, which is a very good idea in that it gives people ownership.  In certain circumstances, when one gets a proportion of a house, one pays one&rsquo;s mortgage and accepts full responsibility for the house&rsquo;s maintenance.  Surrounding homes may not have been acquired privately and may still be in the hands of the local authority.  Is the maintenance monitored for a transition period by the local authorities?  It would be rather unfortunate if there were decent people who did not buy their houses, or could not afford to do so or to get a mortgage &mdash; this may now become more difficult &mdash; who had somebody next door who was not doing proper maintenance on his or her house.  Is this being monitored?</P>
        <P>The question of anti-social behaviour is really troubling.  I am not sure what the solution is, nor am I sure there is one contained in the Bill.  There are attempts to address it, and it is certainly not ignored, but we cannot tolerate circumstances in which a person is consistently anti-social in his or her behaviour, be it by way of drug dealing, drunken neglect of property, rowdy parties or antagonising neighbours, and has the neighbour-from-hell syndrome one sees on television programmes.  What happens to such people and where do they go?  If they cannot provide housing for themselves and if they make themselves impossible tenants for the local authority, is it a case of, &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;?  The people are still alive and therefore one must ask how society should cope with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not a problem?  Is there a quarantine area?  Do we shove all the people onto Spike Island or some such place?</P>
        <P>One aspect of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill that I found to be very positive and refreshing was the fact that it does not have significant financial implications.  This means it is probably safer than much other legislation that has been floating around the Houses recently.  There is capacity to recycle State money through the various schemes.  Therefore, I hope that since it is seen as broadly Exchequer neutral, we can push ahead with it.</P><Col N="310"/>
        <P>I have received some briefings from a group I had not heard of before called MakeRoom, which seems to be a coalition of very responsible bodies such as Simon Communities of Ireland, Focus Ireland and Threshold.  Broadly speaking, the organisation is pleased with the Bill but believes it could be strengthened in various ways.  There does not seem to be a specific, precise and clear definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; in the Bill.  Will the Minister of State provide a definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; to incorporate the criteria I have mentioned?  Will he account for equitable assessment and adopt a clearly human rights-based approach to the legislation?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  Particularly in the current circumstances, it is important that we continue to provide a positive legislative lead in the sensitive human area of housing.  I hope the Minister of State will reassure us that, since the Bill is described as being broadly Exchequer neutral, its provisions will be safe.  I hope he may be able to address some of the questions I have raised.</P>
        <P>My new-found friends in MakeRoom have indicated they will supply positive and constructive amendments.  I am sure many of us have been in contact with the organisation and may have received those amendments.  I will be happy to table them or, if my colleagues table them, I will be happy to support them to the extent I regard them as being constructive.  From what I have seen of the vague outline given in the briefing document, the amendments will be constructive and helpful.  I am sure the Minister of State, whom I remember as a constructive colleague in this House, will find it possible to accept some of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, back to the Seanad.  If anybody knows anything about housing, it is he because he has many years under his belt as a member of a local authority.</P>
        <P>This Bill is very timely because it addresses circumstances that have obtained for some 40 years.  The question of social and affordable housing, which has featured for quite some time, has been addressed on a somewhat piecemeal basis and this Bill will restore order to what can only be termed as the <i>ad hoc</i> procedures that obtained heretofore.</P>
        <P>There are a number of provisions in the Bill that are particularly welcome.  They have been already touched on but I will repeat them because they bear doing so.  The incremental purchase scheme will enable existing social housing tenants and households qualified for social housing support to become owners of houses newly built by housing authorities and voluntary and co-operative bodies.  The scheme provides for the transfer of full ownership of a house to a household on the purchase of an initial share of the equity.  Clearly, this is a very important provision.  It gives the purchaser a sense of ownership and this will drive the tenant in a direction he might not have gone heretofore.  He will have pride of ownership, which is very important.  Most of us who had to put our hands in our pockets, dig very deep and convince the bank manager, SDA, Housing Finance Agency or building society that we constituted a reasonable risk will know how difficult it was when we started making repayments.  Purchasers, when they buy the initial share in their house, will understand what people who go through this experience must endure.  As the old saying goes, borrowed horses very often have hard hooves.</P>
        <P>It brings tears to one&rsquo;s eyes to see the manner in which certain houses received by tenants deteriorate in a relatively short period, perhaps within six months.  Thankfully, I do not refer to all houses.  Houses for which people would pay huge amounts of money in the private sector are given away, provided by the taxpayer and the ratepayer at a differential rent.  To see them abused in the manner in which they often have been is heart-rending, to say the least.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that Westmeath County Council, of which I was a member for some 25 years, has a proud record of providing accommodation for the Travelling community, who rate among some of our best tenants.  I hasten to add that we have the other kind as well, but that is not <Col N="311"/>alone pertinent to the Travelling community but to the settled community also.  However, it is only fair to say that some of our best tenants are members of the Travelling community.  The manner in which they keep their houses is a credit to them.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes new powers for elected members to adopt strategies for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in the local authority housing stock and an extended definition of anti-social behaviour to cover graffiti and damage to property.  This is welcome, and I welcome any measure that will give powers to locally elected members.  However, I want to introduce an important caveat in this regard.  A lady recently brought her son to my home.  The family was living in a certain housing estate in a certain Midlands town and the son was being bullied beyond all human endurance, which is the best way I can put it.  The family was advised by the local authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to move.  Why should the offended have to move?  Why not the offender?  It begs the question.</P>
        <P>The problem is that if the offender is to be taken to task, somebody must go to court, point the finger and identify the person or persons causing the problems, and explain the problems being caused.  It is a difficult problem but it must be tackled because it will not go away.  In this case, the family did move, which is a defeat for law and order, as I know it.  We are all entitled to live our lives in a peaceful and harmonious way.  We must get down to the nub of dealing with anti-social behaviour.  It can only be beaten through people power, with the help of the Garda and the local authority.  There is no doubt that elected members also have a pivotal role to play.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  It comes after 40 years and gives a basis to the adage, &ldquo;It is never too late to do the right thing.&rdquo;  This is the right thing to do.  It will be the jewel in the crown if the Minister of State can find an answer to anti-social behaviour.  By that, I am talking about graffiti, people being bullied and, of course, drug dealing.  I am told <i>ad nauseam</i> about what is going on by people who come to my office, in the same way my councillor son, my secretary and every other elected member in the area has been told this.  There is no point in talking about it.  We have talked the talk.  Now, we have to walk the walk.  We must deal with this problem.</P>
        <P>The Bill will broaden the choices available to those seeking social housing by establishing a more developed framework for contractual arrangements to secure rented accommodation for social housing.  These provisions are based on experience with the rental accommodation scheme, which involves housing authorities progressively taking responsibility for accommodating people in receipt of social welfare rent supplement who have a long-term housing need.  By the end of 2008, between the rental accommodation scheme and other forms of social housing, the Government expects to have rehoused more than 16,000 households with long-term housing needs that were previously supported through rent supplement.</P>
        <P>To be honest, while rent supplement is a very important part of addressing social need, I have always considered it a waste of money.  I would far rather see that money invested in providing housing, although I understand there is a short-term solution and a long-term solution.  The Bill takes many strides in the right direction.  What I have heard from all sides of the House should give the Minister of State great comfort because the Bill has great support across the board, which I welcome.  I commend the Bill to colleagues on all sides of the House.  I look forward to Committee Stage, when I am sure suggestions will be brought forward.</P>
        <P>I will conclude on the following point.  We must grasp by the scruff of the neck the issue of anti-social behaviour in our housing estates.  There is no point talking about it because we have talked long enough.  We must deal with it immediately, and the Bill is a basis for doing that.  It enables local authorities and their members, as well as tenants, to deal with it.  Together, we <Col N="312"/>can beat this problem.  An unco-ordinated approach will not work because that is what we have had thus far, and we have got nowhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the House.  He is a not infrequent visitor to my area of Waterford and south Kilkenny.  I am sure he is well aware of the serious cases of anti-social behaviour &mdash; criminality is probably a better word &mdash; which have taken place in Waterford in recent months.  Some 14 houses have been burnt down, 11 of which were local authority houses, children have been shot at, cars have been rammed, large caches of weapons have been found by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and even a pipe bomb was placed in one estate as a result of a feud between various families in the area.  I pay tribute to the garda&iacute; involved for their bravery, understanding and professionalism, and to the local authority staff and mediation services, who have done great work.</P>
        <P>Can we imagine ordinary tenants, perhaps a son or daughter of ours, living in those estates and having to put up with this terrorism &mdash; I can think of no better word for it?  To refer to Senator Glynn&rsquo;s point, I have been approached on numerous occasions by residents of such estates who are looking to move out or transfer because of the hassle and terror they and their children suffer as a result of these events.</P>
        <P>While these are extreme cases, there are other ongoing cases.  I am glad the Bill addresses anti-social behaviour because any local authority member to whom one speaks throughout the country has come across such cases.  The Bill refers to violence, threats and intimidation.  Unfortunately, these are commonplace in many estates throughout the country.  We on this side of the House will not be found wanting in support for any measure, in any Bill, that will help to address these issues.  It is a shame that decent, honest tenants throughout the length and breadth of the country are held to ransom by a small number of individuals who are causing distress to others.</P>
        <P>It is certainly distress that is caused.  The people who come to me, and I presume those who come to other representatives, are distressed.  They are fearful for their families and their children.  When they go home in the evening they do not know what is facing them regarding damage to their properties.  This must be rooted out.  The Minister will have support from all sides of the House for this.  There will be do-gooders saying they have to be looked after the same as everybody else but everyone wants fair play.  Anti-social behaviour is one of the largest problems in many, not just local authority, estates.  It will have to be tackled.</P>
        <P>The tenant purchase scheme allows for a maximum discount of 30%.  There were more generous ones in the past.  Perhaps the Minister could look at increasing the discount to allow people to purchase more local authority houses.  Many people in the voluntary housing schemes, including Refocus, Cluid and Respond, are precluded from buying their houses.  If they are funded by the State and local authorities, there should be some system for people living in those houses to purchase them.  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris mentioned repossessions.  There have been approximately 300 repossessions recently.  The mortgage allowance scheme provided for in the Bill could be a mechanism for people facing repossession to be referred to local authorities.  There should be negotiations rather than the banks putting people on the side of the road.  There could be some interaction with some of these schemes.  I was never a lover of the share purchase scheme, and the mortgage allowance scheme is similar, but perhaps something can be done for the increasing numbers of people having their homes repossessed.</P>
        <P>The issue of homelessness is not mentioned in the Bill.  The Minister outlined his homeless strategy a number of weeks ago, but it is disappointing that there is little mention of homelessness in the Bill.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <P>The money dried up months ago in Waterford City Council for housing aid for the elderly and the disabled person&rsquo;s grant, or housing adaptation grants as they are now called.  I am sure it is the same in many local authorities around the country.  These are some of the most vulnerable people in the community.  I spoke to a couple who applied to have a shower put in instead of a bath; they are in their 70s and cannot get in or out of the bath, and it is dangerous for them.  They applied for a grant for a shower, but they were told the money has dried up.  There is no money for heating or various adaptation grants.  Times are hard now &mdash; we have been told that &mdash;  and after next week they will be even harder.  We have prided ourselves in the past for looking after the elderly and people most in need, and I hope that continues into the future.  These are the schemes that help those people.</P>
        <P>The HSE had schemes but it does not seem to be looking after them any more.  We are told it is finalising them and handing them on to local authorities.  Will the money it was granted be handed to local authorities so that some of these people can be looked after?  What is the position?  There is a problem between the HSE and local authorities regarding the housing aid grant, and I ask the Minister to look into that.</P>
        <P>There are more than 44,000 people on local authority lists for housing.  It is a sad indictment of Government policy.  We have a problem when marriages break down.  Many males in their 40s and 50s are on housing lists, and that increases the amount that would not have been there heretofore.  It must be addressed, perhaps by building apartments.  It is predominantly men because women usually retain the house and children.  The paper we received from the Oireachtas Library research committee mentioned that many private dwellings offered for rent are in a poor state of repair.  There are many men in small flats who have visiting rights for their children, and they cannot bring children into them for a weekend.  There is a need to look after these people, especially as there are so many of them on the housing list.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister mentioned supporting the strengthening of local democracy.  We support anything that strengthens local democracy,  because over the last number of years we have seen the powers of local authorities being diluted in many ways.  The Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 excludes local authority members.  This has been a theme over the last number of years in various Bills.  We can vote against it, but we need people from other sides of the House to stand up for local authority members and representatives.  We support the strengthening of local democracy, but it must be an improvement on Better Local Government, which only benefitted the officials.  The ordinary punter did not see any improvement in the provision of local services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is the consolidation of 40 years of legislation in this area.  In his speech the Minister of State stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Housing is an issue that affects everyone.  In these turbulent days we are all too familiar with the issues arising in the housing sector, both in this country and abroad, and we are also aware of the human dimension of the steep downturn we are experiencing.  This places a public spotlight on our public policy and finances.  Are we getting value for money for our investment?  Are we efficient and effective?  Most importantly, are we protecting the most vulnerable sections of our society?</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill is timely.  The Minister of State made reference to how important a home is for everybody, be they individuals or part of a family.  People do not like to see their home under threat.  Given the turbulent times we are experiencing in the public and private sectors, people are worried about the safety and security of their homes.</P>
        <P>I envy the Minister of State his job.  Housing is one of the most important things, and the Minister of State is involved in it at an interesting time.  The downturn provides something of <Col N="314"/>an opportunity.  When I was a local authority member, we could not build houses fast enough.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did not have an exemplary record for building houses.  Much of that was due to the cost of land and similar issues.  The high cost of land was due to developers buying up the sites to build privately and that squeezed the local authority out with the result that our housing lists grew.  Is the Minister of State considering the option of purchasing houses because, given the slowdown in the housing sector there are many vacant houses and perhaps we can get value for money?</P>
        <P>I find it difficult to reconcile local authorities owning houses because, as Senator Glynn indicated, people take pride in home ownership and that brings something to a community or housing estate.  When people own houses in a housing estate that improves them greatly and it is a benefit to all the people living in the area.  However, as a former member of a local authority I am conscious also that because tenants were allowed to purchase houses local authorities lost those assets.  Where I live the houses are very expensive and there is no question of the local authority being able to afford them.  Now that housing prices are a little more realistic, does the Minister of State propose to buy some of the vacant properties around the country?</P>
        <P>It is proposed in section 13 that any moneys accruing to housing authorities from the sale of dwellings or clawbacks shall be placed in a separate account and may, with the Minister&rsquo;s approval, be used for housing related purposes.  Local authorities are due to deal with their budgets at this time and people are anxious to see what will happen with that money.  As the Minister of State no doubt appreciates, there is no reward for schemes that save money in the public service.  In fact, local authorities are penalised.  I appreciate the times are more difficult for the Government as we do not have as much money as we did in the past.  Every penny needs to be accounted for.  Is it the case that a local authority that is able to save money will be penalised for that?  I do not suggest local authorities can hide money anywhere but if they want to invest money in better housing schemes, will they be permitted to do so?</P>
        <P>Time served on a local authority can be some of the best spent in public service because one is working on the ground on issues that matter to people.  That is especially true of housing.  There is scope for expansion of the anti-social provisions in the Bill.  In my local authority of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council tenant purchase schemes provided training for new home owners on how to get used to owning their own homes.  I am pleased such measures will become more prevalent and will help combat anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State intend to consider within the scope of the Bill a provision for tenants of flats to buy their properties?  At one of the first conferences I attended as a member of a local authority I met a Labour councillor from Dublin City Council who was a tenant of the Ballymun flats.  He told me that when the Ballymun flats were being allocated initially one had to be a sterling tenant to qualify.  One had to be up to date with rent, for example, to qualify for consideration as a tenant of the Ballymun flats.  When a scheme was introduced to allow local authority tenants to purchase their own homes, tenants with any kind of get-up-and-go left.  It was then that the Ballymun flats became a type of ghetto as the less than sterling tenants remained.  The problem I see developing if people are not allowed to purchase their own flats in a block of local authority flats is that they become ghettos of sorts.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider the possibility of allowing tenants of local authority flats to purchase them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and wish him well in his job as Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  I have no doubt he has a deep interest in this aspect of local government.  Although I have some misgivings, in general, I <Col N="315"/>welcome the Bill.  Its provisions will help to address some of the problems we face in the housing area.</P>
        <P>In 1987 at a time of recession when Fine Gael and Labour went out of Government there was no waiting list for local authority houses.  One can ask what has gone wrong in the past ten years given that when we had the greatest boom in the history of the State we have the longest housing waiting lists in every local authority.</P>
        <P>It was brought to my attention recently that a number of local authorities are selling affordable homes but that they are overvalued.  As a result, people do not know whether to buy them.  The lifetime of some of those loans can be in excess of 20 years and purchasers may find that in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time when they want to buy another home they may not realise the value.  It is a sad state of affairs when people who work in fairly well paid jobs still cannot afford a home on the open market and must resort to buying an affordable home that is overvalued.  The Minister of State should examine the matter.</P>
        <P>In some towns &mdash; including one in my own county &mdash; many houses are boarded up.  Action must be taken by the Government to tackle the problem.  I do not know whether local authorities do not have the funding to deal with them.  The figure of 15% of local authority houses being vacant is bandied around.  That is a startling statistic at a time when so many are on waiting lists for local authority houses.  I cannot understand why local authorities do not give priority to this housing stock.  In Ballina a whole street of houses lie vacant and are boarded up, and that is also the case in Longford.  One wonders if the cause is a lack of funding from the local authority, if it is not channelling the funds through and why these houses are vacant and cannot be turned around more quickly.</P>
        <P>I raise the matter of the single rural house, which may not be an issue in every local authority but it is in my county, and the length of time it takes a local authority to proceed from processing an application to building it.  In many cases it takes from three to five years.  This needs to be addressed.  Such houses are a necessary evil in many cases and there is a demand for them, especially in rural, isolated areas.  These should be fast-tracked and they do not cause any great expense to a local authority.  There are only one or two in most cases on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>The case has been well made by Senators from all sides of the House for the provision of housing for single males, whether it is single or two-bedroom apartments.  There is a lack of accommodation for such people.  This matter should be examined urgently and funding should be put in place.</P>
        <P>Under section 17 councillors can make a housing plan which is similar to local authority members making a county development plan.  The plan must come before the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for approval.  I am not happy with this section, as it may be the case that the Minister is not the only person unhappy with the plan.  If a county manager is not happy with it, he will refer it to the Minister and his officials, who will take it upon themselves to change the plan to suit either the Minister or the county manager.  This is not enhancing local democracy.  If local authority members are given powers to make a housing plan for their area, the power and the consequences should lie with them.</P>

	<P>The electorate will deal with them on that basis in due course.  How can the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government make a plan for every local authority throughout the country and examine it in detail?  Every local authority should have that power and the obligation should rest with the local authority members.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to examine this matter.</P><Col N="316"/>
        <P>There have been several new aspects introduced recently.  We are all familiar with the disabled persons grant and the essential repairs grant.  However, there are new grants which I welcome.  I congratulate the Minister of State for the introduction of the housing adaptation grant, the mobility aids grant and the housing aid for elderly people grant.  My local authority, it would seem, would need considerable funding to carry out all the work entailed, given the number of applications made to the local authority.  The grants sought by applicants to Mayo County Council under these schemes totals &euro;5.7 million.  While I welcome the proposals and the new schemes, they must be backed up with extra funding.</P>
        <P>A former Member of the D&aacute;il, Dr. Jerry Cowley, provides through the Safe-Home Programme Ireland accommodation in Mulranny.  Those involved in the programme do tremendous work for people on their uppers in England, the USA and various other countries.  They bring such people back home for their last days.  In past years, these people sent home money to this country during very poor times.  Any house or extra funding that can be provided in this area is very welcome.  Any additional schemes provided by local authorities would also be very helpful and rewarding for such people in dire straits in those countries.  I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, will examine the areas I have highlighted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their kind words on my return to the House, after having spent so many years here.  I also thank Senators for their contribution to the debate on Second Stage, for their attendance during the debate and for their supportive comments on the legislation.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 is a milestone in the development of housing policy, not only in terms of the enhancement of the legislation code, but also in advancing the reform programme set out in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  The Bill will radically improve the capacity of housing authorities to plan and deliver their services in a coherent, flexible and responsive manner.  It will improve customer choice with the inclusion of the new rental accommodation scheme and the incremental purchase scheme.  It will strengthen the powers of housing authorities as social housing landlords and enablers of social housing provision.</P>
        <P>The contributions of Senators touched on a wide range of issues and I will endeavour to deal with as many of them as I can, as time allows.  Several Senators raised the issue of homelessness and the Government strategy, The Way Home.  This new Government strategy on homelessness, which I launched in August, sets out a clear vision for the future where the occurrence of homelessness is minimised.  Where it does arise, nobody will sleep rough or remain for more than six months in emergency accommodation.  This is very important.  When I launched the strategy I explained that there were people in emergency accommodation for up to eight years.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I was no longer prepared to accept this and I have set out a programme whereby we will not have people in emergency accommodation for more than six months.</P>
        <P>Substantial legislative change is not required to implement this.  The matter has been raised but we do not need new legislation.  Housing authorities already have the power to provide emergency services for homeless people by virtue of the Housing Act 1998.  This is one of a range of housing supports provided by authorities referred to in section 10.  More permanent solutions to the accommodation needs of homeless people are encompassed in the various forms of social housing support described in section 19.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the current statutory definition of homelessness in the Housing Act 1998 is sufficient.  We carried out a review of the definition for operational purposes.  Furthermore, in the context of the development of a new assessment of need for social housing support, we <Col N="317"/>will provide a nationwide, consistent standard and an objective suite of criteria.  The details of such criteria are best suited to secondary legislation and this is what the Bill provides for.  In developing these regulations we will be informed by the European typology of homelessness and housing exclusion, which were alluded to in contributions and which were the basis of consultations with The Housing Forum on the new system of assessing needs.</P>
        <P>An area of legislative change proposed in the strategy A Way Home deals with homeless action plans.  If possible we will provide the necessary statutory basis for this during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  This matter has been raised by some Senators.  Senators Bacik and Doherty questioned whether it was intended that new schemes such as the rental accommodation scheme will ultimately replace traditional local authority housing to meet housing needs.  The answer, which I wish to clearly state in this House, is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is not my intention that this will be the case.  There always will be a local authority housing programme.  This Bill, however, provides the statutory basis for a change signalled in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  That change seeks to respond to the fact that, as the range of housing needs expands and becomes more complex, so also must the response from housing authorities if those needs are to be adequately met.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A point mentioned by several Senators was the unavailability of housing units for single people in many local authorities.  I know that to be the case from my own experience of local authorities and I recognise that as a deficit in the system.  The rental accommodation scheme is an ideal opportunity to deal with many of those cases.  I see a major take-up by people in that regard and it is being used through the local authority system.</P>
        <P>This move to a more flexible and graduated range of housing supports reflects the philosophy underpinning the NESC report on housing.  We have invested significantly in housing in recent years to increase the level of output.  The Exchequer spending this year will be more than three times that in 2000.  In the past ten years, the output of newly built or acquired social housing has risen from under 4,000 units in 1998 to almost 8,700 units last year.  When other forms of social housing support and vacancies arising in the stock are taken into account, some 14,600 households&rsquo; need for social housing support were met last year.  That is a substantial figure, and there is still more to be done.</P>
        <P>Schemes such as the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are providing additional choice in meeting this diversity of need.  RAS has proven to be a very good response to the housing needs of single men, for example, which many Senators mentioned, who may not have got sufficient priority in housing lists in the past.  Senators made strong points in that regard.  If the needs of a RAS tenant or any other tenant changes, the appropriate response to that changing need can be reviewed and a different form of social housing support offered.  Section 19 reflects this new reality, pulling together the various elements of social housing support that are available to meet the diversity of existing and emerging housing needs.</P>
        <P>A number of Members, including Senators Coffey, Brady, Ellis and others, referred to the issue of vacancies in the local authority stock.  The rate of such vacancies is monitored as part of the local authority annual service indicators as we are concerned to use our existing stock effectively.  I understand that the median average for all local authorities at the end of 2007 indicated that 4% of dwellings were empty.  That is the figure available to us.  While there are many legitimate reasons for vacancies, we have strongly encouraged local authorities to turn around stock as quickly as possible.  The local government audit service will be carrying out a value for money audit on housing management and maintenance in local authorities in 2009 and I look forward to seeing the results of that work to examine how we can make further progress on that issue.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley raised the issue of the programme of works, people who save money and so on.  Those are the type of internal receipts we see them use for the upgrading of existing stock.  We would hope, through the service plans of the council, that is what would be done.  There would not be any penalty involved.  It would be a matter for the local authority members through the service plan.  We see that as one area of the service plan where they could decide to implement a programme of refurbishment and upgrading of existing local authority stock.</P>
        <P>I share the concern expressed by many Senators that local authorities should have mechanisms available to deal with anti-social behaviour in their estates.  I understand from all Senators here and from contributions on the previous day that everybody is concerned about that matter.  The legislation currently before this House, and which I hope will be enacted by the Oireachtas, will not solve this problem on its own.  We must examine the reasons behind homelessness or anti-social behaviour.  There is not just one reason.  There are several reasons including family breakdown, addiction, be it drugs or alcohol, mental health problems and a range of other problems and therefore a range of agencies is needed to deal with the problem.  What I am doing is putting in place a framework into which those agencies will be able to dovetail, whether it is the Garda, local authority members, the Health Service Executive, Neighbourhood Watch or community groups.  They all have a part to play and I hope that will happen because anti-social behaviour is a scourge in some areas of our cities, towns and villages.  It is a major problem for tenants who look after their houses and live within the laws as laid down by the State.  Having their lives upset by anti-social behaviour is a major intrusion into their lives.</P>
        <P>Anti-social behaviour can threaten the sustainability of communities and further disadvantage vulnerable households.  The provisions of the Bill go some way to improving the existing regime by updating the definition of anti-social behaviour and introducing anti-social behaviour strategies in section 34.  In conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, I am examining the scope for further changes to existing legislation that will enhance the role of housing authorities in addressing anti-social behaviour.  I will incorporate any further measures in this area during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised important points which I will address.  Senator Carty raised a number of issues.  He complimented the voluntary housing sector on its good work, and I endorse that.  We are fortunate that so many people have moved into the area of bringing forward schemes in the voluntary housing sector.  They are providing good accommodation for people in need.</P>
        <P>On private rental accommodation, ancillary services is a broader issue.  It is important that housing estates, whether they be private, public or a mixture of both, have ancillary services including schools, shops and so on because they cannot develop into a community otherwise.  One of my roles, apart from the one on housing and urban renewal, is the development of new areas.  That is an area on which I intend to focus a great deal in the future.  We are drawing up plans on areas throughout the country and I will insist that the Departments play their part in the plans being developed for those areas.  The local authorities will be the policy makers to the extent that they will come forward with proposals to my Department but other Departments will have responsibility as well.  There is no point in a Department saying it will deal with a particular school, road or library issue at another time.  We must have integration.  There is no point in talking about sustainable communities if we do not start from the bottom, that is, we must have integration of services in those new developing areas with the community to allow us build a sustainable community.</P>
        <P>The Senator mentioned the housing service plans, which other Senators mentioned also.  The housing service plans are a reserve function of the local authority.  They were raised in the <Col N="319"/>debate under two headings.  Senator Norris said he did not want them to have autonomy to the extent that their plans would be the bible, as it were, and Senator Burke indicated that he did not want the Minister to have any major involvement.  A bit of both would not go astray.  It is a reserve function but it is necessary that the housing service plan dovetails into the national strategy.  I hope that will be the case but the local authorities are the people on the ground and if the county manager, with the local authority members, bring forward a plan it will then go forward from the Executive.  If conflict arises in some situations the Minister may have to take action.  That process is available as a precaution to ensure the national strategy is in place.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris made a very good point about the human dimension, which was made also by Senator O&rsquo;Malley, namely, that in a downturn those who cannot shout loudly can be forgotten.  I hope that will not be the case.  I will be keen to ensure the importance of the human dimension is emphasised.  People&rsquo;s homes are very important to them.  I am responsible for ensuring people remain our priority.</P>
      
        <P>Repossessions were mentioned by a couple of Senators.  When I held my previous portfolio, I raised this issue with the Irish Banking Federation and the Financial Regulator.  It does not bother me to say that banks and financial institutions should pursue repossession as a last resort.  All possible avenues of resolution, such as discussion, should be explored before repossession is considered.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked about a certain figure.  It is really a matter for each local authority.  We allocate a certain sum of money to each authority.  I think approximately &euro;2.5 billion is allocated within the voluntary housing sector.  The local authorities are responsible for spending this money.  I understand commitments have been made in that regard for 2008.  Other money has been allocated through the grants system, etc.  Any money which has not been drawn down has, of course, been accounted for.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Senator also spoke about the assessment of needs, which is something I feel strongly about.  There was a time when a person&rsquo;s name was put on a local authority housing list without his or her needs being assessed.  I do not want that to continue.  If a person asks a local authority to be considered for rehousing or some other form of housing support, in any of the ways open to the local authority, his or her needs should be assessed so that the most suitable form of support can be ascertained.  The authority should not wait two or three years to conduct such an assessment.  Local authorities in all parts of the country are doing that, however.  I want people to be assessed.  Local authorities should have a designated staff member whose job is to assess people as they make applications.  He or she should be responsible for telling people whether they are suitable for participation in the local authority housing scheme or perhaps more suited to one of the schemes being provided for in this legislation, such as the incremental purchase scheme.  We should not leave people in limbo.  In many cases, people are left in limbo for many years.</P>

	<P>We have a responsibility to provide for early assessment.  The housing grants schemes were mentioned by a number of Senators.  Demand under the adaptation grants scheme has accelerated this year.  Annual expenditure on the scheme has increased from &euro;13 million to &euro;71 million over the past ten years.  There has been a major increase in activity.  Some 74,000 grants have been paid under the scheme since 1997.  In other words, 74,000 people, including people with disabilities, have been helped to stay in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  It is a sizeable figure.  Local authorities are to be complimented on the manner in which they have dealt with the scheme.  I have some queries about prioritisation, however.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government meets 80% of the cost of the housing adaptation grants scheme, with the local authorities making a 20% contribution.  In May of this year, I announced that a combined capital allocation of &euro;71.4 million was being made available to local authorities for the operation of the scheme in private houses in 2008.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each scheme from the combined allocation made available to it.  Each authority must manage the operation of each scheme in its area from this allocation.</P>
        <P>I recognise that in a number of local authority areas, the demand for the housing adaptation grants scheme has outstripped the level of funding available this year.  In recognition of the crucial role these grants play in supporting independent living by older people and people with disabilities, the Department has recently allocated an additional round of funding to a number of local authorities which have encountered particularly significant levels of demand.  I hope to be in a position to announce a second round of additional allocations to local authorities in the event of further moneys becoming available.  In the meantime, it is essential that all local authorities continue to accept and process applications on a prioritised basis in line with existing resources.  This is necessary if they are to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable sectors of the community are addressed quickly and effectively.  It is important to prioritise.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond briefly to Senators&rsquo; questions about the special housing aid for the elderly scheme.  I will update the House on the arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the scheme from the Health Service Executive to the local authority sector.  As Senators are aware, the Government decided in February 2006 that a more integrated service could be achieved if responsibility for the scheme were to be transferred in such a manner.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government already had responsibility for the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes.  The new housing aid for older people scheme amalgamates the provisions of the essential repairs grant scheme and the special aid for the elderly scheme.  It provides assistance to older people who need certain improvements and repairs to be carried out.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the fact that the transfer of responsibility for the scheme to local authorities would pose significant challenges to the workloads and resources of the authorities, and to ensure the satisfactory resolution of the outstanding issues, it was agreed that the special housing aid for the elderly scheme would continue to be operated and administered by the HSE until March 2008.  There are some outstanding matters regarding staff and completion of works.  Consideration of such matters is ongoing.  I hope it will be brought to a conclusion in the near future.</P>
        <P>I would like to respond to one or two other points that were made.  Senator Cummins asked about local democracy in the context of housing plans.  He pointed out that the Green Paper, <Col N="321"/>which is being considered at present, is one of the most important aspects of this issue.  It is obvious that local authority members have had a say in that.  I was at the launch of two of the six regional seminars which were held throughout the country.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s comments about the plight of the most vulnerable during the downturn.</P>
        <P>This country&rsquo;s 30,000 vacant houses were mentioned by Senators.  It has been suggested that local authorities should purchase houses and large areas where vacant houses are located.  The Department no longer has a policy of reverting back to large local authority estates.  The purchase of large areas for local authority purposes, or for rehousing, is not an option.  It would not comply with the Department&rsquo;s thinking on the development of integrated and sustainable communities.  It may be the case that some houses could be acquired, but that is a matter for each local authority, such as Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>Not all the houses in question are in locations where houses are wanted.  I understand that 10,000 of the houses in question are in Dublin, with a further 20,000 in other parts of the country.  They are not all in areas where need exists.  When local authorities submit plans to the Department, they must be based on need.  There is no point in going ahead with housing developments, on the voluntary side or on the local authority side, unless they are based on need.  That is the bottom line, especially now that we cannot be as flath&uacute;lach with finances as we were in the past.  We will not be able to provide for the increases in housing development which were observed in the past.  It is important for all allocations, and all requests made to the Department, to be based on need.  We can then respond on the basis of such need.</P>
        <P>I was also asked about tenant purchase schemes, which are important.  We hope to introduce amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage &mdash; perhaps not in this House, but certainly in the D&aacute;il &mdash; to provide for the sale of flats to existing tenants.  On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, we will bring forward proposals for the sale of flats to existing tenants.  It is an intricate area and there are legal considerations to be taken into account by the Department, the Attorney General and by outside legal people.  However, it is my intention to come forward with a scheme for the sale of flats to tenants during the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The tenant purchase scheme was also raised.  There is a tenant purchase scheme in existence at present.  It is based on a 3% discount of the market value of the house for a ten year period, which means 30%.  In addition to that, a sum of &euro;3,809 is also deducted.  For example, if the market value of a house is &euro;140,000, that tenant can buy the house for &euro;94,200.  I do not have any proposals to change the scheme but I will always keep those things under review.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised the issue of single rural houses.  That might not seem important in Dublin or Cork, but it is still an issue with many local authorities where houses have been run down and are not capable of being repaired.  In those circumstances, county managers and housing officers still deal in the provision of rural houses.  This means that the person and his family are maintained in that rural area and they hold the fabric of that town or village together.  There is still a need for that.  Some elderly people may wish to move into a village where there are more services, but in rural townlands there is still a need for it.</P>
        <P>Our focus has been in establishing a sufficiently robust foundation to allow the sale to proceed, but I have already said that.  I am encouraged by the supportive comments here today, and the constructive contribution made on Second Stage, and I look forward to dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage and to interacting with Members of the House on it.</P>

    <Title>Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 for the consideration of the House.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to certain aspects of the Government&rsquo;s ports policy which was launched in January 2005.  In line with the objectives of the ports policy, this Bill will underpin and enhance further the commercial freedom conferred on the State&rsquo;s port companies under the Harbours Act 1996 to better reflect the changing environment in which they operate.</P>
        <P>As an island nation, Ireland is dependent upon seaborne trade and the economic significance and importance of our ports to the State&rsquo;s prosperity is self-evident.  Given our open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness is central to overall economic performance.</P>
        <P>Our ports are vital gateways for commercial freight and sea passengers.  This is highlighted by the fact that nine of the ten commercial State port companies are located in areas identified as gateways in the national spatial strategy.  It is estimated that in 2007 merchandise goods to the value of &euro;135 billion were transported along the Irish maritime supply chain.  That figure is equivalent to 75% of our gross domestic product at current market prices.  One of the core objectives of my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2008-2010 in relation to ports is to ensure &ldquo;investment in ports meets capacity requirements and to facilitate the availability of commercial port services which are effective, competitive and cost efficient&rdquo;.  I am confident this Bill will enhance the ability of my Department and the maritime sector to meet this objective.</P>
        <P>The year 2003 saw publication of the high level review of the State commercial ports operating under the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2000.  This review was the first to be undertaken since the enactment of the Harbours Act 1996.  That Act changed the status of the State&rsquo;s ports from harbour authorities functioning under the Harbours Act 1946 to commercial port companies under the terms of the Harbours Act 1996 and gave them the commercial freedom to operate as modern customer-orientated service industries.  The remit of the 2003 review was to examine critically the current model for the governance of the State commercial ports.</P>
        <P>On foot of publication of the review, a comprehensive consultation process was initiated which involved interested parties making both written and oral submissions on future ports policy.  The responses received fed into and informed the content and recommendations of the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement in 2005.  The principal aims of the ports policy statement were to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs through clearer and more focused commercial mandates for the ports and their boards, enhancing board performance through reform of the structure of port boards, encouragement of private sector investment and involvement, sanction for the use of non-core <Col N="323"/>assets to fund new port development but not to mask inefficiencies, and encouragement of healthy competitive conditions within and also between ports.</P>
        <P>Since the launch of the ports policy statement, the Department&rsquo;s strategy has been to focus on implementing the recommended actions contained therein.  This Bill is another important step towards ensuring our commercial ports are equipped to meet the challenges ahead in the competitive economic climate within which they operate.</P>
        <P>A number of the objectives contained within the ports policy statement require legislative change and the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 is designed to incorporate these important recommendations into primary legislation.  The Bill also addresses certain anomalies in respect of that Act, which have come to light since its enactment.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill are considered necessary in light of a period of considerable change undergone by Irish ports over the past decade.  The Bill will help to ensure they are equipped to grow as an integral driver of our economic success in the future.  In particular, it is considered critical that commercial ports are given the capacity to provide cost-effective and efficient services to meet the needs of their customers, the State and the national economy.  These high level targets could be described as being the ultimate objectives of this Bill.</P>
        <P>While the explanatory and financial memorandum which was circulated to Members of the House along with the Bill contains a brief explanation of all of the sections of the Bill, I will highlight some of the significant changes and discuss them in greater detail.</P>
        <P>One of the key challenges facing our commercial State ports is the provision of adequate and efficient capacity to ensure our economy can continue to grow and prosper.  Notwithstanding the changed economic environment the ports and, indeed, the country are in currently, the ability to respond to capacity needs remains a critical concern for our ports and our economy in general.  In response to a national ports capacity study commissioned by the Department in 2005, a number of ports submitted significant development proposals to address potential capacity requirements identified by the study.</P>
        <P>One such proposal was that submitted by Drogheda Port Company on the development of a new port at Bremore.  To facilitate this development it was proposed to alter the harbour limits of Drogheda Port Company.  However, advice received from the Attorney General indicated that section 9 of the Harbours Act 1996 does not contain sufficient principles and policies to allow such an alteration under section 9(2)(<i>a</i>) and that the change proposed was not sufficiently technical to allow the limits of the harbour, listed in the Third Schedule of the 1996 Act, to be changed by secondary legislation.  I have no doubt Senators will be aware that this advice is in line with the rulings given in the City View Press and Mulcreevy judgments.</P>
        <P>Therefore, section 3 of this Bill will amend section 9 of the Principal Act and will allow a Minister to make an order that may either extend or move a company&rsquo;s harbour limits as defined in Part I of the Third Schedule to the 1996 Act.  Any extension to a company&rsquo;s harbour limits is not restricted to an area contiguous to a company&rsquo;s existing harbour limits; it may be an extension to include any area irrespective of location.  However, in accordance with the legal advice received, there are a number of specific principles and policies a Minister must consider when making any order under this section.  These include planning applications or planning permissions under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, various regulatory processes under the Foreshore Act 1933, navigational safety and also the present and expected capacity of the harbour.  This amendment will facilitate a port company&rsquo;s growth either by expanding its existing harbour limits or designating additional areas as within the port company&rsquo;s harbour limits.</P>
        <P>The amendments contained within section 9 will allow port companies or a subsidiary, or either of them, to borrow up to &euro;200 million or 50% of the value of their fixed assets, dependent <Col N="324"/>upon whichever is the higher.  The borrowings will remain subject to the consent both of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance.  Additionally, the Bill specifies the principles and policies to which a Minister should have regard, should an order varying the 50% limit be made.</P>
        <P>Another key focus of the ports policy statement was to enhance the commercial mandate of the port companies and to facilitate improved port company board performance through the reform of their board structure.  The Bill sets out to achieve this aim through a number of important amendments.</P>
        <P>Sections 4 and 5 seek to expand the commercial freedom of the port companies by providing a clear legislative basis to underpin investment by port companies outside their current harbour limits, as defined in the 1996 Act.  The sections also allow for port company investment outside the State where a port company views such investment to be desirable and appropriate from a business perspective, subject to the approval of the Minister of Transport and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Previously, port companies were restricted under section 11(4)(<i>d</i>) from investing outside the State unless such investment would &ldquo;promote the interests of trade or tourism in the State&rdquo;.  Section 4 deletes this restrictive section.  Section 5 provides that port companies may invest outside their harbour limits, which includes investment opportunities outside the State, provided that ministerial consent from both the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance has been granted.</P>
        <P>This provision regarding investment outside a company&rsquo;s harbour limits is considered appropriate to underpin and enhance the commercial freedom conferred on port companies under the 1996 Act and is one that is available to other commercial State bodies such as the Dublin Airport Authority and the ESB.</P>
        <P>This Bill also contains a number of amendments designed to enhance board performance through reform of the structure of port boards.  Currently, boards consist of 12 members and their membership is comprised of three directors appointed on the nomination of the local authority; one or two employee directors, depending on the size of the company, either elected by the employees or appointed by the Minister to represent their interests; the chief executive officer; and the remaining board members who are appointed at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
        <P>Twelve directors is considered excessive for the State port companies. In the case of some of the smaller companies, the number of directors is greater than the number of employees.  Therefore, section 8 amends the articles of association of the companies to provide that the number of directors shall not exceed eight.  This reduction will be achieved by the abolition of the statutory appointment of local authority directors and a standardisation of employee board membership in order that all port companies will in future have not more than one employee director.  Notwithstanding these changes, it is intended that all current directors will serve their full terms of office.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline in greater detail the rationale behind these amendments and the context in which they are being made.  With regard to local authority membership of port boards, a performance audit of the companies in 2001-02, undertaken by Jonathan Packer, recommended that the statutory provision for local authority directors be abolished.  The 2003 high-level review of the State commercial ports concurred with this recommendation and concluded that the practise of appointing port users, local councillors and those without relevant experience should cease.</P>
        <P>The developments that have occurred in the sector since the Harbours Act 1996 have resulted in a major organisational and cultural change within the ports.  While there have been substan<Col N="325"/>tial and valuable inputs from local authority directors through the years, the rationale for such statutory representation on the boards of State bodies, operating under a statutory commercial remit, is no longer compelling.  No similar practice exists in other commercial State companies, such as the airports.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, it is my intention to continue to appoint a local authority director from among my own statutory nominees.  This decision is consistent with the principles set out in the ports policy statement.  It will help to alleviate the understandable concerns of those who feel that this removal of the statutory provision represents an unwelcome break from tradition.  The appointment of port users to boards of the commercial State port companies can lead to conflicts of interest and, in line with the port policy statement, this practice will cease with regard to all future appointments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 11 provides that no person may be recommended for appointment to a board if that person, within the three years preceding the recommendation, had a charge imposed upon him or her by that company under section 13 of the Act, was an employee of a person who had a charge so imposed, had provided a significant commercial service to that port company, or was an employee of a person who had provided such a service.  The section also provides for a recommending person who is unsure if a service provided to a company would constitute a significant service to advise the Minister of the facts and the Minister may decide whether the service provided constitutes a significant commercial service.  While this section will prevent directors who have close commercial connections with a particular port being appointed to that board, it will not prevent the appointment of individuals with valuable industry expertise who do not have commercial connections to the port in question.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, the reduction in board sizes will see employee representation set at one employee director, irrespective of port company size.  Currently, a system applies whereby those companies with more than 50 employees appoint two employee directors following a ballot as per regulations set out in the Fifth Schedule to the Act.  Companies with between 30 and 50 employees appoint one director following a similar ballot.  However, the practice of holding elections, as prescribed in section 30 of the 1996 Act, can lead to practical difficulties in its application, as there are companies whose employee numbers are subject to fluctuation during any given year.  This can lead to companies exceeding the threshold level for an election, which leads to a ballot being triggered under section 30 of the 1996 Act, only for the numbers to fall later below the threshold level &mdash; for example, due to retirement.</P>
        <P>Such a scenario can lead to unnecessary expense for port companies and, therefore, section 11 proposes to address this matter by introducing an &ldquo;averaging&rdquo; system similar to that enacted in the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986, relating to the calculation of the average number of employees of a company during any given year.  Elections for employee directors will be held in companies where the average number of employees will exceed 30.  All references in the Act to the threshold of 50 employees will be removed, as all companies will now appoint only one employee director.  In the case of companies with less than 30 employees, the Minister will continue to appoint a person who, in his or her opinion, is representative of the interests of the company.</P>
        <P>Turning to regional harbours, the ports policy statement made a number of points in respect of the harbour authorities operating under the Harbours Act 1946.  It stated that the continued operation of many of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance.  The statement  reiterated the view that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local control in cases where there is little or no commercial traffic and, in harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration will be given to bringing them under the control of a <Col N="326"/>nearby port company.  The Bill underpins these statements by providing the necessary legislative base to enable these options to be fully realised.  A number of amendments in sections 17 and 18 provide this necessary legislative change.</P>
        <P>In 1996, consideration was given to establishing a commercial port company in respect of Arklow harbour.  Accordingly, it was not included in the list of harbours in section 87(2) of the Harbours Act 1996, which could, subject to a ministerial order, be transferred to a relevant local authority.  Due to the fact that Arklow harbour now has no significant commercial traffic, it is considered appropriate that it should appear in this list, which will permit its transfer to local authority control along with other similar harbours across the country.  Section 17 will, therefore, delete Arklow harbour from the list of harbours to be established as port companies and include it in the list of harbours in section 87(2), which may be transferred to local authority control subject to a ministerial order.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, the ports policy statement provided that in the case of harbour authorities where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration would be given to bringing such harbours under the control of a port company.  As significant commercial traffic exists only at Bantry Bay and Tralee and Fenit pier and harbour, it is not considered necessary to introduce a general provision allowing for such a transfer.  Section 18 deals specifically with these two harbours.</P>
        <P>Upon enactment of this Bill, the Minister for Transport will have the necessary authority, under section 87A(2), to make an order transferring Bantry Bay harbour to the Port of Cork Company and to transfer Tralee and Fenit pier and harbour to Shannon Foynes Port Company.  Such a provision is consistent with the recommendations of the Ports Policy Statement and ensures that each of these harbour authorities has access to the best regional port management expertise, marketing skills and strategic development planning.</P>
        <P>The Bill also contains a number of amendments to the Harbours Act 1996 in relation to pilotage and pilotage services.  These changes address a number of issues identified since the original Act was passed and also changes that are required on foot of other amendments I have already discussed, such as the provision to alter harbour limits.</P>
        <P>Sections 12 and 16 contain useful amendments to the powers of a Minister to alter the limits of a pilotage district.  These amendments mirror the proposed changes contained in section 3 relating to harbour limits and allow for a ministerial order to alter the limits of a pilotage district having regard to certain principles and policies.</P>
        <P>Section 16 also corrects an anomaly that has arisen with regard to the provision of pilotage services by harbour authorities.  The Pilotage Act 1913 was repealed in its entirety by virtue of a statutory instrument made under the Harbours Act 1996.  While a saving clause was included in the Harbours Act regarding by-laws made under the Pilotage Act 1913 with regard to the pilotage districts of port companies, no such clause was included for those of harbour authorities.</P>
        <P>Therefore, this section empowers the Minister for Transport to not only re-organise pilotage services as outlined previously, but to also confer on a specified person the function of organising and ensuring the provision of pilotage services in the particular pilotage district.  This will enable a Minister for Transport to designate the relevant harbour authority or local authority, as the case may be, to be that specified person and will address the issue caused by the repeal of the Pilotage Act 1913.</P>
        <P>Sections 13, 14 and 15 make further changes to the pilotage provisions contained in the 1996 Act by harmonising elements of the regulations regarding pilotage charges with those of harbour charges, re-adjusting the bond payable by a pilot in terms of limiting his liability and <Col N="327"/>updating the regulations around pilotage exemption certificates.  These changes ensure that the Act is updated to take into account the changes that have occurred since its enactment in 1996.</P>
        <P>The final element of this Bill I propose to highlight is section 7, which pertains to the transfer of certain ministerial responsibility regarding the compulsory purchase of land by port companies to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Currently, port companies seeking to make a compulsory purchase order must apply for a ministerial acquisition order under the Fourth Schedule to the Harbours Act 1996.  While this function has only been exercised once since its enactment, it is felt more appropriate that this power be transferred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la given its role, pursuant to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, as the determining body in respect of planning consent for strategic infrastructure developments at commercial ports.</P>
        <P>With this new role conferred on the board since 2006 with regard to strategic infrastructure, it is anticipated that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will over time acquire and build up a body of expertise and experience on the planning aspects of major infrastructural development generally and particularly, in this case, in port projects.  In these circumstances, a strong case can be made that the board would be better placed to adjudicate on port company applications for the compulsory acquisition of land rather than the Minister of the day.  In light of the above, and the fact that similar functions with regard to the compulsory acquisition of land by Aer Rianta &mdash; now the Dublin Airport Authority &mdash; were transferred to the board under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, I believe that this proposal is the correct approach to take with regard to the State commercial ports.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the Bill will further underpin the commercial ethos introduced into our ports sector by the Harbours Act 1996.  With the enactment of the Bill, our State commercial ports will be better placed to respond to the challenges posed by the demanding environment in which they operate.  It is evident to all of us that one of the cornerstones of our economic success is the ability of our ports to adapt to changing markets and to have the commercial ability to build upon their success for the future.  I am confident the Bill will help accommodate those objectives and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am deputising for Senator Donohoe who is my party&rsquo;s spokesperson in this area.  As an employee of Waterford Port for over 20 years, a former chairman of the old harbour commissioners and a director of the first port board in 1996, I have a long-standing interest in portal affairs, harbours and, in particular, commercial ports in the country.</P>
        <P>This is important legislation.  I wish to identify what we in Fine Gael believe to be the key priorities for it, the main questions which need to be answered and the issues to be resolved, possibly on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main policy document for evaluating this legislation is the Ports Policy Statement of 2005.  It recognises, first, that our ports are essential to our nation&rsquo;s prosperity &mdash; ten ports bring through almost 99% of the goods that are essential to our prosperity.  Second, it identifies two crucial challenges.  There is a shortfall of 12.2 million tonnes of goods to be carried between now and 2015; in other words, there is not the capacity to meet the present and, indeed, future demands on our economy.  Third, there will be a funding shortfall.  In the challenging days in which we find ourselves, this may be even bigger than we think.  These three challenges must be met, which is why this legislation is so important.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has identified a number of concerns regarding the legislation which we will seek to have answered and resolved on Committee Stage.  First, we must further understand the power which this Bill allows the port authorities to compulsorily purchase land.  It is unclear to <Col N="328"/>us at this stage whether the existing power is being reallocated or additional power is being created, and this needs to be clarified.</P>
        <P>Second, we believe that any port development must recognise the local conditions and environment within which the port is situated.  This Bill is not strong enough in this regard.  It must take more account of the county and city development plans.  This is a necessity.</P>
        <P>Third, we have real concerns about the further reduction of the role of local politicians.  The Bill is a further attack on local democracy and the men and women who do vital work for their communities, which we must acknowledge and continue to support.  This is another attack on the fine work of local authorities by the Government.</P>
        <P>The number of port authority directors is being reduced from 12 to eight.  The number of directors appointed by the local authority is being reduced from three to a possible one.  In Waterford, for instance, there is one from Waterford city, one from Waterford county and one from County Kilkenny, where the port is situated.  The legislation states that the Minister may appoint from within his own nominations one director.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister of State referred to a 2001-02 report which recommended that statutory provision of local authorities directors be abolished.  Can we have the reasons local authority members should not be members of port authorities or regional harbour authorities?  As a former member of those boards, I am aware that the board members who were local authority members were conversant with the local issues and did not have any vested interests.  I acknowledge the point made regarding port users, that they should not have membership of the boards because of a potential conflict of interest, but I can see no reason why local authority members should not be members of these boards.  The reduction is a retrograde step.  The Members on the Government side of the House have raised this issue on numerous occasions.  There has been a flow of legislation through the House in which civil servants have decided that local authority members should not be members of semi-State boards.  Why should people with interest and experience in local authorities, who can and should be members of these boards, be excluded?  They are elected by the people.  Why exclude them?</P>
      
        <P>This rat race to keep local authority members off these boards can only be stopped by the Members on the Government side of the House.  We can shout until kingdom come and people can nod and agree with us but the Members on the Government side must stand up and call a halt to this.  What we are saying about local authority members is correct, especially in this instance with regard to the Harbours (Amendment) Bill.  I hope we will have support on Committee Stage and that the Government Members will call a halt to this and stop the erosion of the powers of local authority members.</P>
        <P>I agree with the recommendation that port users should probably be excluded from directorships of the port companies because of a possible conflict of interest.  I saw what has happened in the past so I have no difficulty with that provision.  However, I have a difficulty with that policy where local authority members are concerned.</P>
        <P>The fourth point which must be addressed is the amalgamation of port authorities.  This requires careful consideration.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on the need for the amalgamation of port authorities.  I consider it a good idea but the issue should be teased out a little more.</P>
        <P>Fifth, we must be careful in our definition of commercial activity.  The prime function and role of the ports is to cater for the shipping needs of our economy.  All other activities are ancillary to that function.  The increase in the borrowing capacity of port companies is welcome.  The port companies will have less restrictive obligations under the Bill and that is also welcome. <Col N="329"/> The commercial activity of ports must be assisted.  A total of 98% of the goods that come into this country come through our ports so they deserve every possible assistance.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael understands the need for this legislation and the policy behind it.  However, important questions must be dealt with.  We will certainly not tolerate a further assault on the rights of local authority members and local politicians who do such good work on the boards of port companies and regional harbour boards.  I hope our concerns will be considered and addressed on Committee Stage and that we will have the full support of Members on the Government side of the House in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an opportunity for us to examine the situation in the country&rsquo;s ports.  I agree with Senator Cummins on one issue.  The race to remove elected local authority members from public bodies arose previously with the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  On that occasion the Minister accepted an amendment that originated from the Government side of the House and was agreed by all sides.  The same should be done with port authorities.  If the membership of a port company is to be reduced to eight, there should be a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the number of local authority members.  When the membership was 12, there were three local authority members, so consideration should be given to two of the eight members being local authority members.</P>
        <P>The local authority plays a major role for ports.  It is responsible for roads to the port and for overall development in the port area.  The Minister has discretion to appoint a local authority member to the board but that does not mean the Minister will not be lobbied by every Member seeking to have X, Y or Z appointed, not because he or she might be the best person to do the job but because we will all be put under the famous old political pressure to do something for the individual.  The local authorities have always been reasonably fair in making these appointments and, in most cases, have politically divided them to ensure a balance.  Irrespective of who the Minister of the day will be, he or she will have to bow to his or her political colleagues when appointing a local authority member.  It might be easier for the Minister if the local authorities appointed their own representatives.  The Minister would then only have to worry about appointing people who have the commercial orientation necessary to develop our ports further.</P>
        <P>This Bill was undertaken as a result of the Jonathan Packer report.  That report is six years old.  I have fears about depending on something that old.  I am aware the Minister has taken the advice of the Department about this but reflecting on something that is six years old and trying to move on from that to frame legislation could result in the legislation being out of date before it is out of the Houses.  There will be anomalies left, right and centre because of the development that has taken place in this country over the past ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a degree of concern about some of the smaller ports that are due to be subsumed into the larger ports.  That is the case with Bantry and the two Kerry ports.  A case should be made for some of these smaller ports.  Bantry, for example, is used by only a few people but it has quite an amount of cash reserves, which cannot be said for some of the other ports.  Something could be done to allow that port to continue as an independent entity.  I am saying this too on behalf of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, who regrettably cannot be present today.  He has expressed a view on this issue and I accept that view.  I saw what happened with the rationalisation of co-operatives.  The smaller co-operatives that had cash were taken over by the bigger players who needed the cash reserves to keep themselves in business.  The same is happening with Bantry.  I urge the Minister to review this and see if something can be done to maintain the port as it is.</P>
        <P>I have fears about An Bord Plean&aacute;la being the deciding body in land acquisition.  If it takes that body as long to deal with land acquisition for a port as it does to give decisions on any <Col N="330"/>type of complicated or semi-complicated planning case, the port&rsquo;s need would be long past before it could get access to the land.  It would be more understandable if the planning element were sent immediately to An Bord Plean&aacute;la rather than going through the local authority, but that is not suggested in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There is a need to remove bodies such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and as many other quangos as possible from legislation.  They prevent progress.  At least when a Minister has to make a decision, it is up to those in the Department to implement it.  However, if, for example, the proposed new port in north Dublin is sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will be there for eternity.  Something must be done about this.  The compulsory purchase order powers should remain vested in the Minister rather than be handed over to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I can understand the issue going to the outside body for planning once the area to be acquired has been decided, but definitely not the acquisition.  The Minister should review this.</P>
        <P>After all, this takes away some of the Minister&rsquo;s powers.  I doubt any Member wants that to happen in this case.  Too much ministerial power has been given to quangos over recent years.  There is a need for Ministers to exercise their powers.  Ministerial office does not simply mean dealing with public relations matters all the time.  The office exists to take decisions that are in the national interest.  The best people to make those decisions are politicians, irrespective of their political parties.  Politicians must face the electorate and people who do not should have only an implementation role.  This applies to practically every body in this country.  When Ministers make decisions, nine times out of ten they are much better than those made by the quangos.  Considerable power has been ceded to the latter by Ministers in the past 20 to 25 years, or since I first came into this House.  This is regrettable as far as John Citizen is concerned because he cannot gain access to anybody with decision-making power.</P>
        <P>There is a need for total rationalisation of many of the quangos, which are not answerable to anybody.  A Minister is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or committees thereof.  However, some of the quangos, if invited to appear before an Oireachtas committee, would tell it they had no responsibility in that regard and did not have to accept anything.  They are autonomous and have far too much power in the development of this country.</P>
        <P>A number of major ports are not mentioned in the legislation.  Who will set the port tariffs?  Will the bigger users be treated preferentially to kill off the smaller users of some of our ports?  We have all heard allegations in recent weeks to the effect that large companies are getting much more beneficial rates than some of the small ones.  I have written to the chairman of the port concerned to determine whether this is the case.  If it is, the small operators will never be able to develop shipping lines from this country.  We have all seen the detrimental effect of monopolies on our economy.  The Minister of State pointed out in his opening remarks that 75% of our exports leave by sea.  This places an enormous responsibility on the Government to ensure there will be equal access and help in respect of ports and their development.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the north Dublin port and the one in Drogheda.  Further north there are ports in Greenore, Warrenpoint, Larne and Derry.  In the west, Killybegs is being developed further as a port.  What co-ordination is there between the Department of Transport, which now has responsibility for ports, and its counterpart in Northern Ireland?  It is important to the part of the country from where I come that there be good access to Derry, Warrenpoint or Larne, which have been used traditionally by port traffic.  Much traffic from the west and north west of the Republic has gone through these ports.</P>
        <P>A co-ordinated effort could lead to major savings right across the board.  It is desirable that one be able to avail of a proper service from the nearest port rather than having to hawk commodities from Donegal to Waterford or Rosslare.  It is a much shorter spin to Larne, <Col N="331"/>Warrenpoint or Dublin.  This needs to be considered.  When we create a full port policy, we should do so on a national basis and seek agreement from our elected colleagues in Northern Ireland that this be the approach.  This is very important and I appeal to the Minister of State to determine what can be done in this regard.</P>
        <P>We would all support the concept of ports having sufficient capability to borrow.  If they are to be competitive, they must have the most modern equipment, be it X-ray equipment, handling equipment or otherwise.</P>
        <P>I am a little worried over who decides what constitutes 50% of the value of a port.  Is it calculated by the auditors in their report to the port company or is there an actual valuation?  Much of the value is theoretical and I hope that, because of the way in which we have increased the sum that may be borrowed by a port, they will not end up in debt beyond their capacity to repay.  Some ports are dependent on certain lines of business.  If they were to lose that business or certain commodity businesses, they would find very quickly that they could not honour major commitments.</P>
        <P>We all welcome this Bill because we need to upgrade our ports as much as possible.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider on Committee Stage an amendment to allow for local authority members to be represented<i> </i>on a<i> pro rata</i> basis.  Given that the number of directors is to be reduced from 12 to eight, the number of local authority members should be reduced from three to two.</P>
        <P>When appointing ministerial nominees, the only people who should be considered are those with a commercial background who know what needs to be done.  They may be associated with another port some distance away or with international trade, but they must understand what needs to be done.  The day of appointing somebody because he or she is a good accountant, county manager or county secretary is over.  The day should come on which all ports will be run as commercial entities with the intention of making them profitable and improving the manner in which they can facilitate exportation and importation.  We must accept traffic in both directions.  If we do not run them as commercial entities, they will end up being run out of business by our colleagues in Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak on this important and controversial Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who was in this House on many occasions during the last term in his various capacities as Minister of State.  We had very robust debates with him and I always found him to be a very good colleague in terms of parliamentary debate.</P>
        <P>This Bill is being introduced as it is considered necessary to give effect to certain aspects of the Government&rsquo;s policy as set out in the ports policy statement of 2005.  The principal objectives of the Bill, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, relate to the Harbours Act 1996, which contains guidelines for port companies on the acquisition of land.  It also addresses issues associated with the disposal of land.  Other objectives are to provide for the transfer of functions from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of the compulsory acquisition of land by port companies and to alter the limits of Drogheda Port Company to facilitate the proposal to build a new port in Balbriggan.  Amendments are considered necessary in this regard.  Furthermore, there is to be provision for a clear legislative basis to underpin investment by port companies outside their current harbour limits.  Finally, the number of directors in a port company is to be reduced from 12 to eight.</P>
        <P>The first four objectives seem reasonably compelling in that they are to amend legislation that is limited in its current form.  We can accept them.  However, I wish to focus on the last expressed reason for the legislation, that is, the reduction from 12 to eight of the number of <Col N="332"/>directors in a port company, as provided for in section 11.  I am very disturbed by the Minister&rsquo;s motivation in this respect.  The reduction being proposed is at the expense of three local authority members and the user representative.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, was in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and will have debated the role of elected councillors in local authorities.  We have debated their resources and limited functions.  By and large, the Members of this House are elected by members of local authorities throughout the country, with the exception of the six Senators from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin and the 11 Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  The majority of us have served on county councils.  I was very lucky and honoured to be elected to Cork County Council at 22 years of age.  I served as vice chairman of the full council and as chairman of its western division on two occasions.  The majority of councillors are hard-working, decent people.  We are all well aware of the unlimited number of hours they devote to their work as members of local authorities, the sacrifices they make and the limitations to their role.</P>
        <P>On several occasions in this House, I have pointed out what I believe is the democratic deficit that currently dogs local government, namely, the difference between the reserved function and the executive function.  Those who are members of local authorities have a reserved function, which means they can recommend to council that a certain course of action can be taken.  Of course, the executive function, the real decision-making power, rests with county and city managers.  If we are serious about local government reform, we must address this anomaly in the system.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the matter at hand.  I cannot understand why any Government would want to see local authority membership wiped from the boards of the ports throughout this country.  I cannot understand why the Government is so intent on taking away functions from local authority members.  If we have learned anything from attending councillors&rsquo; conferences or from being councillors, it is that councillors want more powers and real input into local government.  They do not want to be told that the power to set a rate collection charge is being taken from them and given to the manager.  They are now being told to skedaddle from the boards of the ports, which is not good enough.</P>
        <P>This view is held on both sides of this House.  To be fair to Government Members, they are here to support Government legislation.  However, the Minister and the Government would do well to listen to the points of view expressed by Members of all political persuasions in this House.  We are speaking from experience.  We have consulted with colleagues in local government, who are seriously concerned with the manner in which the Government is dealing with this issue.  I cannot understand it.  I hope the Minister takes this argument on board.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport is a former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He first flew the flag in regard to the abolition of the dual mandate and, as he has served on a local authority, he is acutely aware of the faults and failings of local government.  He is also aware of the manner in which councillors are expected to carry out onerous tasks while not being well remunerated or afforded the proper democratic right to exercise functions, despite the trust placed in them by those who have elected them to local authorities.  This is an issue of which we must by fully cognisant.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to carry the message back to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that he should drop this ridiculous idea.  I understand there is an argument, based on reports, that this should be the case but the democratic views of the Members of this House need to be taken into consideration.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>Worker representation takes a hit and will be confined to one representative.  My party will oppose this move, particularly in regard to local authorities and worker representatives.  We would not be doing our job properly if we did not do so.</P>
        <P>Amendments under section 11 are supposed to reflect the provisions of the ports policy statement of 2005.  While that statement indicates that 12 members is considered to be excessive, which we accept in the spirit in which it is intended, it does not make any recommendation as to what the lower number should be.  The smaller number might be ten rather than eight.  Where did the Minister get this figure?  Why is he going beyond what is stated in the ports policy statement of 2005?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ports policy statement recommends a reduction in the number of local authority members from three to one.  This amendment appears to reduce the number to zero.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether this is the case and outline the thinking behind this amendment?  If the answer to these questions is that the Minister is indeed going beyond the ports policy statement, why is he doing so, and why is this particularly the case with regard to local authority membership?  Is the Minister ideologically opposed to having local authority members on boards?  If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, it begs the question why this is the case and whether it is party policy.</P>
        <P>From discussing the Bill with some Members opposite, I am aware there are those on the other side of the House who are particularly supportive of the points I make in this regard, although they are constrained because they are on the Government side.  I ask the Minister of State to listen to the democratic wishes of his own party.</P>
        <P>I would expect the Minister of State to answer the following questions.  Why is the Government so determined on this provision?  From where does it come?  Whose agenda is it?  Is it ideological?  What is the thinking behind it?  Has the Minister of State consulted the grassroots of his own organisation?  Has the Minister consulted the various council representative groups?  Has he consulted councillors in his own party?  If the answer to all of these questions is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, did any of those organisations share the view that Government should reduce local authority membership on these boards?</P>
        <P>A fundamental part of our local government system is those who come through it.  Those who are successful in local authority elections are representative of their community and bring a fundamental part of democracy with them to the council chamber, the health boards of the old system, the VECs and the ports.  I know many councillors who have served the port of Cork. I have served on it and have ratified appointments to it, and know the councillors are fine, decent people and a good conduit between local government and the outside bodies to which they have been appointed.  I see no compelling reason they should be removed from the board.</P>
        <P>I am aware Members opposite cannot directly oppose the Minister on this issue.  However, while I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, if the Minister refuses to budge from his position I would appeal to Members on the other side of the House to approach him privately to beseech him to listen to common sense in this regard.  I am certain our electorate have a view &mdash; I am speaking with regard to those Senators who have been elected because of the support of members of county councils from Donegal to Cork and Dublin to Galway.  We will oppose this section and I have no doubt Fine Gael will do the same.  I earnestly ask Members on the other side of the House to stand up and be counted on this issue.The Minister can do what is legally necessary.  He can make the changes that are definitely needed, but he does not have to do this at the expense of local democracy and local government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 18 has serious implications for Bantry and west Cork.  Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners has substantially funded the new slipway at Whiddy Island and is now involved with <Col N="334"/>the one proposed for the mainland beside the Abbey cemetery in Bantry.  The commissioners also purchased the old railway pier foreshore rights from Bantry House for the full market value and own and control the existing pier.  Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners made a profit each year since 1996 except 2004.  Conoco Phillips is the company involved in the facility on Whiddy Island and it looks likely it will invest substantially in that facility to repair and refurbish oil storage and other facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To be parochial, the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners has unanimously on several occasions rejected proposals for a merger with or takeover by the Cork port authority.  Solid assurances were given by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on many previous occasions that any decision would be based on consultation with the people concerned.  A letter sent by the Minister last month to the chairman of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, Mr. Aiden McCarthy, refers to a letter sent by the harbour authority to the Minister outlining its concerns.  The Minister gives an assurance in this correspondence that any decision the Government would make in this regard would only be made following consultation with the people involved.  I regret to add no such consultation was entered into with the people concerned before this legislation arrived at its current stage.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to leave Bantry port alone.  It is financially capable of operating on its own basis and we do not need it to be subsumed into the port of Cork.  This view is held unanimously by Bantry Town Council and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and it is also a view held by other Oireachtas Members for Cork South-West.  I urge the Government to listen to us.  If there is an insistence in this regard on the further Stages of the Bill, I will oppose it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill seeks to give statutory effect to the Government&rsquo;s port policy statement.  The definition of a port policy statement can be taken to mean a statement of the port policy of the Government.  I tend to think of it as a statement of the Government moving towards a ports policy, because it is an evolving policy area over several years and it is clear this Bill is an attempt to meet some of the gaps remaining.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of the dependence of an island nation on harbours is unanswerable, and the need to have a statutory effect to ensure they operate to their optimum level cannot be debated.  The Bill answers many of the questions that need to be answered.  The Harbours Act 1996 brought about changes from the old harbour commissioners system in larger ports, where port companies were established and a more commercial system was put in place.  This allowed the evolution of a competition policy between many of the larger ports in the country.  The existence of competition allows for more traffic for exports and imports, and thereby increases the viability of the ports.</P>
        <P>Increasing the economic activity of the ports is an aim of Government policy in itself, but there are other areas we need to examine, such as the capacity of the ports that exist.  The most supported port in terms of infrastructure is the Europort in Rosslare, the most under-utilised port in the country.  Where is our policy going when we have substantial investment in major ports that are not utilised to their full capability?</P>
        <P>When goods are imported and exported we should have a transport policy that identifies particular ports so the minimum impact on transport on the island is achieved.  The problem with an open competition policy is that one is encouraging goods to be imported to or exported from Donegal and sent out through any of the ports in the country.  That is not environmentally sound and does not make good economic sense.  A harbour or ports policy should address these inconsistencies.  The Bill moves towards that, but there is much work to be done, and I hope that will be done in the formation of a fully-fledged ports policy and in later legislation.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>Many of the locations of existing ports do not meet modern needs.  The ports themselves are developed, or they are relocated.  In Cork there has been an attempt by the Port of Cork Company to achieve a relocation through the use of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  It went through An Bord Plean&aacute;la and argued to move all its facilities to Ringaskiddy at the lower end of Cork Harbour.  This failed, and one of the reasons for that was that &mdash; another lacuna in harbours policy &mdash; in terms of transport infrastructure, it should be an accepted fact that rail links are a prerequisite.  It is economically stupid, as well as environmentally damaging, to develop new locations, in north Dublin or elsewhere, without an insistence on rail links as a matter of policy.  I would like to see the development of a ports policy along these grounds.</P>
        <P>As a nominated member of the Seanad, I am aware that while we are discussing the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008, we spend an undue amount of time on particular provisions and how they relate to local authority members.  That cannot be unconnected to the fact that a large part of the electorate for most Members of this House are local authority members.  I understand why Members feel the need to address those concerns.  It is a distortion of what this Bill is about, and I ask that on Committee Stage the more important commercially and economically sensitive elements of the Bill are examined more carefully.</P>
        <P>Most of the legislation that prohibits local authority members from membership of all State bodies and agencies needs to be reformed.  If there is an expertise and skill in local government, it should be encouraged and people should be allowed to be appointed to such bodies.  If legislation states that there should be a minimum participation of local government representatives, regardless of whether those skills exist in local authorities themselves, that is not in the interests of local government or their members.  It may be technically feasible that in any port company the 12, 15 or 17 members are local authority members or, conversely, if the specific skills do not exist in that local authority, then none of them should be members.  If we are interested in bringing up the standard of public representation, that is what we need to achieve.  We need a skills set, whether in harbours, education or healthcare and not just members sitting on bodies for the sake of it.  If we can achieve that, there will be more respect for politics in general and identification with local government in particular.  Members in this House, because of their special relationship with members of local authorities, should reflect on those facts and see how we can improve matters in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my own area in Cork there is a conflict of interest between the local authorities - Cork City Council and Cork County Council - and the Port of Cork Company, particularly towards the development of the Port of Cork Company.  The city&rsquo;s interest is in developing the south city docklands which, outside of irregular cargos for IAWS which are happy to move to a new location, is ripe for new development and would bring new life to the city.  Instead we have a stand-off between the Port of Cork Company and the local authorities that sees little movement to allow such redevelopment to occur.  That is despite the fact that Cork City Council has direct representation on the Port of Cork Company.  Even where representation exists, what is the value of it when it cannot deal with these vitally important issues of infrastructure and economic development at a local level?</P>

	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point about Bantry and I am prepared to listen to the arguments.  There are economies of scale that need to be taken into account, and this Bill is about that.  There is a case for some linkage between the port of Cork and Bantry port, if only to have a responsibility for a body of the State for the oil refinery facilities in Whitegate and the oil storage facilities in Whiddy.  It would make sense to have somebody responsible for both, rather than having the responsibility divided in two.  I heard what other <Col N="336"/>Members said, and I believe that is the intent of what is proposed in the Bill.  We can discuss on Committee Stage whether that is a good or a bad thing.</P>
        <P>We are discussing a reduction in the number of ports that are recognised in this legislation.  If the identification of these ports is not linked with an overall transportation plan that has identified rail links and identifies where the goods are coming from and going to within a set radius of each port, we will not achieve the potential of existing ports.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Bill seeks to do and I recognise it as a further evolution of a policy that still has a journey to go before it is fully fledged.  The debate today and the examination of the Bill on Committee Stage, and discussion in the other House, will allow us to develop a policy that, sadly, for an island nation for too long has not been fully developed.</P>

	<P>No.  I know that man&rsquo;s views because I know how disgracefully he was treated in regard to a port company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We oppose the section.  It is a studied assault on local democracy and on decent people.  Everyone in this House would defend the right of local authority members to be on those boards.  The number of board members is being reduced.  I understand that the Minister may appoint one board member.  We on this side of the House do not accept that.  It is wrong.  We, as politicians who have put ourselves forward for so many years to be elected, and who are fortunate to be here, should not show such scant regard for colleagues serving on local authorities who do such good work.</P>
        <P>Members opposite and the Minister will have the chance to respond to tell me how firmly that is Government policy.  Senators will agree this is creeping through all Departments.  As Senator Ellis pointed out, we have seen this before although I cannot remember the last instance of it.  It seems as though someone in the so-called permanent government is getting at the Government of the day.  These instances have occurred once or twice in the ten years or so that I have been a Member of the House.  We need to cry &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  As politicians, we should have the guts to put down the appropriate amendment, which I hope we will.  We are all behind <Col N="337"/>it.  I would like to think Ministers would not think differently to us on how local democracy should be conducted.</P>
        <P>I did not hear what Senator McCarthy said about Bantry.  I believe Bantry and Fenit &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan may be more competent when it comes to Fenit &mdash; are strategically located ports and they should be made autonomous.  Putting Bantry in with Cork is not something anyone in Bantry wants.  There is approximately 100 miles of coastline between Bantry and Cork.  Bantry is a very busy port in its own right and it deserves encouragement even if sufficient funding is not available currently.  Equally, Fenit deserves to be autonomous, not to become an adjunct of Foynes and Shannon.  I have no doubt Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan will contribute on that point.  Other than those points I have nothing further to say and I am happy to hand over to my colleague.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Coghlan for sharing time with me.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins.  I welcome the Bill but I am amazed at some aspects of it.  I do not like the provision for the transfer of functions from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of the compulsory acquisition of land by a port company.  That is a major power.  I cannot understand why the Minister would not give that power to the local authority in question.  If the Minister with responsibility for the marine had given power to the local authority rather than a private company we would not have the long debacle we have had on our hands with Shell in north Mayo in recent years.  That considerable power is being handed over to unelected people.  The Minister should reconsider and vest the power to compulsorily acquire land in local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government gave away nearly all of his powers when he gave away harbours, ports and transport to the Department of Transport.  His role is considerably diminished now.  The Minister for Transport is now giving away further powers.  I am not too happy with the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> public representatives.  We are told the Minister cannot intervene in companies such as CIE, the Health Service Executive and the National Roads Authority because power is vested in them and they are a law unto themselves.  However, nearly every county development plan in the country has been altered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  On the one hand, we give away power and say the Minister cannot intervene in the Health Service Executive, the National Roads Authority, CIE, etc., but on the other hand, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can interfere willy-nilly in the affairs of local authorities.  Instead of having locally elected people, those with no electoral accountability are being put in charge.  In the case of the Health Service Executive the Minister removed locally elected people from the boards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not enamoured of the change that has taken place and that has been presided over by Fianna F&aacute;il in government in the recent years.  I urge the Minister of State to convey my views to the Minister for Transport and to consider the case for the appointment of public representatives to harbour boards.  I fail to understand why they should not be appointed to such boards, as they are elected and accountable and they have done a magnificent job in the past, yet we are now passing legislation to vest the power in unelected people.  I urge the Minister to examine the matter prior to Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation, which has been drafted to enhance the long-term viability of the ports around our island nation.  Our long-standing maritime tradition is one aspect of the economy that is often overlooked and the legislation shines a badly needed spotlight on the sector.  It seeks to allow harbour authorities the flexibility and autonomy to operate in a high-pressured global environment and to create the kind of conditions needed to increase commercial activity in ports.</P><Col N="338"/>
        <P Just="Left">We currently have ten State port companies operating on our coasts and each of those companies has plans for the expansion and enhancement of its facilities in the coming years.  Some of the ports are already in the middle of major expansion.  For example, we recently saw the opening of a 190 m quay extension at the port of Waterford at a cost of &euro;11 million.  That extension will boost the port&rsquo;s growing cargo business and its reputation as one of north-west Europe&rsquo;s key maritime hubs.  The new facility provides the port of Waterford and the commercial and industrial activities in its vicinity with the room to continue to grow into the future.  In Cork there are progressive companies, for example, Mainport, which has gone in the past five or six years from owning and operating five or six vessels to 30, including seven recent vessel acquisitions.</P>
        <P>Irish-based ship owners demonstrate that, given the right conditions, they can compete in tough, highly challenging global markets.  On 1 August 2008 the Irish Maritime Development Office announced expansion plans by seven Irish-based shipping groups with an expected total cost of almost &euro;1 billion.  In the first six months of 2008, 21 new and second-hand vessels were acquired with a further 27 vessels confirmed or expected to be delivered over the next two years, most of which are newly built.  While economic conditions in Ireland will be tougher in coming years, this is clearly not a factor constraining those Irish maritime companies that continue to compete successfully in the global marketplace.  In announcing the expansion plans, Mr. Glenn Murphy, director of the Irish Maritime Development Office, said that the Government has created the commercial and financial conditions that have fostered an environment where both foreign and Irish companies can now expand and develop their business.</P>
        <P>In the past 15 years the value of trade through Irish ports has grown from &euro;28 billion per annum to &euro;150 billion.  Ireland has managed to establish itself among the top 15 international shipping finance centres and, earlier this year, gained admittance to the prestigious white list of top performing shipping states in the world.  Obtaining white list status is an international recognition that Ireland operates a quality shipping register.  It is against this background of proactive support for the Irish shipping industry that the legislation is founded.  It seeks to assist the port authorities in growing and developing maritime businesses in future.  For the first time, it seeks to provide a clear legislative basis to underpin investment by port companies outside their current harbour limits.  This provision is necessary to facilitate the development and successful completion of proposals relating to investment by port companies outside their limits and outside the State.  Special provision will be made to facilitate the proposed new port development at Bremore, County Meath, which has the potential to develop into a major maritime centre on the east coast.</P>
        <P>The provision to reduce the number of directors the board of a port company from 12 to eight should improve the ability of commercial ports to deliver on their mandate.  I have always believed that a small, tightly focused group of people committed to achieving a common goal can be far more effective than a large cumbersome group with diverse interests.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, spoke of the rather nonsensical situation where, in some cases, the number of directors on port company boards is greater than the number of employees in the company.</P>
        <P>On the role of local authority members on maritime boards, I share the concern expressed by some of my colleagues in the House that there is a gradual erosion of the powers of elected representatives.  If we are to argue credibly for enhanced local representation and strengthened local democracy, however, we must acknowledge that there are, perhaps, no roles for certain local authority members on such boards.  These are commercial entities operating in a highly pressurised global environment.  The port companies at Drogheda, Waterford and Rosslare are not competing with each other but against such ports as Rotterdam and Southampton.  If the <Col N="339"/>expertise exists within our local authorities and if there are people who have the knowledge and commercial background to make a serious and worthwhile contribution to the running of these commercial entities, then let them serve on the board.  The comments from Senator Cummins of his experience on the board of Waterford Port Company suggest that if he were currently a member of the relevant local authority, he would be an ideal candidate to occupy such a position.  However, the suggestion that we should simply adopt people onto the boards of these commercial entities solely because they are members of a local authority is spurious and does not give credibility to the argument that we should have enhanced representation and strengthened local democracy.  If we are to make this argument, we should be equally honest and state that there are times when local authority representation is not necessary and could be a hindrance.</P>
        <P>We will give autonomy to the port authorities by allowing them greater flexibility to borrow to fund additional port capacity.  The Irish Exporters Association has welcomed these aspects of the Bill.  In its opinion the legislation will take some of the shackles off port company management and enable it to clear board decisions rapidly and raise the necessary loan finance to invest in new infrastructure which is essential to stay competitive in today&rsquo;s trading environment.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill to the House as it seeks to provide the autonomy and flexibility that port authorities need to grow.  They are an important element of our economy.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of a great friend of ours and a former Deputy, Mr. Eddie Wade, with whom I had the pleasure of serving on the Shannon Foynes Port Company for several years.  It is fortuitous that he has arrived during this debate.</P>
        <P>The issues most debated appear to be those of rationalisation of boards, mergers, the number of directors and, especially, representation by local authority members.  I have mixed opinions about the first matter.  Along with Mr. Wade, I was a member of the Shannon Estuary Port Company when the former Limerick Harbour Commissioners and the Foynes Port Company were amalgamated by the then Minister with responsibility for the marine, Deputy Frank Fahey.  There was much difficulty with the matter.  There was a hard campaign and I was one of those in favour of the merger because I believed the estuary would gain overall from the creation of a single authority.  I believed my area in County Kerry would stand to gain from the change.  Not everyone agreed with this position.  There were teething difficulties with the amalgamation, some of which have been well documented.  I lived through the changes and, overall, it was a good example of a merger.</P>
        <P>I am not so sanguine about the proposed merger of Shannon Foynes Port Company with Fenit Harbour.  This is not at all popular in County Kerry.  I was speaking to the chairman of the board, Councillor John Wall, this morning and he explained there was resistance across the board in Fenit and Tralee to the proposal.  Fenit&rsquo;s operation is very different from Shannon Foynes which is a huge, industrialised port.  The business of Fenit is almost entirely leisure and tourism-based.  It has a niche industry client, Liebherr in Killarney, which, if Fenit was not available, might relocate out of Kerry and the south west altogether.  The Minister of State should be cautious in this regard.</P><Col N="340"/>
        <P>Our colleague, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, has championed the cause of Bantry in the House and, formerly, in the D&aacute;il.  He regrets that he cannot be present but he has outlined, as have other speakers, the way that Bantry has returned a profit through the years, as has Fenit.  If something is working and not broken, one does not fix it.  A port that is making money should be cherished.</P>
        <P>I am a student of history and I am currently reading late 19th century history.  An extraordinary coincidence has occurred because at the turn of the 19th century there was much trouble in Bantry and there was a very formidable politician there by the name of Timothy M. Healy.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, he had a beard and practised as a solicitor.  He led a group of politicians which became known as the Bantry gang.  They created much difficulty for their leader at that time, Mr. Charles Stewart Parnell, who was an elected representative for County Meath.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, should examine closely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this situation before he tackles the Bantry gang.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with the reduction in the number of board members.  Everything is getting leaner and tighter nowadays and this makes some sense.  I have two comments on the matter.  It is not fair to have only one worker director.  In my experience, worker directors made a very important contribution on the board of which I was a member.  It is unfair to expect one worker to attend at a board meeting and try to fight a cause on behalf of a large number of employees which, in the case of Shannon Foynes Port Company, for instance, work in a region almost 50 miles in length.  We should consider appointing a second worker-director.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">On the contentious issue of councillors on boards, I strongly support the views expressed by Senators on both sides of the House and I am on record about the need to protect the rights of councillors.  I was happy to hear the Taoiseach make it clear in the D&aacute;il yesterday, in response to a query, that he has absolute confidence in councillors and should they be suitable for appointment to a board, he is fully in favour of public representatives being appointed to boards.  That is from the Taoiseach, a man for whom I have the greatest respect, as does the entire country.  I hope all the Ministers will take a leaf out of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s book in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have had words with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on this issue and he is aware of my views. Appointments were made recently to the board of Shannon Foynes Port Company with the result that for the first time in nearly 50 years, no Kerry person or public representative has a say in the affairs of the estuary which is closest to us and which is of major importance to our welfare and our future.  I served on the board for 15 years.  A cousin of mine, the late former Senator and Deputy, Kit Ahern, served for an even longer period.  Many other excellent councillors represented the interests of Kerry and of the region but for the first time that has ceased to be the case.  I can assure the Minister of State that is resented in Kerry.  I hope that when any further appointments are made to the board of Shannon Foynes Port Company, the kingdom will not be left out again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many positive measures in the Bill.  It is a proactive Bill that examines ways to increase the profitability and competitiveness of our major ports, and as a former director I applaud that.  Many serious issues arose that were creating obstacles to progress and to profit.  I agree with the speaker who said that we are driven by profit but obstacles were put in our way to do with the acquisition of property and expediting planning applications.  I disagree with the speakers who said that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not the appropriate body to deal with planning issues.  We had witness to that in my own north Kerry area recently when we got fast-track <Col N="341"/>planning permission for the proposed gas terminal, which is supported by the community with the exception of one or two individuals.  Senator Paul Coghlan, my great friend and colleague, was good enough to mention the fact that I experienced difficulty regarding my position there, along with another colleague and great friend, Councillor John Brassil.  A complaint was made about me to the director of the Ethics Register because I was a member of the board of Shannon Foynes Port Company at a time when Kerry County Council &mdash; of which I was also a member &mdash; rezoned land to provide for that gas terminal in Tarbert-Ballylongford.  Councillor Brassil was a chairman of Shannon Development and I was a director of Shannon Foynes Port Company.  I am glad to say both of us were exonerated.  We had no case to answer.  We had no pecuniary interest.  I regret to say we do not own any property adjacent to the site.  That matter has been put aside.</P>
        <P>To return to the original point about the councillors, the Minister would be sending out the wrong signal if he reduced the number of councillors on boards.  It might give credence to the people I mentioned earlier, many of whom may be cranks who are trying to find fault with public representatives.  Public representatives should be supported by our Ministers.</P>
        <P>The various Governments in the past ten years must be commended for major investment in our ports under the national development plan.  People often ask if money was wasted during the days of the Celtic tiger but I deny that.  The Government handled the wealth very well and I hope and pray it will now be in a position to handle the downturn equally well.  When people say to me that money was wasted, I tell them to consider the investment that was made in our major ports such as Waterford, Dublin, Shannon and Galway.  That was good use of money.  It was investment in our future and future generations will reap the benefit of that investment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the tougher times we are now entering there has never been a greater need to focus on the commercial mandate of our ports.  This Bill enables that.  It will be proven to be positive.  I believe most Members will support it, although there are aspects of it on which we are not keen.  The suitability of public representatives for membership of the boards will continue to be a hot issue during the debates on the various Stages.  I will vote for the Bill as put forward by the Minister but I will work as hard as I can to get some movement on that aspect.  I intend to take up the challenge issued to us by Senator Cummins.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must take umbrage with a colleague whom I respect, Senator Boyle, who said that if people in councils had the proper skills they should be appointed to boards.  In other words, if a member of a council happens to be an expert in maritime affairs or hydrology, he or she is suitable to be appointed to a harbour board.  However, councillors themselves are a skill set, to use his term.  To be a councillor one must first be elected, which takes a fair amount of skill.  One must be local, which is very important when it comes to regional boards.  Also, one must have a commitment to the welfare of the community, not for oneself or one&rsquo;s pocket but for the overall good.  All those experiences create a skill set which Senator Boyle would agree a councillor encompasses.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister and compliment his officials.  I have dealt with officials in the Minister&rsquo;s Department at different levels for many years and always found them to be proactive and concerned with the good of the harbours and of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak for a few minutes on this important topic.  As an island nation we do not have a sufficient number of debates on marine issues.  It is disappointing that Members are not queuing up to talk about them, as we do in regard to many other topics, and use the facility of Second Stage to not only address the Bill but introduce other issues.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to the House.</P><Col N="342"/>
        <P>Having said that, the first point I would make in a debate on marine matters is that politicians, never mind those involved in the marine industry, have a difficult life in that the marine is under the aegis of seven Ministers and Ministers of State.  When pursuing particular issues one finds that harbours come under the aegis of one Minister, inland rivers come under the aegis of another while another Minister has responsibility for the seas.  It is difficult to follow particular projects when there are so many people responsible for the area of the marine.</P>
        <P>On the Bill before the House, I was interested to hear the various topics raised in the debate to do with west Cork, Kerry and Waterford.  It seemed to be one of those debates on the region south of the line from Dublin to Galway but I must ask what is in it for me?  I do not ask that in a personal sense but as a representative from Donegal.  What is in the Bill that will reflect the fact that we are surrounded by water?  I live in a peninsula and the Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners is the nearest recognised port authority to me.  I live close to the mouth of the Foyle where many of the big boats that come in every day to go to Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners at Lisahally must spend one, two or three days waiting for the right tide to allow them do that.  They often do not get the right tide and must wait for smaller boats to come down and unload them in the middle of the Foyle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What do we intend to do to develop the new port authorities?  Are we happy to leave things the way they are currently?  Are we proactive in terms of developing our marine activity?  On the number of boats coming in to the Foyle, the vast majority, approximately 90%, leave empty.  What are we doing to promote the idea in my region of not only importing but exporting?  That is the reason I raise the issue of ministerial responsibility.  This relates to the whole issue of recognising our waters as an economic resource.  I refer to commercial freight, luxury cruise liners, international and local yachting opportunities, local rowing clubs and the ongoing fishing activities.  One cannot speak about a port without considering all the activities that go on there.  Greencastle Harbour is the host port of the pilot boat, the Greencastle car ferry to Magilligan and the local white fish fleet.  Many oyster and mussel farmers are based there.  There is a coastguard in Greencastle, as well as a search and rescue service.  Some yachts are moored there at the moment, as a consequence of mooring difficulties elsewhere.  I wish to declare an interest in this regard &mdash; I row into Greencastle Harbour during my ventures between Moville and Greencastle on the odd Sunday.  The Foyle punts also use the harbour.  There is a great deal of activity there.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear Senators speaking about the concept of a port authority extending its reach to another area.  It was suggested that people in County Donegal might link up with people in the North to make their economic entity more realistic.  Like Senator Ellis, I would like to know whether anything is being done at cross-Border level.  Is the port authority in Derry working with its counterpart in Donegal to ensure that the potential of Greencastle Harbour, or Carrickarory pier in Moville, is developed?  A small addition to the existing pier at Carrickarory would provide access to natural deep-water berthage, thereby enabling many ships that cannot travel up the Foyle to offload at that point.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle suggested that railway stations are necessary at our ports.  I do not mind if he wants to develop a railway line between Derry and Moville.  I suppose it might have happened in the past.  There does not seem to be much potential for it at the moment.  Some &euro;36 million is being invested in Greencastle Harbour.  A breakwater is being developed and safer facilities are being provided to benefit those who use the harbour.  It is a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>It is great that we are giving local authorities responsibility for looking after our ports.  If we give them responsibility for the less economically viable harbours, however, they will not have the same money-generating opportunities.  Perhaps I do not understand the system correctly. <Col N="343"/> The harbours to which I refer have the same maintenance costs.  They will have to ask the Department of the marine for money to upgrade or maintain slipways.  The slipway in Moville is in serious trouble.  There will be problems when it comes to getting co-financing from the local authority.  We are giving the local authority more and more responsibility, while expecting it to provide 25% co-financing.  It is wrong to suggest that this Bill does not have any financial implications.  It will have financial implications for the local authorities which will be given responsibility for additional harbours.  I know that from my first-hand experience of Greencastle Harbour.  We had a serious battle when we tried to get Donegal County Council to provide 25% of the &euro;36 million the harbour needed.  Thankfully, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, came partly to the rescue in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about public representation on boards.  I believe that many public representatives have as much knowledge of, and interest in, these matters as anybody else.  We are more accountable then anyone else because we can be kicked out at each election.  I accept that people sometimes agree to sit on certain committees because it is the done thing.  When I was a member of a local authority, I did not get involved in things unless I was interested in them.  I lost money because the amount of time I put into some meetings could not be matched by the amount of recompense that was available in those days for travelling to them.  I urge the Government to move slowly when considering whether to abolish public representation on boards of this nature.  I agree with those who said it would be fair enough if the reduction in public representation on boards were proportionate to the reduction in the overall size of boards.  We should not exclude public representatives altogether.</P>
        <P>I would very much like to see a single overall marine ministry established again.  Equally, the remit of our ports should not be explicitly commercial.  They should have a commercial perspective, but they should also be concerned with ferries, cruises and leisure and recreation.  A great deal of opportunity is being missed.  Ireland is an island nation.  One can count on one hand the number of people who use the seas and waterways in most parts of the country.  To date, we have not taken advantage of the opportunity provided to us.</P>
        <P>A Member of the House asked whether the involvement of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in some aspects of this sector will speed things up or slow things down.  I have been trying for many years to secure permission for the development of a breakwater in Buncrana, for the exclusive benefit of the RNLI.  If the breakwater is used for other purposes after it is put in place, the lease will have to be renegotiated and changed.  The delay in taking action in that regard is scandalous.  I remind whoever is responsible for bringing projects of this nature to a conclusion that this project is very important.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the concept of healthy competition.  As I said at the outset, the potential of harbours in my local area like Greencastle, Moville and Buncrana to do more than they are doing at present is being stymied.  The harbours in question are on Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly.  The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners have some responsibilities in respect of Lough Foyle.  It seems that ne&rsquo;er the twain shall meet.  I would like this opportunity to be taken so that County Donegal can gain from the potential that exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the broad thrust of this Bill.  The ten port authorities it covers are currently covered by the Harbours Acts.  The years to come will represent an important era for the harbours in question.  They will get investment.  They will be able to go outside their functioning area to acquire assets, etc.  That is all to be welcomed.  I am wary of the proposal to give further powers to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not believe the general public has much confidence in the proposal.  Those who have had dealings with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on planning permissions, etc., associate the organisation with a lack of transparency and accountability.  I do not understand why local authorities are not being given the power to compulsorily <Col N="344"/>acquire land where relevant, possible or necessary.  As Senator Keaveney said, local representatives often have more knowledge of these matters.  It is generally the case that local authorities are used to working in the areas in question.  It is a new departure to give An Bord Plean&aacute;la more powers, in this day and age.  I would not be keen to undermine local authorities any more than they have already been undermined.  Many people, on foot of their own experiences, are not impressed by the proposal to give An Bord Plean&aacute;la further clout.</P>
        <P>As a native of Wexford town, I am a little upset about one aspect of the Bill.  The three most important ports in County Wexford are Rosslare Europort, Kilmore Quay and the old harbour in Wexford town.  Their importance differs as they have differing functions and levels of activity &mdash; they are not in competition with each other.  It is astonishing that Rosslare Europort is not mentioned in this legislation, and has scarcely been mentioned during this debate, given that it is the nearest Irish port to the UK and mainland Europe.  Perhaps the Minister of State intends to introduce a separate Bill to provide for Rosslare Europort.  I would welcome such legislation because it is needed.  As someone who often travels to Rosslare, I can inform the House that ships often have to wait at sea before they can berth because passengers are disembarking from another ship at the port.  It badly needs investment and this Bill does not provide for Rosslare Europort.  I am very upset about that.</P>
        <P>One Senator said Waterford had the most important port in the south east, but I think Waterford and Rosslare have completely different functions.  Rosslare is ro-ro whereas Waterford is more freight orientated.  In that respect they do not need to be mutually exclusive.  I appreciate it is run by CIE and a separate Bill may be required, but I do not want the opportunity to pass without mentioning it.</P>
        <P>Kilmore Quay is the most important fishing port on the south-east coast and one would need to go as far as Castletownbere to find a port that is as busy.  The fishing industry there has gone through its worst ever turmoil in the past five years.  Senator Keaveney called for more pressure to be placed on local authorities to provide investment.  It is very difficult and we need to look at the area of investment.  There are people in Wexford who do not have berths for their leisure craft.  New marinas could be provided at the smaller piers that are no longer in action.</P>
        <P>I notice that three ports &mdash; Fenit, Tralee and Bantry &mdash; have been given flexibility to transfer to local authority control or to have their own port company because of their commercial activity.  Every year, &euro;15 million worth of mussels are harvested in Wexford Harbour and one can go anywhere in Europe and find Wexford mussels on the menus of hotels and restaurants.  Wexford Port, which used to be so important to this economy in years gone by, is still an active, working port and should have been included in that list.  I have spoken to the county manager about this and the council has concerns that it will not be able to provide the investment required for this working port.  Small things like slipways, buoys in the harbour and so on are all issues of concern to the local authorities in respect of this matter.  They need some clarification.  Perhaps it has been given and I am not aware of it.  I know the harbour commissioners in Wexford made the case to the Department for inclusion but it has not been included.  I wonder whether anything will be done about it.</P>
        <P>We are all aware Wexford hosts the international opera festival, which is coming up shortly.  The marina in Wexford is a fabulous vantage point for Ireland from a tourist perspective.  It is very important the situation is not reached with the harbour where the level of investment required will not be provided.  I generally welcome the Bill, including the investment for the ports that are covered in it, but I am concerned about the ports that are not covered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank those Senators who contributed to the debate for the constructive manner in which they have approached the Second Stage of this Bill.  We all realise the critical importance of the State&rsquo;s commercial ports to our economy and the vital role they play in facilitating growth and prosperity.  The Minister of State outlined to the House his belief that this Bill will further enhance the commercial ethos conferred on our ports by the Harbours Act 1996 and will ensure they are positioned to respond to the challenges they will face.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis raised the issue of borrowing and asked who decides the value of the port assets.  This is obviously an important issue.  Fixed assets valuations are set out in the port company&rsquo;s audited accounts.  Senator Ellis also raised the issue of port tariffs.  They are set out by individual port companies and are an operational matter for the port companies under the Harbours Act 1996.  Senators Ellis and Keaveney referred to co-operation with the Northern authorities.  The all-island nature of the ports sector is well recognised by the Department, and there is close co-operation between the Department of Transport and the Department for regional development in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins, Ellis, Burke and others referred to the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the compulsory purchase order powers conferred on it.  The Bill transfers the Minister&rsquo;s powers to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but it does not confer any additional powers.  Since 1996, only one such order has been made.</P>
        <P>Several Senators referred to the issue of removing local authority representation from port company boards.  The statutory performance audit of port companies in 2001 and the 2003 high level review of State commercial ports both concluded that the practice of statutory local authority representation on port company boards should cease.  Local authorities do not nominate directors to the boards of other commercial State companies such as airports.  There is a view that the presence of local authority representations may create the potential for conflict of interest.  This could constrain the boards from pursuing tough commercial decisions and strategies.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>While the policy statement of the ports was published in January 2005 envisaging the reduction of local authority representation from three members to one, we felt it was necessary to remove local authority representation by right in order for the port companies to be seen to operate on a fully commercial basis.  I have no doubt this issue will surface on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy spoke about the reduction of employee representation on port company boards.  Two employee directors may be elected to the board, which is currently the case in just three of the ten companies, namely, Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins and Senator Keaveney raised the possibility of the Bill providing for future amalgamation of port companies.  While the Bill does not provide for any initiatives in this regard, it is evident that existing legislation provides enabling powers for amalgamation of port companies should that course of action be identified as the most appropriate for the companies in question.</P><Col N="346"/>
        <P>A few Senators spoke about the transfer of Bantry Bay and Tralee and Fenit harbour commissioners to port company control.  It is an issue that will be raised again on Committee Stage, but the Bill will allow for three potential courses of action for these harbours.  There will either be a transfer of control to the relevant local authority, the establishment of a private company in respect of the harbour, or a transfer of control of the harbour to the relevant port authority.</P>
        <P>With regard to the compulsory purchase order provisions that were mentioned, ministerial functions under the Fourth Schedule have been exercised only once since the enactment of the 1996 Act.  It is worth stating that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has, pursuant to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, become the determining body in respect of planning consent for strategic infrastructure developments at the commercial ports.  It would make sense, therefore, that it also would become the determining body regarding the adjudication of applications for the compulsory acquisition of property as described already in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, Boyle and others made reference to the fact that the port companies should be looked at in the context of an overall freight transport policy for the whole island of Ireland.  It is worth stating that a port capacity study was carried out in 2006 which received detailed submissions from seven ports in regard to increasing utilised capacity.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has undertaken extensive engagement with the industry and port authorities but has had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business which could be utilised on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>Substantial ongoing current and capital Exchequer investment is being made in the development and operation of the railway network as one of the measures to encourage rail freight business.  In addition, rail freight has been fully liberalised since 1 January 2007.  While no serious representations have been made to date to the Department of Transport by private rail operators for entry into the market, the Minister would welcome any expressions of interest in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators raised other issues in their contributions but I have endeavoured to cover them as best I can.  I thank Senators for their contributions and look forward to Committee Stage when many of the issues raised will be discussed further.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="348"/>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Given the state of the economy, we are at a particularly critical time in our history.  The underfunding of primary school education is causing a serious situation.  I intend to raise five points, which I would like the Minister to address in his reply.  I will begin by examining how we fare compared to other OECD countries. The recent OECD report entitled &ldquo;2008: Education at a Glance&rdquo;, which was published in September, indicated that Ireland has the third lowest education spend in Europe.  That must be borne in mind.  In addition, the report stated that educational expenditure, as a proportion of GDP, fell from 5.2% in 1995 to 4.6% in 2005 &mdash; that was during ten years of boom.</P>
        <P>My first point concerns the massive shortfall in day-to-day funding for our primary schools.  Such schools are in debt because the capitation grant is inadequate.  They are struggling to make ends meet and the capitation grant levels are not covering expenses such as oil, electricity, insurance and phone charges.  In addition, water charges are soon to be implemented.  I have been reliably informed that this will become a major issue in next year&rsquo;s local elections.</P>
        <P>Many schools rely on fundraising and voluntary contributions from parents to survive.  A recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science was attended by representatives of the IPPN, the primary school principals&rsquo; network, and the CPSMA, the Catholic primary schools management association.  They told the joint committee that the average primary school is in debt to the tune of &euro;23,000.</P>
        <P>A survey of 300 schools for the calendar year 2006 showed that parents were paying one third of primary school running costs.  In other words, for every two euros the State puts in, parents are paying an additional euro.  A south Dublin INTO survey showed that the situation is even worse &mdash; that for every one euro from the State, parents are contributing one euro.  This is happening thanks to charity walks, readathons and race nights.  Where I come from in Galway it is called &ldquo;Who wants be a thousandaire?&rdquo;  Will this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government be the first to get rid of free education, at least the primary school element?</P>
        <P>Increasingly, schools are asking parents for voluntary contributions.  However, there was a disturbing experience recently when one Galway school asked for a voluntary contribution of &euro;40, and a parent contacted the school to say &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask us.  It is embarrassing.  We can just about meet our mortgage&rdquo;.  These are the times in which we are living.  With the Government&rsquo;s permission, banks used to loan 100% mortgages to families, but now they are having difficulty meeting the basic cost of running a home, not to mention school costs.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is recommending a number of measures to rectify this situation.  The programme for Government promised to double the capitation grant.  The Minister should tell the House what he proposes to do in this regard.  We have made a reasonable proposal, asking the Minister to commission an independent review of capitation grants to be delivered within six months.  If he is not going to do that, he should tell us by how much he will increase the capitation grant so that schools will know how to cope with their debts.  Schools should be able to run smoothly without worrying about how they are funded.  They deserve no less.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister should investigate the possibility of refunding VAT paid on goods and services to schools, which amounts to a huge annual bill.  Last year, one school in Portlaoise paid &euro;14,000 in VAT.  Gaelscoil de H&iacute;de, in my own area of Oranmore, paid &euro;21,500 in VAT on prefabs last year.  Meanwhile, a south Dublin school with 18 teachers paid &euro;8,400 in VAT.  This area offers big potential because essentially the schools are another arm of the State.  Schools are being asked to pay VAT on goods and services they purchase, yet the Minister is not funding them adequately, so the principle is basically unfair.</P><Col N="349"/>
        <P>The Minister should also examine the option of using the State Claims Agency to provide insurance for schools.  There is a precedent because insurance for model schools, or modhscoileanna, run by the Department of Education and Science, is paid for in this way.  This is a real opportunity to help with the capitation grant because, as the Minister is aware, insurance is paid from that grant.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could examine this matter.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing that 10% of our schools have had to achieve charitable status.  What sort of trend is it when education is called charity, but we know it is a right?  There is a benefit in this for some schools because those that get donations receive matching benefit from the tax system, but that is not a possibility for less well off schools, which are unlikely to attract donations.</P>
        <P>I also wish to refer to the repair and maintenance of school buildings.  It is a false economy not to keep our schools functioning as safe places for learning.  They will fall apart if the Minister continues to keep the summer works scheme out of the system.  Last year, one thousand schools applied for the scheme but while their applications were accepted, they have now been frozen.  That work would have constituted essential maintenance for roofs, electrical work, boilers and windows, which are major health and safety concerns for the children involved.  The Minister is now putting that responsibility on the school boards of management but he will bankrupt them unless the scheme is reinstated.  One thousand schools add up to thousands of parents and tens of thousands of children.  The effects on health have been well documented.  I received correspondence in my office about the effects of rising damp in classes with poor windows.  An example is the spread of asthma.  This scheme was abandoned by the former Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin and, so far, by the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  It is a disaster for schools.  I ask the Minister to indicate today when this scheme will be reintroduced.  Schools were promised this.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given that commitment in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Healy Eames without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The schools expected the applications by 30 September and they have not received them.  Equally, the minor works grant was a significant cutback.  That covered painting, new fittings and furniture.</P>
        <P>The devolved scheme did incredible work.  I will grant the Minister this.  I am delighted to see the Minister&rsquo;s offer where a school can build a permanent classroom for &euro;120,000 instead of using prefabs.  Such permanent solutions are the type of move we want to see.</P>
        <P>My third point relates to the Minister&rsquo;s most damning move so far.  The ICT funding for primary schools, which he slashed, is vital for job creation in the future.  It is vital for the nation&rsquo;s future and the opportunities for our children.  The Minister slashed &euro;252 million from the budget.  I am delighted he is shaking his head because it means he will give us good news here today.  If this funding is slashed, it will be one of the worst moves of his term as Minister.</P>
        <P>It is difficult for me to say that we currently have obsolete computers in classrooms.  They are there since the year 2000.  In many schools there is one computer for 30 children.  That is <Col N="350"/>ridiculous.  There are still 100,000 of our children in classes of 30 or more.  As the Minister will be aware, there is patchy broadband access.  That is no way to build our future.</P>
        <P>One of the biggest drawbacks is that the IT advisers have been pulled.  They showed teachers the potential of ICT and the potential of computers.  One school in my area, Carnmore national school, has had to fund-raise using a new calendar to buy two computers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday I heard the Taoiseach state in the D&aacute;il that Ireland is open for business.  Together, the Minister and he must get this right.  The Taoiseach has stated time and again that the infrastructural commitments in the NDP were sacrosanct.  Cutting this budget suggests that the Minister does not understand the value of ICT to our children and our nation&rsquo;s future.  Without investment in ICT we are staying with traditional thinking and approaches, we will not be at the races in terms of innovation and creativity and we will lose opportunities and jobs in the future.  We need only consider how successful a country Singapore has been in this area.  There was evidence of this after the announcement that 5,000 students failed mathematics in the leaving certificate and when one company director stated on a news programme that he had to go abroad to recruit 100 employees because the IT skill level was not available here.  That is damning.  The place to start is in the primary schools.  I would be greatly encouraged, and the first to congratulate the Minister if I can get a commitment that the funding will be reinstated.</P>
        <P>My fourth point is that transparency is badly needed on the school building programme.  It is essential so that schools figure out where they are on the list, and plan accordingly.  The former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, put the school building programme on the web.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, took it away and replaced it with announcement by press release.  This is most unsatisfactory.  We all have evidence of this.  I ask the Minister to put the school building programme back on the web.</P>
        <P>Let us be honest with the schools.  Let us be transparent and tell them where they stand.  On all commitments made prior to the election, Oranmore national school, Scoil Mhuire national school, Clarinbridge, Newcastle national school, Athenry, and Lacken national school, all of which are in Galway, do not know where they stand on the building programme.   St. Mary&rsquo;s Church of Ireland national school in Bagenalstown, County Carlow, has contacted me to say as much.  I could continue, but I am aware that my colleagues will speak about this.  It is time to do something about the building programme and, above all, to introduce honesty into how schools are accepted.</P>
        <P>My final point is that principals, particularly teaching principals, are experiencing inordinate levels of administration and this needs to be reduced.  This will take not money but a little creative thought.  They are inundated with inordinate levels of bureaucracy and repetitious form-filling exercises.</P>
        <P>Teaching principals, in particular, are in difficult circumstances.  Some of the excessive form-filling required by the Department can be cut down simply by various sections of the Department communicating with each other instead of asking the principals to provide the same information over and over again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of teaching principals it is reasonable to request that there would be a secretary to take calls and communicate with parents for at least three hours a day while the principal is teaching.  Continuous interruption on the teaching principals&rsquo; time is cutting down on pupil contact time and this is more chronic than we realise.  It is unfair to pupils, as this is their learning time.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>Another matter that has come to my attention in the past few days in my research for this debate is that security is a growing issue in schools and it is costing schools a great deal.  There is fear for the children&rsquo;s safety.  The secretary was a watchful eye for schools.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to address five points.  I ask him to look at our suggestions to see if they are helpful.  I do not mind how he addresses them.  First, come up with a way to help schools afford to run as places of education.  Second, make schools safe places of learning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Healy Eames to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Third, invest in ICT.  Fourth, introduce transparency into the school building programme, which, as I stated, is easy to do.  Fifth, introduce smart ways in which administration can be cut down for all principals and, especially, provide a watchful eye for teaching principals.  I thank the Minister for his time and look forward to hearing his responses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.</P>
        <P>It is nice to see the Minister here and I thank him and his officials for attending this debate.  I must concur with much of what was said by my colleague, Senator Healy Eames.  The biggest issue for me would be transparency on the building projects.  Two weeks ago while the Minister was in Monaghan, he made his announcements.  How do schools get left out?  It does not seem to be the duration that they are left on the list, the numbers of pupils that are in an overcrowded situation nor their whereabouts in the country.  They could be rural or urban.  However, it seems that schools in the area of the commuter belt of Dublin get priority and I ask the Minister for clarification in that regard.</P>
        <P>There are examples I would like to raise with the Minister.  He kindly met with a representative Ballymahon group and he met with a representative group of the Athlone Community College.  These are two schools with which I am intensely familiar, as he probably knows from his dealings in his own constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I think I was very positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>He was.  I respected him having to review, and adjust to, his brief.  He was landed in the deep end and had to address all of the commitments that had been given prior to the election by his predecessor, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames stated, there are a number of national schools, as there are in counties Cavan and in Westmeath, that were promised before the election and it was a difficult position in which the Minister found himself.  I am hopeful, because the Minister gave us a good hearing, that in 2009 he will be able to consider the two schools that we spoke to him about that day, and, also Coosan national school.</P>
        <P>Athlone Community College is in a very precarious position.  Senator Healy Eames referred to schools that are risky from the point of view of health.  The school in Athlone was built initially for 500 pupils but now has 1,000.  We have acquired the land and I would ask the Minister to consider meeting with me again privately to discuss that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the announcement that the Minister will reintroduce the summer works scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I applaud works that have been done in the past on that scheme because it has been money well spent.  It was like spending pennies and gaining pounds.  In fixing a leaking roof, for example, one did not end up with damp or seeping walls which <Col N="352"/>would ensue otherwise.  It makes sense to spend a small amount of money in order to save a huge amount.</P>
        <P>During my research for this debate one of the school principals to whom I spoke suggested it would be good if a means could be found to ensure that schools would not have to pay water charges or VAT.  It is extraordinary that schools must pay water charges to a local authority.  That puts them on the same basis as a business or commercial entity.  If a way could be found to deal with that, it would make a huge difference as the water charges must be paid from the capitation grant.  Insurance costs are another problem.</P>
        <P>The other issue high on the agenda of the principals to whom I spoke was the problem of form filling and the amount of time they spend on book work.  There is also the issue of audits.  In one case an audit was to be carried out but the inspector rang at the last minute to say he or she could not come.  As the Minister can imagine, the school was under huge pressure getting organised for the audit only to have the meeting cancelled at the last minute.  I do not know whether the cancellation was due to over-work or inefficiency.  Now the school is back to square one, having to get itself organised again.  It is a huge amount of work for a school principal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another problem is the rising cost of electricity and gas.  There has been no provision in the capitation grants for that.  Principals are trying to make ends meet with the same amount of money they had last year, before these increases occurred.  Perhaps the Minister could examine ways of dealing with electricity and water charges and consider exempting schools from VAT in order that principals can get proper use of the capitation grant.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am delighted to welcome the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I believe this is the first opportunity we have had to welcome him formally to the Department of Education and Science.  I am pleased to move the amendment.  I read it out to Members because it explains what is taking place.  Listening to the speakers so far, and I anticipate more of the same, one would think everything had ground to a halt and that nothing had been done for the past ten years.  There has been no acknowledgement of the tremendous strides we have taken in education in the past decade.</P>
        <P>I fought a battle when I was first elected to the other House more than 12 years ago.  We could not get a remedial teacher for our schools.  There were approximately 27 remedial teachers for 144 schools, yet 78% of the schools were covered by remedial teachers.  That might appear an odd matter to be discussing in this day and age but five or six schools sharing a remedial teacher was the only extra support available in those days.  I welcome our esteemed Member, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>

	<P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that I recently received a little local publicity after producing a press release which stated that I was successful in getting the Government to toss my local school.  I was even more successful in that we secured the money to rebuild it.  The school was on the building programme for quite some time.  It involves an amalgamation and is now under construction.  Another school is under construction in Clonmany.</P>
        <P>Moville Community College also became a reality.  It started with prefabs but we did not like that concept so we approached the Minister and asked that the next stage be constructed in cement.  We promised it would not cost any more that the cost of prefab accommodation.  We delivered on that.  I raise this parochial issue as an example of how these things can be done.  The school now has a significant and beautiful building, although a little more must be done to finalise the overall accommodation needs.  Perhaps the Minister will note the name of the college.  The important element is that we undertook not to overspend.  Many projects have overspent in the past.  We also acknowledged that it was unnecessary to spend so much money <Col N="354"/>on architects, fees and so forth.  The standard model concept for four, six and eight teacher schools is cost effective.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames mentioned that there is a different economic climate now and said we should anticipate our future needs and what our children will be doing in the future.  I would therefore have been less surprised if the motion dealt with course content for primary school, how it is delivered and how to develop analytical skills and deliver the critical mind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Schooling is far more than the building, as we have proven on many occasions.  The Minister is providing more support for the development of buildings.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of helping teachers to minimise costs in the school.  A school principal told me a couple of years ago that the school&rsquo;s minor works money was being used for photocopying.  The school spent &euro;18,000 on photocopying.  I wondered how the school could manage that when there were 200 children in the school.  It sounded way beyond what was possible.  In the context of increases in the cost of water and electricity, much can be learned in school beyond what we would call the central disciplines of reading, writing and arithmetic.  This would develop very important skills for the growing child who will be living in a tighter economy over the next few years.  These types of lessons will prove to be very important.</P>
        <P>The Minister should continue to invest in teachers.  The 19,000 teachers and special needs assistants working with pupils with special needs must be in place.</P>
        <P>I agree with the concept of focusing on primary education but we must consider the pre-primary sector also.  I refer to children up to six years old.  We are facing financial difficulties and in this respect pre-primary development is the key to children&rsquo;s success at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many companies and organisations, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, replace computers after two years, sometimes earlier.  I cannot see why a little imagination could not be used by the organisations and schools, under the aegis of the Department, to maximise the numbers of computers in schools.  However, it is not enough to put computers in schools.  In 2000, the number of students per computer in Irish primary schools was 16.3 and this was reduced to 9.1 in 2005.  The corresponding figures at post-primary level were 10.9 and 7.  One of the most important tasks is to upgrade the software.  It is grand to have computers but if the software is not up to speed with current needs, we are not as far ahead as we want to be.</P>
        <P>My time has concluded but there are many more points I could make.  The economic climate will become more difficult but the Minister should continue to focus on the building programme, bearing in mind the economies of scale he has highlighted recently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is not meant to be understood, but the ordinary people of Ireland do not realise this.  There are various bands and procedures.  If any school could understand where it was in the process, it would be great, but this is not the case.</P>
        <P>There are two serious issues, the first of which concerns the quantum or sum of money.  I am not talking about that today because, as a realist, I recognise there is sometimes additional money and that, in times of economic stringency, there are cutbacks.  However, what is driving people to distraction and what is almost bringing the Adjournment debates of the House to a standstill is the inability to find out what is going on regarding a school project or what is being proposed.  One of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, Deputy Noel Dempsey, decided to dispose of all the trouble and simply list the schools in order of priority.  This has always been sought and the reason is very simple.  If the Minister created his list for this year and went to a Cabinet meeting at which it was said the list would have to be cut back by 5%, he would simply retain his priority list and tell schools that, instead of having their projects start on 1 January, they would start on 1 September.  They might not like that but they would understand it.  If the Minister states a place outside Balbriggan had a population of ten three years ago and now has a population of 5,000, thus warranting a school, it is reasonable and people cannot argue with it.  This is what is required.</P>
        <P>Before I start being more critical of the Minister, I will agree with him on one point.  I refer to his recent initiative to work out how many schools an area is entitled to.  When I was INTO general secretary, I forecasted this would happen.  We proceeded from circumstances in which no one could open a school to circumstances in which every one could do so, but then schools stopped receiving recognition.  We are now at a stage in which there is a very welcome variety of schools, including gaelscoileanna, special schools, multidenominational schools, and French and German schools.  This is all very well but this needs to be controlled from the point of view <Col N="356"/>of the taxpayer.  I accept we need to be sensible about the matter and I agree with the Minister in this regard.</P>
        <P>If someone from the Minister&rsquo;s constituency writes to the Department in respect of a school, he or she receives a response stating the school is on a band of a particular number from one to four.  The Minister is familiar with the bands but very few are.  People believe the bands are like the rungs of a ladder and that if one is on the first, one is on one&rsquo;s way to the second.  When they are told by the Department they are on a specified band &mdash; for example, the one that means they are ready to go &mdash; they believe their school is ready to be built.  However, they are then told that after being on bands, they must proceed to stages.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 70 pages in the design team procedures, which I know the Minister has never read because he is far too sensible.  The procedures involve the appointment of a design team.  There is a preliminary design stage, followed by a design stage, involving a sketch design.  This is followed by a detailed sketch design, a tender evaluation, a tender action and award, construction, handover and final account.  Each of these stages has a million subsections.</P>
        <P>This system of stages replaces the older one which involved the same length of time but with a different number of steps, just to add to the confusion.  People believe that when they progress from the bands to the stages, they are ready to proceed to tender on foot of receiving planning permission.  They do not realise that going out to tender is only that and it does not mean one can proceed to build.  When the authorities behind a school are ready to go, they discover the Minister&rsquo;s intervention into the priority list.  At the end of year, the Minister has another look at the list and says he does not like the inclusion of two particular schools, perhaps for the very best of reasons, and replaces them with two others that were never on the list.  Schools on the list this year, happy and relaxed in the belief that they are moving along, see the new list for next year and realise they are not on it at all.  I am not exaggerating as what I outline is happening.</P>
        <P>We are losing money hand over fist.  There is a hard-working group of civil servants in the building section of the Department who are not allowed to proceed with their work because there is no process.  They are fending off 3,000 schools every day that are asking questions.  They are trying to make excuses.  I once gave the example of staff in my office ringing the building section for information on a process only to be told they could not be given an answer and would have to ring the Minister&rsquo;s office.  We rang the Minister&rsquo;s office and were told we should be ringing the building section, which we had already rung.  We rang it again and were told to hold while the matter was being examined.  The phone was put on hold and the member of staff in question lifted another phone &mdash; we could hear all this going on &mdash; to ring the person in the building section to whom my personal assistant had been speaking five minutes earlier.  The member of staff returned to us with the answer on the phone.  Is this good management?  It is not.</P>

	<P>The issue is that whatever comes through, it will not be somebody in the building section but somebody in the Department of Education and Science who will have to go through the whole process all over again.  Despite this, we will not get an answer and Deputies must put down a parliamentary question or Senators must raise a matter on the Adjournment.  Senator Doherty has a matter on the Adjournment today concerning a school on which I have a file so high.  I would like the Minister to interpret what we are told, such as &ldquo;it is continually under review&rdquo; and so on.  The system is not working.</P>
        <P>We cannot, in this day and age, have a situation where the Minister can intervene and change the list without Members understanding the criteria, reasons and understandings behind why this is happening, which is why I have asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the operation of this area.  I guarantee I will get the Minister better value for the same amount of money if he lets me run the building section for a while.  Builders should be told they have a particular envelope of money.  If they can build a school for that amount, with the required specification, they should go ahead and do it &mdash; we know they can do it.  Whether these matters go through a proper tendering process, it is just not happening at present.  There is no value for money.  This is driving people to distraction, not just at school level but also among Deputies and Senators who are trying to deal with these questions but cannot get answers.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister do what the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, did?  Will he put the list for 2009 on the Department&rsquo;s website?  The Minister knows I am as good as my word on these matters.  I promise him that if the list must be changed, and there is a good and valid reason for changing it, I will back him up.  Circumstances alter cases, as my grandfather always told me.  One has to deal with changing circumstances, whatever they happen to be.  At least if it is open and clear, people would understand what is happening even if they do not like it.  At present, they do not understand the system.  They complain of all sorts of issues, such as political interference and local involvement.  The problem is that nobody believes in the system.  It is like the situation with the banks &mdash; we must restore confidence in the building section.</P>
        <P>The last time I raised an issue with the building section under the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, I was in total frustration.  I was told that if I was so concerned, I should put it down as an Adjournment matter.  That is on the record, with the names of those involved and so on, but it is no answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the Minister in the House to listen to the debate and I wish him well.  He has come into office at a bad time and has a huge challenge ahead.  With his educational background and being a good listener, he has taken on board the points made and I know we can look forward to a very good future for education with him monitoring this area.</P><Col N="358"/>
        <P>I must recognise the Government&rsquo;s input to education since 1997.  We are dealing with taxpayers&rsquo; money and we need to tell the public what has gone into education.  Of course more needs to be done, but that investment must be acknowledged and I intend to put it on the record in this contribution.</P>
        <P>In 2008, &euro;9.3 billion went to education, an increase of &euro;690 million from 2007.  This was to provide additional school places to meet demographic expansion, investment in school buildings throughout the country, and, a matter close to my heart, the investment in the DEIS programme to address educational disadvantage, for which &euro;800 million was allocated.  I want this to be a main focus.  If we get education right at primary level, we will not have problems at secondary level.  The funding must be focused on areas such as the provision of additional teachers, remedial teachers and other supports, including links with parents.  If we get it right at that level, we are in a win-win situation in our educational programme right through to second level and beyond.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on one aspect of the motion, namely, capital expenditure on schools.  The capital allocation for the school building programme has grown steadily in recent years, from just under &euro;400 million in 2004 to &euro;542 million in 2007 and to &euro;586 million this year.  Senators should reflect on this huge commitment.  The Government invested over &euro;2.6 billion in over 7,800 school building projects over the lifetime of the last national development plan.  The principal component of school building and modernisation is the delivery of large-scale projects.  The expected completion of large-scale projects in 2008 will consist of 21 new schools and 46 extension or refurbishment projects, giving an overall total of 67 large-scale projects.</P>
        <P>In September, the Minister announced another 25 projects to progress through the building programme, which included 20 primary schools.  Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of PPP schools and the second bundle of schools was offered to the market early this year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the summer works scheme, I am pleased that since 2004 over 3,000 projects consisting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is good to know the Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place and he understands these summer projects are important.  While it is a pity this is often not acknowledged, I am happy to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to take up the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole with regard to the lack of transparency, which I agree exists.  I have difficulty explaining to school principals how the criteria are assessed with regard to what schools should be listed and so on.  I do not understand the process but, having done some research on the issue, I am pleased to note the Minister is upgrading the Department&rsquo;s website, which may be able to communicate further <Col N="359"/>information in the simple way we all want.  I sometimes think I am remedial when I listen to what the Department tells us about how school projects are listed in terms of need.</P>
        <P>An important point is that the Minister is about to establish development area units.  This is a good move which will identify where schools are needed and will link in with the local authorities.  When I was a councillor, it was difficult, as it still is, to get information from the Department of Education and Science with regard to forward planning and how a county council would incorporate a school into an action plan.  Co-ordination was not good, so I hope this matter is tidied up.  Given that commuter belts lead to huge pressures on schools, these units would help to solve the problem as they would take account of demographic factors when locating schools.  We need the information map on where country schools should be located.  These are simple things; they are not insurmountable.  Dealing with the lack of transparency would be a move which would be welcomed by principals.</P>
        <P>We are in a downturn.  Significant sums of money are going into education.  We are trying to upgrade the building programme as much as possible.  Teachers are not too unhappy with how the schools are working generally.  I am out and about as much as everyone else, and let there be no doubt about it.  I hear negatives and positives.  My job is to try to get a balance between the two.  The positives outweigh the negatives.  We have some problems, and I know the Minister has noted them.  I wish him well in overcoming them.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his portfolio.  Education is about every child being able to realise his or her potential.  It is also about society reaching its potential.  We invest in education from the national purse because we believe no child should be denied the opportunity provided by education.  The amount we are willing to invest in education tells us a lot about our national priorities.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, Ireland lags behind most other OECD countries in its education expenditure in almost every sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the facts.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>According to recent figures, Ireland spends less than 4.7% of gross domestic product on education, compared with an OECD average of 6.2%.  These figures tell us what almost every parent in the country already knows, that our schools, especially our primary schools, cannot make ends meet without generous voluntary contributions, fund-raising and overdraft facilities.</P>
        <P>A recent survey by the Irish Primary Principals Network and the National Parents Council found that in excess of 40% of parents were paying more than &euro;100 in voluntary contributions for the day-to-day running of the schools.  The IPPN also found that almost one third of parents&rsquo; associations have to raise more than &euro;10,000 a year just to keep the doors open.  Another survey by the IPPN found that the average 100-pupil school received &euro;17,300 for this academic year.  Out of this it is expected to pay for heating, electricity, water and other utility bills, cleaning, repairs, insurance, office supplies and classroom materials.  These basic running costs amount to an average of &euro;34,310, leaving such a school with a deficit of approximately &euro;17,000.</P>
        <P>The Department is aware of this.  It funds schools with a clear knowledge and understanding that they will have to contend with chronic debt from day one.  A brand new school is granted &euro;6,348 to last it from before it opens its doors in September until the capitation grant arrives in January.  This sum is expected to pay for recruiting staff, equipment for classrooms, essentials such as computers, and photocopiers.  Unfortunately it costs approximately &euro;50,000 to set up a new seven-classroom school.</P><Col N="360"/>
        <P>It is not only the paucity of funding for day-to-day running of schools, but also the methodology of delivering that funding that causes difficulties for schools, principals and parents.  The capitation grant is based on school enrolment for the previous year.  This means rapidly expanding schools, such as those in Balbriggan and other newer suburbs, must resource new schools from funds allocated based on outdated information.  Surely it must be possible to anticipate that if there is a need for a new school in the first place, there will be a high demand for places.  Most schools will have a reasonably accurate idea before September of how many pupils they will have for the next academic year.  Why is the capitation grant not delivered to schools before pupils begin the school year?</P>
        <P>Parents were promised a doubling of capitation grants for primary education prior to the previous general election.  This promise has been reneged upon.  A derisory increase was given in the previous budget.  This promise must be fulfilled.  Doubling the core capitation grant for the day-to-day running of schools is fundamentally about taking the crisis out of managing a primary school.  It would cost approximately &euro;82 million, less than 1% of the total education budget.  Inflation, rising energy costs, rising insurance premiums and water charges mean that incremental increases in capitation grants are wiped out almost as soon as they are introduced.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science must be aware of the real cost of running schools.  Second level schools rarely need to fund-raise for necessities.  This is because when a child enters secondary school, he or she is automatically worth almost twice the amount of capitation funding as for primary schools.  The core capitation grant goes towards the day-to-day running of a school, yet it costs the same to heat, light and run a building regardless of the ages of the children in it.</P>
        <P>The primary management bodies have expressed this inbuilt inequality in stark terms.  In a recent statement they said that the lack of realistic capitation and ancillary grants means that almost all schools will be sustained only by their community fund-raising efforts.  This is socially divisive.  Newer schools, and those in less advantaged areas are unable to match the fund-raising capabilities of those in well-off areas.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair that children are disadvantaged in this manner in this day and age.  The effect of this is that a school in a well-off area which can afford to raise up to &euro;90,000 in a year can be almost the desirable digital school with the best of everything, while a school in a disadvantaged area, even allowing for extra funding to pay for extra reading tuition and subsidised school tours, simply does not have this option.</P>
        <P>Our Constitution guarantees the right to an education.  That right should not be contingent on the wealth of one&rsquo;s parents.  Underfunding of schools for basic equipment has become such a fact of life that retail business has moved into the vacuum.  The private sector has spotted a lucrative niche in the form of voucher schemes for computers and PE gear.  We have computers provided by one supermarket chain and footballs by another.  It is disturbing that children are being used as marketing agents by supermarkets which exploit the lack of equipment in schools to get parents to spend a considerable amount of money in their outlets.  These schemes, which depend on high levels of private consumption, privilege a certain type of customer and, in turn, a certain type of school.  What other public service requires its manager to pack bags in the local supermarket or to organise cake sales to keep the lights on?  Instead of being teachers, human resources managers, innovators and leaders our schools need and deserve, principals are semi-permanent fund-raisers.</P><Col N="361"/>
        <P>It is difficult to believe education is a real priority for this Government.  The most vulnerable children have the right to be cared for and respected in the education system.  Our economy, as many Ministers in Government are saying, needs graduates, but they do not materialise at 18 or 21.  Primary education is the cornerstone of the knowledge economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the first crucial rung on the ladder that allows us to reach further and higher.  As such, we should look closely at how well primary schools allow children to climb that ladder.  It is difficult, therefore, to understand the reluctance of the Government to make the necessary leap in investment to free our schools from worries about money and allow them to be visionary about the future, which is their role.  The Minister may refer in his response to the downturn in our economic circumstances.  This Government is reaping what it has sown in the economy, and there is less money available than in the recent past, something which is widely acknowledged.  However, according to Minister, last year the Department of Education and Science spent approximately 5% of total investment in school buildings on the rental of prefabs.  Taking first and second level together, we estimate this to be approximately &euro;30 million.  This is an annual cost and would go a considerable way towards meeting the modest cost of increasing the capitation grant.</P>
        <P>It may be necessary to make trade-offs, and that must be acknowledged, if we are to make the kind of investment that will bring education to the level enjoyed in other EU countries.  Those countries famous for their progressive approach to education, especially early childhood and primary education, did not produce their education system by chance.  They made a choice, decided what mattered to them and set about delivering it.  It is not sufficient that we depend on the goodwill of our school leaders, teachers and parents to compensate with tireless energy and commitment for what we deny them in funds and working conditions.  Investing in our children is long-term planning which will in time help tackle anti-social behaviour, promote Ireland as a knowledge economy, tackle obesity and improve our nation&rsquo;s health.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I thank Senators Healy Eames, McFadden, O&rsquo;Toole, Ormonde, Keaveney and Ryan for their contributions which were positive, though sometimes erratic.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the allocations in the Department of Education and Science since 1997, it can be seen that this year alone, &euro;9.3 billion was the education budget, which is unbelievable.  The continued prioritisation of education in the past 11 years has reversed the historic under-investment in areas such as school facilities, services for children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas.  People have quoted from the OECD report to the effect that Ireland is down the field.  That report is based on 2005 figures and does not take into account the significant investment in education in the past three years.</P>

	<P>Eight years of government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not an up-to-date document.</P>
        <P>Progress in recent years has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from &euro;95.87 per pupil in 2001 to its current rate of &euro;178.58.  That represents an increase of 86% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2001.  That compares to a cumulative increase of 30% in the consumer price index between 2001 and the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>The value of the ancillary services grant for the employment of caretakers and secretaries in schools has almost doubled in the same period, from &euro;76.18 to the current rate of &euro;151.50 per pupil.  In 2008, my Department paid approximately &euro;167 million to primary schools to meet <Col N="362"/>their day-to-day running costs.  The improvements in the capitation and ancillary grants mean the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools has increased this year by &euro;21 to &euro;330 per pupil.  In 2001, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than &euro;52,000 to meet its day-to-day running costs.  That same school today is receiving just under &euro;100,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>They are still in debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I should also point out that enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from &euro;457  to &euro;880 per pupil &mdash; an average increase of about 42% on the rate payable in 2006.  By any standards that is a significant improvement within a relatively short period of time.  That funding does not include the salary costs of teachers and special needs assistants.  Currently, there are 19,000 extra assistants in classrooms between SNAs, language support teachers and the other assistants provided in classrooms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Budget 2008 provided my Department with &euro;4.6 billion or &euro;380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions.  That allocation provides for more than 2,000 extra primary teachers than when the Government took office.  In 2008 my Department will spend approximately &euro;800 million on social inclusion measures across all levels of education, which represents an increase of approximately &euro;70 million on 2007.  That is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school.</P>
        <P>In 2005 my predecessor launched DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, which focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  A total of 673 primary and 203 second level schools currently participate in the programme.  Schools in DEIS can benefit from such measures as lower pupil-teacher ratio, additional capitation, access to school meals, planning supports and enhanced levels of school book grants.  In the 2007 to 2008 school year, DEIS-related grants totalling approximately &euro;14 million were paid to primary schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
        <P>In addition to the improvements to funding we are also helping to achieve administrative efficiencies in our schools.  An example of that was my Department&rsquo;s decision to take over the payroll for various categories of school staff, including more than 8,000 special needs assistants in primary schools, which avoids the inefficiencies and associated costs of having them paid individually at local school level.  Similar type savings for schools are also expected to be achieved when part-time primary teachers are set up and paid through the Department&rsquo;s payroll rather than the current payment system, which is through a grant to individual schools.  An on-line claims system for processing the payment of substitute teachers in schools has also been rolled out by my Department.  Changes to procedures for advertising teaching posts have been made this year to enable schools to achieve reductions on advertising costs through the advertising of teaching vacancies on the Internet.</P>
        <P>In every county in Ireland, we are working hard to ensure all schools have high-quality, modern facilities.  That is not an easy task, given the need to reverse the effects of decades of under-investment in existing schools and to meet the demand for school buildings as a result of demographic changes, and the increase in the number of teachers in schools.  However, huge progress is being made and should be acknowledged.  The capital allocation for the school building programme has grown steadily in recent years from approximately &euro;400 million in <Col N="363"/>2004 to &euro;542 million in 2007 and to in excess of &euro;586 million this year.  That compares to approximately &euro;92 million in 1997.</P>
        <P>The budget for 2007 was the first year of the roll-out of the new national development plan, which will involve an investment of more than &euro;4.5 billion in school building infrastructure in the coming years.  The investment will be the largest in the history of the State and it will enable my Department to ensure school places will be available, where needed, and to continue to take a proactive approach to the modernisation of existing school building stock.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have indicated clearly that they see the school building programme as productive investment in the future and they stated they will continue the level of investment in school building.</P>
        <P>The principal component of the school building and modernisation programme is the delivery of large-scale projects.  The expected completion of large-scale projects in 2008 will consist of 21 new schools and 46 extension-refurbishment projects giving an overall total of 67 large-scale projects.  That is in addition to an overall total of 60 large-scale projects completed in 2007.  An additional feature of the 2008 school building and modernisation programme is the provision of new schools in developing areas under an accelerated programme.  This year, as part of a fast-track programme of construction my Department built six 16-classroom schools, 20 eight-classroom schools and a number of smaller projects in those areas where school accommodation was under greatest pressure.  To achieve that unprecedented level of accommodation provision in such a short timeframe, my Department used a modern method of off-site construction to deliver buildings of first-class quality and design in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
        <P>In the construction of all new schools, my Department has been conscious of the need to promote sustainability and energy efficiency.  My Department has produced technical guidance documents for those involved in school construction, which focus on four key areas, namely, design, awareness, research and technology.  Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents are capable of being 2.3 times more energy efficient than schools built to best international practice.</P>
        <P>In terms of ensuring value for money, my Department pioneered competitive fee bidding for design consultants on my Department&rsquo;s generic repeat design schools.  Since January 2007, all new construction consultancy appointments have been on a competitive fee basis using the new Government conditions of engagement.  As a result, in the past four years the cost of professional fees has been reduced by 20%.</P>
        <P>With regard to the cost of construction contracts, my Department has pioneered fixed price tendering in the public sector, having operated fixed price tendering since 1993 for all projects with a construction duration of less than 15 months.  On Monday, 29 September I announced a further tranche of projects to progress through the school building programme.  These include five primary and two post-primary projects which are to prepare to go on site before the end of 2008; 12 primary and three post-primary projects are to proceed to tender, with a view to going on site in the first half of 2009; and three primary schools are to progress up to and including application for planning permission and preparation of tender documents, with a view to the earliest possible date to go on site.  The projects announced were selected on the basis of need using the Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria.  These criteria took into account factors such as growth in demand for school places as a result of demographic trends and the need to modernise existing schools.</P>
        <P>Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of public private partnership schools and the second bundle of schools were offered to the market earlier this year.  It is planned that a further bundle will be offered to the market next year.  Under the permanent accommodation and small schools scheme in 2007, some 130 projects were completed.  To date <Col N="364"/>in 2008, some 52 projects under these devolved projects have been completed, while a further 174 projects are under construction.  In addition, a further 148 devolved projects have not yet gone on site but it is expected that the majority of these will be under construction before the year-end.  With such a high level of activity underway, the completion of buildings in 2008 under these devolved schemes will significantly exceed the number of projects completed in 2007.  I am glad it was acknowledged by Senator O&rsquo;Toole that I introduced a new scheme this year which gives schools that have applied for grant aid to purchase prefabs the option of using the money to build permanent structures. The primary and post-primary capital allocation for 2008 is at an all time high.  The combined output of traditional build schools, the extension and refurbishment projects and the schools fast-tracked for delivery in September 2008 has resulted in the practical completion of a record level of school building projects.  When the large-scale projects are combined with the expected level of projects being completed under the permanent accommodation and small schools schemes this year, it is clear that the scale of delivery in 2008 is unprecedented and is an absolutely outstanding achievement.</P>

	<P>Since its introduction in 2004 the summer works scheme has been a key component of the programme of funding maintenance and smaller scale capital works in schools.  More than 3,000 projects costing in excess of &euro;300 million have been completed under the scheme since 2004.  With such a large number of projects completed in the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 was on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, <Col N="365"/>while also continuing the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Therefore, my Department focussed on delivering as many large-scale projects as possible in 2008 and for this reason there was no summer works scheme this year.  However, as I have already confirmed, it is my intention to have a summer works scheme in 2009.  The applications for the summer works scheme, which my Department has already received from schools for the 2008 scheme will be assessed for 2009.  The professional and technical reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects in order that schools will not be at a loss of expenditure on those reports.</P>

	<P>I have outlined the large amount of expenditure on major capital works and the summer works scheme in schools.  However, all primary schools get an annual minor works grant which can be used at their discretion to carry out small-scale works.  This grant has been paid in each school year since its introduction in 1996 and 1997.  In November 2006, the Government increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% from the previous year.  Some &euro;27 million was paid out to primary schools throughout the country in the 2007 to 2008 school year to enable thousands of small-scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.  Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per pupil.  It is intended that the grant for the 2008 to 2009 school year will be paid in early 2009.</P><Col N="366"/>

	<P>Schools have been given broadband connectivity under the schools broadband access programme, which my Department has implemented with the support of the Telecommunications and Internet Federation.  The National Centre for Technology in Education has provided a programme of continuing professional development for teachers, with more than 144,000 training places having been availed of by primary and post-primary teachers since 1998.  Disadvantaged schools are benefiting from the &euro;3.4 million ICT grant scheme for delivering equality of opportunity in schools plan, DEIS, schools from the dormant accounts fund and a new fund of &euro;1 million is now being made available to assist some of the most disadvantaged DEIS schools achieve digital school status.</P>
        <P>We must ensure our students develop digital competence to fully participate in our rapidly changing world.  However, the integration of ICT into our teaching and learning encompasses more than the acquisition of ICT skills.  When used effectively, ICT enriches teaching and learning across the whole curriculum and I assure the House that I am committed to promoting the integration of ICT into teaching and learning, as resources permit.</P>

It is that sensible and balanced management of the economy that has enabled the Government to make substantial investment in education in the past decade.  The Government is moving to protect the gains our country has made, including those in the education sector, by ensuring responsible management of the public finances. </P>
        <P>I want to respond to some points made to me during the course of the debate, one of which is the issue of criteria, bands and the publication of those bands.  I want transparency in everything that is done in the Department.  Members should note that all of the projects are chosen on the basis of criteria agreed among the education partners.  I am considering how that information can be made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The website is being upgraded.  That work will be completed before the end of the year and it is my intention to put all those projects on the website.  That will meet the demands of people like Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>I take issue with Members on the idea that principal teachers have too much time in class and not enough time for administration.</P>

	<P>On the question of grants and running costs in schools, in 2001 a 300 pupil school got &pound;52,000 towards its running costs.  In 2008, a school with 300 pupils gets &euro;100,000.  I have indicated clearly in the D&aacute;il that I would like to see the capitation fee for schools increased.  It is my intention, as Minister for Education and Science, to try to bring that about as best I can in a period when resources are not as freely available.  I will be very sympathetic in any consideration of the budget I have in place.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that education remains at the forefront.  In terms of the capital programme, the Government has indicated that it is committed to the building of new schools and extensions and the refurbishment of schools to meet the requirements of the developing areas.</P>
        <P>When I hear people bitterly criticise the building unit I ask them to note that last September, 7,000 new places were provided for primary school children in the greater Dublin area.  Not one child was left without a school place.  Members should compare that to the previous September when there was major difficulty.  The reason for that success is that we put together a developing areas team within the Department of Education and Science.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for housing we interacted with each city and county manager and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  We set up a database into which we put all of the demographic growths within the various areas and this year we ensured that no child was without a school place in September.  That was a remarkable achievement.  A total of 7,000 children went into those schools without a hitch or a complaint.  Everybody was happy and I congratulate my building unit.</P>

	<P>On the question of water charges, the Senator must remember that in the past few years we put in a graded system of charges and that system will remain in place until 2009.  This year I will examine how I can help schools with the various projects and as part of the summer works scheme I am considering a programme that will examine energy conservation and water conservation.  There are minor works to be done in schools which would allow them halve the cost of the water they use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  It is my pleasure to formally support the motion proposed so eloquently and comprehensively by my colleague, Senator Healy-Eames, and seconded by my other colleague, Senator McFadden.</P>
        <P>Regarding the debate on education, nobody can deny that investment in education has been fundamental to the economic success of this country in recent years.  By way of a cautionary note in the debate, it will be a major error to proceed with cuts in the area of education in the future as part of any reconfiguration of national finances because our taking advantage of any future good economic winds is dependent on present day investment in education.  Investment in education is not only socially desirable but economically fruitful and necessary to the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a critical point.  We are not talking about something that will not have a return.  The return will be 100-fold.  An educated young people is the engine that will drive economic progress and make us adaptable to the changing economic environment.</P>
        <P>I was heartened to hear the Minister say he is prepared to concede the idea of putting the order of school building projects on the Internet.  That is welcome but I challenge the Minister&rsquo;s statement that there are objective criteria.  We have sufficient anecdotal evidence and evidence in local media to indicate that during elections communities are given the impression they will get a new school but it does not happen.  The Minister should go a stage further and remove the allocation of schools from the political process by putting in place discernible, simple, objective criteria and putting that on the web.  That would take politics out of this area.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is to be congratulated on his activities in this area in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As stated in Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s motion, we must acknowledge that we have a crisis in the school building area.  There was a good deal of investment in teaching personnel in recent years, and rightly so, including resource teachers and so on, but that was to the detriment of a schools building programme.  We currently have many derelict school buildings and a proliferation of prefabs on grounds, removing playing areas and creating bad conditions, and a lack of adequate school buildings throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not an exaggeration to say there is a crisis in school building and that crisis must be addressed in an imaginative way but some issues must borne in mind in that regard.  The cost of prefabs is astronomical.  The cost of maintaining an unemployed building worker on the dole on unemployment assistance or, as we call it now, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, is hugely expensive also.  The potential of money spent on school buildings and materials by builders going back into the economy is enormous.  If we were to employ our tragically unemployed, or potentially unemployed, building workers on school building projects throughout the country, the net cost would be low when matters like VAT returns, the reduced cost of social welfare and the non-existent cost of prefabs in such a scenario are factored in.  If grants were given to local communities under devolved schemes, it would be easier to source local builders under such ventures.  Good value for money would be secured in such circumstances.  I do not doubt that at a time of unemployment among building workers and depression in the construction sector as a whole, my proposal represents an opportunity to tackle the school building issue in a coherent national way.  I am not sure the Minister has given us sufficient confidence to believe that will happen.</P><Col N="370"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to ensure this becomes a priority for the Government.  The crisis in school buildings is matched by the crisis in the construction sector.  If we think outside the box by marrying the two crises imaginatively, in a way that ensures construction workers can benefit from locally devolved grants when building new school facilities, we will save money.  I suggest that when the cost of not doing this is calculated, it will turn out to be more or less cost-neutral.  I thank God that our children leave exquisite and beautiful homes each morning.  If they go from that to a cramped and inadequate school environment, however, the contradiction will be too much for them to be able to learn effectively.  It was more tolerable in the olden days, when children went from primitive housing conditions to primitive school buildings.  One cannot synchronise the two in a modern context.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will not think I am wrong if I mention some local issues in passing.  We are all familiar with the Tip O&rsquo;Neill maxim that &ldquo;all politics is local&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister of State to bring high into his consideration the plight of the people of Virginia and Laragh in County Cavan, who are waiting for new schools.  They have believed since the last election that new schools would be built.  They were told they would get new schools, but they have not been built.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the projects.  I am delighted that a senior executive with Cavan County Council, Mr. Geelan, is present for this debate.  Protocol does not allow me to welcome him, unfortunately.  I am sure he is anxious to hear the Minister of State give us a positive signal on the two schools.</P>
        <P>If we do not pursue an accelerated schools building programme immediately, we will have missed an opportunity.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say he is considering public private partnerships.  Some such schemes are coming on stream.  If the Exchequer cannot afford to pay for projects, the Minister should use the public private partnership model, which involves the release of buildings back into State hands over time.  We should not have recourse to this model from the outset, but we should use it if the alternative is to leave children in primitive conditions.</P>
        <P>I was heartened to hear the Minister say he intends to revisit the summer works scheme.  I am not sure he gave us a sufficient assurance in that regard, however.  Perhaps the Minister of State will make it clear that new applications will be accepted for 2009, in addition to those which were made in respect of 2008.  The summer works scheme represents good economics.  A stitch in time saves nine.  If one uses the summer works scheme to fix a problem that is threatening the structure of the school, one will save money in the long run if one succeeds in preserving the building.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to make a new attempt to achieve a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  This is necessary in the interests of economic progress, the quality of life of our people and the need to integrate our immigrant population.  It is a tragedy that the pupil-teacher ratio reduction scheme has been put on hold.  It is a false economy, false social planning and false thinking.  It needs to be addressed as a priority.</P>
        <P>I will conclude with a final point.  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.  It is critical that we consider pumping more money into teaching English to our new immigrants.  I do not think that has been sufficiently identified as an issue.  Our strategy should be to provide for further investment.  If we could get immigrants to speak English, the benefit to this country in social <Col N="371"/>and economic terms would well merit the investment.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak.  I anxiously await the Minister of State&rsquo;s responses to the specific matters I have raised.</P>

	<P>While I understand much of what this evening&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion is trying to achieve, I feel that Fine Gael has adopted too much of a scattergun approach.  The wording of the motion does not make it clear whether Fine Gael&rsquo;s primary concern is the size of the capitation fee, the level of infrastructural spending on school buildings or the extent of additional expenditure on IT matters.  The motion does not seem to be concerned about whether Ireland&rsquo;s investment in education, particularly primary education, delivers the best bang for its buck in terms of the quality of education young people receive.  I would have thought that would have been the starting point for any debate on primary education.  I accept that many of the other issues raised in the motion need to be tackled as they are causing difficulties.  We should accept that the quality of education in this country is very high despite those difficulties.  We should acknowledge those who help us to provide such a high standard of education.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about some of the individual matters that are itemised in the motion.  Some of the wording used in the motion is unfortunate and unnecessarily political.  The reference to Ireland&rsquo;s supposedly &ldquo;Third World standard of ICT infrastructure&rdquo; is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a Third World standard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;an insult to the developing world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an insult to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that anything is of a &ldquo;Third World standard&rdquo; prejudges the kind of standard that exists in many countries.  While I agree that our ICT infrastructure is not what it should be, I understand that the Departments of Education and Science and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have an innovative initiative in the pipeline, to be announced in the coming months.  I hope the Opposition will take on board that announcement when it is made.</P>
        <P>There is no argument about the need for new school buildings and ancillary school infrastructure works.  As Senator Buttimer is aware, I make the same argument when I experience poor standards in my own local area.  There is a lack of transparency in the system.  We need a system that brings that about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could be prosecuted for his lack of understanding of this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will outline the problem with the schools building programme.  We need to look beyond the need to construct new schools and repair those which are quite old.  We should try to provide schools which are cost efficient.  Schools are the public buildings that are most numerous in our society.  If we are to create an environment in which people can go through the education system in the most acceptable manner, we need to provide for the highest possible standards in our schools.  Despite the straitened times in which we find ourselves, the Departments of Education and Science and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are about to announce an initiative whereby many of our schools will be retrofitted <Col N="372"/>to make them more cost efficient and energy efficient.  The initiative should help school boards of management.</P>
        <P>The problems associated with educational finance revolve around the extent to which money is being used efficiently within the administrative infrastructure that is in place.  The Opposition is entitled to argue that the inconsistent nature of much of the funding that is provided by the Department of Education and Science allows neither for proper administration nor for the most efficient use of the moneys in question.  We also need to question whether certain bodies, such as VECs, use their funds as effectively as they could.  I was a member of an efficient VEC in Cork that has one of the highest standards in the country.  We have dodged the debate on the number of VECs in this country.  What functions should they have?  How many should we have to ensure they are as efficient as possible?  If we were to examine this area of educational expenditure, we might decide to reduce the level of administration that pertains to quite small urban units.  We could achieve significant savings in such a manner.  Such moneys badly need to be reinvested in our education system.</P>
        <P>We are entering a period in which there are questions about the level of funding that we can and should be giving to education.  I hope that decisions announced on Tuesday will be made on the basis that they protect the most vulnerable in our society and recognise the need for those to be given access to the best quality education at primary level.  I look forward to returning to this debate after the Minister has dealt with those questions.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Boyle for his ecumenical gesture and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  </P>
        <P>I attended a public meeting on Monday night in Kinsale community school regarding its much needed extension.  The experience was similar to those felt by other Members of this House.  The school principal was told on 5 April 2007 that the extension was urgent, but on 22 April 2008 it was classified as an early stage development.  From where did the change come?  Why did it go from &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; in April 2007 to &ldquo;early stage&rdquo; in April 2008?</P>
        <P>There were public representatives at the meeting, but we could not answer any of these questions.  What type of language is being used here?  Why does the Minister select different phrases to describe various stages without providing a clear timeline or giving guidelines?  Public representatives could be then allowed to do our duty by informing people of what they can expect and when they can expect it.</P>
        <P>I also have a proposal regarding Gaelscoil Chloch na gCoillte.  This school is in operation since the mid-1990s.  A total of 28 prefabs are being rented on a site which is also being rented.  It costs around &euro;300,000 per annum to operate that Gaelscoil.  In 1997, the principal met with the then newly appointed Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and proposed that the Department guarantee a mortgage that would be taken out by the board of management and repaid by the board.  The board would use the then equivalent of &euro;300,000 per annum to pay back the mortgage.  It was a new departure from practice and thinking, and the Minister stated it was an eminently sensible suggestion.  Yet here we are 11 years later and the suggestion has never been followed through, in spite of all the dead money paid in rent since.</P>
        <P>The devolved works scheme allowed some imprimatur from the board, but unfortunately that is no more.  Such an idea would take people who have lost their jobs in construction off social welfare, which is a saving to the Exchequer, and put them into a revenue contributing status.  That is something that merits investigation by the Department.  If the State can guarantee banks, it can surely guarantee mortgages for our schools.  In conclusion, we need transparency and accountability in relation to the schools building programme.</P>

	<P>I would like to share my time with Senator Buttimer.  I was somewhat disappointed with what the Minister had to say, but I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  If one reads between the lines of what the Minister had to say, it looks as if there will be a freeze on educational spending next week.  The speech he made was peppered with code words like &ldquo;as resources permit&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the changed circumstances&rdquo; and &ldquo;consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy&rdquo;.  This means we will not get any good news for schools next week.  I suppose we cannot expect it, but we should make a special plea for primary schools.</P>
        <P>I do not claim to be an expert on education or on how it operates, but I have a certain knowledge of waste in the public service.  It is fair to say that, in the educational world, there is far less waste than in other Departments.  The value for money that comes from the Department of Education and Science is far greater than others, and not just in the immediate sense.  The Minister talks in a lame way about administrative efficiencies; there is no problem with that as one could talk about them forever.  It is a bit of a cliche to say this, but the money put into education today pays off forever.  It is difficult to accept that there can be any justification for cuts of any sort next week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met a group of primary teachers here not long ago.  One of the most distressing things was that their morale has been almost destroyed.  These people were very dedicated.  They were not overpaid but they were not in the slightest bit worried about it, which was striking.  I asked them what was worrying them.  Not one of them mentioned pay, which is a big change from ten years ago.  This indicated to me that they were demoralised because of the conditions in which they had to work.  The Minister knows the stories of people working in overcrowded classrooms, in terrapin huts and with no computers.  Incidentally, I cannot believe that the Minister is congratulating himself on having one computer for every nine pupils.  That means there are eight people waiting all the time.</P>

	<P>I would have thought the ambition should be one each at this stage.  It is  devastating that we have such limited ambitions for education, and it appears we are being softened up and at the very best we will get no progress, no expansion and no kept promises.</P>
        <P>The issue of school buildings is one with which the Minister of State will be familiar.  It is totally unacceptable that anybody should have to work in such conditions, not to mention the young people of Ireland who are educated in them.  Another issue is that of transparency which would solve the problem, although there is a reluctance to have any transparency for reasons that are quite apparent.  Those teachers I met were convinced that there were political shenanigans going on in regard to the priority being given to certain schools and not to others.  The politicians were interfering and priority was given to schools which were politically sensitive.  It is difficult to ask Fianna F&aacute;il politicians not to do that sort of thing, because it is in their nature to do so, but it is wrong to play around with the lives and education of young people for political advantage.  A more transparent system would be more important.</P>
        <P>The other area in which the Government has blatantly broken its promise is that of the pupil-teacher ratio.  The commitment in the programme for Government was 24 pupils to one teacher in both primary and secondary schools, but approximately 100,000 pupils are still in classes with more than 30 pupils to one teacher.  This is unacceptable, but whereas that has not only been breached, the ambition to bring it down has also been lost.  Next week we will have a decision that will delay all the commitments the Minister outlined in his speech.  Educational professionals, and primary school teachers in particular, are demoralised by the Government&rsquo;s attitude to education, which should get a special place in the budget next week.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing time with me.  I am disappointed that the Minister has gone, because he is effectively putting a freeze on educational spending and he has given us the advance notice tonight.  It can be dressed up in any way, but cutbacks are here.  The Fianna F&aacute;il election promise on reducing class sizes, on its commitment to special needs, ICT and the schools building programme is gone.  The Minister has misled the Irish people by telling them, and the children of Ireland, blatant lies.  Be it on the heads of the Members opposite when they speak about investment in education because the Government has failed the people of Ireland.  </P>
        <P>The Minister referred to information technology.  What happened last June when the Department of Education and Science decided to axe 20 IT advisers to schools?  Where was the commitment of the Government?  These IT advisers were giving support to the development of computer and IT education in schools.  They are gone at the stroke of a pen.  This is short-sighted vision.</P>

	<P Just="Left">What happened to the people in Cork South Central, to the people of Ballygarvan and the Star of the Sea school in Passage who were waiting for a new school?  We have heard the Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, trotting out promise after promise and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, now doing the same.  The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, did not care because she was not from Cork.  What message are we giving the young people in our satellite towns and in Ballygarvan and Passage?  We are telling them we do not care about them, that we do not give a damn.  The message is that they can be educated in a prefab or in a rat-infested school or in an overcrowded classroom.  Senator Ross is correct.  Morale in education is at an all time low, but the Government and the Members opposite talk about changing economic times and cutbacks.  The Members opposite forget that cutbacks affect people and the lives of people and the fact that the quality of education is dependent upon a built environment, a suitable learning environment along with suitable personnel.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s policy is not adding up.  It can be dressed up by the Members opposite but these are the facts.  The OECD report states that Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on education is the third lowest in Europe, it has the second largest primary school classes in Europe and there are four more pupils in Irish classes than in any other EU country.  The commitment of this Government to education is negligible.</P>

	<P>A this is my second time today to be Paddy last in a fairly lengthy debate, I need to have a chat with my Whip.  In the meantime, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, who is always very generous with his time in this House.  I had hoped to have a chance to welcome my neighbour and new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, but unfortunately he had to leave the House.  One advantage of him addressing the House before I spoke was that I had an opportunity to listen very closely to his presentation.  If the truth were told, I think some of my colleagues on the Opposition benches were also fairly impressed.  They were very quiet for most of it.</P><Col N="375"/>
        <P>I will deal with two or three issues at this late stage in the debate.  I was surprised to hear Senator Ross referring to what the Minister had to say about the new economic reality which obtains now.  I always listen very closely to Senator Ross on matters to do with the economy and his articles on the economy in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> are required reading in my house.  He of all people must know and take cognisance of the fact that we are in a new reality and that any Minister &mdash; no matter what the Department &mdash; who cannot take this on board, change direction and be as flexible as possible is a very poor Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt the Minister will be able to handle the necessary changes which are inevitable in the new situation while at the same time continuing to provide the type of educational excellence this Government has provided in the past ten years.  I am particularly proud of my party&rsquo;s record in education going right back to the 1930s.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, had a predecessor from his own constituency, the late Se&aacute;n Moylan, who was an excellent Minister for Education and pioneered vocational education in this country.  The record extends through the time of Donogh O&rsquo;Malley and up to the current Minister.  </P>
        <P>I am not easily staggered but I was stunned when I read the motion.  I said to Senator Healy Eames before the debate began that she has thrown in everything including the kitchen sink.  Uncle Tom Cobley and all are in this motion.  The Minister is accused of virtually everything short of possibly the shooting of Michael Collins.</P>

	<P>The Senator has a hard neck considering the track record in education of her party in Government in recent years.  I was a primary teacher in the famous hardship government of 1973 to 1977.  Anyone who was involved in education in that horrendous period will not easily forget it.  I was also a teacher at secondary level in the Garret era and it was a case of the last one out of the school was to turn off the lights.</P>

When the Senator&rsquo;s party was last in Government the number of children in classes of more than 35 and 40 was five times more than it is today.  In that Government&rsquo;s last budget in 1997, her party cut teacher numbers.  These are the facts.</P>

	<P>The Senator may wish to be political about the matter but I am not a great man for fighting political corners because I like to be friendly with everybody.  The Senators opposite have neck for Ireland.  We are in tough times.  What I liked about the Minister&rsquo;s contribution was that he focused on the new concept of lean and mean.  He is showing that in his Department he will be lean and mean in terms of tenders and this is no harm.  We must get the best value for money.  Let us put advertising of positions online rather than in <Col N="376"/>expensive publications as was the case heretofore.  There can be significant savings in areas such as land acquisitions.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We all have our own views on the schools priority list.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked for flexibility and there must be some flexibility in these issues.  As a north Kerry man I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the new school for Ballybunion.  In every debate on education in the House I have mentioned Drumclogh national school which has been waiting for a technical visit for two years.  The principal of that school is a neighbour of mine and they are very frustrated at the delay.  I would also like an update if possible from the Minister &mdash; not now but at a later stage &mdash; on the position regarding the review of education provision at second level for Kerry North.  A lot of work has been done on this review and it has been welcomed by the general public, by school managements, by pupils and by teachers.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I have one small piece of advice for the Minister in his absence.  There are many elements involved in education such as parents, management and the provision of school buildings.  The only advice I would have the temerity to offer the Minister is that he should listen closely to teachers.  They are the people at the coalface&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Healy Eames on the motion she has brought to the House and for her passion and commitment as spokesperson on education.  I can understand why members of the Government get uneasy when she details the situation in education as it is today.  The biggest disappointment for our citizens, after ten years of unprecedented wealth, is to see the problems that remain in education, in renovation, in the schools building programme and the failure to fulfil the promises that were given on the pupil-teacher ratio.   Hundreds of parents attended meetings all over Dublin at which these promises were given, yet they have not been kept.  I will focus on one issue &mdash; the lack of transparency in the <Col N="377"/>schools building programme.  Earlier this week, the Minister attended the House and said he would address my concerns about health and safety issues in one school, St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Palmerstown.  However, a number of schools in my area are awaiting word on the provision of sites and refurbishment.  The lack of transparency is a source of great frustration for principals, teachers, parents and children alike.  It is disgraceful not to have a transparent decision-making process in the Department.  It is taxpayers&rsquo; money and details should be available on the website.  I welcome what the Minister had to say about this, but it should be clear and there should not be any political interference.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary how teachers can cope with some of the conditions in which they are expected to teach.  Nobody can deny the sort of money that has been invested in education, but why have these schools not been dealt with?  Why are they not being refurbished?  I want to make a plea on behalf of settled communities like Palmerstown.  We have seen the building programme in action in newer areas, which is important, but the same urgency should be put into refurbishment work in schools where conditions are simply dire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed to see that the entire Government side has left the House, bar the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  I cannot believe my eyes.  Is this a measure of how much they are on the run?  This motion is about the underfunding of primary education.  It is great to see Government Senators coming into the Chamber now.  I thank them for that.</P>
        <P>The quality of education outcomes is related to investment in education, which repays 100-fold in the development of young children&rsquo;s fertile minds.  Is there anything better than the magic of seeing children learn and think for themselves?  This is related to investment in education.  Senator Ross noted the low morale of teachers, particularly in primary schools.  As a former primary teacher, I have seen that too.  How could morale be high when a teacher must give lessons in the broom closet of a school in Moycullen?</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister&rsquo;s figures, which he presented as if everything is okay but clearly it is not.  He presented global figures, which sound big when spread across thousands of primary schools but it all comes down to individual schools.  The average school is in debt to the tune of &euro;23,000 after the capitation grant has been spent.  We have had broken promises on capitation grants and lower pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that over the period of the national development plan some &euro;4.5 billion will be spent on school building infrastructure.  I want to know how much of this we will get in next week&rsquo;s budget.  My information is that grade three cuts &mdash; the most severe &mdash; are coming.  The Minister made promises concerning investment strategy but they are only promises.  I will, however, welcome any steps that are worthwhile.  The Minister also said he will re-introduce the summer works scheme and I am delighted to hear that.  We have accepted that it is a good scheme when it is operating.  However, when will the scheme be reopened for the 1,000 schools on the 2007-08 list?  Schools have contacted me about this matter.  I am concerned because there have been too many broken promises and consequently too many disappointed parents.  Ultimately the children are affected.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to reinstate the minor works grant in 2008-09, but I am disappointed with the provision of ICT in schools.  The Minister says he will talk to people in Intel, but I hope they will continue to be there.  A case study of computers in Carnmore national school showed it has six laptops for 188 children, which is one computer per 31 pupils.  They need ten more laptops and three smart-boards, costing a total of &euro;20,000.  The school is selling calendars to raise funds, but from where will the additional money come?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s officials might direct me to the budget so that the school can get an extra &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P>The OECD&rsquo;s report entitled, &ldquo;Education at a Glance&rdquo; stated that in 1995 &mdash; when Fine Gael was in Government &mdash; some 5.2% of GDP was spent on education.  In 2005, after seven years <Col N="378"/>of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, the figure had fallen to 4.6% of GDP.  Despite the boom and an increasing population, the Government did not invest in the area that would provide the greatest future return.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately the Government is always looking backwards, trying to defend what it has done.  It should look forward and show its plans for the future.  It could start by laying them out in next week&rsquo;s budget.  We need to know how debt-ridden schools will be funded and how they will be made safe places for learning.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Cork docklands are a cornerstone of the future plans of Cork City Council, its elected councillors and its city officials, led by Mr. Pat Ledwidge and Mr. Joe Gavin, city manager.  The development requires a clear commitment to deliver to Cork by, first, publishing the Cork Docklands Forum report and, second, providing funding for the eastern gateway bridge.  In particular, it requires the publication of the report of the Cork Docklands Development Forum. <Col N="380"/> It is extraordinary that the report was given to the Department and that we read about it in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 October before many of the stakeholders had seen it.  The elected representatives of Cork City Council have not read it.  I do not wish to take issue with the Government regard the leaking of the report but it is unfair and disingenuous to the people of Cork and those charged with representing them that it was not published.</P>
        <P>Professor Wrixon, the chairman of the forum appointed by the Government, has included many interesting points in the report.  However, we need the docklands site, which amounts to a massive 400 acres, to be developed.  Why is there no report?  Will it be available prior to the budget next Tuesday?  Other Governments promised tax incentives and funding for the eastern gateway bridge in their budgets but they have not been realised.  We were told provision would be made in Finance Bills but this has not happened.  There has been complete silence from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, which is worrying.  The cynic in me suspects we might see nothing in the budget next week and that we will see no published report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has an opportunity to kick-start economic development in the regions and in Cork.  For some members of the Government, the country ends at the Red Cow roundabout at one end of the city and on the M1 near Dublin Airport at the other.  Those of us who live beyond Dublin need to see the regions and Cork city developed.  The docklands development is the last major development needed in Cork to &ldquo;stimulate regional activity&rdquo;, as Cork Chamber put it.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and hope he has good news for the people of Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</P>
        <P>There is general consensus among relevant Departments and State agencies that the Cork docklands project advanced by Cork City Council is potentially of major significance to the city and in a wider national framework.  The council is to be congratulated for articulating an ambitious vision for the regeneration of the docklands, establishing a detailed local planning framework and undertaking various infrastructural and economic studies to support the implementation of this vision.</P>
        <P>With an area of more than 160 hectares, contiguous to the city centre, the docklands offer the prospect of developing a modern, mixed-use city quarter.  Current plans anticipate that, over a 20-year period, the population of the docklands could increase from 500 at present to some 22,000.  This would entail the provision of more than 9,500 residential units, including nearly 2,000 social and affordable units.  It is estimated that this regeneration project has the potential to sustain in the region of 27,000 new jobs in retail and financial services, industry, ICT, higher-level educational institutions and leisure and cultural activities.</P>
        <P>Development on this scale is the equivalent of placing a large Irish town in a city centre location and it would clearly give Cork further critical mass in terms of its potential to act as a counterpoint to Dublin.  For this reason, the regeneration of the docklands is recognised as a priority project under the national development plan, and as an important element in meeting the overall objectives of the national spatial strategy regarding balanced regional development.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to support the transformation of the area.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the potential significance of the Cork docklands project, the Government, in December 2007, established the Cork Docklands Development Forum, comprising representatives of relevant Departments, State agencies, local authorities and business and community interests.  Essentially, the forum was asked to prioritise the early consideration by, and response <Col N="381"/>of, public bodies to the docklands area plan and promote the effective co-ordination and delivery of public investment in the docklands.  The forum submitted its report in early July 2008.  Without going into detail, it set out a clear policy and economic rationale for the regeneration project; identified key economic and other drivers essential to the realisation of the vision for the area; identified and costed critical public infrastructure required over the lifetime of the project &mdash; up to 2027 at least &mdash; to underpin subsequent private investment; considered significant constraints and barriers to the intended redevelopment; considered how this redevelopment might be incentivised; and made recommendations regarding institutional arrangements to bring forward the project.  The forum report envisages very significant investment in public infrastructure, in addition to possible support for the relocation of port and other activities.</P>
        <P>In the light of current economic and financial circumstances, and as future investment priorities are being determined, the House will appreciate that a report of this nature requires careful consideration.  On 23 July, the Government agreed to establish an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to develop a response to the report.  This group will report to the Government very shortly, at which time the appropriate timescale for publication of the report can be considered.  While the Minister is aware that the main content of the report was very recently reported in the national press, he does not believe its formal publication at this time would serve a useful purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the nature of the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, which does not fall under his brief, and given that another committee has been established to deal with the forum report, will he inform the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, that we have not received a timescale for its publication?  The response states it will be published &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  Will we have action in the budget to provide funding for Cork docklands?  We and the members of Cork City Council need these answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Title>Schools Building Projects. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to refer to a number of educational projects in my area that are being considered by the Department at present.  Each board of management and parent group is anxiously awaiting a positive decision thereon.</P>
        <P>There was a very interesting debate on education this evening.  I particularly welcomed the comments by the Minister to the effect that he intends to reintroduce the summer works scheme in 2009.  This will be greatly welcomed by many school authorities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the fact that 25 school projects were approved nationally last week, one of which was Dooish national school in my constituency, Donegal South-West.  Other schools in the constituency are being considered by the Department.</P>
        <P>The first of the schools to which I want to refer is Scoil Chonaill Naofa, An Bun Beag.  Its board of management applied to upgrade the electrical works and for the provision of additional accommodation at the school in 1998.  The proposal is for six full-size classrooms plus ancillary accommodation.  Planning permission for the project has been approved.  On 25 April 2006, the then Minister for Education and Science approved the project to proceed to tender and construction.  However, the project has not yet progressed past this stage.  The school has obtained an electrical report from a local contractor which outlines that the electrical works <Col N="382"/>at the school are very dangerous and totally unsatisfactory.  The board of management, pupils and their parents want the project to proceed.  They want formal approval from the Minister to allow it because the current conditions are unsafe.  The board conveyed this view directly to the Minister and Department.  I must impress upon the Minister the need to have the project approved.</P>
        <P>Scoil Mhuire national school, Creeslough, which is also in my constituency, has made an application for capital funding towards the provision of additional accommodation and the upgrading of the current accommodation because it is expected the pupil numbers at the school will rise.  An assessment of projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and housing developments in the area was carried out by the Department and this information is now available.  The assessment work, which has now been finalised, has given the Department figures on future pupil numbers and so on.  Pupils are currently in substandard accommodation so it is another project I hope can be progressed in the near future.</P>
        <P>The third project is one I raised in the House in March last with Senator Doherty, namely, the physical education hall project at Pobal Scoil Gaoth Dobhair.  This is urgently needed for the physical activity which is important for the progression and development of pupils.  The school was constructed in 1982 without a sports hall.  Decisions were made in June 2006 and May 2007 and confirmation was given by the Minister for Education and Science to allow the construction of the PE hall to proceed.  What is sought at this stage is that the Minister would allow this project to progress.  It is one of very few second level schools in the country without a gymnasium for indoor sports activities.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the national school in my home village of Gortahork.  The Office of Public Works has identified a site in agreement with the board of management.  The site is suitable and this has been conveyed to the Department of Education and Science.  The board of management is awaiting approval from the Department towards the acquisition of the site and I call for that to happen.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response in regard to these projects.  While I fully appreciate there are financial constraints, these projects are important to the children, parents and communities of Donegal South-West.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news for us this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in school infrastructure and to outline the current position in regard to the four schools in question.  The Senator will appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has to manage the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s capital budget in a responsible manner and, in so doing, must ensure that funding is targeted at schools most in need.  This is why the Department introduced prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects which were formulated following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Thousands of building projects were carried out under the last national development plan to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure and thousands more will be carried out under the current national development plan.  However, there must be an order as to how this happens and a realisation that not all building projects can proceed together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The extent of the demand on the capital budget is enormous, providing, as it does, accommodation for new communities together with accommodation for the unprecedented number of extra teachers which the Government has put into the system.  We also have to modernise much of the existing stock as a result of historical under-investment.  This will not all be achieved overnight but we have made huge inroads and we will continue to build on our success <Col N="383"/>under the last national development plan when we delivered 7,800 building projects.  However, as I have said, this must be done in an orderly and planned manner and on the basis of the most pressing need.</P>
        <P>As part of the assessment of all applications for capital funding by the planning and building unit of the Department, each project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need which is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To address the projects of particular concern to the Senator, the first school, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Gort a Choirce, has a priority band rating of 2.2 and requires a site acquisition for further progression.  The Office of Public Works, which acts generally on behalf of the Department in regard to site acquisitions for schools, was requested to source a suitable site for the new school building.  On foot of advertising a number of proposals were received and one of these was identified as the preferred option.  The OPW entered negotiations with the vendor for the acquisition of this site but agreement could not be reached with the vendor on price and the OPW re-advertised.  Following the necessary re-advertisement, a number of proposals were received including the previous preferred option.  The OPW again deemed this site the most suitable and again entered into negotiations with the vendor for its acquisition and an agreement on price was eventually reached.  The acquisition of the site for the school will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.</P>
        <P>With regard to the second school referred to, Creeslough national school, the Department has assessed the school&rsquo;s application and has determined that the long-term accommodation requirements for this school would be for a principal, eight mainstream assistants and ancillary staff.  This application, which has a band-rating of 2.2, has not yet commenced architectural planning.</P>
        <P>With regard to the third school referred to, Scoil Chonaill, Bunbeg, the design team on the project is currently working on stage 4-5 documentation and planning permission has been received.  Clarification regarding the provision of temporary accommodation for the duration of the project was requested from the design team and its response is currently being examined by the Department&rsquo;s technical staff.  The project has a band-rating of 2.1.</P>
        <P>With regard to the fourth school referred to, Pobal Scoil Gaoth Dobhair, this project which involves the provision of a new PE hall is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  While it is not possible at this stage to be precise about when this project will go to construction because of higher competing priorities, and the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, refers in particular to the need to provide new schools in rapidly developing areas, the Minister can say that the project will be considered for progression on an ongoing basis as the school building and modernisation programme is rolled out.</P>
        <P>All of the school building projects referred to by the Senator will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme for 2009 and beyond.  Again, I thank the Senator for raising this matter and point out that over the lifetime of the national development plan, the Government is providing funding of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable the Department to ensure school places are available where they are needed.  This investment will allow the Department to continue the schools building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last national development plan.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="384"/>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion I have put down concerns whether the Minister is aware that the electrical contractor for Bunbeg national school has stated the school&rsquo;s electrics are in a very dangerous state.  The reason I posed this question instead of asking when the school will be allowed to progress to the tender and construction stage is that I have asked that question umpteen times and I have received the same type of response the Minister of State gave to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, which is appalling.</P>
        <P>This school and many others have been waiting for many years, in some cases decades, for works to be carried out.  Children are going through the whole education system in schools that are not fit for them.  The debate in the Seanad earlier highlighted the problems in the schools building programme.</P>
        <P>What sparked me to raise this matter was the continuous campaign by the parents, board of management and staff of the school.  What also sparked me was the kick in the face for that school and other schools represented by the announcement two weeks ago of the schools building programme, which involved 25 schools out of approximately 1,300 on the school building list.</P>
        <P>It is appalling that the Government is treating the children of this nation with contempt.  The question is very clear.  I know the answer because I have furnished the Minister with the electrical report from the contractor.  The report states that the contractor has concluded that the electrics in the school are in a very dangerous state due to the fact that they are more than 50 years old, the consumer board being completely out of date and not having proper tripping protection, not having a proper earth rod or earthing system, the socket circuits being overloaded and not protected from mechanical damage and a lack of a fire alarm system in the school which leaves it very unsafe.</P>
        <P>I want a clear answer from the Minister, and not the same type of answer I received from this and previous Ministers when they are asked for information on school buildings.  The Minister spoke earlier in the Chamber about being transparent.  The answers we are getting are not transparent.  They give nothing to us as representatives, and it gives no reassurance to the community, the board of management, the parents or the staff.  Is the Minister aware that tomorrow morning, over 100 pupils will be going into a building which is unsafe?  He is paying staff to work in a building which is unsafe.  The type of regulations which apply to school buildings would not be applied to a business in any part of Ireland or the world.  One would not allow works to go into a building which is unsafe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am highlighting this point because this school needs to be allowed to urgently progress to the next stage.  In the response the Minister gave to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, it stated that the design team has been asked about suitable accommodation.  That question was asked months if not years ago and answers have been received.  Language such as &ldquo;we are currently looking at the options&rdquo; is simply putting back the issue.</P>
        <P>There needs to be a commitment for this school because it is unsafe.  There are other issues.  The school does not have ancillary facilities, it does not have a PE hall or proper library and the rooms are too small and are not up to the standard the Department sets for new builds.  I attended that school, my sister and cousin teach there and my uncle is a former headmaster.  Deputy McGinley was also a headmaster of the school.  I have an interest in it.  The school, and the children who attend it, deserve the same as children in other schools in Donegal.  Some of the schools are excellent.  I commend the Government where it has invested in new builds.  The facilities available are excellent but the children in that school, and in countless others, deserve the same type of respect from this Minister and Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="385"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position in relation to Scoil Chonaill Naofa, Bunbeg.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, wishes to make clear that modernising facilities in our existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge and one which he intends to prioritise as Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost &euro;600 million this year.  The expected completion in 2008 of 67 large scale projects at primary level and 19 projects at post-primary level will benefit over 18,000 students and construction work on 150 devolved projects will provide an additional 8000 permanent places in existing primary schools.  The Senator will also be aware that last month, the Minister announced a further tranche of 24 large-scale projects to progress to tender and construction.</P>
        <P>This year has also seen a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas with the construction of 26 new schools under the fast track off-site construction programme.  Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of public private partnership schools, while further ones will be offered to the market next year with a view to building work commencing in later years.  This is an enormous programme of work by any standards and, while there will continue to be a focus during the year on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will continue to be on new schools and extensions to provide additionality in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria to determine the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings and site capacity, leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  Projects are then selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  The project for Scoil Chonaill Naofa has been assigned a band rating of 2.1.</P>
        <P>A report from a local electrical contractor outlining issues regarding the electrics in the current school building has recently been received by my Department.  In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements.  The introduction in January 1997 of the Grant Scheme for Minor Works to National School Properties gave school authorities the scope to address maintenance issues of most immediate concern to them. Since the introduction of the scheme in 1997, Scoil Chonaill Naofa has received in excess of &euro;50,000 for works which can include improvement or replacement of electrical services.</P>
        <P>With regard to the project for refurbishment and extension of Scoil Chonaill Naofa, the design team on the project for this are currently working on stage 4-5 documentation which involves the preparation of tender documents.  Planning permission has been received.  Clarification regarding the provision of temporary accommodation for the duration of the project was requested from the design team and its response is currently being examined by the Department&rsquo;s technical staff.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Further progression of the school building project at Scoil Chonaill Naofa will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.  The Minister wishes to assure the Senator that the project will be progressed when the necessary resources are available to allow this to happen.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="386"/>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion, is it good value for money, given that we are going into a budget where the Minister is telling us to tighten our belts, for a school that has been waiting for 11 years to progress to construction, where a site has been identified, with the school ready to move out last year, to apply for funding to the Government to upgrade the electrical works in the school?  A week or a month later the work could be done again.  The answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Anyone in junior infants would say it is not good value for money to do this work, and then have it replicated in a week or a month, when the Minister finally makes a decision.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The school will have to consider its options and all the available information, and decide what to do.  It is up to the school to assess the course of action it wishes to take having regard to the school building and modernisation programme.  The school will have to assess that and decide if it should make an application.  The two applications could be made in parallel. </P>
