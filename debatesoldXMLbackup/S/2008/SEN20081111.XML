	<P>I have notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the building plan for St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the position on the ability to carry liquids purchased in airport shops on flights as hand luggage when travel involves more than one flight and whether there is a single rule worldwide.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline his proposed budgetary supports and resources for regional airports with specific reference to Waterford regional airport and if funding will be provided as promised for the proposed extension of its runway.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the rural development programme 2007 &mdash; 2013.  It is proposed to take No. 1 at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., if not previously concluded.  Spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators may speak for seven minutes, and Senators may share time by agreement of the House.</P>

	<P>What is new?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is none this week.  Much legislation has been promised &mdash; I will refer to some of it in a moment &mdash; but why are Ministers not producing it this term?  Last week we also asked for debates on the economy, equality and the decision to abolish Combat Poverty.  I am very disappointed none of those is on the Seanad programme this week.</P>
        <P>I express condolences to the family and fianc&eacute;e of Shane Geoghegan, who was brutally murdered in Limerick.  It is horrific that a young man walking home from watching a rugby match in his friend&rsquo;s house had his life ended in such a tragic and cruel way.  I express the sympathy of this side of the House to his family and his fianc&eacute;e.</P>
        <P>There have been 127 gangland murders in 11 years, with just 14 convictions.  It seems there is little deterrent to gangland crime in this country.  Why can other countries manage gangland crime but we cannot do so?  When I hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform say there are enough resources and the Garda has assured him of this, I must ask why there are no convictions and where is the plan from Government.  Such a plan is needed.  I urge the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to explain why the new anti-gangland legislation under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 is still not being enforced.  Why is it that no one has been charged with directing gangland activity?  What is going on?  This House needs explanations as to why there is the feeling and belief &mdash; and the evidence to prove it &mdash; that these gangs are out of control.  The ordinary citizen feels there is no plan to tackle what is happening.  That is a dreadful feeling for any citizen, especially the people of Limerick.  We are planning for the regeneration of Limerick but on the other hand we have this appalling violence, which has to be tackled.  I urge the Leader to arrange a debate in this House.  We have spoken about it previously and very strong views were expressed.  There is a consensus that tough action needs to be taken.  Let us have a debate on the subject and see what people have to say.</P>
        <P>It is extremely discouraging, disappointing and saddening for women and their families to see the withdrawal of the cervical cancer vaccine, which we know would save at least 100 lives in the near future.  I urge the Government to re-examine the finances in the Department of Health and Children to see if &euro;10 million can be found to save lives.  I referred to the need for a plan to tackle crime but we know that if we introduce this vaccine we will save 100 lives.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the decision she has made to withdraw the vaccine.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate what Senator Fitzgerald said and not just on the substantive issues which she addressed.  I do not know what has happened to that very old fashioned idea that the Houses of the Oireachtas are here to introduce legislation.  We deserve an explanation <Col N="3"/>for the fact that today, tomorrow and Thursday we are simply going to produce statements on issues that have been picked out of the ground.  I do not understand why there is no legislation because Senator Regan has proposed two Bills and the Independents have virtually a Bill each.  Senator Bacik has been inquiring about her Bill on climate change.  Senator Ryan from the Labour Party has a Bill also.  I do not understand why we cannot discuss those Bills if the Government has nothing to offer.  The Independents and the Opposition have more legislation on the Order Paper than the Government.  That is a terrible indictment of a lack of ideas or initiative.  Everything is not right with the country and there has to be legislation.  We deserve an explanation for why it is not being entered into the House.</P>
        <P>A pretty big industrial relations crisis is about to break in Aer Lingus.  Before the Leader of the House says that is a private company and it is not for discussion in this House, I remind him that the Government holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, so the matter is relevant to us all.  An extraordinary contradiction exists on top of that, which must beg the question of whether the Government should sell its stake in Aer Lingus.  In the budget the Government put a &euro;10 charge on people leaving the country and that has a very bad effect on airline companies.  One might ask who cares, but the Government is conflicted in this area because that is devaluing its 25% asset at the same time.  What we should debate is whether the Government has any business being in the airline industry any more when it is taking measures to damage that industry.</P>
        <P>I do not see anything specifically relevant on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, or any particular reason why we should be meeting, apart from blowing hot air at issues that will go away after we have blown the air.  If we want to be relevant why do we not discuss a vital issue that was addressed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and other newspapers at the weekend?  Apparently the IDA has issued a survey showing that 50% of the multinationals in Ireland believe they would not locate here if they were to decide on doing so again.  They regret their decisions.  This is a sword of Damocles hanging over the economy.  If those multinationals withdraw, or if others do not come in, the economy we have at present will look like a paradise in ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, express my sympathy to the family of Shane Geoghegan following his really shocking murder in Limerick at the weekend.</P>
        <P>I support what has been said on the extraordinary absence of Government legislation in the House.  Senator Ross is correct about this.  We have debates on efficiency and relevance in respect of the public service and apparently the debate is bubbling away.  Members have asked whether we should spend time considering efficiency in the public service but it may not be long before eyes start looking at this wing of the public service and deciding whether it is up to scratch in terms of its contribution.  It is really extraordinary that, week in, week out, not a single Bill is brought forward.  This draws attention to the debate on the efficiency and relevance of this House.  We are to have statements on a number of issues this week but we do not have any opportunity to debate the issues that Members on this side of the House have been raising and on which they have been asking for a debate.</P>
        <P>The Leader told us we were to have a rolling debate on the economy.  When will it start rolling?  It has not happened yet.  There is a very considerable debate taking place outside the Houses on whether the banks require capitalisation.  It is taking place everywhere except in the Parliament of the people.  Why can we not have scrutiny in the House and debate the various arguments for and against capitalisation?  It seems the banking policy rests entirely on the guarantee that was given.  The remainder of the policy is a matter of keeping one&rsquo;s head down and hoping for the best.  This is a fair definition of our national policy on the crisis that everybody else in the world recognises.  We appear to believe it does not exist.</P>
<Col N="4"/>
        <P>In the interest of being relevant, let me repeat Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s remarks on the importance of inviting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to justify the rationale behind the reduction in the budgets for the Equality Authority of Ireland and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The Senator also referred to the Combat Poverty Agency and I support her in this regard.  Although we are told there is an economic crisis up to which everybody must face, and that the reason for the cuts in the agencies is the financial circumstances, I wonder, in light of today&rsquo;s report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Carol Coulter, whether the real reason for the cuts has less to do with the need to make savings, necessary as they may be in the eyes of the Government, than with the fact that a great majority of the cases being brought forward by the Equality Authority of Ireland by various third parties are against State agencies.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to state whether Ms Coulter is correct in concluding that the activity on the part of the Equality Authority has been an irritant to civil servants, and the opportunity afforded by the Budget was grasped by the Government to achieve something it might otherwise have wished to achieve anyway.</P>
        <P>It is fine to have a debate with the Minister on the Criminal Assets Bureau, which is a vitally important body, but the report is on the record.  The Minister might regard developments in this regard as good news and an achievement, which they are in many ways, but he does not seem to be willing to discuss issues within his remit that may be more controversial, such as the considerable reduction in the budgets for these vital agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader state whether the first meeting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which took place on 21 January 1919 in the Mansion House, will be commemorated?  It was a most important meeting and the Irish declaration of independence was made on that day.</P>
        <P>This week, a great ceremony took place to commemorate the end of the First World War, the war to end all wars, but our forefathers had to fight on for another few years to gain freedom and our right to govern ourselves.  I believe some ceremony should take place to commemorate the courage and vision of the Members of the first D&aacute;il because without them we would probably not be sitting here today.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my words of support to the remarks of Senator Fitzgerald, especially in regard to the brutal and horrific slaying of the innocent Shane Geoghegan in Limerick.  Will the Leader report to this House on the decisions and actions decided upon as a result of the meeting today between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Garda Commissioner in respect of the matter?</P>
        <P>As we all sadly witness, gangland crime is growing rather than shrinking in this country.  These criminals are known.  How is it that they have such ready access to guns and other weapons of destruction?  If we cannot intern them, even though they are known, there should at least be very strict monitoring.  I wish to hear from the Leader on this.  Can we not avail of electronic surveillance or necessary wiretaps?  We have asked these questions before but in the light of this most horrific murder we are forced to ask them again.  I wish to hear urgently from the Leader.</P>
        <P>There is to be a significant programme of regeneration in Limerick and I know the city needs it badly.  However, we hear that some of the crime families there are insisting on certain matters in regard to this and are being widely consulted.  I do not say that citizens and groups should <Col N="5"/>not be consulted but there is something rotten here when, sadly, despite all the resources so far put in, the emergency response unit and other sections of the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader agrees to that debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we can discuss the issue.  Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s point is made and there are many speakers today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but my request is that the Leader address the House on this matter because he is the conduit between the Seanad and the Government.  The House deserves to hear from the Leader on the up-to-date information that I presume he has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support what Senator Fitzgerald said concerning the shooting in Limerick.  Sometimes it seems that the city&rsquo;s great anthem, &ldquo;Alone It Stands&rdquo;, applies to that city.  This is not only Limerick&rsquo;s problem but is Dublin&rsquo;s and Cork&rsquo;s problem too.  I was very impressed yesterday by the powerful performance of Deputy Michael Noonan who put his finger on the central problem.  He said that it was not now a matter of getting convictions after crime but of getting people before the crime is committed.</P>
        <P>That means a significant shift in our criminal jurisprudence system.  I would like to get through one debate without having people talk about knee-jerk reactions.  There is nothing knee-jerk about what has been going on among the public since Veronica Guerin was shot dead.  That amounts to almost 20 years of cold fury on the part of the people and still these gangs do their dirty work.</P>
        <P>I am not one who advocates wholesale internment but I advocate that we look at the criminal jurisprudence system.  It was set up, rightly, by jurors and lawyers who wished to protect citizens from despotism and tyrants.  However, this is a social democratic state.  No tyrants and despots oppress us other than these gangs.  Now the citizens need protection from these gangs and there must be a shift in criminal jurisprudence.  The most important point is that the courts seem unwilling to take the word of a superintendent of the police.  That voice is the most effective weapon to use to put them away because it treats them as the IRA was treated.  If that is done, we should then move legally, using lawyers, and appoint prosecuting magistrates as the French and Italians do.  They should be properly trained lawyers armed with the considerable powers that are now on the Statute Book, who would go in and take these gangs out.  The courts might then at least have respect for the word of the police superintendent.  If a prosecuting magistrate, a trained lawyer, states to a judge that he or she believes a person habitually hangs around with members of gangs and men who have murdered people, the person in question should be selectively interned.  We may not like to use the word &ldquo;interned&rdquo; but such persons should be taken off the streets indefinitely or for as long as it takes for them to learn their lesson.  This would cut out the cat and mouse act.  The message the Houses of the Oireachtas should send today is that the murder of Mr. Geoghegan is not just one more crime.  We must signal to his unfortunate family and the people of Limerick that alone they do not stand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with colleagues who pointed out that the House will deal only with statements this week.  However, the situation is even worse than we imagined because we did exactly the same thing last week.  On Tuesday, 4 November, the only business in the House was statements on broadcasting standards.  On Wednesday, 5 November, we had statements on medical cards for those aged over 70 years and HIQA, while on Thursday, 6 November, we managed to discuss a little scrap of legislation which lasted until close to lunch time.  That was the week&rsquo;s business in the House.  This week, the House will have statements on rural development today, statements on the fishing industry and the Criminal Assets Bureau tomorrow and statements on radon protection measures on Thursday.  If this continues, I will <Col N="6"/>be forced to join the ranks of those who call for the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann because it is an utter waste of time.  It is idiotic for the House to have disputes about whether we can have time on the Order of Business when the House is doing nothing else.  Surely we should extend the Order of Business and deal with a few issues of relevance to people. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am glad that one of my colleagues made a glancing reference to the fact that today marks the 90th anniversary of the armistice in the First World War.  I pay tribute to this Government for at last starting to face up to the reality of what took place and the large number of Irish people who were involved in the war.  Some 58,000 Irish people died in the First World War, more than the number of casualties suffered by the United States of America, but we refused to countenance this and allowed the memorial at Islandbridge to sink into decrepitude.  I have just spoken to the former Dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, Reverend Victor Griffin, who told me that he received death threats in the 1970s and he and his wife were given police protection because he permitted a service of commemoration to be held in the cathedral.  The walls of the cathedral and deanery were also daubed with the slogan, &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo;.  I welcome the fact that the situation has moved on and that the House played a role in rectifying the true injustice perpetrated against those unfortunate people, of whom a proportionately greater number were Irish, who, suffering shell shock, were shot at dawn.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s comments regarding the Equality Authority and Human Rights Commission.  For several weeks, I have been raising this astonishing issue, which has been taken up by Carl O&rsquo;Brien in <i>The Irish Times.  </i>In a magisterial article published in the same newspaper today Carol Coulter makes perfectly clear that these two bodies are being specifically targeted in a vicious manner by the Government.  As is perfectly clear from the figures, this is being done to muzzle them precisely because they spoke out.  For example, funding for the Human Rights Commission has been reduced by 24%, while the budget of the Equality Authority has been cut by 43%.  Why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are entitled to know the facts.  I ask for an immediate debate on this issue.  According to Ms Coulter&rsquo;s report, Departments, State agencies, local authorities and educational institutions made up 54% of the case files under the Equal Status Acts in 2005, 60% in 2006 and 69% in 2007.  The Equality Authority is the only body within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which is listed for decentralisation.  This will result in a massive loss of professional expertise because, to put the best complexion on the matter, we will have 30 people in Roscrea, none of whom will have expertise in the equality area, and a handful of others left stranded in Dublin. </P>
      
        <P>We are also neutering and spancilling the Human Rights Commission, which was established on a statutory basis as part of the Good Friday Agreement, under which it should be of equal strength to its counterpart in the North.  It is quite clear why this is so and one good reason is that they came out with a report on rendition and the use of Shannon Airport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make those points during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone who stands up to Government will get smacked and the budget will be an excuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues who condemned the appalling cold-blooded murder of Mr. Shane Geoghegan in Limerick.  I know other Senators have spoken passionately, but as regards gangland crime I have no problem with the reintroduction of the Special Crimi<Col N="7"/>nal Court.  I know it is a serious step but it appears that a certain element involved in the drugs trade has no respect for jurors.  Most people who serve on juries are afraid of their lives in carrying out their functions as jurors, which is a civic duty.  Witnesses are being intimidated and this is an ongoing situation that requires desperate measures to be taken.  We need a debate on this, but we should look seriously at the reintroduction of the Special Criminal Court in this regard on a two-year or three-year trial basis, however drastic it may be.  I remind the House that when the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell introduced strong legislation in this regard in the previous D&aacute;il, the Official Report shows that some Deputies had serious reservations.  I am concerned that people start crying out when these things happen.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to those involved in the significant drugs haul that occurred last week in my neck of the woods, Castletownbere.  This is the second huge haul within 18 months.  I accept that in the first case in Dunlough Bay, it was probably more through accident than design that the haul of drugs was intercepted.  I have said repeatedly during my time in the Oireachtas and before that as a councillor that drug importation using coastlines such as west Cork is an ongoing scenario.  These drug barons are so daring that they are prepared to bring tonnes of cocaine 3,000 or 4,000 miles across the Atlantic to land on our coastline because up to now we did not have the resources to deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>I must compliment the people involved in this instance, where lives were put at risk.  The Garda, the Naval Service and Customs and Excise were working with this new group in Lisbon in an effort to stymie the importation of drugs, which were most likely destined for the British and European markets.  Fair play to all concerned.  It was a major initiative and by now the message may have gone out internationally to the effect that the people in Ireland along the coastline are no longer asleep.  Congratulations to all concerned.  I have often criticised the Naval Service and the Garda but in this instance a superb job has been done.  I hope it sends a message to the international drug lords in South America and elsewhere that we are not putting up with this situation any longer.</P>
        <P>This could be the beginning because the situation in Limerick, with due respect to the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Fitzgerald, is related to drugs.  We must acknowledge the success of the Garda and all those concerned in the magnificent haul at Castletownbere, which occurred in most difficult sea conditions where the swell was as high as the roof of  this Chamber, to give the House some idea what the Naval Service and those who went out on ribs to board the drug-laden yacht had to contend with.  One of the ribs was severely damaged.  They risked their lives to stop the importation of drugs and this House must respect and acknowledge that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the condemnation of the killing of an innocent man, Mr. Shane Geoghegan, in Limerick.  The reality is that it is only when someone innocent is killed as a result of gangland criminality that there is an expression of outrage and demands for action.  The reality is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senators Fitzgerald, Harris and others in condemning the killing of Mr. Shane Geoghegan in Limerick, who was an innocent man.  There is an attitude of &ldquo;Good riddance&rdquo; when people are killed who are involved in inter-gang warfare, and it has <Col N="8"/>not been taken as seriously by the police, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or successive Ministers.  Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea referred to a need for new legislation on the right to silence; this matter has nothing to do with such an issue. Deputy Michael Noonan, as Senator Harris stated, put his finger on it when he said, &ldquo;It is an issue of detection and prosecution&rdquo;, and that is where the Government has failed in tackling gangland crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One problem in prosecution and conviction is intimidation, and that is where the question of non-jury trials must be considered.  We should have a debate on this specific issue.  There was a debate and a resolution from this side of the House last year on the matter of tackling gangland crime, and we were told by the then Minister that everything was in place and action was being taken.  In the light of this killing, the Minister should come into the House and outline the strategy he is purportedly following to tackle this scourge.    Regarding the visit of President V&aacute;clav Klaus of the Czech Republic &mdash; which is welcomed by everyone in Ireland &mdash; there is an article in<i> The Irish Times</i> today about whether he breached protocol in meeting Mr. Declan Ganley, but we are not raising any issues in that regard. Open and transparent discussion is necessary on these issues.  When he says the Taoiseach is in no hurry to find a solution on the Lisbon treaty, I am not sure he is correct or that I would formulate it in that way.  On the issue of the Lisbon treaty, there is no doubt the Taoiseach and Government are playing for time, as they are with the economy, the public finances, reform of the public sector and the recapitalisation of Irish banks.  The reality is that time is running out on all of these issues, and there is a time for decisions and a time for leadership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ross mentioned a survey of multinationals in this country.  Whatever decisions they took in the past, what is really important is the decisions they take today, and unless there is clear leadership from the Government on the fundamental economic issues and on the Lisbon treaty, I would be fearful of the type of decision the multinationals based in Ireland might make in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the comments made by a number of Senators on the Equality Authority and the Human Right&rsquo;s Commission, and I agree with Senator Norris that we could have a useful debate on this matter.  I hold a contrary view to his but, nonetheless, it would be equally valid.  We have built up and industry, not just in Ireland but internationally, around the question of human rights and equality.  Unfortunately, many of those organisations have been taken over by sectional interests to pursue their own agenda.  I was alarmed to learn of some of the salaries paid to people involved in these organisations in this country, and it was definitely time to cry halt in that regard.  It is those in these Houses who should articulate and be the champions of human rights and equality.  This is where it should be done.  We should not pay significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money to bodies that are not accountable to the State.</P>
        <P>I join those Senators who sympathised with the family of Shane Geoghegan.  His murder was an appalling and horrific crime but, unfortunately, it is only another in a catalogue of such crimes, going back many decades.  I spoke about this issue in the House previously, when I spoke after the murder of Brian Fitzgerald in Limerick, who put his personal safety at risk to protect a premises where he was employed from being invaded by drug pushers.  He paid with his life as a consequence, a young man with a family.  Similarly, the late Shane Geoghegan had his whole life to look forward to, but that life has been snubbed out while he was still in the prime of life.  This is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I recall debates we had in this House following previous murders, when many people were more concerned about the human rights of the perpetrators of the crime and of similar type crimes than of the victims and their families.  The time has come for a clear review of where we stand on these issues.  The time has come too, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan proposed, for us to <Col N="9"/>consider having non-jury courts, like the Special Criminal Court used in the past to deal with situations felt to be a threat to the State.  It is time to take the issue in hand and pursue such measures for a period of two or three years, as suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  We should monitor closely how such courts work to ensure the innocent do not suffer.  We need to take strong action on these horrific crimes, particularly those against innocent people.  Human life is inviolate.  I would like a debate in the House along those lines.</P>

	<P>I join other Senators in deploring the recent murder in Limerick.  It demonstrates that when we can only achieve a conviction in one out of every six murder cases, the current approach does not work.  While I would not go as far as some other Senators have suggested, I wonder whether it is time to introduce a witness protection Bill and to put a witness protection scheme on a statutory footing.  The Garda introduced a programme ten years ago, but although it is well intentioned, it clearly does not do the job.  This is the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court has concerns about the programme.</P>
        <P>America introduced a witness protection programme in 1970.  Since then, 10,000 people have been convicted of crimes.  A witness protection programme could work, therefore, if introduced.  When we tried to introduce a witness protection Bill last year in this House, the Minister at the time said he and the Garda Commissioner felt it was not appropriate then.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to speak to the Garda Commissioner to ascertain if it would be appropriate now?</P>

	<P>Will the Leader indicate whether it would be possible to have a debate on the national spatial strategy?  I am interested in particular in the gateway innovation fund, which was announced some years ago.  I know that in this time of scarcity it is not possible to proceed at the pace initially planned or foreseen.  However, in the context of the nine gateways and the planning that went into applying for funding under that fund, it would be prudent for the various Departments to indicate the projects that will be acceptable under the gateway innovation fund and the level of commitment that may be given over a period of years as resources become more freely available.</P>
        <P>The budget for the undergraduate nursing education programme nationally is administered by the HSE.  In that context, we need an urgent debate on the HSE.  Recently, as part of its savings and adjustments, it has decided to reduce by 310 the number of nursing places around the country.  To my extreme disappointment, it seems the north west is to suffer the most discrimination.  St. Angela&rsquo;s College, which is the only constituent colleague of the National University of Ireland north of the line between Dublin and Galway, will suffer a 30% reduction in nursing places, whereas Trinity College Dublin&rsquo;s courses will be reduced by a mere 6.4%.  The reduction in TCD&rsquo;s numbers will have an insignificant impact given the overall number of students at the college but the impact will be much more severe at St. Angela&rsquo;s.  I am informed that people working within the Health Service Executive made the determination on where savings would be made and which colleges would be most affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Leader will be aware, I have a particular problem when it comes to discrimination against the people of the north-west region and, in line with my commitment las week and previous weeks, I ask him for a formal response to the failure of the national cancer screening service to roll out services in the north west.  I remind the Leader of the contempt shown by the chief executive of the service in the comments he made to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I ask the Leader to come back with a formal response in that  regard and, while it is not my intention to bore my colleagues, I make no apologies for representing the people of the north west to the best of my ability.</P>

	<P>Unlike previous speakers, I blame the Government rather than this House for the lack of legislation before us.  It is the Government&rsquo;s job to bring forward legis<Col N="10"/>lation.  I ask the Leader whether the Government plans to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 in light of the Green Party&rsquo;s targeting of civil servants.</P>
        <P>I join others in condemning the killing of innocent Shane Geoghegan in Limerick.  I support Senator Harris in calling for a debate on our penal system because prison must mean prison.  We can no longer allow criminal warlords to organise their troops from inside jails.  According to media reports, mobile telephones, Internet scams, bazookas and all sorts of things are being ordered or arranged from within prisons.  It is time that we held a proper debate on what prison means in this country and we have to send a strong message to thugs whose only interest is self-preservation.  They do not care about ordinary human beings who do not deal in drugs or intimidate witnesses and jurors.  We have to get serious.  We have had 11 years of successive Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When are we going to see reforms that stand on the side of ordinary people by ensuring violence and murder bring life imprisonment without parole?  Today in Limerick, a young family is bereaved.  This is not a statistic.  Have we become immune to this?  I call for a debate on civil liberties because I want this House to send a message to the thugs that their time is up and we are going to get them.  I do not care if it is unparliamentary or not politically correct to say this but the murders have to be stopped.</P>

I ask the Leader whether time could be put aside for a debate on this important issue.</P>
        <P>During my time as spokesperson for health and children, I raised <i>ad nauseam</i> the issue of diabetes types I and II.  We must take our hats off to the Diabetes Federation of Ireland, which is making major efforts to heighten public awareness of diabetic suffering.  Regrettably, I cannot be at Bloomfield House Hotel, Mullingar, tonight but an information seminar will take place.  It is not concentrated in Mullingar.  From time to time the federation moves these seminars around the country.  We must take our hats off and offer sincere thanks to the federation.</P>
        <P>Regarding the murder of Shane Geoghegan, it is time we told the do-gooders to keep quiet and the silent majority to speak up for the Shane Geoghegans of this world.  He was taken away from his family at a young age.  It is time we got tough with the rough.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the time.  Like every Member who has spoken today, I condemn the dreadful murder of Shane Geoghegan in Limerick and extend sympathies to his bereaved family.  It is time we had a debate on how best to deal with gangland murder.  The focus on sanctions and trial processes is not the most effective response for the victims of this appalling crime.  We would be better placed examining investigation, detection and how best to reassure potential witnesses.  In catching people and ensuring they are convicted of crimes, it is crucial that evidence can be gathered.  Before any case goes to court, it is important that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the ability to gather evidence.  Chief among the tasks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to reassure potential witnesses that they will not be intimidated and will be protected if they come forward and give the evidence necessary to prosecute and convict people.</P>
        <P>The Special Criminal Court is used for organised crime.  It can be used because the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to refer all sorts of crimes for trial before that non-jury court.  We already have extensive severe penalties.  We brought in such penalties, mandatory minimum sentences, in 2006 in respect of firearms offences.  We must examine witness protec<Col N="11"/>tion programmes and reassurance for potential witnesses.  These are the key areas in terms of effective prevention of this sort of appalling crime.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the Climate Protection Bill, which I have sought a number of times.  I renew my call given the absence of other legislation in the House.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to the voices of others, calling for an urgent debate on the future of the Equality Authority.  I do not agree that this authority is part of some human rights industry.  One can examine the very human cases the authority has supported, such as the Christian Brother in his 70s, who last week won his claim of age discrimination against a car hire company, thereby changing policies on car hire for older people.  We see the real people who are being helped by the Equality Authority and who will miss the authority in its watered down form.</P>

	<P>The sheer revulsion expressed by Members at the hideous and horrible murder of Shane Geoghegan demands an appropriate response from this House, and that it comes speedily.  I sense a degree of consensus, although people have articulated viewpoints from different sides of the debate.  The consensus I see is that there is intimidation at play, with regard to witnesses and trials and in terms of whole communities in this country.  While that exists, the onus is on us as public representatives to articulate different ways we can overcome these problems.  In the political debate and in the context of economic crises throughout the world, this is an issue we should give particular attention to and, in that regard, I will not dignify other petty, party political points that have been raised on the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the expressions of sympathy to the Geoghegan family on the shocking tragedy that has befallen them.  For many parents, such a tragedy is their worst nightmare.  They stay awake at night fearing such a tragedy might befall their youngster on his or her way home.  </P>
        <P>While Shane Geoghegan&rsquo;s death is a shocking and dreadful incident, tragically there is a level of anarchy on our streets that must be dealt with.   There is a consistent underlying level of anarchy on our streets at night.  I agree with the view that membership of a criminal gang should become an indictable offence.  I support Senator Harris&rsquo;s view that we must review our legislation and jurisprudence in the light of what we are dealing with here.</P>
        <P>As a first measure, membership of a gang must be made an indictable offence.  We must also introduce witness protection legislation and witness protection procedures.  Such crime dictates &mdash; a point touched on by Senator Bacik among others &mdash; the need for intervention at childhood level.  It dictates a reversal of the Government&rsquo;s reduction and under-investment in child care and in preschool education.  If we invest in child care, preschool and primary education and have the right level of class sizes, we will deal with many of these problems at source.</P>
        <P>The provision of drop-in caf&eacute;s in our cities and towns for our youth is critical.   I have been saying that for a long time.</P>
        <P>I want the Leader to specifically take up the following point, which could be examined as an immediate practical response.  Garda&iacute; should be responsible for separate streets and districts in ours towns and cities.  In other words, a garda would be responsible for street X&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I will be brief.  In one of today&rsquo;s newspapers there is a report on the incidence of elder abuse.  It is indicated by the HSE that 600 people reported alleged elder abuse in the first six months of this year.  Some 93% of the older people who were abused said it happened in their own homes.  Some 40% of them said it was their sons or daughters who abused them.  </P>
        <P>We in Ireland overlook the issue of older people and do not address it as it is addressed in other countries, particularly in the UK.  In my document, A New Approach to Ageing &amp; Ageism, I highlight the issue and the statement from the National Council on Ageing and Older People that at any one time in this country between 12,000 and 20,000 older people could be suffering from some form of abuse.  There are 26 recommendations in my document on providing for older people.  One of them is the urgent implementation of the elder abuse report.  That has not happened.  We are brilliant at preparing reports but very poor on their implementation.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Ross, Alex White, Coghlan, Harris, Norris, O&rsquo;Donovan, Regan, Walsh, Hannigan, Buttimer, Glynn, Bacik, O&rsquo;Reilly and Boyle expressed their deepest sympathy to the family of Shane Geoghegan who was so tragically murdered in Limerick at the weekend.  I express our strong condemnation of that murder on behalf of all Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and particularly on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, of which I am Leader in this House.  </P>
        <P>This morning the Taoiseach met the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner to discuss criminal justice issues generally and the ongoing investigation into the brutal killing of Shane Geoghegan.  This tragic death of a well respected young man going about his business is a despicable crime.  An intensive Garda investigation is now under way in Limerick.  I understand the Garda Commissioner is travelling to Limerick this afternoon to meet the investigation team on the ground.  The Commissioner has stated that the full resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are available to the investigation team and that no effort will be spared in bringing those responsible to justice.</P>
        <P>In the past year alone there has been a 12% increase in the Garda numbers in Limerick city and a 40% increase since 2003.  Divisional 24-hour armed patrols supported by emergency response units and a regional support unit supplementing the regular patrols by plain-clothes armed garda&iacute; are in place.  To date in 2008 there have been five murders in the Limerick area, including that of Mr. Shane Geoghegan.  Persons have been charged in respect of two of these. <Col N="13"/> Two of the murders have been with firearms and a person has been charged in respect of one of these.  There were 18 murders involving firearms in 2007 compared with 27 in 2002, a reduction of 33%.  There have been 19 deaths by shooting so far this year.  This year homicide offences have dropped by more than 56% in the third quarter and by almost half, 44.9%, year on year.</P>
        <P>These statistics were supplied to me by the Department of the Taoiseach prior to the Order of Business.  I knew Senators would make their strong views known to the House on the Order of Business.  I want to assure the House that the Taoiseach, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner are giving this matter top priority.  The challenge has been laid down to the State and it must face it head on.  Of course I will arrange a debate in which colleagues can make statements to the House with a Minister present as a matter of urgency after the Order of Business today.</P>
        <P>Comments were made about the amount of legislation coming through the House.  The Harbours (Amendment) Bill is on Committee Stage and has been taken on three different days.  We have now reached amendment No. 7.  All Stages of the Charities Bill have been completed in the D&aacute;il and we will be taking Second Stage of that Bill.  The Coroners Bill has reached Committee Stage in the House.  Committee Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 will be taken in the House.  These are Bills due in the House and many more Bills are to come to the House.  As we all know we will have the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  We will have the Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill.  These are all due to be taken in the House before the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>I have responded, as I have always done, to the requests of colleagues on the Order of Business to have debates and statements on urgent issues.  I will continue to do that when convenient bearing in mind legislation and Ministers&rsquo; diaries.  We have responded at all times to leaders&rsquo; requests and those of other Senators who have made such requests of me on the Order of Business.  I look forward to this evening&rsquo;s debate on rural development.  As we all know, Ireland does not stop at the Dublin border; it stops on the sea.  We are representative of all parts of our country and not just one part.  I look forward to colleagues on all sides of the House contributing to a meaningful debate on rural development.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty in allowing time for a debate on the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission.  Regarding cervical cancer immunisation, the Government has invested &euro;30 million on screening for females which started in September.  We must not lose sight of the fact that &euro;30 million has been invested in very tight economic times.  We will do all we can, on all sides of the House, to ask the Minister to initiate the programme at the earliest possible time so that 12 year old girls and those who urgently need it can be vaccinated.  I understand the cost of the programme is more than &euro;10 million and may cost &euro;14 million or &euro;15 million.  However, if finance is available, it should be done as a matter of urgency.  I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Fitzgerald, in her call for that to be done.  I do not want to let go unnoticed the &euro;30 million that has been invested already for a programme in this area that commenced in September.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross called for an urgent debate on Aer Lingus.  I would have no difficulty in this taking place.  It is timely that it should take place.  He expressed his views on IDA Ireland, on which his favourite Sunday newspaper, the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, had an article last Sunday.  I know the challenges faced by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland which work hard to create vast numbers of jobs in this country.</P>
        <P>I thank colleagues who attended the special meeting that took place after the Order of Business on Thursday morning on energy costs.  At that meeting I gave my word to colleagues on all sides of the House that we should all go back to our parliamentary party meetings to <Col N="14"/>debate that matter this week.  It is down for debate in the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting this evening.  I hope colleagues on the other side of the House have it down for their parliamentary party debates.</P>
        <P>It was alarming to watch television last night and hear the serious views being expressed at the energy forum yesterday.  The ESB and Bord G&aacute;is have sought another increase having only got an increase a few weeks ago.  It is unacceptable and unsustainable.  We on all sides of the House must unite in our fight.  To maintain jobs is the priority of the Government and Opposition in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We should send that message out loud and clear to any body seeking an increase in the next two years.  They must simply forget about it as far as I am concerned, and I am speaking personally here.  If they do not, we will see unprecedented increases in the levels of unemployment.  I am talking from vast experience of this area.  We made insurance the priority in the previous Government.  This Seanad must lead the way in stating that enough is enough and there should be no more increases for anything that will interfere with the keeping people in the jobs they have at present.</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan congratulated those involved in the significant drugs haul off the coast of west Cork over the weekend.  He congratulated the Garda, the Naval Service and Customs and Excise personnel who risked their lives.  I wish to be associated with and offer the congratu<Col N="15"/>lations of all Members of the House to the Garda, the Naval Service and Customs and Excise for this magnificent achievement.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan commented on the State visit of the President of the Czech Republic to Ireland.  He is very welcome and I had the pleasure and honour of representing the Seanad, along with the Deputy Leader, Senator Boyle, at a lunch yesterday hosted by the Taoiseach for the Czech President.  I was honoured to have met him and spoken to him for a few moments.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry called for a debate on the national spatial strategy and the innovation fund in particular.  He called on various Departments to indicate the up-to-date position and this can be taken with the debate on the economy.  As I have stated in the House &mdash; some colleagues may have been in committee or otherwise engaged last week &mdash; we should leave such a debate until after the Finance Bill is published on 3 December.  It would be possible to have the debate on the week after.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry made his strong views known to the House regarding the Health Service Executive in the north west and the reduction in nurses&rsquo; training.  I understand the problem is in getting staff and I will come back to the House when I have a further update.  There is a difficulty in recruitment in the area and I will have the matter checked further before coming back to the House, perhaps tomorrow, on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Senator also had serious concerns regarding cancer screening in the north east.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, was in the House last week and gave a very comprehensive commentary on all aspects of the HSE.  She even extended her question and answer session by 30 minutes, which was very generous.  I mentioned this on the Order of Business last Thursday, and we never have any difficulty finding out the up-to-date position on that Minister&rsquo;s portfolio.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Nuair a bh&iacute;onn d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ann, is ea a chrutha&iacute;onn daoine a gcumas.  In ainneoin na nd&uacute;shl&aacute;n at&aacute; ann, creidim go bhfuil s&eacute; de chumas ag pobal na tuaithe leas a bhaint as na deiseanna at&aacute; ann agus forbairt mh&oacute;r a dh&eacute;anamh sna blianta beaga at&aacute; romhainn.

        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in the Seanad about rural development.  There is no question that this is a time of great challenge but it is also a time of great opportunity and it is very important we focus on the opportunities as a method of overcoming the challenges we face.  Despite the downturn in the economy and the huge challenges faced particularly by those involved in the building industry in rural Ireland, there are also huge untapped opportunities.  It is our obligation now to focus on these opportunities and to ensure the work done in recent years on rural development is consolidated.</P>
<Col N="17"/>
        <P>Last Tuesday, I was delighted to announce the allocations of funding to local action groups under axes 3 and 4 of the new rural development programme.  Starting this month, this programme will inject &euro;425.4 million of State and European finance into the rural economy.  This, matched with another &euro;600 million of community and private finance, means there will be a boost to the rural economy of &euro;1 billion over the coming five years.  This is three times as much as the previous rural development programme and is the largest ever package for rural development in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>The &euro;425.4 million in funding will be channelled through 36 new and integrated local action groups to the continued development of rural communities all over Ireland.  Their applications were evaluated by independent consultants, Fitzpatrick and Associates, under various criteria.  The allocation of funding to each group was based on these criteria as well as on both population and rurality, so that we can ensure the funding granted is directly related to need.  Each of these local action groups will distribute funding to community groups and individuals in rural areas for the range of varied activities, including diversification into non-agricultural activities, support for business creation, encouragement of tourism activities, basic services for the economy and rural population, village renewal and development, conservation and upgrading of rural heritage, and training and information.</P>
        <P>This rural development programme will have a particular focus on the opportunities of indigenous small-scale industry, particularly in the small food sector.  Even in the present atmosphere of global economic restraint, the food sector continues to thrive.  Today there are an estimated 320 businesses producing artisan and speciality food in Ireland.  Together, our producers have a combined turnover of &euro;450 million.  That means &euro;450 million in sales value to 320 small and speciality food producers throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>Importantly, our sales are growing by at least 12% per annum, reflecting the growing market demand for artisan and speciality food.  My Department will continue to provide support for artisan and speciality food production in Ireland under the new rural development programme 2007-2013.  Among other things, this funding will support niche speciality food provision, farm shops and farmers&rsquo; markets.</P>
        <P>Particular emphasis will also be placed on rural recreation under this new rural development programme.  When we consider the continuing urbanisation of Europe and even of our own country, it is clear there are significant opportunities in rural recreation still untapped.  We are lucky to have one of the most diverse and beautiful countrysides, relative to our size, of any country, with beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes and a general landscape that largely remains undeveloped in terms of the potential of rural recreation.  I believe there is an unparalleled opportunity to develop those assets through the rural recreation policy of my Department and through the Leader programme.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline the practicalities of some of the progress achieved in rural recreation to date.  I made provision this year for funding for Coillte Teoranta, which owns 7.5% of the land mass of the country, in recognition of its important role in the provision of rural recreation.  My Department is currently completing a partnership agreement with Coillte to improve the management of recreation services across the country and to develop diverse products on its lands including scrambler bikes, riding, hiking, loop walks, wilderness, etc.  Coillte Teoranta has been proactive in this regard in the past year and many useful developments have taken place.</P>
        <P>My Department, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Trails Office and others, assisted Coillte Teoranta in the organisation of the first ever National Trails Day to enhance awareness and use of our trails.  National Trails Day took place on Sunday, 28 September last and more than 70 events were organised countrywide.  It was a great success and I look forward to seeing it go from strength to strength in the coming years.  The National Trails Day activities were <Col N="18"/>mirrored in the North where the forest service there held an open day on its forest trails to highlight the rural recreation facilities in that part of the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Other important developments by State agencies include the Coillte welcome initiative and Coillte Outdoors website to attract walkers and cyclists to use Coillte&rsquo;s recreational facilities around the country.  I encourage everyone to visit this website, <i>www.coillteoutdoors.ie</i>.  I am sure people will be pleasantly surprised by the number and range of beautiful walks and activities available free of charge all around the country.</P>
        <P>Discussions are taking place with larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and community groups on the development of the Limerick to Tralee railway line as a cycle-walkway.  There are also huge possibilities for the development of totally abandoned railway lines as cycle-walkways and my Department will, in the coming months, develop a programme to try to facilitate that.  Such development depends on the goodwill and the assistance of landowners and we will be seeking this confident in the knowledge that the rural community see the advantage of such developments.</P>
        <P>This year has seen the institution of the new walks scheme, which I launched in early March.  I thank farmers and landowners for their enthusiastic participation in this scheme that is facilitating the development and maintenance of a high quality network of walks throughout the country.  Under the scheme, landholders receive payment for the development, maintenance and enhancement of approved national waymarked ways, NWMW, and looped walking routes that pass through their land or, alternatively, their maintenance under the rural social scheme.  Participation in the scheme is optional and access is granted by the permission of the landholder.  The measure is based on mutual agreement and co-operation.  This is a win-win situation for everybody as it gives people living in rural Ireland not alone new opportunities but also ensures the maintenance of the walkways to a high quality.</P>
        <P>We took a large step forward this year with the appointment of 12 rural recreation officers.  An integral part of their role will be to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  The rural recreation officer will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice.  These officers will provide vital support in rolling out the walks scheme.</P>
        <P>I have provided approximately &euro;650,000 in capital funding to F&aacute;ilte Ireland this year to assist in the development of the national network of looped walks to a total of 50 trailheads and more than 80 Loops in 19 counties.  We expect to have at least one looped walk in each county by the end of this year.  It is interesting and heartening to see F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s figures for walking tourism from overseas visitors, as they reflect a dramatic increase in the numbers of tourists coming to Ireland to walk.  The number has grown from a low of 168,000 in 2003 in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis to 511,000 in 2007.  As we make more progress, we want to see the increase in the numbers of people walking, hiking, cycling and involved in water-based activities sustained.  Walking is an activity that suits people of all ages and fitness levels and has social and health benefits for all of us.  Rural areas have a clear advantage in the area of walking tourism and this rural tourism contributes to more diverse and vibrant rural communities in which people live and do not just visit at weekends.</P>
        <P>The measures we are taking in co-operation with local communities are being developed to facilitate agreed access to the countryside and the development of rural recreation.  All this work is about improving the quality of rural recreation product available to market to overseas visitors and to attract our own communities to avail of the social and economic benefits of rural recreation.</P>
        <P>In September, I had a meeting with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and Ms Michelle Gildernew, the Northern Ireland Minister for <Col N="19"/>Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Development.  That was a very positive meeting and I hope we will be able to develop a joint all-Ireland approach to the development of trails in order that we will have a seamless product to put on the international tourism market.  All-island co-operation makes sense, as people who visit Ireland from abroad tend to see it as one geographic unit and it is now marketed as such through Tourism Ireland.</P>
        <P>I also had a very constructive meeting in September in Scotland with my counterpart, Mr. Richard Lochhead, MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, who was very positive about sharing knowledge and best practice with us in order that we can learn from the experiences in Scotland, just as we will assist them in any way with information regarding the approach been taken in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Rural recreation should not be confined to the land and I will work with my colleague, the Minister for the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the development of rural recreation on the lakes and rivers of Ireland.  These, traditionally, have been a source of interest to many people, however, there is room for further expansion.  Angling and water sports are growing interests with many people and there are still huge untapped resources on our lakes and rivers.  As Minister with responsibility for Waterways Ireland, along with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Gregory Campbell, MLA, we are determined to continue to develop the inland waterways of Ireland for leisure purposes.  Next year we will see the opening of the Royal Canal connecting Dublin to the Shannon and this will be a major milestone in the restoration of our waterways.  Work is progressing on the development of the Ulster Canal and we are on target to achieve the opening of the first section of this canal by 2012.  This section will open the canal from the Erne to Clones.  Once this section is completed further, examination will be given to the further development of the canal until it eventually links Lough Neagh to Lough Erne, which will mean we will have continuous waterway from Limerick to the North Sea near Coleraine.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Around the coasts of Ireland we have some of the most interesting seas, which are a haven for those interested in water sports of every type, from diving to surfboarding to yachting.  Traditionally, we have undervalued the oceans around us and I believe there is a unique opportunity for us with the Volvo ocean race coming to Galway in 2009 to exploit the incredible resource that our coastline gives us for marine leisure.  I will work with my colleagues in the coming years to ensure this potential is tapped.  I believe that 2009 will be a watershed year in this regard, with the putting in place of a clear vision of how we can proceed with the development in an orderly way of marine leisure around our coasts.</P>
        <P>Given what has happened in other countries, there are huge untapped resources in the private sector in this regard.  I believe the role of Government in regard to rural development and marine leisure is to be one of facilitator investing where necessary but, in particular, encouraging the private sector to invest in the development of services, infrastructure and employment by creating the right circumstances for same.  I am confident that under the new rural development programme, Exchequer and European Union funding, in combination with private investment, will ensure that, together, we will continue on our journey to see rural Ireland realise its potential.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Seanad on having this debate, which is my first opportunity to speak in the Houses of the Oireachtas about the new rural development programme.  At a time when many people are somewhat downbeat, looking at the two big areas of development, namely, people and natural resources, we have both in rural Ireland and this could be a time of expansion there when many other people are talking about contraction.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Maraon leis an Aire, t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi chursa&iacute; forbartha tuaithe mar t&aacute; a l&aacute;n fadhbanna i measc pobal na tuaithe.  Fine Gael welcomes the publication of the Leader programme or rural development programme, despite the delay.  As the Minister stated in his address, rural Ireland has two great assets, its natural resources and its people.  It should be recognised that a significant proportion of the money being provided is from the European Union.  I hope the people of rural Ireland who voted against the Lisbon treaty in June 2008 will take cognisance of the fact that, without funding from the European Union, we would not have significant resources to invest in rural Ireland.  In fairness to our EU counterparts, we must acknowledge the support they give us. I hope this will be recognised by na gn&aacute;th daoine.</P>
        <P>While the funding is clearly welcome, there has been a long delay in bringing the programme to fruition.  We all accept it was necessary to have reform but, as the Minister stated, it has come at a time when the regions are suffering.  Let us be honest and realise we face an economic downturn, partly as a consequence of Government policy and partly due to the global downturn.  The number of unemployed on the live register has increased massively.  It is the largest increase in over a quarter of a century.  One person is losing his job every three minutes, amounting to 70,000 jobs since the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, took office.</P>
        <P>In this economic context, 45% of multinationals based in Ireland said they would not come here again, primarily because of the high cost of doing business here and the poor quality of our infrastructure.  Unfortunately, as the Minister and Senators know, the areas of the country worst hit by the stark reality of the recession are the rural, peripheral regions.  Despite the fanfare at the launch of the programme and many of the Minister&rsquo;s fine remarks, we must be clear that it is critical to stimulate growth in regional areas.  I do not know whether that is addressed in the programme.  I hope so but I do not believe it.</P>
        <P>Funding for business creation and the development of tourism activities is welcome and to be lauded but there must be adequate supports to ensure these activities will not just be soundbites or a short-lived success.  The Minister referred to canals and the Volvo Ocean Race in Galway in 2009.  Baltimore in west Cork and Crosshaven, with their ability to attract sailors and others involved in ocean-related activity, must be developed.  We must use our ocean more and I support the Minister fully in this regard.  His words need to be more than soundbites and simple throwaway remarks, which I hope they will not be.</P>
        <P>The Minister is introducing this programme after having decided at Cabinet to introduce levies that will hit tourism at a time when visitor numbers are decreasing.  The chairman of Ireland West Airport Knock referred to this prospect this morning.  Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland were before the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in recent weeks.  The agricultural community in particular was hit in the budget through the axing of many of the schemes designed to rejuvenate the sector and encourage young people to stay in farming.</P>
        <P>Infrastructure is critical to the development of the regions.  The Leader of the Seanad spoke correctly about the fact that Ireland does not end at the border of Dublin or the M50.  The Minister lives in a rural area in Galway West and I am from Cork city, although my family is from west Cork and north Cork.  Rural Ireland is the lifeblood of our country and, if we are to be serious, we must not stall infrastructure projects under Transport 21.  I refer to the western rail corridor, the Cork commuter rail plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is going ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="21"/>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Not only do they need to go ahead but they must also come to fruition.  They cannot be stalled in a piecemeal manner. The major components of Transport 21 are centred around the hub of Dublin.  The commuter belts around the rest of the country must be considered in a balanced way.  The bus strategy for rural Ireland, involving Bus &Eacute;ireann, does not inspire confidence.  The company has been allocated approximately &euro;23 million to buy 75 replacement buses.  That these buses are not new means many communities will not benefit from the investment.</P>
        <P>Regional airports are having their investments delayed due to the deterioration in the health of the public finances.  This implies that essential infrastructure and equipment upgrades will not take place.  This morning the director of Ireland West Airport Knock, Liam Scollan, said the airport tax introduced in the budget will devastate the airport.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, he stated a reduction of between 5% and 10% in passenger numbers into Knock &ldquo;would result in a loss of between &euro;5.2 million and &euro;10.5 million in tourism revenue to the region &mdash; far more than the revenue collected&rdquo;.  Today Aer Lingus spoke about a &euro;30 million hit as a consequence of the tax.  On one level we are announcing massive plans while, on another, we are making cuts.  Is it a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul?</P>
        <P>Will the Atlantic road corridor, due for completion in 2015, proceed?  Will the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, create a stop-gap?  Already we have seen the postponement of construction of part of the Cork-Dublin motorway.  What is the position on the Rosslare-Waterford road project?  I hope transport infrastructure in rural areas will not be neglected in favour of the metro in Dublin.  Although we need a metro, we need sustainable and viable rural infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not mention broadband in his address.  It is a major issue for rural development.  Fine Gael has always stated and has produced documents on the fact that we should support high-speed wireless connectivity to areas too remote to justify ducting and fibre-optic connections.  This will help our competitiveness in a global market as IT becomes an integral part of our economy.  Foreign companies are still attracted to such connectivity and it will influence their decision to invest here.  Ireland is 33rd of 35 countries in terms of average Internet speed, behind countries such as Mexico and Turkey.  Will the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs apprise the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of this?  We need to consider this.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy states regional development is essential.  Amenities such as hospitals, schools and child care facilities are essential in rural Ireland.  With the cutbacks in education, the amalgamation of hospitals and the creation of centres of excellence, I, as a schoolteacher, believe we are sending a wrong message to the three-teacher and four-teacher schools in rural Ireland.  I would like to hear the remarks of the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on this.  We should not be closing schools in rural Ireland and amalgamating them with others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what was proposed by the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in his remarks on the budget.  I look forward to debating this with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The closure of many hospitals in regional Ireland sends out the wrong message because patients must now travel farther to gain access to basic medical facilities.  Senator MacSharry refers in this House day after day to cancer services in the north west.</P>
<Col N="22"/>
        <P>The rate of unemployment has increased since the Government came into office.  Rural areas have been particularly hit.  Ballybofey in County Donegal has had an increase of 107% in unemployment; Carrickmacross in County Monaghan, 99%, Kenmare in County Kerry,<?oasys _jy ?>110%; and my own county, Cork, has had a 53% increase in people signing on.  We see nothing but cutting back in the budget.  It is not a budget of renewal that rewards enterprise and promotes rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the Minister knows, agriculture was and is a major component of rural Irish life.  It has provided substantial employment and one hopes it will continue to do so.  Many commitments made to agriculture in the programme for Government have not been met.  At the first sign of fiscal trouble there are cutbacks for rural life and the disadvantaged areas, early retirement, young farmer, installation aid and farm investment schemes have been reduced.  The IFA produced a document which shows the numbers of people affected.</P>
        <P>Where is the programme for Government now?  Will the Minister, as stated in that programme: &ldquo;implement proposals for a Community Development Plan which will deliver community facilities such as playgrounds, community centres, local markets, recycling and sports recreation facilities throughout the country&rdquo;.  That was to be the plan over a five-year period.  Where is that plan now?  Is it all contained in the Minister&rsquo;s plan today?  Is that it?</P>
        <P>I have questions regarding matching funding in the scheme.  If, for example, a community centre receives an allocation from Pobal or from Leader, is it allowed to receive funding from another source or must it be funded from only one source?  Can we not have matching funding given to community groups that will allow them to bring projects to fruition?  From having spoken to some groups in recent days since the Minister announced this plan, I know they have an issue regarding matching funding.  Is there a plan for the drawing down of moneys in the first year?  Is there a cap on the amount that can be drawn down by groups in the same year?  If that is the case, what is the logic behind it?  In fairness, I know we must encourage groups to spend and I am involved in a sporting club that received capital funding from the lottery sports programme.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether there is a cap.</P>
        <P>I hope we might see enterprise hubs in each county.  Deputy Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, has pointed out that energy projects, microenterprises, centres of specialist food production and sustainable tourism projects deserve to be supported.  We have an obligation to look after rural Ireland and it should not be seen as isolated and detached from the rest of society.  It requires a level of investment that will bring major benefit to the country at large.</P>
        <P>Did the Minister consider the abolition of all the Leader programmes and those that are now amalgamated under the councils?  At a time of recession there might be accountability and no further quangos.  I do not say that these programmes are quangos but one might then have local authorities in charge and accountability through elected people.  Sometimes that does not obtain.</P>
        <P>As mentioned in the Minister&rsquo;s speech, the national trades day was a good initiative and the events that took place were welcome.  The Heritage Council has a wonderful season pass that is not well promoted.  It might be used to encourage more people to visit our heritage sites and might also be tied into the Minister&rsquo;s walking and trails scheme.  As a person who walks a lot, it is important to commend our farming community who have allowed people to enter their lands and it is also important to promote rural Ireland in this way.  The Minister is right in that <Col N="23"/>sense.  There must be an increase in walking and cycling programmes and in the use of our waterways and oceans.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply at the end of the debate.</P>
        <P>Broadband penetration, infrastructural development and a reduction in the cost of doing business must be tackled if we are to promote seriously an alternative to our cities and metropolitan areas.</P>

T&aacute; an t-airgead thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach, ach t&aacute; an spiorad agus an tuiscint ar na riachtanais &aacute;iti&uacute;la chomh t&aacute;bhachtach.  N&iacute; g&aacute; ach f&eacute;achaint ar an strucht&uacute;r at&aacute; go forleathan chun sin a fheice&aacute;il.  Tharla sin toisc go raibh p&aacute;irtn&eacute;ireacht ann idir an St&aacute;t agus an obair dheonach a bh&iacute; ar si&uacute;l.  Sin mar ba ch&oacute;ir &eacute; a bheith agus mar ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh amach anseo.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister.  We now have an opportunity to discuss the programme that has been launched and to talk about some of the aims and opportunities that exist within it.  I agree with the Minister that in this time of economic challenges there is considerable opportunity for us to tap into that wellspring of commitment, voluntary service and pride of place that is to be found in the rural community.</P>
        <P>It is also significant that the urban-rural divide is not accentuated to the same extent as it was in the past.  One reason for that is  the success of rural Ireland and the balance that has been achieved.  Of course, there are requests and demands for more resources.  One would be very surprised if this were not the case but it is well worthwhile to have a historical perspective on rural development.  One must think of people such as Canon Hayes, the founder of Muintir na T&iacute;re, Father McDyer, who played a very significant role in the development of his region, and Monsignor Horan, who acted in the same way.  It is interesting that all three were clergymen who happened to be leaders in the community.  When one thinks of what they achieved with limited resources at that time and realises the resources we have at our disposal now there is no reason for despondency.  Imagine if somebody had told us that the funding allocation for this programme would be three times greater than that allocated to the previous one.  The sum of &euro;425.4 million is a considerable sum of money and if we add to that the extra &euro;600 million to which the Minister referred, this makes a huge resource.  We are not starting from a greenfield situation.  A major part of the required infrastructure for rural areas is in place and we must now make the best possible use of these resources.  I am pleased that, under the Leader programme, the proportion of community projects that may be funded has been increased from 50% to 75% and the ceiling on capital grants has increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000.  These measures are indicative of hope and positive thinking.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note the diverse nature of the headings under which the programme will operate, by which I do not mean only the need to achieve the important goal of diversification in agriculture.  Anyone who is familiar with small farming will be aware that the sector faces <Col N="24"/>challenging times.  We must not allow it to be viewed as a hobby because small farms can be productive in many ways.  People have shown initiative in this area, for example, in developing farmers&rsquo; markets and different types of food products.  People are prepared to pay for quality, particularly those who are health conscious.  I am pleased to note the importance attached to diversification.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, delegations from four groups connected with tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Tour Operators Association, appeared before the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The meeting, at which Senator Buttimer made an important contribution, provided an opportunity for the joint committee to receive an update from representatives of the tourism sector.  The key message delivered by all the groups was that there is no room for despondency in tourism and all of them are working in a positive manner.  There was also general agreement on the need to extend tourism from urban areas into the regions.  A spokesperson for F&aacute;ilte Ireland noted, for example, that the organisation had invested &euro;3 million in the development of the Shannon area, which linked in to the west.</P>
        <P>Tourism is a strong element of the Leader programme.  Heritage is an element of tourism that can be successfully promoted, even in the most isolated areas because people are prepared to travel to visit living and built heritage attractions.  While these sites depend on the goodwill of tour operators and others, by and large, the heritage sector has been successful throughout rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I made a suggestion, which may not come within the ambit of the Leader programme, at a number of meetings of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It would be disappointing if the bed and breakfast industry was diminished in any way because it is under major pressure, primarily as a result of overhead costs arising from health, hygiene and insurance regulations.  I do not contend that this bureaucracy is unnecessary but it should be revisited to alleviate the problems faced by bed and breakfast establishments, particularly in rural areas where hotels may not be available to service heritage attractions.  It may be worthwhile to introduce a programme to assist the sector.  I understand measures are in place in the Gaeltacht areas, perhaps relating to mn&aacute; t&iacute;.  Such a programme would be a radical but necessary step because if bed and breakfast establishments disappear, the younger generation will not start them up again as they are not prepared to make themselves available for the long hours necessary.  If bed and breakfast infrastructure is weakened, it will cause serious harm to tourism.</P>
        <P>I am not sure the cost of services and food are high when one compares like with like.  Ireland has a unique record internationally for the standard of its hotels, restaurants and bed and breakfast establishments.  We must not interfere with quality on the basis that the price is considered too high.  Likewise,  one must compare like with like in the case of entertainment and attractions.  In rural areas, one can pay as little as &euro;20 or &euro;25 to attend high class entertainment events.  That is not expensive.</P>
        <P>I read a survey on tourism carried out many years ago.  As part of the study, tourists were asked to identify the six main attractions in visiting Ireland.  The main attraction was national monuments, an area in which rural areas are to the fore.  Tourists continue to visit these sites because they use their imagination and are discerning.  They want a totally new experience, not to replicate that which they have left behind.</P>
        <P>The second most important attraction was high class evening and traditional entertainment.  Where does one find traditional entertainment?  While it is available in urban areas, it is wide<Col N="25"/>spread in rural areas.  A third important attraction was the ability to trace one&rsquo;s roots.  Currently, 33 centres on the island, North and South, offer a genealogical service using church and, in many cases, civil records.  These services are available on-line and have been accessed by millions of people who are willing to pay a small amount to do so.  Genealogy attracts people from abroad to visit the places from which their ancestors came.  We should not underestimate the power of the diaspora in that regard because, as the saying goes, the savage loves his native shore.  It is important to attract people to visit the places from which their forefathers came, many of which are obviously in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The key issues, therefore, are the threefold increase in funding, the increase in the proportion of funding available for projects, the increase in the capital ceiling and the diversity of headings under which it is possible to secure funding.  While I do not wish to start a debate at this late stage in my contribution, the message from this discussion is that the Government will face the challenge presented to it, not by the accession of Deputy Brian Cowen to the office of the Taoiseach but by the onset of a global recession.  The manner in which the Government responded to the banking crisis by introducing a bank guarantee showed that it was up to the challenge when the time came.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators stated on the Order of Business &mdash; Senator Quinn did so on a previous occasion &mdash; let us face this challenge in a united manner and show genuine admiration for the great visionaries of the past who developed rural Ireland.  Let us support the Minister who is also a great visionary. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am impressed with the rural development programme for the coming six years.  I am always fearful, however, when I learn that a committee has been established to address a problem because the first step such bodies take is to send a deputation to Dublin to have the problem solved on their behalf.  I am anxious to ensure we do not attempt to do that in this case.  Rather, we must tell people if they have a problem in their rural area that we here in Dublin will do our best to open the doors for them but that they must solve the problems themselves.</P>
        <P>I grew up in the tourism business.  My father started a holiday camp in Skerries when I was very young and my first job was as a shoeshine boy and so on.  The whole objective of that Red Island holiday camp was that the guests paid on the day they arrived.  When they paid, everything was included.  It was an all-in holiday and the objective was not to take more money from the guests.  I have some apprehension in this regard now, lest we have not learned this lesson well enough.  The objective was to get the customers to come back again year after year.  We need to instil that philosophy into people involved in the tourism business in particular so that people will want to come back year after year.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; had to say, when he spoke of the various things that happen within Ireland in the country, not the big cities.  I recall my wife and I being in Clifden on one occasion and we were wondering what to do one evening.  We were directed to the local hall where people were putting on their own show.  What a joy it was compared with what we might otherwise have had.  We were not looking for anything spectacular.</P>
        <P>Again, last weekend, I was so impressed.  We were down in Galway for the weekend and on Friday morning drove to Ballyvaughan, County Clare, to Monk&rsquo;s restaurant, which I do not mind mentioning.  We were the only Irish people there and it was pouring rain.  It was very wet and we had not come prepared for the Burren.  People coming in were wearing jeans, welling<Col N="26"/>tons and so on, but ours were the only Irish voices we heard on a busy Saturday morning, 8 November, in terrible weather, not like today.  Clearly there is an opportunity to do things.  That particular restaurant seemed to be a Mecca for people.  It is said that if one invents a new and better mousetrap, people will beat their way to it.  They were certainly beating their way to that little town in west County Clare and to that restaurant.  I believe it is possible.  The House will recall the old seanfhocal, &ldquo;&Eacute;ist le fuaim na habhann, mar gheobhaidh t&uacute; breac&rdquo;, or listen to the sound of the river if you are going to catch a trout.  I believe that is the opportunity we have in Ireland as regards tourism.  Let us open the doors and remove the shackles, controls and regulations to give people the freedom to be creative for themselves.</P>
        <P>Food is another area in which we can do something similar.  We place too many shackles, regulations and controls on people.  I think of the number of cheeses that did not exist 20 years ago, from my experience in the food business.  There are many examples as well of very successful farmhouse products that have been introduced, but I had better not mention names in case I leave some out.  However, the producers are very much hamstrung by regulations.  I know we blame Europe for this and say it is a matter of food safety, etc.  However, Ms Darina Allen, in County Cork, talks in particular of the need to ensure those entrepreneurs in the countryside are able to produce such products.  With so many people now living in urban areas, there is something of a renewed interest in rural activities.  I am not just referring to fishing, hiking, camping and boating.  As well as renewed interest in small organic food production, there is also a need to preserve our rural heritage and ensure that with so many new developments, rural areas are not inversely harmed.  Having said that, rural areas cannot be viewed as stagnant museum pieces and the rural development programme goes a long way towards helping to develop these areas in a constructive way.  I welcome the provision of these grants.</P>
        <P>One part of the programme that is especially welcome is the funding given to entrepreneurial farm families seeking to diversify into new areas.  Entrepreneurship is a really effective part of the rural development programme and, considering that Ireland imports 70% of its organic requirements, that is a real challenge to us.  Providing funding for diversification gives farmers a chance to convert to organic and helps to meet the overall target of converting 5% of the total agricultural area to organic production by 2012.  I am not a great believer that organic will be of interest to much more than a certain sector, but this is a sector that can well pay for itself because those who buy organic generally do not have price high on the agenda.</P>
        <P>I am concerned, however, with the specifics of the plan.  I hope the rural development programme will create jobs at a time when many have been lost, for instance in the sugar beet industry in County Wexford.  However, has a specific calculation been done as to how many jobs will be created per million euro spent?  In addition, has it been estimated what the precise economic benefit will be for the communities in which the money is actually spent?  Those working in the construction industry, in particular, have been very hard hit and there is a great need to strive to provide employment for them.  I would like to know whether an estimate has been made of how many construction workers will be employed as part of this phase of the rural development programme.  Instead of welcoming unquestioningly the funding provided by the rural development programme, I believe these are legitimate questions that need to be asked in order that the funds are distributed wisely.</P>
        <P>I support what the Minister is doing, and the enthusiasm we are showing here.  I support the concept that we are not doing things for others, but rather opening the door to provide the freedom for individuals to do it themselves.  I am confident the people of rural Ireland will grab hold of that opportunity.</P>

        <P>In more constrained economic times we should welcome this as a good news story.  We have three times the previous spend available under the previous programme, which ran from 2000 to 2006, as well as funding of &euro;425 million and this has to be good news for rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on the great work he does and on his intense focus on the needs of rural communities.  From his background in working with co-operatives, it is difficult to imagine someone more suited to the brief.  I am sure thanks are owed not just to the Minister.  I acknowledge the fact that this is one of the good news stories.</P>
        <P>Many of us are involved in a debate at the moment on the impact of the European Union on Irish affairs, and many people have concerns that one hopes will be addressed in the weeks and months ahead.  They will be matters for discussion at the level of the Sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, of which I am a member, and I hope it will be the subject of a discussion between the Government and our European partners to see how we may assert our positive European identity.  In a way that takes account of the fact that we have distinctive traditions and want the freedom to operate in certain areas and so forth.  It is very easy when one is involved in a debate such as that to focus only on the challenges and the potential negatives.  We should never lose sight of the fact that the European Union has made so many things possible for our country.  We can see that this continues, and it is particularly visible with the LEADER funding, where 55% comes from the European Union and 45% from the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>As a son of rural Ireland, I am supportive of anybody, anything or any institution that takes to heart in a serious manner the importance of making life better in rural Ireland and increasing the viability and attractiveness of life there.  I am also anxious we do that in sustainable ways.  As we make money available to people and bodies for activities such as the upgrading of parks, civic areas or river walks &mdash; there are a million things one could mention &mdash; it is good we see that in the context of concern and care for the environment, and that the development we support and champion enhances the quality of our environment, which is of benefit not only to rural dwellers but also to the wider community.  We should continue to pursue those goals in a sustainable way.</P>

        <P>I wish to refer to a number of issues.  I listened to<b> </b>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and I share many of his views on rural Ireland and how it can be developed.  Ireland was established on the basis of the baile feirme, the townland structure, which provides us with a unique geographical structure.  I discussed this with officials from Donegal County Council recently and made the point about broadband being available on a universal basis in other EU countries such as Germany, Finland and Sweden, where broadband is readily available, but that it is forgotten that much of the population in those countries live in apartment blocks.  It is easy to make broadband available in urban areas where 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 people live in an apartment block, but it is much more difficult to obtain the same objective in a rural area.</P>
        <P>I am proud to come from rural Ireland, a part of rural Donegal in the Gaeltacht.  I pay tribute to the Minister for the work he has done in progressing rural Ireland.  I entered politics in 1999 and since then I have seen at first hand the work and commitment of this Minister to rural Ireland and Gaeltacht areas, and I salute him for that commitment and effort.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of days there has been much discussion on the new Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  I met many people in my area in Donegal who have welcomed the programme, the structure, the &euro;425 million, the co-operation from the EU, which Senator Buttimer noted in his opening remarks, and the recognition that rural Ireland is important not only to Ireland but also the European Community.  We should acknowledge the input from the European unit in making funding available.  There is an increased level of funding over the next six or seven years, the percentage of the funding available to community groups has been increased and funding is also being made available for core things important to people in rural communities, such as diversification into non-agricultural activities for part-time small farmers who want to diversify, the creation of new business ideas, the development of existing businesses and the encouragement of tourism activities.</P>
        <P>There are opportunities available to rural Ireland and the Gaeltacht areas in developing tourism products from the natural resources available to us.  Nuair a bh&iacute; clinic&iacute; ar si&uacute;l agam i mo d&aacute;ilcheantar fh&eacute;in le linn na deireadh seachtaine, bhuail m&eacute; le gr&uacute;pa mn&aacute; t&iacute;.  I had constituency clinics during the weekend and one group who came in was a group of mn&aacute; t&iacute;, and the Minister will recognise their importance to rural Ireland as he has been to the forefront of developing Irish colleges over the past ten years.  They were looking to develop walkways in their own area, and developing a tourism product working with the Donegal county walking officer.  They had already developed four routes, and were not looking for money.  They were looking for help to develop routes themselves, and the men would help out with the work.  It will extend the tourism season to allow people come to the Gaeltacht, participate in walking <Col N="29"/>and learn the Irish language while staying with a bean an t&iacute;.  It is a wonderful idea which has potential, and I ask the Minister to consider it as part of this programme, because while the bean an t&iacute; has a seasonal responsibility during June, July and August, we could widen that, develop the language and bring tourists into the Gaeltacht region.</P>
        <P>The new programme will have significant benefits.  It will strengthen our communities, the backbone of rural Ireland, and build on the work done, especially in the CL&Aacute;R programme which has reversed depopulation and fulfilled the objectives laid out in 2001 and 2002, which I welcome.  Rural Ireland can grow in the knowledge that there is a future for us all.  Third level education is now available in many parts of the west and rural Ireland, and we welcome that and acknowledge the work that has been done.  The CL&Aacute;R programme brought about the confidence for people to be willing to stay at home because the Government took an interest in rural Ireland and the focus was on not on west to east, but east to west since the programme was launched by the Minister.  The Government must be applauded for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad to speak on the rural development programme and its role in shaping the Ireland of the future.  It is vital that we think about the future because for too long rural development in Ireland has been left behind and has been the poor relation of Government policy.  As the economic boom turns to bust, rural Ireland is staring at a decade of stagnation, financial hardship and, potentially, emigration.</P>
        <P>The usefulness and integrity of the rural development programme is not in question.  The scheme continues to provide training and the support of expert professional advice on business start-ups, agribusinesses, crafts and agricultural innovation.  I was a director of Meath Partnership, or Meath Leader as it was then, and I recognise and am well aware of the positive role the partnership and leadership programmes have played in rural Ireland.  However, in many areas these programmes are only a drop in the ocean.  While rural development programmes go some way to addressing the difficulties inherent in rural living, the overall picture remains decidedly bleak.  The new rural development programme is useful and welcome, but it is difficult to avoid the impression that it is just an outdated blueprint designed for more prosperous times.</P>
        <P>The scale of the impending economic crisis is such that the impact will be felt differently across the country and the inequality that existed already with regard to the urban-rural split will become painfully more apparent in the difficult times ahead.  The question therefore is how can we nurture vibrant rural communities where farmers and non-farmers living there contribute towards the well-being and future of their locality.</P>
        <P>I wonder, for example, how we can nurture communities by closing rural post offices.  Some 500 post offices have closed throughout Ireland in the past ten years.  This has a significant impact on community life.  One consequence of post office closures is that elderly people feel more isolated and disconnected from their localities.  Post offices are the focus of local communities and decisions on their closure cannot be justified purely on cost terms.  We need to consider factors such as the socio-economic benefits of keeping rural post offices open.</P>
        <P>This time last year there were 170,000 people unemployed throughout the country.  Last week, the Taoiseach said he expects this number to rise to approximately 300,000 in the coming two years.  These job losses will be devastating for rural communities.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill will be well aware that just a few years ago the census figures showed that in rural areas such as Donegal 25% of people were unemployed.  In two electoral wards in Mayo, the unemployment rate was as high as 40%.  If this is a snapshot of the rural community during the good <Col N="30"/>times, we can only imagine what the situation will be in a few years&rsquo; time when the full effects of the economic crisis and downturn will be felt.</P>
        <P>The most recent budget has not helped the countryside.  In agriculture, the much vaunted early retirement scheme for farmers has been cut, installation aid for young farmers is gone, payments in the suckler cow welfare scheme have been halved and the fallen animals aid scheme subvention has been slashed.  Cutbacks such as post office closures on one hand and attacks on farmer&rsquo;s allowances on the other mean that rural living as a viable way of life and alternative to urban living is in serious jeopardy.  While 40% of the country&rsquo;s population live in the countryside, equity of opportunity in rural as compared to urban areas is grossly deficient.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year the Minister wrote an article for the <i>Irish Examiner</i> in which he said: &ldquo;No rural area has the social, economic or quality of life deprivation found in Ireland&rsquo;s worst off urban communities.&rdquo;  Social and economic poverty has many faces.  While it may not be as potent, concentrated or visible in rural areas as compared with large towns and cities, this does not imply that poverty does not exist in rural communities.</P>

	<P>Let me give the Minister one example.  The Summerhill active retirement group submitted a document that depicts what life is like, in terms of poverty, in rural Ireland.  The group&rsquo;s submission highlighted the case of an 87 year old woman who came to the group for assistance.  She is a widow with poor eyesight who suffers from chronic ill health.  Her home was in such poor repair that she had to take all her meals in one room and live in that room because the rest of the house was too cold.  Her situation improved with the assistance of the active retirement group.  However, her case is a clear indication that poverty exists in the countryside.  We must not forget this and must be aware that just because it is less visible, it is no less dangerous or damaging than in urban areas. </P>
        <P>Three years ago the National University of Ireland Maynooth, UCD and Teagasc published a report entitled Rural Ireland 2025 which stated that current rural affairs policy would lead to a dramatic reduction in farming numbers and a widespread decline in commercial farming.  If the market determines that farming numbers will decrease, there is only so much we can do, but we can ensure we have programmes in place to encourage people to diversify and retrain for areas such as specialist food production and agritourism.  We all accept the rural development programme can help them to do that, but only if there are sufficient resources in place.</P>
        <P>We have all seen the benefits of diversification away from farming towards the utilisation of the facilities and benefits of the countryside.  In my constituency, Rathbeggan Lakes provide an excellent example of what can be done in terms of rural innovation and diversification.  They have fisheries, a pet farm and an allotment scheme, which encourages urban dwellers to come and grow vegetables.  This is valuable to the community.  Other projects have helped to encourage economic diversification elsewhere.</P>
<Col N="31"/>
        <P>I am aware of a wide range of projects put in place by Meath Leader and Meath Partnership.  An artist in Bellewstown has received a donation for a new studio.  Community groups in the north of Meath are taking care of their local village greens and a potter has received financial assistance for kilns.  These projects are making real differences to life in rural Ireland.  Senator Quinn mentioned artisan foods and the production of quality organic cheeses.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned mn&aacute; t&iacute; and the encouragement of the development of walking routes.  I benefited from going to the Gaeltacht last August to learn Irish in the morning and walk in the afternoons.  I am better at walking than I was, but I am not so sure about my Irish.  However, I intend to return to the Gaeltacht.  It is such schemes that can help improve tourism in the countryside.</P>
        <P>Ireland is stalled with regard to the development of walking routes in the countryside.  The Minister has tried to improve the situation for walkers in the past couple of years, but this area needs greater emphasis.  The Labour Party tried to introduce a Bill recently.  Will the Minister take another look at how to encourage more members of rural communities to take part in walking schemes to encourage more people into the countryside.</P>
        <P>Projects like these must be nurtured and encouraged.  The programme for rural development provides some security and cause for optimism for people living in the countryside, but it will only improve matters if the finances are guaranteed.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure he maintains these resources and that the rural development programme does not suffer from cutbacks.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him and the Government on the improvements that have been made in the area of rural development.  The Minister outlined a number of improvements that have been brought forward under the funding allocations pertaining to axes 3 and 4 of the new Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  I will not repeat what the Minister said, but I will touch on the key factors contributing to the development of rural areas and of services to rural dwellers.  Senator Hannigan referred to post offices, which I agree form an integral part of rural infrastructure.  However, keeping them open is not as easy as people might think.  I recall at least two occasions when I had to drive around an area and knock on doors to ask people whether they would take over post offices.  In both cases, the answers were negative.  To quote a saying, the head was not worth the washing.  The money was not there.  I acknowledge the vital roles played by post offices, schools, churches and Garda stations in rural development.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I would love to see an end to the famous green man, which used to be in vogue and may still obtain in certain areas.  As someone who is proud of being bred, born and reared in the country, I believe more crime was prevented by the actions of garda&iacute; locally in rural areas, towns and villages than was ever committed.  They knew what was going on and could identify the blackguards.  We had such garda&iacute; in Mullingar, who have gone to their eternal rewards after doing a marvellous job in keeping order.</P>
        <P>When we speak about schools we tend to dwell on the related issues of numbers and planning.  During the debates this Chamber has held on planning, the issue of serial objectors repeatedly arose.  A previous speaker noted that An Taisce is being used to whip young people who apply for planning permission in rural areas, even in respect of their own lands.  I could point to somebody who is connected in a family context but that is not an argument.  A young <Col N="32"/>man with a farm was granted planning permission by Westmeath County Council but, lo and behold, the area was visited by an aeroplane and an aerial photograph was taken that resulted in the decision being overturned.  The serial objector to whom I refer came into this world with a silver spoon in his mouth.  What about the ordinary son and daughter of Mary and Pat?  Where are they supposed to live?  That is why schools and churches are closing, although there may be other reasons in respect of the latter.  I belong to a group of people who believe they have a pivotal role to play in churches.  GAA clubs are also experiencing a decline as a result of the shrinking rural population.</P>
        <P>Rural development is driven by infrastructure and people.  It is not driven by crows, which are an important part of the flora and fauna.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom focal n&oacute; dh&oacute; a r&aacute; mar gheall ar Chomhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.

One travels to another country to see people as they are and to taste their cuisine and hear their music and language.  I commend the farming community on the role it has played in agritourism and rural development.</P>

Go minic, is d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; mar gheall ar an nGaeilge amh&aacute;in a tharraing&iacute;onn &oacute;r&aacute;id&iacute; as Gaeilge sa Teach seo.  I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I wish to address briefly some of the issues that arose.</P>
        <P>I remind Senators that 55% of the funding for this programme comes from the EU.  The programme represents a European notion that rural communities have value beyond agriculture.  As Senator Glynn noted, our planning process must be compatible with rural development.  In January, I met county managers to tell them it would be strange if we could not get planning for rural developments, such as farm diversification and small industrial projects, which are funded by this &euro;425 million rural development programme.  The national broadband scheme is to be rolled out to the areas of the country which do not at present have broadband.</P>
        <P>In regard to the issue raised by Senator Buttimer on matching funds, I am slightly puzzled as to why it wound up as it did.  I am addressing the issue as speedily as I can but must follow a specific procedure.  I intend to provide matching funding for local authorities.  In terms of community development, non-commercial projects can receive up to 75% funding but communities must put their money where their mouths are by coming up with the remaining<?oasys _jy ?>25%.  In respect of Leader funding, unlike the last round which had a cap of &euro;100,000, projects can now receive up to &euro;500,000.  That does not mean a project which includes a cr&egrave;che and a community development aspect will not be approved separately.</P>
        <P>I announced the level of funding for the programme on Tuesday but by Wednesday concerns were expressed that we would run out of money next year.  We should not speak about running out of money until it is spent because &euro;27 million has been put aside for next year.  One of the <Col N="33"/>reasons I did not provide more funding for next year is that my experience of sanctioning funds, which is not always finalised by 1 January because the contracts and applications have to be prepared, is that people can be very slow in finishing their programmes and drawing down the money.  I hope the irony is not lost on the rural community as it bangs down the doors to seek an extension of the farm waste management scheme.  It seems that three or four years is not enough time to spend the money sanctioned for that scheme.  Leader companies are already claiming that I have not provided sufficient money for next year.  We will see who is right.  I am saying to the Leader companies to get out there and spend it.  There will be plenty of money in 2009 and 2010.  The whole &euro;425 million will be provided.</P>
        <P>I want to close taking receipts for payment at the end of November.  That gives us one month to pay people.  It is not acceptable to submit a bill on 20 December and expect to be paid on 25 December with no inspection.  There will be 11 months to draw down &euro;27 million.  At the end of next year I will be shaking the bushes trying to find legitimate payments to make.  We will see who is wrong.  I urge the Leader companies to spend what they have and stop worrying until they have it spent.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with the idea of Senator Buttimer that the scheme should go under the control of the councils.  These new, integrated companies, with a wide representation of community interests, social partners, local authorities and statutory agencies, must be removed from the purely statutory domain so that they have the flexibility they need.  It is wrong to see them as only delivering Leader.  They deliver the rural social scheme.  Do we suggest that this should be delivered by county councils?  This would not have worked if it had been done this way.  Should the rural recreation office or the rural walkway scheme have been delivered by county councils?  If we had done it that way, more bureaucracy would have been involved.  I refer also to the local development social inclusion programme.</P>
        <P>I have cut the number of bodies from more than 100 to 55 but if local authorities could get on with tarring the roads well and providing water, sewerage, planning and housing well, they would have a great day&rsquo;s work done.  They should do this rather than taking on the world.  Perhaps I am wrong on this point.</P>
        <P>People refer to post offices and sometimes they refer to a world that is gone.  We are trying to create a world at the moment.  I accept that Senator Buttimer and half of his party is with the Government on decentralisation.  The one means to bring jobs to rural Ireland that is within the Government&rsquo;s gift is decentralisation.  In fairness to Deputies Kenny, Ring and O&rsquo;Mahony, they are always asking when the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will be transferred to Charlestown, and rightly so.</P>

	<P>It is not.  It is going full steam ahead.  There are 100 civil servants in Tubbercurry.  What is disconcerting is the fact that senior spokespersons in Fine Gael run down the decentralisation programme week in, week out.  They do not inform themselves that all this decentralisation has taken place and the Departments are working so efficiently in the decentralised locations that people do not realise the move has taken place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The Budget Statement outlined that we will have completed 6,000 out of 10,000 by 2011.  If we had announced 6,000 the first day, it would still have been the <Col N="34"/>largest decentralisation programme ever.  Perhaps we overshot somewhat; so be it.  Decentralisation is one of the great dynamic drivers in rural Ireland.  I do not subscribe that we should have decentralised to the gateway towns because they were growing anyway.</P>

T&aacute; na daoine at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; le B&amp;B i bhfad n&iacute;os sine n&aacute; na mn&aacute; t&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The bed and breakfast sector has a major role to play but it must change its game.  The idea of passing trade for bed and breakfast is dead.  Rural recreation, activities and bringing guests to the bed and breakfast for a week is important.  That is why mn&aacute; t&iacute; work so well.  The guests are there for three weeks, the house is full, there is money to be made and the standards are very high.  There is also co-ordination with someone else who is filling the house.  We must become more sophisticated.  I try to encourage an industry of rural leisure, rural recreation, marine leisure, leisure on lakes and every kind of group coming, including artists.  People could organise to fill the house of the bed and breakfast so that the owner would not be waiting for someone to pass, as might have been the case 20 years ago.</P>
        <P>If we do not modernise, we will not survive.  We need a more integrated approach to how we fill bed and breakfast establishments so that they are not the more casual bed and breakfast establishments of the past but will do more business, fill more beds and make more money.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to post offices, which cannot survive if people do not use them.  Young people send e-mails and have credit cards and bank cards.  When they want a payment into their account, it is done by electronic transfer.  If one is always protecting the past, one will fail on two levels.  One will not succeed in keeping open establishments that are uneconomical, as were many of our post offices which were making an average income of &euro;5,000-6,000 per year.  On the other hand, if the only policy is to keep open something that is not working and that the new generation has moved beyond, then one is doomed to failure.</P>
        <P>My experience in rural Ireland is to be ahead of the game and as innovative as those in urban Ireland, who always accept change.  We went from clothes manufacturing and other industries from the time I was growing up to the Irish Financial Services Centre, and we will move on from there in the future.  If that is the way cities operate, to keep moving forward, the only way to develop rural Ireland is to seek the new service that young people require because there is a future in that.  We must be careful of the nostalgic view of solving problems.  It is important that old people have engagement.  That is why we invest so much in care of the elderly, day care centres, activities and rural and night buses.  We must keep ahead of the situation and be creative in doing so.</P>
        <P>I cannot resist the temptation to refer to this and I hope the Senator will forgive me.  There is no deprivation in rural Ireland on a community level like that in urban areas.  Statistics from sociologists bear me out.  As part of the RAPID programme, a remapping process was carried out on this basis and the results are solidly the same.  One day I was in Ballycroy, a village with a population of 600 people, 300 of whom were in the hall.  I was a little cheeky because I said that while there were challenges with unemployment and migration, I offered to pay, at my expense, for anyone who approached me after the meeting to stay in a deprived urban area of my choice for a week.  Not one person challenged me and not one person approached me after the meeting.  I said this not to belittle the challenges faced by the community, which were enormous and especially in respect of youth migration, but to give them the self worth they shared with me in the possibilities of the community if they overcame the challenges they faced.  Intrinsically, it was a good place to live.</P>
<Col N="35"/>
        <P>To provide the other side of the story, I remember being in Wexford at a partnership meeting.  I made the same comment and a lady put up her hand and asked to speak.  She said that I was dead right, that she was from the Aran Islands and that there was no deprivation on the Aran Islands like there was in Wexford town.  I was glad and relieved that she validated my point.  If rural Ireland was a totally deprived, poor and a terrible place to live, why would we be trying to develop it?  The reality is that within rural Ireland there is a potential to have a fantastic society.  In terms of the standard of living for a wide spectrum of the community, there is the potential to have probably the best society there because of the closeness, togetherness and structures of society there and all the supports it gives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This leads me to Senator Glynn&rsquo;s contribution which dealt with a key issue.  This programme is about economic development but it also about social development.  Why do we as a Government believe that rural development is so important?  We believe in that because within rural Ireland we have always had strong community structures.  They were informal but strong and driven by people locally as opposed to big organisations or the State.  The school and church were mentioned.  There is also Comhaltas, which in more recent years has been incredibly strong in promoting traditional music, the cuarta&iacute;ocht and the GAA clubs.  All those tend to bring the whole community together in a way that is difficult to achieve in an urban community.  Those structures create a place where people are happy living.</P>
        <P>When we talk about developing communities and our society, it is not only about economic development but about getting the right balance of economic, community and social development such that people living in an area are not merely economic units but see themselves as members of a community who care for each other.</P>
        <P>Having grown up in Dublin, one aspect of rural Ireland I greatly value is the support of communities for each other in good times and bad.  I hope the development companies, in rolling out this programme, take account of such a wider vision and get a balance between economic and social development to ensure we create total communities.  Senator Quinn alluded to that vision.  It is an important one, namely, about the State facilitating but not taking away that aspect that makes rural Ireland unique.  That aspect is that most of what happens comes from the ground up and the State plays the role of a facilitator rather than taking over from the people and deciding for them what should happen.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter with the Minister of State agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 31 January.  As I said then, St. Angela&rsquo;s school in Cork city has had meetings, engaged in a consultative process and promises have been made in respect of it.  The school is concerned that it will not have a new school building and that the development plan has not been advanced or brought to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>The school wishes to bring to a conclusion the purchase of the adjoining convent site, which is a key element of the building plan.  The trustees have submitted all the legal documents to <Col N="36"/>the Department and I am informed the sales process is now in the hands of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  The trustees, their solicitors and the school are waiting for the sale to be concluded.  When will the Department of Education and Science be in a position to conclude the sale of the convent site?  From what I gather, the delay in the process is very much on the side of the Department and not on the side of the school.</P>
        <P>There are 524 pupils in St. Angela&rsquo;s.  Enrolments have been good, given that the school is in the inner city which has a wide catchment area.  I was told by the former Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, in January that the extension and refurbishment project was at an early stage of architectural planning.  What band rating has been assigned to the project?</P>
        <P>The Ursuline order is prepared to sell the convent building and grounds to the Department to allow for a modern school to be built.  In January this was being considered by the Department.  Does such consideration and consultation take almost ten months?  I hope we will get answers to these questions.  There is an acceptance now that the extension and refurbishment of the school needs the decanting of the existing building.  I hope we will get a positive reply from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to this House the current position with regard to the proposed building project for St. Angela&rsquo;s school, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hill, Cork city.</P>
        <P>First, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places for typically rapidly developing areas, while a band four project provides desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories, which more specifically describes the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.</P>
        <P>St. Angela&rsquo;s school is an all girls post primary school with a current enrolment of 524 pupils.  Enrolments at the school have remained stable over the past five years.  The extension-refurbishment project proposed for the school is at the early stages of architectural planning.  Consistent with the approach I have outlined, the application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects and it has been assigned a band 2.1 rating.  This reflects the fact that there is a deficit of accommodation, which represents a substantial or significant proportion of the school&rsquo;s overall accommodation needs.  It also reflects the fact that an extensive refurbishment is needed.</P>
        <P>The Department requested the design team to complete a schedule of accommodation based on 500 pupils giving consideration to the following: using the existing school building and site <Col N="37"/>only; and using the existing school building and site and the St. Angela&rsquo;s Convent building and grounds.  The design team concluded that to provide accommodation for a 500-pupil school, the convent building and grounds will be needed.  The order is prepared to sell these to the Department to facilitate the expansion of the school on its current site.  The order is also prepared to cede the current school building and site to the Department.</P>
        <P>Owing to the level of demand on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to provide an indicative timeframe as to when the site and building purchase can be made.  As with all large-scale capital projects, the progression of this project from site acquisition and initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is &euro;581 million, which represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on the public finances, is a sign of the Government&rsquo;s real commitment to investing in school infrastructure and it will permit the continuation of the enormous progress made under the last national development plan when more than 7,800 school building projects were completed.  The Government is looking forward to building on this progress with an unprecedented allocation of &euro;4.5 billion under the current national development plan.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Buttimer again for raising this matter and assure him that progress on the proposed project for St. Angela&rsquo;s will be made commensurate with the priority attaching to it and as soon as the requisite funding is available.  As I am anxious to get to the D&aacute;il in time for the division, I will talk to the Senator subsequently if he has supplementary questions.</P>

	<P>I value the opportunity to raise this issue in the House.  I declare an interest in that I am an airline passenger at times.

I raise this evening the need for the Minister for Transport to outline the position regarding the ability to carry liquids purchased in airport shops on flights as hand luggage when travel involves more than one flight and whether there is a single rule worldwide.</P>
        <P>I accept that bringing liquids on board represented a terrorism threat following the events of 11 September 2001.  I ask whether this is being tightened or loosened internationally at this point.  Whichever we intend doing, in the interest of people who use airlines, we need clarity on what can and cannot be done.  I will give two examples.  I was in New Zealand two years ago and on my way back I was planning to buy some make-up, which was liquid.  I asked the woman in the New Zealand duty-free shop whether it would be taken from me during a two-hour stopover in America.  She could not confirm whether that would happen, but stated that her guess was that it would be taken from me.  I did not buy it and I observed when we reached America that nobody had anything confiscated.  It was a pity I had not bought it.</P>
        <P>When returning from Cape Verde via Lisbon recently, I purchased goods from the duty-free shop.  I had been told on many occasions that there would be no problem provided the package was sealed at the duty-free shop with the receipt attached by staple.  As my onward flight was with a different airline I was required to leave and subsequently return to the security-controlled area in Lisbon.  When I went back in to that area I was told I could not carry a container of liquids greater than 100 ml even though it was in a sealed duty-free shop bag with the receipt attached.  When I questioned it further I was told I could go back and check it in as hold luggage, but I could not take it as hand luggage as this was not a secure state under the <Col N="38"/>Schengen Agreement.  Does the average tourist need to be an expert in law and know what countries are covered by that agreement and whether the rules for those countries are the same everywhere?  I return to my simple example of travel to Australia or New Zealand involving transiting through another country.</P>
        <P>There must be clarity surrounding the procedure into the future regarding the carrying of liquids, be they alcohol, perfume or make-up.  I accept that may be where we are going.  It is not good enough that a customs officer can decide that he or she will take products from people after they have been paid for.  The officers may suggest challenging the airport that sold the products or indicate that persons should have looked on a website to discover if they were eligible to transit products through.</P>
        <P>I do not expect the Minister of State tonight to be able to say Ireland will solve all this.  If there is not already a clear procedure, there should be a concerted effort at European and worldwide level to clarify procedures.  That would ensure the airlines are operating from the same concepts, principles and criteria.  As many now book their flight on the Internet, there should be encouragement for different airlines to put information in place as to what is allowed in this respect.</P>
        <P>If a transit passenger carries a boarding pass and thinks that after going through security in New Zealand he or she is through security in America, that person should know if he or she is allowed to buy duty free products in New Zealand or elsewhere.  At the moment, whether a person is a transit passenger within the system or, as in my second example, a transit passenger without a boarding pass who must go out and come back through the security system, there should be no difference to the passenger just because no agreement exists between the airlines.  Criteria may indicate the duty free product should be maintained in a sealed bag with a receipt and has clearly not been tampered with but the third criteria of whether the country is within the Schengen Agreement seems to be another issue to grapple with.</P>
        <P>I ask that a single policy be implemented across the world.  I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to give me that commitment but we should move towards it.  It might not be a significant issue for any individual but it annoys people when they spend money but are not able to take the products home.  Clarity would yield great results.  I do not believe people intend to be terrorists when they go away on holidays or a business trip and try to take make-up or perfume home.  It is not a personal issue but an example of what can happen with the level of travel worldwide.</P>

	<P>I understand Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s desire for clarity and a single worldwide policy but I am not sure my reply will help in that respect.</P>
        <P>In August 2006 the UK authorities raised the levels of security at UK airports following intelligence reports suggesting an imminent terrorist attack involving the use of liquid explosives to blow up aircraft.  Subsequently the European Commission held a number of meetings to examine options for additional aviation security measures to deter such a threat and concluded that it was necessary to restrict the carriage of liquids and gels.  The EU adopted security rules for passengers and their hand luggage, which came into force in November 2006 at all airports in the European Union.  The rules restrict the amount of liquids and gels that passengers can take through security screening checkpoints.  They apply to all passengers departing from airports in the EU whatever their destination.</P>
<Col N="39"/>
        <P>Only very small quantities of liquids and gels may be brought through passenger screening points at EU airports.  Exemptions exist for larger quantities in respect of medicines, special diet products and baby foods if essential for use during the trip.  These rules mean that at security screening checkpoints, passengers and their hand luggage must be checked for liquids and gels in addition to existing prohibited articles.</P>
        <P>Exemptions may be granted for passengers if the liquids are obtained at another community airport on condition that the liquid is packed in a bag that is both tamper evident and displays satisfactory proof of purchase at airside at that airport on that day.  This exemption permits a passenger to take duty-free liquids bought after the screening point and carry as hand luggage on an additional flight, including a return trip, provided the items are still in the sealed bags, untouched, together with proof of purchase; the additional journey is still the same day; and a screener is satisfied that the purchase was made airside at another EU airport.</P>
        <P>A review of the application of the regulation showed that the restrictions on liquids carried by passengers arriving on flights from countries outside the EU and transferring at EU airports created certain operational difficulties at these airports and caused inconvenience to the passengers concerned.  To address these concerns, discussions have taken place between the EU and other countries to provide for similar exemptions for liquids in tamper evident bags purchased in non-EU airports.</P>
        <P>To date, exemptions have been made for Singapore Airport and airports in Croatia following agreements reached with those countries and confirmation that similar security standards applied at their airports.  This allows a person travelling from Singapore to purchase duty-free at that airport and transfer at Heathrow for a flight to Dublin without the liquid being confiscated at the screening point in Heathrow.  An agreement between the US and the EC, which would provide for a similar exemption for flights between EU and US airports, is expected to be agreed before the end of the year.  Discussions are ongoing with other third countries for the application of similar exemptions.</P>
        <P>The threat from liquid explosives and, in particular, the current limitations on the ability to detect them has been recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.  The European Commission and member states are working hard with ICAO and its contracting states to find solutions so as to enable liquids to be carried freely again.  In this context, Ireland has always supported a proportionate response to the threat of liquid explosives and will continue to do so in discussions at international fora.</P>
        <P>The restrictions on the carriage of liquids will continue as long as this threat exists and until the necessary technology is put in place to detect explosives in liquids.  Discussions are ongoing at EU level and with industry to develop technological solutions to this problem, and this would involve the installation of new screening technology at all airports to scan liquids.  While this is likely to take some time, Ireland will continue to support the objective of removing constraints on passengers taking liquids on board aircraft.</P>
        <P>I can only seek extra clarification in regard to the particular journeys spoken about by the Senator.  I thank Senator Keaveney for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  Often people travel during the night and once they get to the second airport, there is a problem when they thought the procedure was clear.  Clarity within Europe is important in that a product must be in a sealed bag and there must be a receipt.  The difficulty is when people travel outside Europe and do not know that the same rules are not applicable.</P>
<Col N="40"/>
        <P>Until such time as the exemptions are removed, there should be some effort by the Department of Transport to get the information to travellers.  One of the best possible ways is through the Internet, as people can get it when booking flights, or through travel agents.  There should be a line stating that if a traveller is going to a certain destination, he or she will not be able to transport liquids.  When one gets to the airport, it seems nobody can tell for sure and it is a lottery as to whether a person will be successful in getting products through.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which was more helpful than he realises.  He is now more aware of what I was asking about.  Perhaps he will come back on a future date with some more information on the airports we will have agreements with in future.  I am concerned with the information issued to potential customers.</P>
