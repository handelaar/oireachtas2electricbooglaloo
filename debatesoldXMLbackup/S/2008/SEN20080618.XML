      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Thornton Hall prison development, which is back from committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of the Business; No. 2, motion re Planning and Development Regulations 2008, for referral to committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; No. 4, Broadcasting Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage (Resumed), to be taken not earlier than 12.45 p.m., to adjourn not later than 3 p.m. and to resume at the conclusion of No. 5, if not previously concluded; No. 5; statements on older persons; and No. 27, Private Members&rsquo; business, motion re the national drugs strategy, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>Regarding No. 5, it is proposed to postpone these statements until tomorrow morning and, instead, to have statements on the Lisbon reform treaty, to be taken not earlier than 3.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 5.30 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for five minutes and all other Members may speak for six minutes.  Senators may share time by agreement of the House.  The business of the House will be interrupted from 3 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Since this House last sat, the Irish people have exercised their most sovereign right by voting in a referendum.  In doing so, they have rejected the Lisbon treaty.  We will discuss this in detail later today and there will be much analysis of the reasons for that rejection.  However, I take this opportunity to state that we must respect the decision of the people.  The vast majority of Members of this and the other House saw the Lisbon treaty proposals as offering great advantages for the State and, therefore, set out to support the Government in securing a positive outcome for the referendum.  We did so because we recognised the positive future the Lisbon treaty proposals would create.</P>
        <P>For a variety of reasons, however, the people were not persuaded to take the same view as that of the vast majority of Oireachtas Members.  We will not have time to do so comprehensively today but we need to analyse the variety of reasons that people rejected the treaty.  We must take seriously the concerns that have been expressed.  In the last few days of canvassing, I was struck by the significant concerns expressed by women in regard to the defence issues and their fears regarding conscription.  I was surprised that people were so concerned by this.  It signified an underlying anxiety about the direction in which the European Union is moving.  We in the Oireachtas may have debated the issues adequately but as far as the public is concerned, there was insufficient debate to allow them confidently to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  That is a shame.</P>
        <P>My concern now is that we may see the development of a two-tier Union.  Ireland should be at the centre of Europe.  We will watch with interest the ongoing reaction from our European partners to this vote and the Government&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the complex issues involved.  This issue comes at a critical time.  We have always seen our economic future within Europe and we all recognise the advantages the EU has given us.  We are facing an extraordinarily serious economic situation, with the collapse of public private partnerships, a stagnant housing market and the highest ever increase in unemployment.  Despite claims to the contrary, my colleagues will all agree that we are seeing cutbacks to front-line services.  There are cutbacks in home care packages, a lack of contract beds and no speech therapy services in many areas, while area medical officers are not being appointed so no assessments can be made, for example, for domiciliary care allowance and in many parts of Dublin general practitioner services are not available due to the shortage of general practitioners.  We need an economic plan and a solution to the Lisbon treaty issue.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned that whenever Members on this side of the House have highlighted the economic crisis in recent months the reaction on the Government side of the House has been close to a state of denial.  I call on the Taoiseach to come to this House when he returns from his meetings this week and outline his assessment of the economic situation facing the country <Col N="165"/>and his economic plan to deal with the financial crisis we are in at present.  That is a priority for this House.  I hope the Leader will invite the Taoiseach to the House next week for that purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a number of issues but before doing so I seek a ruling from the Chair with regard to No. 1 on the Order of Business, relating to Thornton Hall.  I have a close personal interest in this matter but I am not raising it as a personal issue and I am not seeking an amendment to the Order of Business.  However, this is different from almost any order the House has dealt with previously.  The House is acting <i>in loco</i> for An Bord Plean&aacute;la under section 26 of the Act.  My concern is that we are not being seen to exercise discretion when we propose to take this matter without debate.</P>
        <P>I have spoken on this issue both in this House and in the justice committee so I am not seeking a debate for my sake.  However, I am anxious to get a clear ruling on this.  My view is that it is dangerous to take this matter without debate lest any Member wishes to say something about it.  A number of cases have been lost in the High Court recently where similar decisions were taken by bodies which were not able to point to where they exercised discretion or formed a judgment.  I believe this is an important issue.  I am not proposing an amendment to the Order of Business but I am anxious to have it on the record that I raised this matter because I believe it leaves it open to challenge.</P>
        <P>I support the points made by Senator Fitzgerald about the Order of Business.  It is important to acknowledge that the Irish people have taken a democratic decision, and it behoves us to accept that decision.  It is unacceptable to hear people such as President Sarkozy proclaim himself bemused by our decision.  I did not like the decision and, indeed, opposed it but that decision has now been taken.  President Sarkozy might be better employed finding out why we have spent the last two years trying to clean up the difficulties created by his country taking a democratic decision.  It is no different, much as I dislike it.</P>
        <P>On the other hand while we must accept democracy, if I had given up on an issue every time a vote on it was lost, I would have stopped talking about 30 years ago.  The people who won the referendum should be aware that winning a vote does not mean one is right.  I cheered when democracy gave us Robert Mugabe but found out some years later that I was wrong.  It was the same democracy that gave us George Bush and, indeed, Adolf Hitler.  In fact, it was democracy when Barabbas was chosen and a finer man was left to swing.  The fact that it is a democratic decision does not mean it is the right decision.  We must accept the decision but we must also proceed on that basis.</P>
        <P>It is a clear decision and I accept the point that we must work our way through it and examine the reasons that people voted against the treaty.  Somebody will have to explain to the people in Roscommon that even though they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, they will not get their hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People must explain these matters to the electorate.  That is the reality.  We now need to examine how we will take the matter forward.  We will discuss it this afternoon and I will put forward my views on how to proceed, what issues must be sorted out and what our agenda on Europe should be in the future.  We must work our way through it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue raised by Senator Fitzgerald is crucial.  It would be an absolute disaster if the debate on the Lisbon treaty were to overshadow the extraordinary economic difficulties we are facing at present.  I ask the Leader to allocate a full day as soon as possible to discuss the economy.  The issues concern not only cutbacks but all aspects of the economy.  I would like if the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach were to come into the House and tell us how bad or <Col N="166"/>how good is the situation and outline what course of action can be taken.  Let us hear it and let us make decisions, particularly for those of us who are neither in Government nor members of the Opposition.  We want to be in a position where we have all the information and can recognise and evaluate proposals and decisions.  That is crucially important.  I call for a debate on the economy as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a matter of discretion or opinion as to whether the view of the Irish people should be respected or accepted, it is a constitutional imperative that it be so.  I regard it as almost something that goes without saying, but I will say it just in case there is any doubt.  Of course, one must respect and accept the result of the referendum last week.  If it requires to be said, I am happy to do so.  The fact is, and my colleagues have touched on this, it does not end there because there is no question that the Lisbon treaty is finished and is dead in the eyes of the Irish people.  The treaty that was put to them last week is dead, but by voting as we did we have not necessarily rendered it dead in the eyes of our European partners.  </P>
        <P>While we cannot ratify it, that does not mean that our decision does not have implications and consequences throughout Europe and with our partners in Europe.  We can feel good about the fact that the treaty is finished and is dead in our eyes but we cannot make it finished and dead in the eyes of others.  These are the consequences we and the Government, in particular, have to face.  I do not underestimate the task and the seriousness and the depth of the challenge that faces the Government in the context of the economic challenges to which Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole have referred.</P>
        <P>I am glad we have ordered an initial debate this afternoon on this issue.  I support that call.  Sometimes eyes glaze over when this point is made but it is important to make it at this juncture.  What is the nature of the debate we need to have?  It cannot be just a squabble over who did what when, where there were posters and where there were none, who was out on the street and who was not.  By all means, let us have that debate if people feel it is necessary but a much more fundamental debate is needed which has to do with the question of trust in democratic institutions and trust in the very practice of politics in this country.  By that I do not mean I am frustrated that the people would not do what the politicians suggested they do.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca made the point in the newspapers at some stage during the campaign that it must be asked why, in such serious issues, we should expect people to handle a complex issue presented to them for decision four weeks before a referendum, in circumstances where we do not have a real continuing debate about these issues.  We have such debates here but we do not have them in the community.  That is the level at which the debate has to be had.  The question of trust and the question of democratic institutions are all bound up in the result last week.  Some of the innovations contained in the Broadcasting Bill might assist in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There should be a public forum on television and in other areas of the media where people can have an opportunity to tease out these issues in great detail rather than simply presenting them with a complex document a few weeks before the referendum.  As Senator Fitzgerald and others have said it will be difficult, although necessary, to analyse the reasons people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  In many cases they are directly contradictory.  There are people who thought the charter of fundamental rights did not go far enough and there are those who thought we should not have it.  There are directly conflicting views.</P>
        <P>It is all very well for people to come forward with a wish list, whether it is Sinn F&eacute;in, Libertas or anybody else.  I have a wish list.  We can all have one.  The question is whether we can deliver it.  By all means, let us have a debate about the aftermath but let us have a more fundamental debate about what it means and how we can improve the quality of our public discourse on issues such as this.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="167"/>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to start by commenting on the vote last week of the Irish public in regard to the Lisbon treaty.  This is the first opportunity the House has had to discuss the outcome of that vote.  We are in a situation we did not predict.  There was a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to the Lisbon treaty and it is a difficult position for Ireland to be in.  I wish the Taoiseach good luck tomorrow when he attends the summit in Brussels because he is in a difficult position.  I agree with the approach he has taken to date, which is that there are no quick fixes, that we have to be measured, take our time and remain calm and look to protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests but also to negotiate with our European partners, see what their view of the situation is and how we can all move together.  It is a complex situation.</P>
        <P>It was disturbing to see in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning the result of a European Commission telephone poll, which indicated that 40% of the people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; said they did so because they did not understand the treaty.  That goes back to the point raised by Senator Alex White that we must do a better job of communicating Europe on an ongoing basis to the people of this country and other member states because it is not fair to expect them to be able to digest complex legal treaties in the space of a couple of weeks and to make an informed decision on them.</P>
        <P>We should avoid political recriminations even though people are looking for someone to blame.  I was amused to see this morning that Commissioner Peter Mandelson was finding fault with the Government.  The same charge could equally be levied at him, as he was a target for a lot of criticism in the Irish campaign.  We should avoid that kind of political recrimination.  What we have to look for now are constructive ways forward.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to address the House on how he envisages we can move forward.  He has been to the Council of Ministers meeting yesterday and has had an opportunity to take the temperature and to identify how the ministers of the other member states are feeling.</P>
        <P>The issue is not just about the Lisbon treaty.  The same problems have emerged previously.  I have been involved in the campaign on the Amsterdam treaty, the Nice treaty and recently the Lisbon treaty and there is a serious issue about the support of the citizens of Europe for the project.  People are not engaged in the way they should be.  Most European leaders are very honest in saying that if they had put the treaty to the public in the various member states, very few of them could have guaranteed that they would have had a level of support that would have carried the treaty.  We need to accept that and ask what can be done to address the democratic deficit.  We also need to look creatively at how we can do that because if we manage to somehow salvage the treaty and not address that fundamental issue we will face further difficulties in the future and that is not in any of our interests.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the recommendations of the commission set up to review constituency boundaries.  The results have been positive.  The remit that was given to the commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take that on board.  Colleagues have already mentioned the Lisbon treaty and like many others I voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in spite of the Government campaign rather than because of it.  In a debate in this House before the treaty referendum took place I made the point to the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs that the Government campaign had been badly run and that in particular there was an absence of women&rsquo;s voices on the part of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  As people on the Government side have pointed out, there are three women Ministers in Cabinet.  Three out of 15 is just 20% but far less than 20% of the Ministers speaking on the Lisbon treaty were female.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>They could not get it right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.  It shows a lot of problems with the way in which the campaign was run.  It also confirms the need to reiterate a call I made previously on the Leader for a debate on women&rsquo;s representation in politics.  That is an important point and it was shown up by the treaty result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader consider an amendment to the Order of Business to allow us to take the motion on Thornton Hall with debate?  As my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, has said, this is a very important issue on which this and the other House is being asked to sit as a sort of planning authority to make a decision as to whether this enormous super-prison structure will go ahead.  It is very important for us to have such a debate in this House.  We have had some debate before and I have certainly spoken about the matter here and in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  However, other colleagues should have the opportunity to speak on the matter.  A guillotined debate took place in the other House last night.  It would be a travesty to ask us to pass the motion without debate given its importance not only for the local community but also for our criminal justice policy generally.  I call for an amendment to the Order of Business to enable us to debate the matter today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome of the decision of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to proceed with a number of consultations on the Green Paper on local government reform.  This is a very innovative measure.  While I know we are running out of time in this session, certainly after summer when the consultations have been completed it would be opportune to indulge in a meaningful debate on local government, especially as it affects town local government.  Many in this Chamber will realise that many towns that were previously villages have grown to be far larger than they used to be and therefore it would be meritorious for them to have a town council to give the people of those population centres a voice.</P>
        <P>On a related matter I am very pleased to inform the Seanad that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, addressed this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give his proposals on the compilation of the elec<Col N="169"/>toral register.  He has warmly welcomed the report of the Oireachtas joint committee.  That is a welcome development which I hope will resolve many of the difficulties we all know exist at election time.  After elections we all complain about the deficiencies in the electoral register.  Let us hope that will become a thing of the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will debate the matter this afternoon.  Those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, including Libertas and Sinn F&eacute;in have argued for a renegotiation.  The logic of a renegotiation is that what is renegotiated must be ratified either by the Oireachtas or by the people in a referendum.  The logic of their case for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this referendum is that another referendum will take place on the Lisbon treaty with guarantees or whatever opt-outs might be negotiated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have a debate on the matter later today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The limited scope for renegotiation is illustrated today with the British Parliament proceeding with ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  We are in a very difficult situation.  While we in Ireland may say the treaty is dead, the reality is that the rest of Europe does not believe so.  However, I will continue my comments in this afternoon&rsquo;s debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader of the House for arranging a debate on the outcome of the Lisbon reform treaty referendum so speedily.  When we applied for membership of the then European Economic Community back in the 1960s we were rebuffed on at least one occasion.  The French refused to accept Britain and Ireland at that time.  However, that did not stop us from going back and applying again.  We were eventually accepted and have become leading members of the European Union.  A democratic decision was taken last Thursday by a tight margin.  There is, however, nothing in the Constitution to prevent a question being put to the people twice.  It happened in the divorce referendum when people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; initially and &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when the question was put again.  It was easier to put the &ldquo;No&rdquo; point of view in the first campaign and to defeat that proposal at <Col N="170"/>that time because I was on that side of the campaign.  The Nice treaty was rejected in the first referendum and then accepted.  We should have very careful consideration.  Time is on our side.  Most of the provisions of the Lisbon reform treaty do not come into place until well into the future.</P>
        <P>People did not get the full picture.  The fact that the treaty document was not circulated to every home was damaging to the campaign because people wondered what there was to hide.  Whether it was read or not does not matter.  People must have the document.  They were voting on the reform treaty and surely they needed a copy.  There is no point asking people to go to a library, post office or Garda station.  The people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side said they had the treaty and would provide copies.  These are the lessons that must be learned.</P>
        <P>I was not impressed by the Referendum Commission&rsquo;s advertising campaign showing photographs of half bodies with the slogan &ldquo;Get the full story&rdquo;.  This implied people did not have the full story and something was being hidden.  The advertising agency which prepared those advertisements should be reviewed as to whether it will be appointed in the next campaign.  We will have that debate later.</P>
        <P>As former Deputy Frank Cluskey said when people asked him how he lost his seat, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get enough votes&rdquo;.  We did not get enough votes last Thursday and hopefully we will have another opportunity in the next 12 or 18 months to put this case before the people and decide when we get full and careful clarification and consideration on all the issues raised.  It is a shame the Charter of Fundamental Rights was so misrepresented that it would allow the introduction of abortion, which is totally prohibited under section 40 of the Constitution.  It was a shameful exercise by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners.  So be it.  We fought it out, the game is over for now but let us have a rematch.</P>

	<P>What are the Leader&rsquo;s intentions on the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill scheduled for tomorrow?  Does he intend to proceed with that in the morning bearing in mind that he has moved the Broadcasting Bill to tomorrow?  I agree with Senator de B&uacute;rca regarding the publication of the local election boundary provisions.  I, too, believe three-seat constituencies are not the way forward.  It is good news to see constituencies with a higher number of seats.  However, I ask Senator de B&uacute;rca to impress on her leader the need to reform other three-seat constituencies, such as in this House.  It is time we saw some movement on Seanad reform.  Could she bring that to her leader and see if we can have something on it in the next few months?</P>
        <P>There will be much analysis of last weeks&rsquo; referendum result.  I picked up on the low turnout, just over 50%, although we had one of the most intensive and divisive campaigns in living memory.  There was a very low turnout.  It reminded me of the fact that three years ago the Taoiseach established a task force on active citizenship.  It reported two years ago and one of its recommendations was to try to increase turnout up to 80%.  We have heard nothing on these recommendations from the active citizenship report in the last two years.  It contained some very good ideas and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to tell us what he will do about implementing those recommendations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In this time of sharp economic downturn I agree with the comments of my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald.  There is great shock on the wide price gulf between North and South.  I refer to basic foodstuffs, for which the supermarket giants charge double in the South.  All our National Consumer Agency says to the people is &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; while it conducts surveys.  I wonder if it is a toothless wonder.  The euro has gained in value and there are other factors in our favour, yet nothing has been passed on for consumers in the South.  In our <Col N="171"/>part of the country we seem to have price matching rather than price reduction.  Much of the blame can be laid at the Government&rsquo;s door because of the removal of the groceries order.  We have no price control.  There is a strong argument for its reintroduction, perhaps in modified form, to protect the weaker sections of our community and to protect all those on low wages who will be affected more because of the recession we are in.  These are the people we should move to protect.  I would like the Leader at an early juncture to arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House for a debate.  I would like to hear in a concrete way what the National Consumer Agency is doing about this.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  What all Senators seem to be saying is that winning the vote does not guarantee ultimate success.  Of course, we live in a changing society and the arguments are already shifting.  In line with all other speakers, I believe the analysis of the consequences are hugely important for us.</P>
        <P>On another issue to which I referred some weeks ago, will the Leader provide for a debate on the local electoral area changes announced yesterday, perhaps in conjunction with the constituency boundary changes?  We still do not have that Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome that this House has responded so immediately to the situation after the referendum on the Lisbon treaty and I congratulate the Leader on taking this action.  I had actually submitted a Standing Order 30 motion that this was a matter of urgent national importance but I have withdrawn it in light of this welcome move.</P>
        <P>We are in a remarkable situation.  I, for the first time, voted and spoke against the treaty.  I did so because of the insulting way in which people like Mr. Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing made it clear that the treaty and its language were deliberately obfuscated to sell a pup to an ignorant Irish electorate who would do what they were told by their electoral masters.  That is a rough translation of what he said.  Then, there was the performance of our own leaders, which was regrettable, saying they had not read the treaty and that one would be foolish to try.  At least Senator Regan read the treaty.  I think he brought it in every day and gave us a lecture about it, but at least he stuck to his guns and he appeared to know what he was talking about.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to a two-speed Europe possibly developing.  The two-speed Europe is already here.  There is the speed at which the megalocrats in Europe want to drive the institutions and the speed which the general population of Europe want &mdash; the Irish people are by no means alone in this.</P>

        <P>If there is egg on faces, the massive quantity of it should land on the people in Brussels who attempted to bully and hector, and who said we would be punished economically and would be the first victims financially.  There were even people saying we should give back what we got.  We got nothing to which we were not fully and legally entitled; of that there is no question.  We also gave a hell of a lot.  We gave our best expertise and the brains that helped to drive the Community.  At the top of the Community, one will find Irish people giving loyal service.  The Irish people are loyal to Europe but when they are treated like fools, when they are treated with contempt, when they are treated with a lack of respect for democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sick of asking questions in this House.  I asked a series of very detailed questions about the military aspects of the treaty &mdash; that was why I voted against it &mdash; <Col N="172"/>including the European Defence Agency, coyly renamed from the Western European Armaments Group, and the redefinition of the Petersberg tasks to include intervention in a third country because of a threat of terrorism, which is what got the United States into Iraq.  That is why I am worried.</P>
        <P>I am moving an amendment to the Order of Business today because of my concerns.  I want No. 27, motion 15, concerning rendition, to be taken today.  It shows how we are already compromised by this Government.  As we speak, aeroplane No. N54PA is on the tarmac at Shannon Airport.  Commandant Ed Horgan, who was on the platform with me as the voice of the people against Lisbon for this military reason, is detained at Shannon Airport.  He is not allowed to leave the airport.  He has requested the Garda to search that aeroplane which was in Guantanamo on 3 June this year.  Attempts are being made to remove the camera which he legally possesses and destroy the film.  For that reason, and because I got no answers to any of these questions about the increasing militarisation of Europe, I am moving an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I second Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  I also have spoken on the issue of Thornton Hall and consider it regrettable that it is proposed to develop a mental hospital beside the prison.  I am glad to see the Roman Catholic bishops came out strongly on this issue.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader request the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with responsibility for integration policy, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to explain to the House the situation that has arisen in respect of Integrate Ireland Language and Training Limited?  This is a non-profit campus company of Trinity College which was established in co-operation with the Government to provide language skill courses to newly arrived refugees, asylum seekers and programme people.  It employed 40 full-time staff and trained teachers.  It has developed a programme and a website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a scandal.  Its headquarters at the old veterinary college were sold and it was told it was to move to Greendale community school.  It has now been told, however, that it is being axed and the Department of Education and Science has put out a press statement that misleadingly suggests it is going voluntarily.  This is wrong.  We must have an explanation why these 40 teachers are being let go and why newly arrived programme refugees from Burma and Sudan are being left swinging in the air, so to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in asking the Leader to arrange a debate on the economy as a matter of urgency.  He has been living in denial for the past 12 months.  Inflation has increased to 4.7%, VAT on retail sales is down by 8% and, as Senator Coghlan rightly noted, consumers are suffering.  These consumers are the people of Ireland, the men and women who go about their daily business, but they have gained no refuge from this Government.</P>
        <P>Twelve months ago, the Green Party sailed into Government promising the sun, moon and stars.  The only thing they have done is turn the Celtic tiger into a Celtic snail.  I hope Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca will take heart in that.</P>

        <P>I welcome the commission&rsquo;s report on constituency boundaries but, unlike Senator de B&uacute;rca, I have a fundamental difficulty with the way it proceeded with its business in regard to Cork city and county.  It is wrong that a two-tier Cork city has been created because of the way seats have been allocated.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leader for allowing us time to reflect on the Lisbon treaty.  It is especially appropriate in this House, where the issues were not properly debated before the referendum.  We will be debating in somewhat of a vacuum because there is no plan B or C.  There is simply no plan.</P>

	<P>They had no plan on what to do if this occurred.  It may be a disaster for the political parties who advocated it but it is not a disaster for those who voted for it.  I am somewhat tired and I do not indulge in any triumphalism because it is a difficult situation for everybody but I do not think we should say we respect the decision of the Irish people and then say they were wrong and will be bypassed.  We should say that we accept, not respect, what the Irish people have said.  We have to deal with the situation into which we have been thrust.  We should not speak about people being able to make an informed decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have a debate on the matter this afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to conclude.</P>
        <P>People made a perfectly informed decision.  It was just as well informed as that of Members.  It is patronising to suggest that the people made their decision because they were ignorant of what was happening.  Those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; did so for different reasons.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  There were legitimate, good reasons on both sides.  Those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; did so for myriad reasons, as did those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>During this afternoon&rsquo;s debate we should accept what happened and focus on what Senator Regan said.  I agree with him in respect of this matter.  The treaty is going to be renegotiated because it can be improved and made acceptable.  We should indicate that one of the ways we can extricate ourselves from this matter is by presenting to the people a treaty which is acceptable to them.  I have no difficulty with a second referendum being held, provided it is not conducted in the same manner and with the same direction and as long as tax guarantees to corporates, which are not contained in the treaty as it stands, are provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding what Senator Ross stated, it is my observation that members of the public are fed up of and cynical about our being obliged to put referenda to them on a second occasion.  If there is one lesson we need to learn it is that the Government must get matters right on the first occasion.  On many occasions prior to the referendum, I reported to the House the findings of a survey I carried out on the streets of Galway.  When carrying out that survey, I discovered that nine out of ten people were of the view that the treaty was not explained properly.</P>
        <P>I have been educated in recent days.  I met young people at Irish college and students and their teachers.  One 12 year old with whom I spoke presented me with a note in which he stated that the outcome of the referendum was that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side won and that when the campaign started the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, told the people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, while the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side told them about the contents of the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I apologise.  However, I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to bear with me.  The boy in question included on the note a drawing of the Taoiseach stating &ldquo;Vote yes right now!&rdquo; and of those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side stating &ldquo;How the Lisbon treaty works<?oasys _jy ?>is . . . &rdquo;.  The children to whom I spoke were incredibly engaged by the treaty and they basically stated that those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side did not explain the treaty.</P>

	<P>I call on the Minister for Finance to urgently consider ways to reduce the cost of doing business in this country.  In that context, I refer, in particular, to the rising price of diesel and how this is impacting on business.  I call on the Green Party to consider this matter.  We must examine ways to reduce the excise duty on diesel in order that we might get the country moving again.  I spoke to wholesalers of diesel in Galway who indicated that their output has decreased by 10%, even though the cost of diesel is rising, because business is falling off.  The Government takes in more than &euro;1 billion each year in excise duty.</P>

	<P>I am glad a debate on the Lisbon treaty is being held later today.  Prior to the referendum, the House engaged in quite a lengthy debate, over approximately six or seven weeks, on the treaty.  It would be worthwhile focusing today&rsquo;s debate on what is needed following the rejection of the Lisbon treaty by the people of this State.</P>
        <P>It should be stated that the Lisbon treaty is dead.  I hope a new treaty will emerge that deals with the loss of power, issues of neutrality, public services and worker rights.  If it deals with those issues positively, it would be a treaty I could recommend to the Irish people.</P>
        <P>The idea, even at this early stage, of talking about a Lisbon II is just not good enough.  The idea that we will accept the rights of the people and at the same time scare them into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I caution elected Members on this as I understand most were on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side of the campaign.  We should not try to scare the Irish people into thinking they made the wrong decision.  Thank God our Constitution makes the people sovereign rather than the politicians here.  The Irish people were to decide the outcome of this question, they have done so and we must accept that.  On our part, we want to work with the Government to try to negotiate a better deal.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the economy?  There is no doubt we need a full-day debate on the matter as the number of people losing their jobs on a week by week basis is alarming.  There is much fear out there and there is to be another increase in mortgage interest rates.  People are concerned about the rise in inflation, ESB bills and other aspects that put them under pressure.  We must have that debate.</P>
        <P>In my county we have lost 2,000 jobs in the past year.  Donegal has the highest unemployment levels at this time but the problem is not unique to Donegal.  It is happening right across the State.  I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to the Chamber for a debate on her plan for dealing with the current position.</P>
        <P>As we were informed earlier, there is only a certain number of sitting days left in this term before the summer recess.  Is it proposed that the Seanad will sit the first week in July?  I note the Labour Party has put forward, by means of Private Members&rsquo; business in the D&aacute;il, a proposal, which Sinn F&eacute;in supports, to increase the number of sitting days.  The Seanad should sit through the summer regardless of what the D&aacute;il does &mdash; we are an independent Chamber &mdash; to deal with some of the issues we want debated on the economy.</P>
        <P>This year may be the first that we have not had a debate on the Irish language or on the North.  Will those debates be facilitated before the end of the term?</P>

	<P>In advance of a meeting with the HSE on Friday in Athlone, will the Leader investigate through the Department of Health and Children home care packages in the midlands area?  There have been serious cutbacks in this area as is evident by the number of people who have contacted me, in particular a 58-year-old man who suffered a brain injury who is taking up a very expensive rehab bed in Mullingar.  The service costs between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000 per week.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm continues to talk about saving money for the HSE but only ten hours of an assistance package can be provided for the man in question to go home.  That leaves five hours lacking.  Health professionals have contacted me to try to secure the extra five hours.  The budget of the Carers&rsquo; Association has been cut by &euro;40,000 and new applications are not being opened.  I want the Department of Health and Children to provide answers in regard to home care packages in the midlands before we attend that meeting on Friday afternoon.</P><Col N="176"/>
        <P>I asked about the case of another man approximately four weeks ago who also suffered from a brain injury.  He is at home with no back-up facilities.</P>

	<P>I welcome that we will have a debate on the Lisbon treaty.  I note a comment in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning suggests the Government strategy appears to be to buy time until the real attitudes of other member states become clear while allowing the Irish public to note that other states are continuing to ratify the treaty.  If this is an accurate report of the state of affairs it is to be regretted because, as my colleague Senator Ross said, listening to the people is not simply a matter of saying one respects their opinion and then seek to undermine it at the first opportunity.  </P>
        <P>The rejection of the Lisbon treaty last Thursday presents us with a long-awaited opportunity to reflect in a serious way on what Ireland wants the European Union to be in 50 years and where Ireland will be in it.</P>

	<P>However, it seems the Irish people have voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to cultural uniformity.  I ask the Government to take the time to listen carefully to people and be open to representing their precise will in negotiations with our European partners.  I ask that the Government does not, in any way, behave apologetically regarding the decision of the Irish people in those dealings.</P>

        <P>I am struck by some of the comments by some of the people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side of the argument.  Many of my friends and neighbours voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and each of them has given me a different reason for doing so.  I accept Senator Ross&rsquo;s point that those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; also did so for different reasons but the notion that the Government or anyone acting on our behalf can go to our European colleagues and get a new agreement that is acceptable to everyone <Col N="177"/>who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; is unrealistic.  I am appalled by the hypocrisy of some of those involved on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side who have opposed every treaty that has been put to the Irish people since we joined the European Union.</P>

	<P>They put forward the notion that they would support a better deal if one were negotiated when everyone knows they would not support any deal negotiated on the European Union.  There is an element, small though it may be, among those who opposed the Lisbon treaty that would wish us to leave the European Union.  Contrary to what these people say in their public statements they wish us to leave.  </P>

Can the Leader, at the earliest possible opportunity, arrange a debate on the boundary report for local elections that was published yesterday?  The local and European elections are less than a year away and I feel we should have a discussion on this matter as soon as possible &mdash; certainly before the summer recess.</P>

	<P>We have not had one since the new Taoiseach took office and a new array of Ministers are now in office dealing with economic matters.  I wish to place particular emphasis on price increases, as mentioned by Senator Coghlan, especially fuel costs.  In Government the Green Party is against reducing excise on fuel but this is regrettable.  The Government has capitalised  to an unfair degree on the increase in fuel costs in recent months and it would be opportune for consideration to be given to this.</P>

	<P>Before I respond I want to clarify that No. 4, Broadcasting Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage, is to resume not earlier than 11.45 a.m. and to adjourn not later than 3 p.m., if not previously concluded.  I said 12.45 p.m. earlier but meant to say 11.45 a.m.  In addition, with regard to the debate on the Lisbon treaty, I propose that spokespersons have seven minutes and all other Senators have five minutes, and Senators may share time.  That will take place from 3.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.</P><Col N="178"/>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, de B&uacute;rca, Bacik, Regan, Leyden, Coghlan, Norris, Buttimer, Healy Eames, Doherty, Mullen and John Paul Phelan all expressed their views on the Lisbon treaty referendum.  I agree that the views of the people and the decision of the electorate must be clearly respected and are sacrosanct as far as we, as democrats &mdash; people who are elected to high office in the D&aacute;il or Seanad on behalf of the people of Ireland &mdash; are concerned.  We must respect this.  However, I must also point out to the House that a 4% swing would have given a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  One would swear it was a landslide victory.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the 53% of the Irish population who came out to vote in the referendum, which was a very high proportion.  These people must be commended.  We all know that 10% of the electorate are not available to vote for one reason or another in any election.  There are also those less fortunate people who are sick in hospital, those on holidays and so on.  In view of this, 53% was a very high turnout.  A 4% swing would have given a decisive victory to the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  Those who are trying to blame the Taoiseach or anyone else should remember that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s county of Offaly overwhelmingly voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, whereas in Mayo, as Senator Healy Eames knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Experience is a wonderful asset in life.  Having listened to all the comments here this morning, my opinion is that the father of the House, Senator Ross, has given us the benefit of his enormous experience.  I agree with much of his contribution and I will listen attentively later to all the contributions on this very urgent matter.  I thank the leaders for their co-operation with regard to changing the Order of Business to allow me to arrange this debate.  I anticipated, as did my personal staff in my office, that this urgent matter would need to be taken on the floor of Seanad &Eacute;ireann before the Taoiseach departs for his very important meeting in Brussels tomorrow.  I wish him well on behalf of the people of Ireland in his serious and onerous task of letting Europe know that we still want to be part of the Union that has brought us into the 21st century and has given our future generations a major opportunity that many of us did not have when we were being reared in the Ireland of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave my word to the House that we would have this debate before the summer recess.  This is particularly needed now, as Senator John Paul Phelan correctly pointed out, since we have had changes in the Cabinet and a new Taoiseach.  As Senator <Col N="180"/>MacSharry reminded me, we had a full and lengthy debate on the economy in this session.  However, the challenges facing our country due to the global downturn mean the economic situation is changing by the month.  I certainly do not want the House to go into the summer recess without getting an update from Government on the present economic climate and the difficulties and challenges that will be faced in the six months before the next budget.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca, Hannigan, Coghlan, Glynn, Buttimer and John Paul Phelan called for a debate on the review of constituency boundaries for local elections.  There have been many changes in this area, and Senators from every county were yesterday contacted by anxious local authority members who were trying to find out what their fates and their political futures would be.  I previously represented a three-seat constituency in the north of Westmeath, which has now become a four-seat constituency.  It is certainly a change for us, but when it was previously a four-seat constituency we won three seats out of four, as Senator McFadden will recall.  It was no accident, because we did it back-to-back, which was a marvellous achievement.</P>

	<P>I look forward to playing my part in achieving this again in the next local election for the political party in the Midlands.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on women in politics.  I have no difficulty in arranging this and I applaud anyone who encourages women, and young women in particular, to get involved in public life.  It is a difficult life but it is rewarding to serve one&rsquo;s community.  Senator Glynn called for a debate on local government reform and on local town councils in particular.  I have no difficulty in allocating time for this.  This debate can also encompass the new approach of which the Minister informed the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government this morning.  I will leave aside time for this, but not before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan asked whether I intended to take the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill tomorrow.  As the Senator knows, this Bill must go through the D&aacute;il before it comes to the Seanad.  However, because of the debate on the Lisbon treaty referendum in the D&aacute;il today, which will take five hours, this may not happen.  With the permission of the leaders and spokespersons, I propose to leave this until next week.  Tomorrow&rsquo;s business will be statements on older people, which was to take place this afternoon but cannot now take place because of the debate on the Lisbon treaty referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The new treaty is the &ldquo;Lisburn treaty&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Lisbon.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan mentioned Seanad reform.  Many Senators opposite will not be interested in this, but the Seanad reform committee is having a meeting with the Minister at 4 p.m. today.  I assure the House that real Seanad reform will take place under my leadership.  We can update the Seanad on this, particularly as most leaders are represented on the committee.  I hope we will be able to take this a stage further this afternoon at our meeting with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Coghlan and Buttimer stated their serious concerns with regard to high prices in our department stores compared to prices in the UK.  They propose to call the new T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to the House to let their views be known.  The Senators also requested that the grocery order decision of the committee be reviewed during such a debate at which the Minister would be present.   I have no difficulty in setting aside time for such a debate.</P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>Senators Norris and Mullen proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I am not in a position to take the matter they propose today, even though I have always tried to facilitate Senators to the fullest extent possible.  In regard to statements on the Lisbon reform treaty to be taken today, Senator Norris has a matter on the Order in this regard.  I ask the Senators to reconsider their matter and we will consider it &mdash; without my making a commitment in that respect &mdash; at another time.  I ask the House to co-operate with us as far as possible because it is important we get through the business proposed for today if possible.</P>
        <P>On the matter Senator Norris raised regarding the appointment of a Minister with responsibility for integration, I will make inquiries and report back to him directly on this.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Doherty, I confirm that the House will sit during the second week of July because of pressure of business and the urgent matters and challenges facing us as legislators and facing the nation and Government.</P>

    <Title>Prison Building Programme: Motion (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Donie Cassidy on Thursday, 29 May 2008:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, noting:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, having considered the need for a new prison in the Dublin area, has decided to proceed with the development of a prison in the District Electoral Division of Kilsallaghan, in the County of Fingal;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has caused the documents specified in section 26(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 (No. 10 of 2007) relating to the development of a prison to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas together with a document containing the observations of that Minister on the environmental impact assessment and the report of the rapporteur;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the proposed development relates to the construction of a prison:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) located in the District Electoral Division of Kilsallaghan in the County of Fingal;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) for the purpose of accommodating not more than 2,200 prisoners;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) which development will consist of buildings of a floor area of approximately 140,000 square metres within a site of approximately 57 hectares;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) the site of which development will be bounded by a perimeter wall approximately 7 metres in height constructed behind the existing landscaped perimeter screen planting; and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) which development will consist of buildings with a height of 2 storeys other than the control centre which will have a height of 3 storeys;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the following alterations having been made by the Minister to the development in accordance with section 25 of the Prisons Act 2007 (No. 10 of 2007) in order to mitigate its visual and aural impact:</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P LI="3">(i) the erection of a 3 metre high timber fence on the outer boundary of the car park areas on the west side of the site (marked B on the map placed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Oireachtas Library on 14 May 2008), the re-design and adjustment of the car park, the lowering of the level of the car park at the boundary by approximately 1.5 metres and the imposition of a height limit for lighting fixtures in such car parks so that all the lighting fixtures shall be less than 3 metres in height off the ground;</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) the widening of planting areas at the places marked A on the map placed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Oireachtas Library on the 14 May 2008 by not less than 4 metres, the planting, where appropriate, of larger, mature trees and the relocating of the wall further from the boundary by a similar distance not to exceed 10 metres to accommodate the widened planted area;</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) the use of concrete, which has been treated or conditioned in such a manner as to make it visually less obtrusive, on the exterior security walls on the West and North of the development; and</P>
        <P LI="3">(iv) the development of a new access road;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that an environmental impact assessment was prepared with respect to the proposed development;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform invited submissions or observations relating to the development of the prison from members of the public:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) by means of advertisement placed:</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) in the following national publications on 29 February 2008:</P>
        <P LI="5">The Irish Times;</P>
        <P LI="5">The Irish Independent; and</P>
        <P LI="5">The Irish Examiner;</P>

        <P LI="5">the Fingal Independent for the week commencing 3 March 2008;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) by the erection of site notices at 5 locations on the perimeter of the site;</P>
        <P LI="3" Just="Left">(<i>c</i>) by issuing a newsletter (&lsquo;Thornton Hall Newsletter 2&rsquo;) on 3 March 2008 which was delivered by An Post to more than 1,000 houses in the locality;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) by causing an announcement of the proposed development to be published:</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) on the website of the Irish Prison Service; and</P><Col N="186"/>
        <P LI="4">(ii) on the website of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or offset any possible significant adverse effects of the development on the environment are:</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) the use of a design based primarily on two storey buildings (except for the control centre), centrally based away from the perimeter with a cordon sanitaire and extensive tree screening minimising the visual and environmental impact including the impact on the local ground waters;</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) the retention, as far as possible, of the mature hedgerows and trees on the perimeter of the site and the creation of new habitat by tree planting;</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) the mitigation of potential impact from traffic by the development of a new access road diverting construction and operational traffic away from the road classified by the Minister for Transport as a regional road and assigned the number R130 in the Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 188 of 2006), the town of Coolquay in the County of Fingal and the Francis Taylor National School at Kilcoskan in the County of Fingal and the provision of a regular dedicated bus service, related to demand, linking the city of Dublin to the site of the proposed prison;</P>
        <P LI="3">(iv) the mitigation of noise, dust and other emissions by prioritising the construction of the perimeter wall that will aid the mitigation of noise, dust and other emissions and the adoption of a Construction Environmental Management Plan;</P>
        <P LI="3">(v) the management of the surface water system in a manner which controls the quality and quantity of the surface water in a manner likely to avoid any adverse effect on local water drainage systems (which management includes the use of underground attenuation storage);</P>
        <P LI="3">(vi) the implementation of an environmental management programme to ensure the correct handling and storage of potentially contaminating materials and waste disposal;</P>
        <P LI="3">(vii) the use of solar water heating, rainwater harvesting, biomass boilers, natural ventilation and measures to minimise carbon emissions and water demand;</P>
        <P LI="3">(viii) the minimisation of night light impact by the use of adjustable perimeter security lighting;</P>
        <P LI="3">(ix) the preservation of the Thornton Hall building which will not form part of the prison site; and</P>
        <P LI="3">(x) the investigation of the site to identify, record, resolve or protect potential archaeological heritage in the area of the development;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that visual representations of the exterior of the completed development appear at the end of this resolution;</P><Col N="187"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the conditions relating to the construction of the new prison to be complied with by the principal building contractor or developer engaged by the Minister are:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) that the development shall not vary in any material way from that outlined in the environmental impact assessment and the visual representations of the exterior of the completed development as laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) that the construction schedule shall:</P>
        <P LI="4" Just="Left">(i) give priority to the construction of an access route from the road classified by the Minister for Transport as a regional road and assigned the number R135 in the Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2006 (S. I. No.188 of 2006) to the main site at Thornton Hall and that route will be used as the sole access route for all heavy construction traffic for the development; and</P>
        <P LI="4">(ii) thereafter give priority to the construction of those sections of the perimeter wall that will minimise the impact of construction work within that perimeter on persons residing or working in the locality;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) that the road classified by the Minister for Transport as a regional road and assigned the number R130 in the Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 188 of 2006) shall not be used by heavy construction, delivery or removal vehicles other than:</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) that portion of the road that must be crossed to gain access to the Thornton Hall part of the site from the new access route;</P>
        <P LI="4">(ii) that portion of the road that must be accessed to construct the underpass from the new access route to the Thornton Hall part of the site; and</P>
        <P LI="4">(iii) in emergencies where there is a threat to life or property and where the use of the new access route is not viable for that emergency;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) that the emergency exits at the north-west and south ends of the site shall not be used by service or delivery vehicles at any stage during construction or operation and shall only be used in the case of emergencies or emergency exercises;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) that construction shall not commence until a Construction Environmental Management Plan has been drawn up by the primary contractor, approved of by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and implemented in keeping with best practice and in particular the construction phase mitigation and other measures specified in sections 7.5, 8.7.1, 9.6.1, 10.5.1, 11.5.1, 12.6, 13.5 and 15.5 of the Environmental Impact Assessment shall be adhered to by the body or bodies contractually responsible for the construction of the development including any subcontractors;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was in possession and reported progress on the last occasion.  Amendment No. 29 proposes an amendment to section 41 after subsection (6). </P>
        <P>I should point out that a section on alcohol advertising taken from EU directive 89/552 EC is required to be dealt with by codes under section 42 of the Bill.  That section provides that broadcast advertisements providing alcoholic beverages shall comply with the following criteria: they shall not be aimed specifically at minors or, in particular, depict minors consuming these beverages; they shall not link the consumption of alcohol to enhanced physical performance or to driving; they shall not create the impression that the consumption of alcohol contributes to work, social or sexual success; they shall not claim that alcohol has therapeutic qualities or that it is a stimulant, a sedative or a means of resolving personal conflicts; they shall not encourage immoderate consumption of alcohol or present abstinence or moderation in a negative light; and they shall not place emphasis on high alcoholic content as being a positive quality of the beverage.  That is from Article 15 of the said directive and it is more comprehensive than the amendment.  Those are the provisions that are required to be dealt with by codes under section 42.  Whereas it could be said that they are more comprehensive than what I have proposed for direct insertion into the Bill under section 41, I have sought to introduce a watershed so that a broadcaster shall not broadcast before 9 p.m. an advertisement promoting alcoholic beverages.  There is an argument for the direct incorporation into the Bill of some or all of the broadcasting code set out under the directive I read out.  It might be argued that this would be technically superfluous but it would give the issue more prominence.</P>
        <P>That leads me to my point of conclusion on the previous occasion.  The issue arises as to how serious we are about the consumption of alcohol, especially by younger members of society.  Legislation is on the way that will seek in some way to tackle the supply of alcohol.  There has been much discussion recently about the growth in the number of off-licences and the number of under age people drinking.  Anecdotally, we are all aware of situations where younger people are drinking enormous quantities of alcohol.  One wonders about the problems they are storing up for themselves in later life as they acquire a dependency not just on alcohol but on very high quantities of alcohol.  That will have implications not just for them personally but for their families and family life and also for the Exchequer and the health service.  Those are important considerations.</P>
        <P>The question is whether we are content to seek to tackle the supply of alcohol or if we should also seek to change attitudes so that we tackle the demand.  That is a more difficult <Col N="190"/>issue because we live in a society where many competing messages are directed at people, especially young people.  Despite the fact that we have existing broadcasting codes that try to limit the seductive appeal of alcohol it is none the less a fact that the depiction of alcohol in advertisements on television, for example, is very much associated with social success and people who have attractive personal characteristics.  I do not need to rehearse here the concepts of the type of advertisements we see for various alcoholic beverages.  The question is whether we can be more regulatory in this area.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind that we are legislating in the public interest and that the Bill has to do, <i>inter alia</i>, with the television channels people receive into their homes by dint of paying the standard fee for the basic television package, I have a caveat to my proposal, namely, that I am aware that the concept of a television watershed is becoming increasingly theoretical in value given the lifestyles people lead, especially young people, given the changing structure of the family and a certain lack of parental oversight that is widely noted.  It is fair to say that many young people watch television after 9 p.m., particularly the kind of young people we might have in mind as we discuss alcoholism in society.  That said, it is time we made a start.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris takes a more radical view on this occasion than I in that he proposes a complete ban on the advertisement of alcoholic beverages.  I am inclined to support him.  Amendment No. 29 represents a limited strike.  I hope it is considered favourably because we have to make a start in terms of controlling the message going out to people, especially young people, about alcohol.  We have had discussions and we need to have more discussions about the role of alcohol in the sponsorship of sporting events, especially events that are attractive to young people.  I refer specifically to television advertising, as television is a significant part of people&rsquo;s lives.  Given the fact that the earlier the advertising on television the greater the likelihood it will reach people who are at a formative stage of their lives, it is necessary at the very least to consider a watershed despite the limitations I have acknowledged on watersheds in the modern context.  It is time we made a start and it is on that basis that I make this proposal.</P>
        <P>A watershed represents a good start in terms of alcoholic beverages.  We must have a philosophical discussion in the House about whether we want to prioritise economic issues and the economic benefits to broadcasters and therefore to refuse the amendment or whether we intend to identify in a principled and clear-headed manner where the interests of young people lie, especially those young people who might be vulnerable to alcoholic excess.  It is a question of making a start and of seeking to shape public attitudes, especially of younger people who are at a formative stage.  The point of inserting the amendment directly into section 41, as distinct from the incorporation of the codes under the European directive under section 42, is to seek to give the issue the kind of prominence it needs if we are to make serious inroads into the problem of alcohol abuse among young people in society.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

	<P>I will do a bit of research when I have had my say.  I thank the Acting Chairman.</P>
        <P>I am generally in sympathy with the argument made by Senator Mullen but, as he indicated, mine is slightly more radical.  In fact it is considerably more radical because it looks for a total ban on alcohol advertising and proposes a substantial fine.  The reason for this is that the abuse of alcohol throughout society, not just by young people, is a very costly business to the Exchequer and is very damaging to the health of the nation.  We are in the middle of a crisis in this country because of the excessive consumption of drink.  We have one of the worst rates of binge drinking in the entire world and that is partly driven by advertising.  We know it is an extremely serious health problem and it draws on the resources of the State to deal with the consequences of drink.  The situation has a direct parallel in the impact of smoking.  The Government took an enormously courageous decision to make an outright ban on the advertising of cigarettes.  It moved then to limit the places where one could smoke.</P>
        <P>I am not talking about limiting the places where people can drink or even limiting the availability of drink, although I have said many times that one of the factors that has led to this situation is the extraordinary proliferation of licensing of small retail outlets such as corner shops, supermarkets and mini markets.  However, I am not dealing with that.  I am simply dealing with the advertising of alcohol.  What we have done with cigarettes we can do with alcohol.  Anything less is a half measure.  Television advertising in particular would be affected by such a change as there are not that many drink advertisements on radio.  The reason is that companies use the massive visual appeal of television and they have the money so to do.  We are dealing with a completely unscrupulous drinks industry that deliberately targets young people.  We have seen that with alcopops and the new alcoshots that are highly concentrated.</P>
        <P>I am not impressed by the group, MEAS, which is the Irish for respect.  I have no respect for it.  I know exactly what it is.  I have watched its spokespeople on television defending the drinks industry.  It is a fig leaf.  It is a cosmetic operation by the drinks industry to conceal what it is doing.</P>
        <P>My amendment proposes discontinuing the broadcast of advertisements for alcohol.  That is a clear, clean, simple and radical step.  It will be problematic but if the Minister of State accepted it he would get the kind of kudos that the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, got for introducing the smoking ban.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment sets out to achieve the objectives of the two previous amendments.  It is a question of the best method to achieve the objective.  It is important to restate that we have an alcohol problem.  We have a problem with binge drinking.  There is a frightening culture of drinking among our youth, which has enormous health and social implications.  The progression to other forms of substance abuse begins with abuse of and dependency on alcohol.  It is progressive and there is a link.  Those who tabled the previous two amendments made it clear that we have a problem with alcohol in our society.</P>
        <P>Implicit in the Bill&rsquo;s proposed ban on advertising of junk food is an acceptance of the power of advertising.  We do not necessarily need empirical research to establish that advertising is extremely powerful on both radio and television because we know the companies that invest in it would not put that money in if it was not creating a return.  The advertising is effective. <Col N="192"/> We first need to establish those two principles.  We have a problem and advertising is effective in perpetuating the problem.</P>
        <P>My amendment is a pragmatic, sensible and workable proposal to draw up a broadcasting code by the new authority in collaboration with the drinks industry, the temperance organisations, including the Pioneer Total Abstinence Organisation which does great work in this area, and youth groupings.  They are all stakeholders with an interest in the area.  Those people should be consulted and the authority should establish a broadcasting code for drink advertising.  That code should focus on audience age at a given time of day.  I take the point made by Senator Mullen that there is a blurring, and in contemporary society the watershed times are hard to establish, as there is an overlap between viewing times of different age groupings.  Things are not as clear-cut as they might have been.  However, the code should address the issue of audience age at a given time.  It should be mindful not to have advertising available at a time when the audience of young people is maximised.</P>
        <P>It should consider the nature of the advertisements, particularly television advertisements.  It should consider whether those advertisements suggest a link between alcohol, and sexual prowess and glamorous sex lives.  It should also address the exploitation of women that is also involved in those advertisements and the degree to which they perpetuate the drink culture and problem.  The code should propose the elimination of sexually explicit advertisements that are an insult to womanhood and represent a problem in the drink area.</P>
        <P>The code should address sponsorship that provides subtle advertising.  Some of the most effective subliminal advertising is where the drinks industry has links to particular programmes, and sport and cultural youth events, including song and music contests and drama.  These are called &ldquo;stings&rdquo; and such advertising should be reviewed.  The code should regulate that aspect and also the target age group, the nature of advertisements and the type of sponsorship allowed.  It should also regulate the amount of alcohol advertisements.  The code should specify fines and disciplinary procedures for breaches of the code to ensure compliance with the code.</P>
        <P>I regard this as a pragmatic and sensible amendment.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept it as a method to achieve the objective of us all, which is to protect vulnerable people from being influenced by pernicious advertising that could damage their future.</P>
        <P>The amendment specifies that if agreement cannot be reached between the authority and the stakeholders &mdash; the drinks industry might not agree even though there is no reason it should not and it would if the imperative was there &mdash; then the authority would have the right to act unilaterally and ban certain advertisements at a given time as it saw fit and to deal with the issue on its own with professional advice.  A voluntary code is always more workable.  However, if a voluntary code cannot be agreed &mdash; I believe it would &mdash; the authority would have the ultimate sanction to impose the regulation.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to accept this amendment as a pragmatic and sensible way to deal with the difficulty.  While it could be subject to review in the future, I believe it could work to realistically deal with a very difficult issue in a slightly incremental but nonetheless effective way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have two amendments in this grouping, Nos. 36<i>b</i> and 36<i>c</i>.  Similar issues arise in the next grouping of amendments.  An rud at&aacute; i gceist agam anseo n&aacute; go mbeadh taca&iacute;ocht agus tuiscint ann do mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; agus do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ar intinn agam aon strus n&oacute; str&oacute; a chur ar RTE n&oacute; ar aon ghr&uacute;pa a bheadh ag craobhscaoileadh tr&iacute;d na me&aacute;in.  An rud at&aacute; i gceist n&aacute; go mbeadh seans ag gn&aacute;th muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; a saol a chaitheamh tr&iacute; Ghaelainn, maireachtaint tr&iacute; Ghaelainn agus gn&aacute;th ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaelainn agus go mbeadh an Ghaelainn ar f&aacute;il <Col N="193"/>d&oacute;ibh ar bhonn r&eacute;as&uacute;nta agus praitici&uacute;il.  N&iacute;lim ag iarraidh aon rud nua a chur chun cinn.  N&iacute;l aon rud sa mholadh seo a cuireann deacrachta&iacute; roimh an Aire.  N&iacute;l i gceist agam ach go mbeadh seans ag muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; agus ag Gaeilgeoir&iacute; a gcuid gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaelainn.  Mar shampla, s&eacute;ard at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l leis na leasuithe os &aacute;r gcomhair sa ghr&uacute;pa seo n&aacute; go mbeadh ruda&iacute; mar teletext agus subtitling ar f&aacute;il i nGaelainn.  That is not difficult to do.  The technology exists.  &Uacute;s&aacute;ideann TG4 an teicneola&iacute;ocht sin i gcona&iacute;.  Watching a programme on TG4 it is very easy to press the button.  When we passed the legislation several years ago for the establishment of TG4 we knew it was possible to get an Irish language translation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cad at&aacute; i gceist agam anseo?  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist agam go mbeadh tuiscint againn ar cad at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il.  Ar thaobh an oideachais de, mar shampla do rang scoile, m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, scoileanna n&oacute; lucht f&eacute;achana na teilif&iacute;se, is &eacute; at&aacute; i gceist n&aacute; go mbeadh &aacute;iseanna ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh i nGaelinn agus go mbeadh siad ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh ar fad.  N&iacute; haon rud m&oacute;r &eacute; seo.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go gcuirfeadh an rud at&aacute; a mholadh agam an iomad struis ar an Aire.  What stress will it put on the Minister to provide subtitles in Irish for people from the Gaeltacht if they press the button?  I hope the Minister will be open to this.  Later today or this week one of the committees will deal with the requirements of the Acht Teanga and the requirement to have things ar f&aacute;il i nGaelinn.  T&aacute; an moladh at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh agam anseo i bhfad n&iacute;os simpl&iacute; n&aacute; seo.  T&aacute; an teicneola&iacute;ocht ann agus ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the next group t&aacute; leasuithe molta agam i dtaobh daoine at&aacute; ag cur insteach gear&aacute;in, complaints, to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  M&aacute; chuireann siad isteach gear&aacute;in tr&iacute; Ghaelinn, ba ch&oacute;ir go dtiocfadh na freagra&iacute; ar ais chucu i nGaelinn.  I feel very strongly about this.  When I was at school, half my class were Gaeltacht people.  When people deal with new language and technology they are not in the habit of making complaints every day and will revert to the language in which they are most comfortable.  M&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; go bhfuil siad i bhfad n&iacute;os comporda&iacute; ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh aon taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh. It is not too much to ask.</P>
        <P>I am very clear about this and I have tabled an amendment that the annual report be available in Irish.  I want to short-circuit all the arguments against this.  That is already covered by a regulation under one of the Schedules of the Acht Teanga so there is nothing new here.  I do not want people coming to me and saying I am putting forward a proposal that will cause great problems and time delays.  Having it here means when people set out the annual report on day one, they will know it will have to be ar f&aacute;il i nGaelinn, so the print design can allow for it to be easily produced in Irish or English.  I do not need to have hard copies printed in Irish, but I want it translated and available at least as a Web publication in order that all the work and design goes into it and is there.  I am not asking that we publish thousands of copies that will never be opened or read, although where there is a demand it should be made available.  In the first case, I will be satisfied with Web publication if that is required.  What is killing Irish language policy is that ordinary people who do their work and live their lives through Irish hit a full stop when they deal with aspects of the State.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to come across as some kind of zealot.  I have very little sympathy with some of the fascistic aproaches to the Irish language.  That is not where I come from.  I do not go along with the view of using a language as some kind of ammunition against other people.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;ite sa chult&uacute;r Gaelach.  Rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh m&eacute; i measc daoine a raibh Gailege acu &oacute;n gcliabh&aacute;n agus bh&iacute; mo chuid oideachais ar fad tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Do dhaoine mar m&eacute; f&eacute;in, gur bhre&aacute; leo anois is ar&iacute;s a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an seans ann &eacute; sin a dheanamh.  N&iacute; rud m&oacute;r &eacute; sin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I regularly spoke to the Minister&rsquo;s father in the Irish language and he was a great lover of it.  In his memory, as a man who also shook the chalk dust from his hair at 3 o&rsquo;clock of an <Col N="194"/>evening, taught the Irish language in the midlands and spread the good word, I expect the Minister to at least be open minded on this matter.  Deirim leis an Aire go bhfuil s&eacute; seo t&aacute;bhachtach.  I do not want the Minister to see this as something he can deal with, examine the cost involved and get rid of it or not.  This is very important to a small number of people who are important in this country.  Gaeltacht people are always watching this and asking whether anybody really cares about them.  They do not ask for much.  T&aacute;im&iacute;d ag caint anseo faoi ch&eacute;ad theanga oifigi&uacute;il an St&aacute;it agus is c&oacute;ir mar sin go mbeadh Gaelgeoir&iacute; in ann a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh, a shaol a chaitheamh agus maireachtaint tr&iacute; Ghaelainn m&aacute;s mian leo &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  It is not too much to ask.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am working hard to get the Minister to nod his head somewhere along the way.  I am not getting any positive vibes.  I am feeling negative and discouraged.  Next week we are to discuss the new set of regulations on the Irish language.  If the Minister cannot accept this today, can he guarantee that somebody from his Department will raise this with the Irish language commissioner and ask his view on this and how it ties into the Acht Teanga?  I am the greatest supporter and critic of the Acht Teanga.  People have had to listen to me here over the past five years talking about what is wrong with it and what it tried to do to my home town of Dingle and I have very clear views on it.  I also take a practical view.  An rud at&aacute; a mholadh anseo agam n&aacute; go mbeidh an seans ag gn&aacute;th muintir agus saor&aacute;naigh na t&iacute;re seo, Gaelgeoir&iacute; n&oacute; muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute;, gur mhaith leo a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh &mdash; gear&aacute;in a chur isteach n&oacute; f&eacute;achaint ar teletext n&oacute; subtitles &mdash; go mbeadh sin ar f&aacute;il doibh as Gaeilge.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an tAire oscailte don mh&eacute;id sin.</P>

Aont&aacute;im leis gur c&oacute;ir go mbeadh muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; agus Gaelgeoir&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as &aacute;r  dteanga dh&uacute;chais i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.

        <P Just="Left">On the other amendment regarding advertising, I am not sure of the mechanics of some of the amendments proposed and how effective or otherwise they would be in practice.  However, I am taken by the sentiments expressed and Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s suggestion could be taken on board.  Section 42(4) specifies:</P>
        <P LI="1">A broadcasting code prepared by the Authority under subsection (2)(<i>g</i>) may prohibit the advertising in a broadcasting service of a particular class or classes of foods and beverages considered by the Authority to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is commendable and I welcome it in the Bill and, hopefully, in the Act.  Although it refers to &ldquo;foods and beverages&rdquo;, it also specifies &ldquo;in particular those which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars&rdquo; but does not mention alcohol.  That should be examined.  Obesity is a recognised problem in society.  The solution needs to begin at an early age and children need to be encouraged to be active.  Many schools are taking initiatives in that regard, and this is welcome.  Equally, there is now clear recognition that the temptation for youngsters to become involved with alcohol at an early age is neither good for them, for their health now or in the future, nor for society.  As food and beverages, including the sugar content of some of the minerals that youngsters drink, are dealt with, there is a corollary that it would be a contradiction to exclude alcohol.  Advertising is not the sole influence in regard to drink but it is a significant factor.</P><Col N="195"/>
        <P>I tend to disagree with some of the comments made in criticism of the drinks industry.  The drinks industry has a duty to itself commercially and to its shareholders to promote the sale of its products in the same way any other product is promoted.  However, there is an onus on us, as legislators, to consider the health effects and to ensure appropriate measures are put in place.  Leaving a code to the authority in the first instance would be a good first step in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have difficulty understanding why alcohol is excluded in the last line of this subsection, and while there may be a good reason for this, it is not apparent to me.  This issue should be considered and the general sentiment of what is being expressed could in some way be incorporated before Report Stage so the authority would be empowered, if it sees fit, to make provisions in a code which would influence a more mature and responsible engagement with drink, particularly for those at a young age and in adolescence.</P>

Beimid ag cur isteach c&oacute;d &uacute;r a leagfaidh amach na riachtanais a bheidh ar chraolt&oacute;ir&iacute; agus iad ag br&uacute; &aacute;bhair difri&uacute;la, go h&aacute;irithe ar ph&aacute;ist&iacute;.  It basically states that in the broadcasting codes we would also include the likely effect which the promotion of overtly consumerist attitudes in the promotion of commercial products within programme content will have on the target audience, particularly where the content is targeted at children.</P>
        <P>We can all agree that this is not a major problem with RTE or TG4.  However, if one looks at some of the other services or broadcasters, particularly children&rsquo;s broadcasters and channels, it is a problem where advertising for toys and other goods, and even for mobile phone text providers and ringtone providers, seems to dominate, and where programmes are directly linked with the selling of commercial products.  This is an issue of which I am sure RTE and others are aware but it might be advisable to have it included in the text of the Bill so it forms part of the statutory guidelines.</P>
        <P>Any parent of young children will tell of the pressures they are under when some of these other channels are involved in promoting consumerist attitudes and targeting young children.  It is an issue on which we could all agree, and it could be included in the Bill.</P>

	<P>We have discussed the question of alcohol advertising in the House on many occasions and I have expressed my view very strongly that we need to take a serious look at the advertising of alcohol on television.  This extends to a wider debate on alcohol sponsorship throughout our country and society, particularly in the area of sport and related leisure activities.  It is a huge problem and a major issue which needs to be addressed and confronted.  We all agree that this needs to be done.</P><Col N="196"/>
        <P>Some of my colleagues have brought forward amendments, some of them mandatory in form in respect of a ban and a very large fine, and others which are a variation on the theme.  I am inclined to support the sensible position adopted by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, namely, that as far as possible the detail should be determined in a code of practice and the widest possible amount of agreement should be secured throughout the industry before we resort to the approach of a mandatory ban on advertising of particular products.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While I share the views of those who have said that there ought not to be advertising of alcohol on television, we live in a world where there is a proliferation of television advertising which does not just originate in this State or across the water, as was the position up to a few years ago.  Television stations are now beamed in from all over the world.  We must have regard to the world we live in.  While I do not say this to lessen my earlier point on alcohol advertising, it is a more complex problem than simply saying we should impose a ban and a fine &mdash; I say this with all respect to the proposals of Senators Norris and Mullen in this regard.  This question probably belongs better in the context of a discussion and, hopefully, an agreement on a code of practice, which is the way this type of issue has been dealt with in the past.</P>
        <P>To be fair to the Minister, that would appear to be the context in which he intends to deal with this issue.  There is fairly detailed provision in section 42 in respect of broadcasting codes.  I presume it would be the intention of the Minister to include this question, or at least it would be a view of the Minister that this question needs to be dealt with in the context of the enabling provisions in the Bill for the promulgation of codes of practice and advertising.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment on that issue is probably the one I would prefer over the others for the reasons I have outlined but I also believe, in fairness to the Minister, that this issue is allowed for in the text of the Bill.  That is probably the best way to proceed.</P>
        <P>We can put measures into legislation that make us feel we are doing something or that we can have an impact on a particular problem, but the question is whether in fact we would have that effect and-or whether it would not be better to take the issue apart and deal with it with all of the interested parties concerned, and hopefully reach the outcome we wish to achieve in regard to the advertising of alcohol.</P>

	<P>With regard to amendments Nos. 29, 32 and 35, the regulation of alcohol in the State is a matter which falls to be addressed on a cross-departmental basis.  The Department of Health and Children, which is the lead Department on the health-related issues of alcohol, has, as Senators will be aware, recently reviewed the voluntary code to reduce the exposure of young people to alcoholic drink on television.  This was agreed with the drinks and advertising sectors back in 2005.  The revised codes on alcohol, marketing, communications and sponsorship represent a strengthening of the existing codes.</P>
      
        <P>In April, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which addresses the promotion and sale of alcohol, opening hours and public order issues.  It was the intention to take that Bill in the D&aacute;il tomorrow, although the schedule has been changed and it may instead be introduced next week.</P>
        <P>In respect of broadcasting legislation, we have provided in section 42  for a requirement on the broadcasting authority of Ireland to prepare codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters.  Senators will be aware that section 42(2)(<i>h</i>) approximates and develops the previous provisions under which the BCI prepared the general advertising code.  This code specifically addresses the points made in regard to the advertising of alcohol.  We have provided under section 42(9) for the continuation of this code.  I consider that section 42 <Col N="197"/>assists the whole of Government approach needed to adequately address the concerns raised by Senators and, as such, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 36<i>a</i>, I have provided under section 43(4)(<i>j</i>) that broadcasting codes shall provide for the matters required in chapters IIA, IIB, IV and V of the audiovisual media services directive.  Senators will be aware that under chapter IIA, article 3(g)(1), commercial communications involving product placements are prohibited.  While derogations may apply in respect of certain categories of programming, including cinema, series made for television, sports programmes and light entertainment, this derogation does not apply to children&rsquo;s programming.  Senators will be aware that the product placement provisions of the existing Broadcasting Commission of Ireland codes, specifically its general advertising code, prohibit product placements.  We have provided under section 42(9) for the continuation of these codes.  The advertising code prohibits commercial communications for drinks which contain alcohol content of 25% or above.  That means drinks such as vodka, whiskey, rum, gin and brandy are prohibited.  The same applies in respect of alcopops.  The code also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Commercial communications for alcoholic drinks shall not encourage children or other non-drinkers to begin drinking.  It shall be cast towards brand selling and identification only.</P>
        <P LI="1">Broadcasters shall ensure that commercial communications for alcoholic drinks are not transmitted in or around programmes primarily intended for children and shall take account of the age profile of the viewers and/or listeners to ensure they are communicated, so far as it is possible, to adults.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That makes clear what we are trying to do.</P>
        <P>Section 42 also requires the broadcasting authority of Ireland to prepare codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters.  Section 42(2)(<i>g</i>) provides that advertising and teleshopping material, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion implied in any broadcasting service, in particular those which advertise activities likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children, protect the interests of children and have regard for their general public health interests.  Furthermore, section 42(4) provides that a broadcasting code prepared by the BAI under section 42(2)(<i>g</i>) may prohibit the advertising by a broadcasting service of a particular class or classes of food or beverage considered by the authority to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, particularly products which contain fat or trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars.  As I consider these provisions to adequately address the concerns raised by Senators, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendments Nos. 36<i>b</i> and 36<i>c</i>, section 43 requires the BAI, <i>inter alia</i>, to prepare rules for broadcasters in respect of access to broadcasting services by persons with hearing impairments.  These provisions approximate and develop the previous provisions under which the BCI prepared the access rules.  Section 43(7) provides for the continuation of these codes.  The BAI is the appropriate body to consider and decide on the matters raised in these amendments.  I can see the merit of the proposed amendments but I am sure Senators will agree that the practicalities of implementation are more appropriate to the BAI, which can take all relevant matters into consideration in developing the access rules.  Section 43(6) provides that the BAI must review a broadcasting code made under subsection 43(1)(<i>c</i>) every two years or such lesser period as it may decide.  Furthermore, section 44 provides that draft broadcasting rules prepared by the BAI are subject to public consultation.  I consider these processes to provide ample opportunity for input into the development of access rules, including the issues raised by Senators.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked me to have an open mind.  I like to think I always have an open mind.  We do not have a monopoly on wisdom and are prepared to consider good amendments.  We see some merit in what has been proposed.  TG4 has an Irish language teletext service and a bilingual Internet service, although it does not provide Irish subtitling.  If a programme were broadcast as Gaeilge with subtitling as B&eacute;arla, it might be helpful from the point of view of learning Irish.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland have published key documents in response to correspondence in Irish.</P>
        <P>There is always room for improvement, and I listened attentively to Senators&rsquo; arguments and will consult my colleagues when we have finished our debate in this House.  However, I will have to disappoint some Senators because I am not in a position to accept their amendments as presented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, I am disappointed he will not accept amendment No. 35.  Senators Alex White and Walsh endorsed the amendment and acknowledged its practical wisdom and other colleagues have informally expressed their support for it.  The purpose of the amendment is to place a specific requirement on the BAI to draw up the code in a consultative manner.  The authority could use the ultimate stick of banning advertising if the code could not be agreed because people are obstinate or difficult, although I do not anticipate such a scenario arising.  It is a pragmatic and practical amendment and I will have to press it.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm fosta nach bhfuil an tAire ag glacadh go hioml&aacute;n le leasuithe an tSeanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Tuathail.

        <P>I insist on pressing amendment No. 35.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to the various contributions, I am disappointed the Minister of State will not be accepting my amendment.  I am particularly disappointed that he will not be accepting amendment No. 35 in the name of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the comments of Senator Alex White, who appears to be concerned with regard to provisions in legislation being either too prescriptive or overly draconian.  I presume he is particularly concerned about Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment which would lead to the imposition of a complete ban on the advertisement of alcohol, and that in my name which proposes a watershed of 9 p.m.  We must consider what is the role of legislators.  It is true that we should never make legislative provision or amend legislation lightly.  However, we are debating an issue, namely, alcohol, which is continually discussed as being of concern in society.  There comes a time when we must stop talking and start legislating in the public interest.</P>
        <P>I am concerned in respect of the emergence of a certain quango-itis, so to speak, whereby we become nervous about proposing specific legislative provisions and state that a particular issue is a matter for some quango or an authority we intend to establish, or that it should be dealt with under a code.  There is a place for quangos, authorities and codes.  When people say that a matter would best be dealt with under a particular code, what they really mean is that it would best be dealt with in a way that gives something to everyone.  Sometimes there is a need for clearer intent at the heart of legislation.</P><Col N="199"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly proposes a code in respect of the advertisement of alcohol which I am happy to support.  The code in question represents a more limited strike than Senator Norris or I would have made in respect of this matter.  None the less, the relevant amendment is very thoughtful and challenges to the Government to take the issue of the advertisement of alcohol as seriously as it does that of the advertisement of junk food.  It is stated in section 42(2)(<i>g</i>) that broadcasting codes shall provide:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]hat advertising, teleshopping material, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed in any broadcasting service, in particular advertising and other such activities which relate to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children, protects the interests of children having particular regard to the general public health interests of children[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">Who could disagree with that?  Section 42(4) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">A broadcasting code prepared by the Authority under <i>subsection (2)(g) </i>may prohibit the advertising in a broadcasting service of a particular class or classes of foods and beverages considered by the Authority to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular those which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A standard is being set down by the Government.  It is not proposing a specific ban.  However, it is proposing to enable the creation of such a ban in legislation.  It is interesting that the phrase &ldquo;a broadcasting code shall prohibit such advertising&rdquo; is not used in the Bill.  However, it is stated that such a code may prohibit advertising of this nature.  I am concerned that people are scared to legislate and would be happier to refer certain matters to quangos.  Those to whom I refer are terrified of taking a principled decision and running with it.</P>
        <P>It is not as if legislation, should it prove counterproductive, could not be amended or repealed subsequently.  There are enough resources available to the Government, in the context of intelligent personnel who will research the issues, for it to have a clearer view at this stage with regard to the issue of the advertisement of junk food.  However, that is not my main point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is dealt with in a later amendment in the Senator&rsquo;s name.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that matter will be the subject of discussion in respect of another amendment.  To return to Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment, if we apply the logic of what the Government has done in respect of junk food, why should we not provide that a broadcasting code relating to the advertisement of alcohol should be drawn up?  In addition, why should we not provide that, in the absence of such a code, the authority may prohibit the advertisement of alcohol products?  Are we speaking out of both sides of our mouths?  Are we willing to state how worried we are regarding the drinking of alcohol to excess, particularly among young people, but that in the final analysis we are afraid to tackle the vested interests or challenge the industry?</P>
        <P>No one is suggesting that we ban the sale of alcohol products.  We are proposing the banning of the advertisement of alcohol products, enabling such a ban to be put in place or enabling &mdash; as in Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s modest but none the less thoughtful and welcome amendment &mdash; the establishment of a code under which the advertisement of alcohol could be banned in certain circumstances.  I commend Senator O&rsquo;Reilly on tabling his amendment.  I will not be pressing my amendment but I will support the Senator&rsquo;s, if necessary in a vote.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Doherty also tabled amendments in respect of this matter.  That in the name of Senator Doherty is extremely thoughtful in nature.  It goes to the heart of an issue of <Col N="200"/>great relevance to our society, namely, the promotion of consumerist attitudes, particularly in circumstances where broadcasting content is aimed at children.  I have stated on many occasions that I regard the law as an educator.  That which the law provides has the effect not just of preventing certain behaviours but also of fostering particular attitudes.</P>
        <P>Under the proposed new paragraph (<i>g</i>) in Senator Doherty&rsquo;s amendment, the authority would be obliged to have regard to the matter to which I refer in preparing or revising a broadcasting code.  That is highly relevant.  Many people are concerned with regard to consumerist attitudes.  I am not referring to harmless advertisements such as that relating to Terry&rsquo;s chocolate orange where a woman says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Terry&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s mine&rdquo;, rather I am talking about a more insidious consumerist attitude that is fostered in programme content and certain advertisements.  The amendment in Senator Doherty&rsquo;s name does not propose the imposition of anything, it merely refers to a matter which the authority should be required to take on board.  What could be more reasonable than that?</P>

It is important to reason by analogy, and it is important to speak about issues such as road signs in Irish precisely because what we are trying to do is bring forward a culture in Ireland where people find it as easy as possible to learn and cherish Irish.</P>
        <P>We must have consistency in that.  In so far as we have legislation that provides for certain actions for the sake of the Irish language community, it is important we have joined-up thinking so that at the level of broadcasting also we would have that consistency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  Around the House we are <i>ad idem</i> on the dangers of drink advertising.  I was generally supportive of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment, particularly when reading subsection (4) which deals with junk food.  The Minister of State has clarified this pretty well in that under section 42(9), the advertising code remains operative.  As such, the introduction to section 42 allows the authority to amend and revise the code.</P>
        <P>It may be argued that the code requires strengthening in areas but that is a different argument.  The main thrust of what is being indicated, particularly in Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s submission but also in the general sentiment, is covered by that.  My understanding is there are very heavy penalties of up to &euro;250,000 for non-compliance with those particular sections.</P>
        <P>On reflection, we might give some credence to the existing advertising code which prohibits, for example, the advertising of vodka, whiskey, tequila, rum, gin and brandy which is in excess of 25% alcohol content on broadcast media.  One could argue this should apply to drinks with less than 25% alcohol content.</P>
        <P>Equally, Senator White&rsquo;s comment is relevant in that this will really only apply to the Irish broadcast media, although we have a plethora of multinational and foreign channels beamed into this country.  That will uncover all this quite legally.  There is probably a balance to be taken on this.  That the code exists satisfies me that there is provision for the authority to strengthen the advertising code, which I would like to see.  Any initiative taken should at least be comparable with that taken in regard to junk food, as the same or possibly greater risks and damage to exposed children would be evident in the case of alcohol.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 48, subsection (1), line 29, to delete &ldquo;on&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;including&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This reminds me, in view of our recent discussion, of the Carlsberg advertisement which states &ldquo;Worth waiting for&rdquo;.  I proposed these amendments in the name of the Labour Party Senators and I will outline the thinking behind them.  Amendment 37 proposes that broadcasters give due consideration to any complaint received, whether or not it falls strictly within the remit of section 48.  Amendment No. 38 inserts in page 48, after &ldquo;complainants&rdquo;, &ldquo;which shall include a facility for communication of the complaint by electronic mail&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We have heard time and time again about the use of electronic mail in various forms of legislation.  For example, it is used in job applications on <i>publicjobs.ie</i>.  There is no other way of applying for a position in the public sector.  Thus, at one level the State is promoting the use of electronic mail.  Given that we are here initiating legislation and trying to amend it so that we can ensure it is not rushed and that it is good law, it is important we include this amendment.  Broadcasters should not be permitted to make life difficult for those who wish to lodge a complaint by electronic mail.  The amendment is self-explanatory and given the era in which we are living it should be favourably received by the Minister of State.  I therefore expect he will accept it.</P>
        <P>In amendments Nos. 43 and 44 we propose the provision of a general time limit of 30 days under section 49 to avoid public confusion as to the time within which rights must be exercised.  A time limit of 30 days applies under sections 47 and 48.  Therefore, there would seem to be a case for maintaining consistency, to borrow the logo of a drinks company in this country.  There is a case for maintaining consistency by also providing for a 30 day limit under section 49.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 46 relates to paragraph (<i>m</i>).  There is a large loophole in the right of reply system.  If the injured party agrees to a single sentence by way of a contribution from him or her, that would preclude any right of reply to, say, an hour long programme which contained a mass of incorrect allegations.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="205"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments.  They are worthwhile and self-explanatory and were well proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 47 requires broadcasters to develop and apply basic procedures in respect of complaints handling, including providing information to the viewing and listening public as to how to go about making a complaint and giving a sense of how long they can expect to wait before receiving a response from a broadcaster.  It limits the duty of broadcasters to consider complaints made in writing and complaints that fall within one of the grounds for complaints of the compliance committee under section 48.  It does so in order to ensure that the burden placed on broadcasters is proportionate and not undue or unnecessary.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 37 proposes to broaden the scope of complaints that must be addressed in the first instance by the broadcasters.  This amendment would impose an unnecessary burden on broadcasters, in effect, requiring them to consider a wider range of grounds for complaint than currently exists for the Broadcasting Complaints Commission or for its successor the compliance committee under section 48.  As such, I do not propose to accept that amendment.</P>
        <P>While amendment No. 38 has good merit, from the point of view of clarity, I cannot accept the text as drafted.  I therefore propose to review the text of section 47(3) with a view to bringing forward an equivalent amendment on Report Stage.  The requirement that would be imposed by the acceptance of amendment No. 37<i>a</i> would give rise to an undue burden on small and non-public service broadcasters and, as such, I do not propose to accept the amendment, as drafted.</P>
        <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 40<i>a </i>and 41<i>a</i>, at present the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland  and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are listed bodies in the Schedule to the Official Languages Act 2003.  The BAI, as a successor body to these bodies, will be subject to the requirements of the Official Languages Act.  In addition, both the BCI and BCC have an existing policy of publishing codes and rules in both official languages and respond in the Irish language to complaints and correspondence made in the Irish language.  As such, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 42, the existing text of section 48(15) achieves the same end as the amendment proposed by Senator Mullen.  As a consequence, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 propose to extend the time period allowed for the making of requests for a right of reply to a broadcaster and the compliance committee from ten to 30 days.  It is my view that for the right of reply to work effectively it must work quickly.  Section 49 places strict timescales on applicants, broadcasters and the compliance committee in order to achieve this aim.  While I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 43 and 44, I intend to reflect on the timescales in section 49 before Report Stage in light of the concerns expressed by the Senator McCarthy.  In addition, I propose amendment No. 45, which is a drafting amendment necessary to address a deficiency in the wording of paragraph (<i>b</i>) of section 49(21).</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 46 would serve in an limited manner to circumscribe the discretion of the compliance committee in respect of the grant of a request for the right of reply.  While I do not propose to accept the text of amendment No. 46, I intend to reflect on the text of subsection (21)(<i>m</i>) before Report Stage in light of what the Senator said.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his thoughtful reply.  I appreciate that he will willing to give these proposals further consideration between now and Report Stage.  I too shall probably have sleepless nights between now and then.  I am sure that if the Minister of State does not, we would be more than happy to be enthusiastic about pushing <Col N="206"/>similar amendments on Report Stage.  I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I will withdraw my party&rsquo;s amendments on the basis that the door is still half open.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from what the Minister of State said that he regards the import of what I proposed in amendment No. 42 to section 48 has already been covered elsewhere.  However, I am not satisfied that is the case.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider it.  </P>
        <P>I spoke on a previous occasion on this Bill about instances where there had not been an appropriate level of fairness and balance, particularly in the context of a referendum campaign.  I gave the example of the abortion referendum in 2002.  I had concerns about a broadcast on the RTE Radio 1 programme &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, which sought to introduce into public debate a very emotive topic on the day prior to the moratorium on debate on the referendum.  I am not saying that it applied on this occasion, but one wonders whether there can be a certain cynical intent sometimes in that one can have certain materials and debates broadcast, which might not be fair or impartial, as required by the codes, but in the context of a referendum or election campaign it would be too late to secure any significant redress.  That is why the issue of urgency in terms of the compliance committee carrying out its task of investigating a complaint is a particularly relevant one.  It is also why specific emphasis should be placed on that point.  I ask the Minister of State on that basis to reconsider including a specific legislative requirement, as proposed in my amendment, that would impose an obligation on the compliance committee to deal with complaints with due regard to the urgency of the complaint where appropriate.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="7">&ldquo;(1) The Compliance Committee may for any of the reasons specified in <i>subsection (2)</i> conduct an investigation into the operational, programming, financial, technical or other affairs of a holder of a contract under <i>Part 6</i> or <i>8</i> (&ldquo;contractor&rdquo;).&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 to 58, inclusive, relate to the enforcement provisions proposed in the Bill.  In the interests of fair procedures, amendments Nos. 47 and 48 require the compliance committee to afford a broadcasting or multiplex contractor who is the subject of an investigation under section 50 the opportunity to respond to the compliance committee in respect of the matter under consideration.  Amendment No. 49 removes the onerous requirement on broadcasting and multiplex contractors to pay the cost of any investigation into their affairs.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 50 to 55, inclusive, provide for an appeals process in respect of procedures surrounding the termination or suspension of a broadcasting or multiplex contract.  Where the compliance committee has made a recommendation to the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI, as to the termination or suspension of a contract, the membership of the BAI, in considering the compliance committee&rsquo;s recommendation, must not include any member of the compliance committee involved in the original recommendation.  The broadcasting or multiplex <Col N="208"/>contractor may make further submissions to the BAI and the latter may decide on suspension rather than termination of the contract.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Amendment No. 54 is a minor drafting amendment intended to reduce superfluous words from the text of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 56 to 59, inclusive, are intended to achieve two outcomes.  The first is to ensure that a broadcaster will be automatically offered the opportunity of availing of the non-judicial procedure outlined in section 55(2) as an alternative to court proceedings in respect of the imposition of a financial sanction under section 65.  The second aspect of these provision is the requirement that the BAI must indicate to the broadcaster concerned the amount of any financial sanction imposed if the broadcaster elects to have the matter dealt with under the procedure outlined in section 55(2).  Amendments Nos. 56 to 59, inclusive, are intended to increase the operability of the non-judicial procedure outlined in section 55 (2).</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 47<i>a</i>, in the name of Senator O&rsquo;Toole, proposes the insertion of additional text in section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) in respect of how the compliance committee may have reasonable grounds for believing that a broadcasting or multiplex contractor is in breach of the terms of its contract with the BAI.  The proposed wording is unnecessary and restrictive.  For example, it does not encompass communications to the compliance committee from public authorities such as the Commission for Communications Regulation or from another broadcasting or multiplex contractor.  The existing text of section 50 (2)(<i>a</i>) does not preclude a complaint from a member of the public alerting the compliance committee to a possible breach.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 83:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 74, subsection (9), line 14, to delete &ldquo;5&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section deals with a situation where a licence is due for renewal and there is no realistic challenge to the current licence holder.  I welcome that the section provides adequate opportunity for challengers.  There is a process whereby challengers can emerge from broadcasting organisations for the licence in an area.  The section provides that a report on the incumbent&rsquo;s compliance with broadcasting codes and regulations be sought.  If the incumbent is not challenged, there is provision in the section to vet the incumbent and their degree of compliance with codes and regulations and their competencies.  In other words, the incumbent does not get the nod automatically; there is a process to ensure they are up to scratch, although that would be visible anyway from non-compliance issues having arisen previously.</P>
        <P>When the incumbent is established to be in order, the section provides for fast-tracking of the application and permitting a five-year automatic extension of the licence.  All Members involved in this debate met people in the industry in private discussions and negotiations before the Bill was brought to the House.  The representatives of the industry make a cogent, well-argued and professional case for a ten-year extension.  In this amendment I propose a seven-year extension, which is a reasonable compromise between the position put by the industry and the five-year option adopted by the Minister.</P>
        <P>There are a number of salient reasons for supporting this proposal.  Operating a radio station or a broadcasting station of any type involves constant capital investment in terms of new equipment, offices and so forth.  That is true of any industry but the broadcasting industry requires particularly expensive equipment and facilities.  If there is a capital investment requirement, there must be security of tenure and good prospects for that investment from the point of view both of the financiers who provide the capital and of the investors or risk takers themselves.  There are also the issues of long-term planning and maintenance of investors.  There must be long-term planning in terms of planning capital investment, broadcasts, programmes and seeking capital for expansion and development.  There are planning issues in any business but particularly in the complex and volatile area of broadcasting, with its many daily challenges both domestically and internationally.  In fact, it is not always easy to maintain investors due to the mercurial nature of the business, so maintaining investors is important.  A seven-year option is therefore more workable.</P>
        <P>There is another aspect to this.  If the five years is perceived by the industry as too short, it might create a phoney competition.  The Minister of State and Members of the House live in the real world and are aware of what can happen.  Ways can be found around legislation.  In this case there is a risk of phoney applications being made, merely to create a spurious competition so the broadcaster can secure the full extension.  We must guard against that as it would cause a great deal of administrative hassle and delay in addition to a waste of public resources and expertise in the broadcasting authority.  That must be factored into our consideration of this.  I commend the amendment as a reasonable, proportionate measure which draws a fine balance between what the Minister, commendably, seeks to achieve with the five-year extension and the cogent and comprehensive argument of the industry, whose representatives probably <Col N="215"/>made a strong case to the Minister as well, for the ten-year extension.  Seven years appears to be a reasonable compromise.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 108 refers to section 134.  It is vital that all radio broadcasters, both independent and public service, get involved in digital radio broadcasting if it is to be successful in Ireland.  There is a high degree of uncertainty about digital radio and its future development.  It is only in its infancy and faces uncharted waters.  There is a shortage of information on the technology that will be used, what radio stations will get carriage on the digital platform and how that will pan out.  There is an open debate on the issue and doubts surround it.  There is a lack of comprehensive knowledge as it has not yet been worked through.  Every encouragement must be given to broadcasters to promote their participation in the digital project, specifically digital radio.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a four-year extension to the broadcasting contract for operators who embrace digital technology and make the necessary investment in it.  However, some of the arguments I made for amendment No. 83 hold for amendment No. 108.  The most powerful inducement to full participation in digital radio is the extension of the contract, as is recognised in the legislation.  A sizeable amount of financial and human resources is required for the development of digital broadcasting and a return on this investment is not guaranteed at this stage.  The contract extension must be sufficiently significant to induce the embrace of digital technology and to get the independent sector&rsquo;s involvement.</P>
        <P>I propose that the provision in the Bill which refers to not more than four years be changed to not more than seven years.  This will be a good incentive to broadcasters to grasp digital technology and I believe it will work.  That is the Bill&rsquo;s objective but I believe the amendment enhances the Bill and makes the provision more likely to work in the marketplace.  Ultimately, that is the important issue.  I commend both amendments and hope the Minister of State will accept them now or offer to incorporate them in amendments on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.  The provision for fast-tracking is welcome and might make the situation more efficient.  However, the halving of the period to five years creates difficulties for operators in financial terms.  Halving the term of the licence will force them to run their businesses on a short-term business plan, which is not good and effective planning.  It also inhibits investment, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned, particularly in machinery.  I occasionally participate in radio programmes and one of the stations with which I am involved tends to have dicky microphones.  We cannot persuade the owners to invest.  The margins are fairly tight and some stations are threatened with running at a loss.  There should be a level playing field to foster proper investment in premises, equipment, staff training and so forth.</P>
        <P>A radio station should not be punished simply because there is a lack of competition for its licence.  There should be a more level playing field in this regard also.  In fact, I would prefer to continue with the ten-year licence but, <i>faute de mieux</i>, I support Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I generally agree with the thrust of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendments because in any business one has to engage in long-term financial forecasting.  It is very difficult to do that within a five-year period.  There is also the issue of staff security and jobs.  A person in employment would feel very insecure if he or she did not know what would happen at the end of five years.  It is right and proper to link the two amendments because digital broadcasting and digital radio will be affected also because significant investment will be required to get involved in digital radio.  Given that it is uncharted waters, we do not know where we are going at this stage in regard to digital radio and we do not know what the take-up will be.  For those reasons the amendments make sense and I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="216"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to prolong the debate.  As I indicated on Second Stage I am broadly supportive of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendments.  There is a need to ensure the timespan of the licence is sufficient to give security and confidence in investing in radio stations into the future.  The proposed seven-year term of any contract is an issue.  On Second Stage I would have said that the ten-year licence should be restricted to seven years, although that probably would not have had the support of the industry.  While there is no amendment to that effect, there are issues pertaining to that aspect.</P>
        <P>There is provision in the Bill to restrict monopoly of ownership in this area, which is essential.  A colleague of mine mentioned to me today a concern he had in his area where two neighbouring local radio stations would have the one proprietor.  There is mention also of common programmes and so on which could get away from the local benefit of these radio stations.  That is regrettable.  That licences would be sold on does not apply to broadcasting licences but to licences in other areas.  The most notable one relates to the mobile phone industry where the State got a paltry return in comparison with the hundreds of millions of euro received by those who got the licence and ran the businesses for a short period and made a great deal of money out of it.  I have no difficulty with people making money but from the State&rsquo;s perspective the asset in general will be the licence.  We should ensure that is safeguarded.  I am supportive of the amendment and ask the Minister of State to look at it.  I accept that an increase in the five-year term to a seven-year term would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators have said, section 67 provides for a fast-track procedure in respect of radio licences where the incumbent is the only group interested in broadcasting to the chosen franchise area.  This section derives from the radio licensing review in 2004.  It tries to address the complaints of incumbent radio stations that they have to go to the significant expense of putting together an application for a new contract even when there is no other applicant.</P>
        <P>It provides that if within 28 days of the publication of a public notice by the contract awards committee of its intention to use the fast-track procedure for the awarding of a sound broadcasting contract no other submission is received, the committee may invite the incumbent to make proposals to amend the terms of its existing contract.  The fast-track system proposed under section 67(9) allows for a contract extension of up to five years.  A member of this or the other House would be delighted to get an extension of five years.  We realise we are speaking about a different situation here.</P>
        <P>The term of five years was selected on the basis that it gave the broadcasting authority of Ireland sufficient time to review the question why there were no other applicants for the contract and to make adjustments to its licensing strategy to encourage future applications.  A balance must be struck between ensuring existing radio contractors are not required to incur unnecessary expenses while at the same time encouraging competition in the sector.  In view of the points made by both sides, I will discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I hope we will be in a position to table a suitable amendment on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No.108 on the term of any contract extension under a simulcasting contract, section 134 provides that the BAI may extend by up to four years the term of an FM sound broadcasting contract provided that the sound broadcasting contractor concerned is willing to provide its sound broadcasting service on a digital sound broadcasting multiplex.  It should be noted that there is currently no proposal to switch-off FM radio and under the generous terms of section 134, broadcasters do not have to establish a multiplex platform but merely place their content on one to avail of the contract extension.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has made a very good case for that and there is much merit in his amendment.  Again, I will be pleased <Col N="217"/>to discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with a view to bringing forward a suitable amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and the positive nature of it.  I am pleased he will discuss it with the Minister with a view to bringing forward the necessary amendment on Report Stage to achieve these objectives.  My objective in tabling the amendments was to achieve the necessary balance.  If that can be achieved on Report Stage, I will be happy with that.  I see no merit in pressing them at this point.  We reserve the right to do that on Report Stage.  I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s words will produce results.</P>

B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir nach dtuigeann daoine i gc&oacute;na&iacute; an dearcadh agus meon a bh&iacute;onn ag muintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; nuair a bhraitheann siad nach bhfuil aon duine ann chun guth a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh sa D&aacute;il, sa tSeanad and in producing legislation.  People feel they are without a voice.  I cannot stress this strongly enough.  I know I am making no impact whatever on this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not a member of the committee on the Irish language because I got too frustrated sitting on it.  That committee will take decisions next week about the implementation of the Language Act.  These are simple things.  The Minister will note that there is very little quantification involved in what I have proposed already this morning and what I propose now.  A <Col N="218"/>quantity or percentage may be mentioned in respect of two issues.  That is not what I am about.  I am talking about recognising that Gaeltacht people, Irish language speakers and lovers of the Irish language also have an entitlement.  It must mean something when we talk about the first official language and that we will put in certain boundaries, controls and conditions chun a bheith cinnte go mbeidh seans ann do mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute;.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go mbeadh coinn&iacute;ollacha ann d&oacute;ibh, go mbeadh seans ann d&oacute;ibh agus go mbeadh fosta&iacute;ocht ann d&oacute;ibh.  Mar shampla, f&eacute;ach ar an gcoinn&iacute;ol a dh&eacute;ile&aacute;ileann le fogra&iacute;ocht, advertising.  As a sort of a diversion, seo ceann de na ruda&iacute; is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; i dtaobh na hEorpa.  When we were talking about the Lisbon treaty last week we mentioned the fact that Irish is now a recognised language in Europe and that therefore there are jobs for translators and for people working in the Irish language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important for the Minister of State to recognise one thing, even if he has to lock the door on his officials and keep them inside until they understand it.  People who live their lives through the Irish language are entitled to be creative and developmental in Irish and to work through Irish as well as to be educated through Irish.  For teachers and other people who are ag obair n&oacute; ag m&uacute;ineadh sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, is maith an rud &eacute; go mbeadh seans acu si&uacute;d f&eacute;achaint n&oacute; &eacute;isteacht le cl&aacute;r teilf&iacute;se n&oacute; raidi&oacute; a bhfuil Gaeilge ann agus go mbeadh siad in ann sin a fh&aacute;il ar an web agus websites as Gaeilge a fh&aacute;il chomh maith.  This is not difficult stuff.</P>
        <P>When I commented on the subtitles this morning the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, said that TG4 does not do subtitles in Irish.  He is right and I apologise to the House for misleading it.  I did not do it deliberately.  The point I was making is that the same technology is available to put subtitles in Irish as it is English even if it were to cost a bit more.  I will tell the Minister of State about one of my disappointments in this House.  I am going to the opening of a school in the Gaeltacht next Monday to show support for it and to help it.  We passed legislation five or six years ago about involuntarily committing people to mental hospitals.  Around that time we were debating several items of legislation to ensure that immigrants and asylum seekers would get their rights in Irish.  Given that I was born in a Gaeltacht town, went to school there and lived with Gaeltacht people I was able to ask that when people from the Gaeltacht were being committed to a mental hospital their rights would be explained to them and read to them in Irish.  It was not a huge amount to ask.  The Government of the day &mdash; the party of the Minister of State &mdash; would not accept the amendment.  It is difficult to explain that to a Gaeltacht person.  No costs  &mdash; or only minor costs &mdash; would have been involved as somebody would have had to write out the rights in Irish only once so that they could be read out.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has no idea how bad is the situation and the sort of cynicism and hypocrisy that is spread by the policies on the Irish language.  I am proposing a series of simple changes.  I can understand that aspects of them might cause a difficulty for the Minister of State.  I am prepared to listen to his reasons but I would like to hear how far he will go with the changes and that he and the Minister at least want to do this.  Caithfidh s&eacute; a thuiscint c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is a t&aacute; s&eacute; seo do mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute;, go bhfeicfid&iacute;s go bhfuil daoine anseo at&aacute; ag faire ar a gceartanna agus ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfeicfidh siad go bhfuil daoine anseo at&aacute; freagrach agus a nglacfaidh an c&uacute;ram cinnti&uacute; go gcuirfear cl&aacute;racha ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh i nGaeilge chomh maith le i mB&eacute;arla, go nd&eacute;anfar f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh jabanna agus fosta&iacute;ocht ann d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag obair sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; sin, d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;gra&iacute;ochta, producers, directors, etc., agus go mbeidh obair ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh tr&iacute; Ghaelainn.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach mbeadh?  I want to hear a positive response.  I also want to know why we cannot do it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I invited the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga to a meeting here recently.  I am considered to be an opponent of the Irish language.  The Minister of State might find that hard to believe.  I am <Col N="219"/>considered the enemy by many of the Irish language movements because I do not go along with a lot of the nonsense some of them come out with, but there are also very decent people with decent proposals.  I discussed the amendments with Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge and I found it to be very reasonable and practical.  I do not easily put forward demands on the Irish language.  I only put forward proposals that I believe are practical, reasonable, implementable and useful.  Braithim go bhf&eacute;adfainn an s&oacute;rt rialach sin a chur ar ghach aon cheann de na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agam.  T&aacute; siad praitici&uacute;il, r&eacute;as&uacute;nta, ind&eacute;anta agus &uacute;s&aacute;ideach do ghn&aacute;th mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; agus Gaeilgeoir&iacute;.  I appeal to the Minister of State because I really feel passionate about this.  I know that very often I am a lone voice on the Irish language because I oppose issues.  I am the only person that I know who tries to put forward an all-island policy on the Irish language.  I cannot find one person or political party to support me on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We will deal with the specific amendments.  Section 69 provides for the final terms to be inserted in any broadcasting contract made by the BAI.  Subsection (2)(<i>e</i>) requires a broadcaster to make a contractual commitment to the programme offering he or she has made at application stage.</P>
        <P>Section 66(2)(<i>d</i>) requires that one of the key criteria to be addressed by applicants and to be considered by the contracts awards committee in the award of a broadcasting contract is &ldquo;the quantity, quality, range and type of programmes in the Irish language and the extent of programmes relating to Irish culture proposed to be provided&rdquo;.  As a consequence I believe that the amendment is unnecessary and as such I do not propose to accept it.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment <i>a</i>88<i>a</i>, I am anxious to ensure that RTE and TG4, in establishing the membership of their respective audience councils, select persons to represent the interests of the viewing and listening public rather than individual sectoral interests.  An exception to this has been made in respect of ensuring that the interests of persons with a hearing or sight impairment are represented on any audience council, but this exception has been made given the critical need for feedback to public service broadcasters in respect of the particular broadcasting needs of such persons.  I also point to the requirement in section 96(5) for TG4 to endeavour to ensure that the members of the audience council of TG4 be proficient in the Irish language.  As such, I do not propose to accept amendment <i>a</i>88<i>a</i>.</P>

	<P>No, the previous bit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I also point to the requirement in section 96(5) for TG4 to endeavour to ensure that the members of the audience council of TG4 are proficient in the Irish language.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole presented a good case for amendments Nos. 89<i>a</i> and <i>a</i>90<i>a</i>.  There is merit in what the Senator is proposing and as such I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, with a view to amending section 101 on Report Stage. </P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 90<i>b</i>, the annual statement of commitments mechanism outlined in section 102 is intended as an annual and more detailed elaboration of commitments made by public service broadcasters in a public service broadcasting charter under section 102.  As a consequence the issues raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole are perhaps best addressed in the context of the review of the text of section 101.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
        <P>Regarding amendment 93<i>a</i>, section 106(6) provides that TG4 and RTE may offer terms benefiting advertisers who use the Irish language in their advertisements.  I believe this is the best means of encouraging advertising in Irish on TG4 and therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.  As regards amendment No. <i>a</i>96<i>a</i>, sections 114(1)(<i>b</i>) and 118(1)(<i>b</i>) for the first time permit both RTE and TG4 to expend public moneys on the maintenance of their websites reflecting the converging nature of broadcasting and information technologies.  RTE already provides Irish language content on its website in respect of its Irish language broadcasting output, in particular the Nuacht on RTE and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment 96<i>b</i>, section 114(3) already requires that RTE must provide &ldquo;a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English languages&rdquo;.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.  As regards amendments 100<i>a</i> and 100<i>b</i>, section 118(3)(<i>a</i>) already requires that TG4 must provide &ldquo;a comprehensive range of programmes, primarily in the Irish language&rdquo;.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment 104<i>a</i>, section 127 proposes the establishment of the Irish film channel primarily as a mechanism for showcasing the existing archive of Irish film works.  This channel in its own right will not be funding the production of films, this being a matter falling within the ambit of the Irish Film Board.  While I do not propose to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment as tabled, I propose to consider before Report Stage whether an amendment might be made to the text of the section referencing the potential to broadcast films in the Irish language where such film works are available.  The point was well made and I would be happy to discuss the matter with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply on those issues.  I take the point made by the Minister of State regarding amendment No. 104<i>a</i>.  I look forward to seeing the Minister&rsquo;s Report Stage amendment.  The points he made on amendments Nos. 90<i>b</i>, 93<i>a</i> and 96<i>b</i> are reasonable.  I welcome his proposal to amend section 101 in a similar way to my amendments Nos. 89<i>a</i> and <i>a</i>90<i>a</i> for which I thank him.  I look forward to seeing that amendment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has answered some of the questions dealing with the Gaeltacht area, Gaeilge and TG4.  It was very much putting people in their places which needs to be done in certain cases.  In some cases he has said that something is done through TG4 and I accept the points at which he has said that to me.  My amendment No. <i>a</i>83<i>a</i> proposed to insert, &ldquo;including programmes in the Irish language and programmes pertaining to Irish Culture&rdquo;.  The Minister of State pointed to the earlier version of what was required to be presented by the broadcaster <Col N="221"/>pitching for the licence, etc., with which I do not disagree.  However, in certain cases it is important to have a condition following which it would present what it would intend doing with respect of the section on which the Minister of State reflected.  I do not disagree with the section on which the Minister of State reflected and its provisions are as outlined by him.  However, based on my reading it does not require any condition.  Section 69 outlines the conditions under which these are done.  In this case I want it to be a condition go mbeadh s&eacute; mar choinn&iacute;ol &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>Amendment No 88<i>a</i> proposed to insert the following: &ldquo;including the Gaeltacht and Irish language community&rdquo;.  The Minister of State said he did not want to single out a particular section of the population.  That is not in line with Government policy.  The Government singles out the Gaeltacht time and again because that is the source of the language.  For that reason Government policy since the foundation of the State has been supportive of the Gaeltachta&iacute; in various ways, shapes and forms along the way.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say he will not individualise a section.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. <i>a</i>90<i>a</i>, the audience council for RTE as opposed to the one for TG4 should contain some people with Gaeilge who should feel comfortable about dealing with that part of it.  That is something we also need to consider and it is not just confined to TG4.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first two amendments are the ones on which I feel most strongly.  It is important to make special arrangements for the Gaeltacht, as I have sought to do in amendment No. <i>a</i>88<i>a</i>, which proposes to amend section 96.  It should be a condition of the franchise or licence that the broadcaster should broadcast certain programmes in the Irish language.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;s&uacute;il gur leor d&oacute;ibh insint n&oacute; taispe&aacute;int d&uacute;inn na cl&aacute;racha Gaelacha n&oacute; cult&uacute;rtha a bh&eacute;as &aacute; chraobhscaoileadh acu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh s&eacute; mar choinn&iacute;oll sa reachta&iacute;ocht cl&aacute;racha a chraobhscaoileadh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, roimh aon chead&uacute;nas a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag cur business plan le ch&eacute;ile whatever business plan.</P>
        <P>It is also fairer.  People can include the Irish language in their pitch.  However, if we want to have a level playing pitch, just as we require broadcasters to broadcast a certain amount of news to get their licences there is no reason not to require a certain amount of Irish language.  I am not talking about a large amount.  However, at least when broadcasters are presenting a business plan and pitching for a licence they should all equally reflect that amount as a minimum.  If some broadcasters want to do more that is their business.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach domsa go mbeidh s&eacute; mar choinn&iacute;oll go nd&eacute;anfar an m&eacute;id sin.  I ask the Minister of State to think again with regard to the issue that it be conditional and also that we make special arrangements for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language community.</P>

        <P>I support the Senator&rsquo;s request for a representative, not just of the Gaeltacht area but people who are interested in Irish, to be on the audience council.  That should be a statutory requirement.  We will fail in the promotion of Irish if we exclusively concentrate on Gaeltacht areas.  I agree with much of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  The Gaeltacht is under threat because of the influences of English channel radio and television stations being beamed into homes every evening.  That will erode the knowledge of Irish, particularly among young people.  Therefore, <Col N="222"/>the country at large needs to be exposed to good quality Irish channels.  Bilingual channels can be very beneficial in the promotion of Irish.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage I mentioned Liam &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s programme &ldquo;Trom agus &Eacute;adrom&rdquo; and the great benefit that was to the promotion of the Irish language.  He did that in a very nice and easy way.  People watched that programme which was entertaining.  There is no reason we should not have such programmes on television and every reason we should.  Much rubbish is beamed out on televisions.  Quality programmes that promote or expose the public to the Irish language would be welcomed by the Irish speaking population and by those whose Irish is quite rusty.  It will not happen unless we encourage and chart a path for it to happen.  I strongly support that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened attentively to the three Senators and we are trying to achieve the same goal.  It is a matter of how one does that.  Section 66 of the Bill lists the criteria the contract awards committee must have regard to when an application is being considered, including, in section 66(2)(<i>c</i>) &ldquo;the quality, range and type of the programmes proposed to be provided by each applicant or, if there is only one applicant, by that applicant&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Subsection (<i>f</i>) refers to &ldquo;the desirability of having a diversity of services in the area specified in the notice catering for a wide range of tastes including those of minority interests&rdquo;.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a case for making special arrangements for people living in Gaeltacht areas.  In this Bill we have taken the approach that we are encouraging applicants rather than forcing them to do something.  Legislation can be over-prescriptive.  I take on board what is being said.  I cannot go any further than I have already done.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister.  The audience council is one area we could examine and we could make some new proposals on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and welcome the openness with which he has dealt with this, which I appreciate.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point and I had read section 66(2)(<i>d</i>) which specifies regard for &ldquo;the quantity, quality, range and type of programmes in the Irish language&rdquo;.  The only difficulty is that as that is written, one could receive a full licence without producing anything.  If none of the parties making a presentation proposed any Irish language measures, the contract awards committee could not reject the applicants on the grounds that they have no proposals that satisfy section 66(2)(<i>d</i>).  It is not a failing matter.  It is the difference between an essential and a desirable qualification.</P>
        <P>To simplify it to one line, it is like appointing somebody to a job as opposed to offering that person a contract.  When appointing people to a job, certain boxes must be ticked, some of which are desirable and some of which are essential.  The purpose of my amendment was to make this an essential requirement.  The Minister has answered me that it is desirable.  I want it to be worded in such a way that applicants must do some Irish language programming.</P>
        <P>I am happy with the point the Minister and his officials make, that they are not quantified.  I am not trying to push this over any line.  However, if he could reframe one part of it so that an essential part of an organisation&rsquo;s pitch or presentation and a requirement of its licence would be that there would be some Irish language programming, I would be happy with that. <Col N="223"/> I do not need to have my amendment accepted, but I need this to be an essential requirement as opposed to a desirable yardstick.  I am happy for the Minister to take that back and discuss it.  I ask the officials to take that on board.  N&iacute;lim chun thuile a r&aacute; mar gheall ar sin.  I appreciate the openness with which the Minister has met my points.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 85:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="9">In page 84, before section 78, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="9">&ldquo;78.&mdash;(1) The Authority shall not conclude a satellite content contract with a person for the purpose of material being supplied for its transmission as a broadcasting service (intended for reception in the State) by means of a satellite device unless satisfied that recipients of the service will be in a position to receive by satellite device each free to air service provided by RT&Eacute;, TG4 and the television service programme contractor as a basic programme service.</P>

        <P Just="Right" el="7">&mdash; (Senator Michael McCarthy)</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to put this matter in simple terms.  If we do not make progress, I will bring it back on Report Stage in more technical terms.  I will speak as simply as I can.</P>
        <P>This concerns broadcasting and has much to do with the fact we are changing from medium wave to long wave.  While this is not the business of the legislation, it is what prompted me to bring this issue forward.  When RTE decided to kill medium wave and change over to long wave, I supported that approach because long wave is a clearer and better signal than medium wave.  At that time, I recognised it would be better.</P>
        <P>There was a huge issue for emigrants in Britain in particular, who felt they could no longer listen to GAA matches on a Sunday and various other programmes during the course of a weekend.  Although long wave is clearer and one can listen to it on a car radio throughout the UK, the problem is that at night time it is subject to greater interference.  I was in the UK some months ago and noticed that in parts where I should have received long wave on my car radio, I could not receive it.  I raised this at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and with RTE.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Since then I have discovered something which has made me quite angry, and it is an issue of importance to the GAA, emigrant groups, cultural groups, Irish language groups and so on, namely, reception.  I discovered we have capacity to broadcast on long wave at 500 KW.  That is the power output that was being sent from the Summerhill transmitter when it was operated by Radio Tara and owned by an independent music broadcaster based in London.  Nowadays, apparently, it is only sending out a 250 KW signal which, consequently, cannot be picked up in parts of London.  I tried it last weekend in north London and I could barely get a signal although it should be easily received.</P>
        <P>I will explain why it should be easily received.  The station which is interfering with RTE long wave at night is Radio Morocco or Radio Algeria &mdash; I have forgotten which.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="226"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Radio Algeria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is cutting across RTE.  Radio Algeria is broadcasting at full strength but we are not.  I could go on.</P>
        <P>I feel let down by RTE on this issue.  I argued with those who argued against the elimination of medium wave and I stated that long wave was better.  Long wave is technically better as long as we are using our output, which we are entitled to do.</P>
        <P>I do not want the Minister to come back and tell me that under the terms of the current licence we are only allowed to broadcast at 250 KW.  That is not the issue.  I am not asking him to be responsible for RTE.  I am insisting that we broadcast at full strength where we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel I have been misled by RTE on this issue.  Other groups feel the same.  No one has been told until now about the reduction in the transmission output.</P>
        <P>This is not a problem for which the Minister should be answerable and that is not the point of my amendment.  Its point is to take it from the hands of RTE that it could reduce output at its own discretion.  I want us to use our full output.  I want the Irish message to be received as widely as possible.  If we were broadcasting at 500 KW or more, we could be received in Brussels and all of the UK, never mind London.  There is a big issue.  I know Senator Donie Cassidy shares my view about the importance of long wave being received here.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the issue in simple terms and can outline it in technical terms also, if that is required.  What is happening at present is unacceptable.  Our message is being diluted and not received, and all because we are not using what is available to us.  I ask the Minister of State to concede to us on this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow Senator Norris to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for so graciously yielding because we are both on exactly the same wavelength on this issue, so to speak.  I am happy to know that had I not been present, the Senator would have been able to move this amendment for me.</P>
        <P>Our amendment is similar to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment, with some additional elements such as the maintenance of the proper equipment and taking on board the fact the Government may be persuaded by argument on all sides of the House to use the maximum transmission power.  This is important.</P>
        <P>Like many of my colleagues, I have had extensive briefing from a variety of groups on this issue.  I wish to put on record the view of a senior engineer with an interest in the area of broadcasting engineering techniques.  He states:</P>
        <P LI="1">What does concern me is the capability of the Government in times of crisis to reach the entire nation in a broadcast.  I do not believe that there is national coverage with FM transmitters.  Sky&rsquo;s own figures will show that they do not have national coverage and experiments have shown that coverage from the long wave transmitter is not adequate at present.  Listening to it with a battery powered radio will verify this.  If we were to experience an event similar to the blackouts in north-eastern US or Italy [we remember the electricity blackouts there] in the autumn of 2003, the Government would potentially be without an effective means of communicating with the population.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P FLI="0">That happened in the life of the publication of the recent booklet about how to cope with emergencies.  The situation at present contradicts this because RTE is operating the long wave transmitter on less than full power.  Long wave has been downgraded.  It is not being managed or maintained to cover needs in case of emergency.  We know the Tullamore transmitter has been closed and, as we have learned, the FM service does not provide seamless coverage.</P>
        <P>I recently travelled by train to Limerick and found that on certain parts of the journey there was no signal, although one can get the commercial stations, including those from Dublin.  I was able to listen to Newstalk 106 but I could not get RTE Radio 1.  Members should try it on the Enterprise to Northern Ireland.  Half of the time, the signal is lost.  Why is this?  Why do we not care about these people?</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to emigrant populations in London whose service is interfered with by Radio Algeria.  In Australia where there was a similar problem, they permitted the radio stations to double the strength of their transmissions.  While they double it, we are halving it, although we face the same situation.  It is idiotic.</P>
        <P>There is also the question of weather forecast broadcasts to the fishing fleet at sea.  The current level of power is not adequate to reach our fishing fleet in all emergency situations.  Our brave fishermen, God knows, have been hammered, clobbered and sold out by successive administrations and are now getting whacked by the European Union, but we are not even providing proper cover for emergency services.  This is all in the context of a decision for some reason, presumably economic, to downgrade the power output to approximately half strength.  This unquestionably must reduce service.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the question of preparing for a nuclear emergency and major emergencies.  We know that people will be taking shelter, perhaps in a building that has poor reception.  Most modern buildings are insulated due to environmental considerations, heat loss and all the rest, and foil insulation in particular will effectively block out a large part of the signal.  The booklet tells people to use battery powered radios, presumably because of possible failures in commercial power output.  If one is using a battery powered radio, one is using a weakened receiver and receiving a weakened signal.  How can that possibly be satisfactory?</P>
        <P>The long wave transmitter is not managed and maintained.  In the days of the commercial radio station, Atlantic 252, to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred, it used its full allocation of power.  This transmitter, which is now used to broadcast the national station, is being downgraded to half power.  Reducing power reduces the service and it is not in keeping with the needs of an emergency or our emigrants.</P>
        <P>Turning to a technical area, electromagnetic pollution has increased in recent years and according to the predicted levels contained in the ITU-R p.372 figures &mdash; this is a technical matter which I do not fully understand &mdash; these high levels of magnetic pollution have been in existence for 30 years.  This is the reason Australia has permitted its stations to double their power output.</P>
        <P>A long wave transmitter needs four times the power of its medium wave counterpart to provide a protected service but RTE has made the questionable decision to reduce the power of RTE Radio 1 on long wave 252 KHz.  BBC Radio 4 Droitwich, which is only 100 km away, requires a booster from London on medium wave.  That offers some idea of the matter.  Since the medium wave closure, London, the south east and near Europe suffer interference at night time from a station transmitting a signal which is 30 to 40 times the strength of long wave 252 KHz.  At night, medium wave travels further and overleaps long wave into Europe, which is how Radio Luxembourg was once received in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This policy is contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which pledged to serve the entire island.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, to which I contributed, makes <Col N="228"/>provision for Irish communities overseas.  Radio services were introduced into that Act by an amendment I made.  The original measures in the Act pertained to television services but radio broadcasts were left out until I proposed their inclusion.  I have, therefore, a particular interest in this area.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting to our own people in emergency situations is a serious matter.  I was recently on a television programme with Brian Keenan, who was held hostage in Beirut.  He kept himself going partly because he was able to hear RTE broadcasts.  The question also arises of our fishing fleet.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a menu of amendments from which to chose, including Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s, although he might concede that the amendments proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and myself go further in terms of securing the methods and technical aspects of transmission.  I urge the Minister to use this legislation to close the gap created by the discontinuation of medium wave and to ensure a proper service is guaranteed throughout the island, to emigrants and, if I can make my own little case, to my house in the mountains of Cyprus.  I would dearly love to receive RTE once more.</P>
        <P>In regard to the emergency booklet, it was slightly farcical in the first place and was wonderfully mocked in a musical performance on RTE.  The intention behind it was serious but one has to question its application in a situation where people who take the Government&rsquo;s advice to listen on battery powered radio would probably hear nothing.  Perhaps, if they are lucky, their final moments would be comforted by a broadcast from Radio Alg&eacute;rie.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand the numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure about that.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by a range of interest groups and technical experts that RTE is operating the long wave transmitter at just above half its power capacity.  Reducing power clearly reduces service, so the move has had a detrimental effect on broadcasts to emigrants and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The issue is particularly serious for our emigrant communities.  One of my greatest privileges in public life, both as chair of my local authority and as a Senator, has been my visits to the Cavan associations of Luton and London, where I met a range of people and saw that our vibrant emigrant community has retained close cultural ties with this country.  These emigrants dearly love Ireland and its people and they revel in its success.  They have every right to receive clear broadcasts of RTE programmes.  That should not be negotiable.  Anybody who has met emigrant communities in England could not but be inspired by their kinship with and love of this country and their desire to maintain links.  We should not be equivocal about that.</P>
        <P>Serious problems could arise in an emergency.  Who, for example, can be brave enough to say a nuclear accident will never take place?  A nuclear accident would require people to take shelter in buildings with poor receptions, so maximum power would be needed to broadcast instructions.  These problems would be exacerbated where shelters are located in mountainous areas.  RTE&rsquo;s long wave transmitter is not maintained with this in mind.</P>
        <P>Electromagnetic pollution levels have increased and they are causing a buzzing sound on radios in the south east, London and in near Europe.  A long wave transmitter needs four times the power of its medium wave counterpart to protect a service from this interference.  However, <Col N="229"/>RTE has made the questionable decision to reduce power on RTE Radio 1 long wave 252 KHz by approximately half.  Since the discontinuation of medium wave and the reduction of power, RTE broadcasts to the south east, London and near Europe suffer interference at night from a signal 30 to 40 times more powerful than RTE&rsquo;s.  At night, medium wave travels further and overleaps long wave in the same way that Radio Luxembourg used to reach Ireland.  That brings back memories of my childhood, when I listened to that station in my bedroom with my radio under the bed clothes.</P>
        <P>Closing medium wave transmitters and reducing long wave power by half results in a poor service for Northern Ireland and the UK.  That is a serious matter in the context of the Good Friday agreement and our kinship with and moral responsibility for our emigrant communities.  It is also serious in the context of the quality of life of the people in the south east who are affected.  I empathise with Senator Walsh in that regard.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue.  We have been approached by interest groups and by highly skilled technical personnel.  As Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris stated, we can forward to the Minister of State or to his officials, privately, the technical material we have received.  It would be ludicrous to read that material into the record.  Suffice it to say that this is critical in respect of the quality and area of coverage of broadcast signals and the rights of emigrants and citizens in this country.  The Minister of State must be reasonable and accept the amendment.  I have no doubt he will do so.  Irish emigrants will be watching carefully to see how we deal with this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 114(1)(<i>d</i>) provides, for the first time in legislation, an obligation for the national broadcaster to assist and co-operate with public bodies regarding the dissemination of information &ldquo;in the event of a major emergency&rdquo;.  It is important that the transmission capacity be available in order for this obligation to be honoured in an effective manner.  Studies have been carried out by people who claim the signal has diminished to a significant degree since the change from medium wave.  Given that major emergencies are covered in the Bill, one could argue that there is a requirement on RTE to ensure it has the capacity to broadcast effectively in the event of an emergency occurring.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers stated, those in the maritime industry, particularly fishermen, depend on radio broadcasts for weather forecasts, which are extremely important in the context of their work and for ensuring their safety.  It is important that these people should be able to receive radio signals from the national broadcaster.</P>
        <P>It was also stated that emigrants abroad should be able to receive these signals in order that they might remain in touch with what is happening at home.  The position with regard to citizens living here is similar.  It would be a pity if we were to move in the opposite direction.</P>
        <P>I spent a holiday in France in 1981.  I remember it well because my daughter &mdash; she was only a year old at the time and we did not bring her with us &mdash; keeps reminding me about it.  She refers to it as the holiday when she was left at home.  We travelled through Normandy and Brittany in France and had no difficulty tuning in to Raidi&oacute; &Eacute;ireann, as it was then, and listening to the news and other programmes.  Almost 30 years later, it appears we are going in the wrong direction and moving away from a position where people might tune in to the national station when abroad.</P>
        <P>I understand the Tullamore medium wave transmitter could operate, both day and night, at a capacity of up to 500 KW and that the long-wave transmitter is limited to operating at 62.5 KW at night.  This means the capacity is reduced by eight times, which must have some impact.  People are campaigning strongly in respect of this matter.  Was the change from medium to long wave carried out in order to save energy?  I do not know whether that was the case.  However, a compelling case is being made to the effect that this matter should be assessed <Col N="230"/>independently of RTE.  Perhaps the Department could carry out such an assessment in order to be satisfied as to what is the measurement.  If the anecdotal information we have received is correct, there is a case to be made for RTE to restore the medium wave service.  Questions have been raised in respect of RTE and its presentation in respect of this topic.</P>
        <P>We are currently focused on developing an all-island economy.  In such circumstances, it is incongruous that the radio signals provided by the national broadcaster are not available on all parts of the island.  The latter should be one of the criteria used to assess the acceptability of what is on offer at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s views on RTE.  We should not be going backwards.  Some 30 years ago I had a radio programme on RTE and it was received widely across Scotland, on the Welsh coast and in Liverpool, Manchester and Coventry.  Even when there was a full-blown medium wave service, it was always difficult to broadcast a signal to the north London area.</P>
        <P>What is happening represents a retrograde step on the part of RTE.  The station published its accounts earlier today and these indicate that its radio service is showing a profit.  At a time when the backs of those who run companies are to the wall, the national broadcaster is not playing its part.  That never happened in the past.  Cathal Goan, the chief executive of RTE, is one of the greatest Irishmen I have ever known and he should intervene immediately.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the Minister of State give serious consideration to investigating this matter before Report Stage.  The House would then be in a position to make a decision in respect of it.  While I agree with the majority of Senator Walsh&rsquo;s remarks, I am of the view that this matter is far too serious to be left to an independent inquiry.  Immediate action is required.  If we can promote Irish products abroad by means of advertisements on RTE radio, why are we not using the transmitter in the Slieve Bloom mountains, which has huge capacity, to send signals far and wide across most of Europe?  RTE has been granted a licence to broadcast such signals.  What is happening is that pennies are being saved but euros are being lost, which is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the fishermen and radio broadcasts.  We are all concerned about the fishing industry.  The marine is a valuable national resource.  The Gaelic Athletic Association has made a tremendous contribution to society for many years.  However, we are turning our backs on these interests.  People in the UK have for many years listened to broadcasts of Gaelic games each Sunday on RTE.  As a result, Ireland and its culture have been promoted in that jurisdiction since 1926.</P>
        <P>I am concerned with regard to the broadcast of mass and the services of other denominations on Sunday mornings.  It is a disgrace that we are obliged to listen to particular programmes each Sunday morning.  Why in the name of goodness do we not switch our attention away from the commercial world on Sundays to allow those unfortunate people who are confined to their homes and who may not be fit enough to attend church to listen to religious services?  Why are such services &mdash; Catholic, Protestant or whatever &mdash; not broadcast for the benefit of those to whom I refer?</P>

	<P>The national broadcaster has certain duties and obligations.  This is the Oireachtas and, in the context of this legislation, its Members should stand up for the people to whom I refer.  Enough is enough with regard to commercialism.  For at least two <Col N="231"/>hours each Sunday morning, the religious services of the various churches should be broadcast on all wavelengths.</P>
        <P>What is happening is unacceptable.  As Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I must make the strongest protest to RTE, its chief executive and the chairman of the RTE authority, who has a direct responsibility to the Oireachtas in respect of matters relating to the majority of the members of the public who pay their licence fees.  Before the House takes Report Stage of the Bill next week, I want RTE to provide an assurance in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>We want to support RTE in every possible way.  The station has done tremendous work for generations.  It should not, however, take its eye off the ball and reduce its broadcasting capacity, particularly at a time when pleas are being made in respect of the need to support Irish industry and products.</P>

        <P>It goes without saying that all of us who supported the Lisbon reform treaty are deeply disappointed with the outcome of the referendum, not just for ourselves but for Ireland.  We are in uncharted waters and it is difficult to know where this takes us.  However, one fact is absolutely and crystal clear &mdash; the people have made their decision, which must be respected.  The Taoiseach made that clear last Friday and again today in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Government strongly supported the Lisbon treaty on the basis that the 27 member states had reached an agreement which we all believed sincerely would allow the European Union to work more effectively, efficiently and democratically in the interests of the people in all member states, including Ireland.  We also believed sincerely it would equip the countries of Europe to deal with the global challenges facing us collectively and individually, big or small.  We also believed that Ireland&rsquo;s national interests would, as they are now, be best served by being at the centre of the Union playing a constructive, realistic, engaged role.</P>
        <P>As I have stated, we are now in uncharted territory, and that must have some question mark over it.  Whatever else we disagreed on in the recent campaign, there was close to unanimous agreement that Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of Europe.  It is interesting that the Flash Eurobarometer poll reported in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> demonstrates that the majority of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; &mdash; some 80% &mdash; support Irish membership of the European Union.  They felt positive about such membership.</P>
        <P>In our support for the treaty we were joined by all but one of the political parties, representative groups, ICTU, IBEC, chambers of commerce and other business organisations, the IFA, ICMSA, Macra Na Feirme, ICOS and others who played a committed part at national and local level.  I am very grateful for this support.</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P>As has been clearly stated by the Taoiseach, we will need time to analyse the result properly and to look for an acceptable and practical way forward.  The result of the referendum brings about a position of considerable uncertainty, significant difficulties and in an uncertain economic period, it brings very distinct potential problems.  It will not be resolved easily and the Government and our colleagues in Europe understandably will need time to reflect.</P>
        <P>We must reflect not only on the way forward for Ireland but also on the way forward for the EU, which will take time.  There is a need to avoid snap judgments and hasty decisions at what is a very important point in the history of Ireland&rsquo;s hugely successful engagement with the European Union.  This engagement has been a central pillar of our national development since 1973.</P>
        <P>Along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, I attended Monday&rsquo;s meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, where our counterparts were briefed on the referendum.  There was an understanding of our position and of our need to reflect in light of the result of our referendum.  There was also a wide degree of disappointment.  On the positive side there was no attempt to isolate us.</P>
        <P>There was a real sense of solidarity at the meeting and in the bilaterals which the Minister and I had during the course of the day and half in Luxembourg.  Members of the House will be aware from media reports that there is also a general and very strong desire that ratification should continue in other member states.  Member States do not want to abandon what they all see as the very real advances made in this treaty.</P>
        <P>In my contacts with my counterparts I stressed the need for us to take sufficient time to analyse what has happened and to consult, both domestically and with our European partners, in order to find an agreed way forward.  I recalled the Union&rsquo;s record of success in overcoming past setbacks of this kind and expressed the hope that, working together, we can do so again on this occasion.  As has been stated time and again over the weekend, we are very distinctly in uncharted waters and it is very hard to see where we go from here.  As of today, 18 member states have ratified the treaty and the 19th will ratify it within the next 48 hours.  The others are on the cusp of ratification and they want to move forward with a treaty they believe is in the interests of their citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Council, which begins tomorrow, provides an early opportunity for the Taoiseach to give his initial assessment of the referendum result and its implications.  An important point which the Government will stress in the period ahead is that the Irish people continue to be committed to the European Union and Ireland has not turned Eurosceptic.  It is interesting to reflect on the European Commission survey mentioned earlier, which was taken immediately after the referendum and which was reported today.  It provides some interesting insights.</P>
        <P>It showed very high levels of support for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU among those who voted against the treaty.  Some 80% of people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, as I mentioned already, support Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership.  It is reasonable to suggest that 100% of those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; also support Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership.  Where do we go from here?  This is a very positive and important place for us to begin our analysis and understanding of the outcome of Thursday&rsquo;s referendum.</P>
        <P>Another very interesting point which was also reported in the press was that approximately three quarters of those who voted against the treaty believed the Government can somehow renegotiate exceptions.  At this point, 18 member states have effectively ratified the treaty and it will not be long before 25 or 26 have ratified it.  The Government will have to work hard to <Col N="233"/>reflect the Irish people&rsquo;s concerns as we move forward.  At the same time we must respect that there are 26 other parties to this agreement.</P>
        <P>The point was made in the D&aacute;il today that we should stick with the facts.  That is correct but it is not what happened in the recent campaign.  Every conceivable distortion of facts was used by some element or other of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigns to demonise the European Union.  We were warned about conscription, abortion, euthanasia, the death penalty, the incarcerations of young children &mdash; nothing was too outlandish to put into the mix.</P>
        <P>One fact that is undisputable is that the sight of Monsieur Le Pen and his ilk, the United Kingdom Independence Party and the virulently anti-EU foreign-owned newspapers rejoicing at our decision must give pause for thought to anybody with the welfare or well-being of Ireland at heart.  The sight of UKIP members celebrating Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in an Irish pub in Brussels &mdash; using the tricolour as a tablecloth for their drinks &mdash; is hard to stomach.  The same people in the EU Parliament today were decked out in green jerseys.  There is also some irony that the newspapers from across the water which have attacked the EU for decades presented themselves as pro-Irish, pro-EU and even pro-agriculture when hostility to this nation and the Irish people is deeply embedded in their history and editorial lines, going back decades.  However, their sincerity in this matter is for history to judge.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments in the D&aacute;il that our debate should be part of the national discussion.  We must undertake this debate and be honest with ourselves now that we, as a people, have taken our decision.  Today is about reflecting not only on the events of last week, but on what they might mean for our nation in the years and decades to come.</P>
        <P>There are lessons to be learned from the campaign for Ireland and for the EU.  There is a need to reconnect the Union with citizens and we have said this for some time.  There is a particular need to bring to light the continuing benefits of the Union to all and there is also a need to simplify our message about the EU, including about the Union&rsquo;s laws and treaties.  There is a need for the Union to speak to all of its citizens in language to which they can relate and to consign to the waste basket the jargon, the special language and terminologies that exclude people.  There is a need to try to centre debates on the EU on the facts.  I found it striking in Brussels last Monday that so many people, all seasoned politicians, were genuinely surprised by the level of misinformation and untruths that circulated throughout the campaign.  People were amazed and affronted in equal measure by the distortions we saw reflected.  One person asked me how Sinn F&eacute;in could, on the one hand, discuss the Union as some form of militaristic venture when the Deputy First Minister in the North recently praised the EU, in most extraordinary terms, as a force for peace.  It was a speech I would have been proud to have written.  He spoke of the peace the EU brought to the continent, the progress it brought to Ireland and the help it gave during our peace process.  Yet his colleagues down here demonised Europe on every possible occasion.  They spoke of a militaristic Europe to which we should not sign up.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not address that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They speak from both sides of their mouths.  There is a need to examine why people voted against the treaty and, most importantly of all, to establish how best we can address these reasons.</P>
        <P>As a country, we now face just about the greatest diplomatic and international challenge in our modern history.  We have to convince ourselves and, more importantly, others that we want to find a solution that places us at the heart of Europe.  I agree with the comments made earlier <Col N="234"/>in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Gilmore that we should not lose sight of the advances that have been made through our EU membership, particularly in the area of social Europe.  I do not believe last Thursday&rsquo;s vote should be seen as a rejection of Europe or of the need to continue to improve the Union&rsquo;s functioning and effectiveness; nor should it be seen as a sign that we as a nation have changed either our affection for Europe or our desire to stay part of the Union.</P>
        <P>My view remains that Ireland&rsquo;s future is bound with that of Europe.  We now face uncertainty and a real challenge and we will have to face both with great care.  It is incumbent on us to ensure we respond carefully to the decision of the Irish people and with the interests of Ireland at heart.  As I said at the outset, they made a clear decision last Thursday and it now remains for us to pick up from where that decision leaves us.  We must lead this country forward into a future which is less certain than it was last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that expos&eacute;.  I consider the European Union to be a fantastic and extraordinary project in which we have played a part for 35 years.  We have, in many ways, shaped the Europe in which we now live and have ownership of it.  We have benefitted greatly from the EU and have a keen interest in ensuring it functions effectively, democratically and in a transparent manner.  I make no apologies for having supported the Lisbon treaty and I am happy that my constituency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, had the highest &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote at 63.5%.  Many constituencies also had high &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; votes.  </P>
        <P>Before we move on we must examine the reasons for the failure of the campaign.  The primary responsibility for this campaign lies with the Government, which was preoccupied with its own affairs.  It was distracted by the problems of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, its defence of him, the outcome of the Mahon tribunal, the change of leadership, the appointment of the new Cabinet and so on.  The Government was preoccupied with its internal affairs and the result was that the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign proceeded without a concerted Government effort, apart from the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who is with us today.  The fault for the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign lies primarily with the Government and mistakes made in the first Nice treaty referendum were repeated.  The Lisbon treaty was not lost on its merits; it was lost due to the ineffectiveness of the Government&rsquo;s campaign.</P>
        <P>There were various reasons for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There were protest votes and we now know, through the European Commission survey, that 40% of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; did so because they did not know the provisions of the treaty.  We know that 75% of people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; wanted a better deal and considered one could be achieved through a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  They felt there was no downside to voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There is also a category of people who vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Europe in every referendum.  I do not wish to simplify the situation and the reality is we must analyse the reasons for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote; we cannot guess.  This matter raises questions relating not only to the attitudes of people to Europe but also to politicians, particularly the established parties.  There is an issue that trust in politicians has been undermined in recent years due to tribunals and investigations, most recently one that related to the highest political office in the land and forced the resignation of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Given this background, people have no trust in the Government nor in people who say, &ldquo;There is no need to read this treaty.  I have not read it.  Vote &ldquo;Yes&ldquo;, Europe has been good for you&rdquo;.  This type of trust does not exist after years of tribunals.</P>
        <P>The main focus of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign was that Ireland can get a better deal.  This means we must re-engage with Europe on what can be done to address some of the concerns that have been raised.  We must identify the concerns that can be addressed.  As I said earlier today, the logic of Libertas, Sinn F&eacute;in and the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign is that we will renegotiate a Lisbon B treaty that will have to be ratified.  It could, on constitutional grounds, be ratified by the <Col N="235"/>Oireachtas but it would, most likely, go to another referendum.  The Government has not admitted that is the road we are to take but the logic of both the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigns suggests that a renegotiation of some sort will take place.  This process has already begun.</P>
        <P>What makes me uncomfortable about the current situation is that our new best friends in Europe appear to be the UK Independence Party, the far right of the Conservative Party in Britain, Jean-Marie Le Pen and Eurosceptics in France, the Netherlands and other member states.  I do not feel our future lies in such company.  I think that participating fully in the process of European integration and helping to shape that process is where the interests of this country lie.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State pointed out that 80% of people are in favour of the European Union but this only highlights the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  Irish people are committed to the European project and see Europe as benign and positive for Ireland.  Given the basis upon which people voted and the lack of information they felt they had at hand to vote on the treaty, it also highlights that failure.</P>
        <P>We have to identify and address the issues that have been raised.  In the cold light of day, as the campaign has ended and as we re-engage with Europe on how these issues can be addressed, what will be exposed in the next six or 12 months is that the many and varied issues that have been raised by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign are fictitious.  There are genuine concerns about Europe, about democracy and about where we are going.  While Lisbon would not have represented a great leap forward, there is a concern about what, ultimately, will be the shape of Europe.  It is these concerns which must be dealt with.  However, with regard to the issues of workers&rsquo; rights, taxation, threats to the public service and abortion, in the cold light of day after the referendum campaign many of these will be exposed and many people will feel they have been misled by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign was lost not on the merits of the treaty but by the failure of the Government campaign in terms of timing and getting the information out to people.  It will take time to complete the process of analysis of negotiations with Brussels, but the fact that the ratification process is proceeding today in the House of Lords shows the limited scope for renegotiation.  We may argue about the legal issues of the treaty not going ahead if one country says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but the hard political reality is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the treaty is not ratified, it is up to each member state.  The harsh reality is that it is very likely that if Britain proceeds other member states will also proceed.  We will have 26 member states that have ratified the treaty.  Ultimately, we will have to decide whether we want to remain in the centre of Europe or enter the slow lane.  Ireland has long experience of being on the periphery in Europe and we do not want to go back there.</P>

	<P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and congratulate him on his performance and his efforts to steer the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  It was a marathon effort for him.  I am disappointed with Senator Regan and his comments.  We are always looking into ourselves and playing the blame game.  I could easily stand here and apply blame across the floor of the House, but I will not do that.  It is not in my interest to do so.  My interest is in working together to see where we can go from here.  That is what this debate is all about.  It is a pity that Senator Regan stood up and played the blame game as he is forever doing.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not blaming the people for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I am just saying we have to discuss where we are now.  We are in a period of reflection and listening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The listening should have been done before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is great at it.</P>
        <P>What we must do now is to listen to and engage with the public.  We tried to do it during the campaign and it did not work.  Democracy has won and I must accept the result.  We must consider what happened and analyse where the issues were.  We must analyse the diverse range of concerns that were expressed and decide where to go from here.  No decisions can be made in the short term; there is no quick fix.  I wish the Taoiseach well in presenting his case to the Council tomorrow and ensuring we come out of this in the best way in the future.</P>
        <P>There are 27 member states and it looks as though all of the other 26 will ratify the treaty.  Where will that leave us?  We used to be at the centre of the decision making process in Europe, but this makes us vulnerable.  How can we best go forward?  The issues mentioned by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side include taxation, neutrality, abortion and euthanasia.  I spent my time during the campaign discussing what was in the treaty rather than trying to make people understand that those issues had nothing to do with the treaty, and I failed to connect.  There is no doubt a perception exists that there is a disconnect between Brussels and the people of the EU and that decisions are taken by a top-down rather than a bottom-up approach.  That was said to me many times during the campaign with regard to regulations and directives that are implemented.  People felt we were being over-regulated.  This is something that should be considered.</P>
        <P>There was also the issue of distrust.  People did not trust what we were saying to them.  It worries me that people do not trust politicians.  It came across to me that the electorate was angry, for whatever reason, although it was nothing to do with the Lisbon treaty.  They were not prepared to listen when we were trying to debate the issues that were part of the treaty rather than those introduced as a scaremongering tactic.  That concerns me greatly.  I hope that out of this will come a new approach for Europe.  We must consider how we can reform in order that we may become a better member as a result of this.  Unfortunately, that is the situation.  The public will want to reflect and consider why they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the implications for the future of the EU.  Democracy has won and the public is now entitled to consider the decision it has made and how we can shape Ireland into the future of the EU.  We must have a period of reflection in the next couple of months.  It is only when the pressure is off that people say, as many have already said to me, they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; but did not understand the implications.  It has now come across that they did not understand them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Even though I explained to them many times the implications of the treaty, they did not want to know.  If we take a couple of months to reflect, I hope out of this will come a new period of thinking for all member states.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, on their performances at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on Monday.  It certainly showed they had reflected on the result of the referendum.  There was a solidarity behind our concerns.  Small states have done very well out of this treaty and they will not be anxious for us to revisit this.  There are many complications in terms of how we can steer ourselves out of this.  I do not want to be part of a two-tier system.  I never wanted to be a poor relation to anybody.  We were always at the centre of the decision making process and I hope that will not change in the future.  The line being peddled at present is that we will have a two-tier system and that we will be left behind.  I do not want that to happen and neither does Ireland.  We have been honoured to be at the centre of things and to be respected.  I want that to continue for us.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I hope that after a period of reflection we will be in a position to revisit this issue.  I have heard many people say the Lisbon treaty is dead.  It is dead as it stands, but we must revisit it in some way.  If we got reassurances and protocols were introduced, we may be in a position to present it again.  However, at this point we need to think about it and we need to let the public think about it.  They have spoken.  That is what I love about our democracy.  Let us respect democracy, but when we have revisited this issue in our minds, let us return to it and say what we would do.  It is clear from a survey that was carried out that a review of this treaty is already taking place in people&rsquo;s minds and that they will revisit it when we put it to them again in some form.  I wish the Minister of State well in how it is shaped in the future.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  I will comment briefly on his speech.  He spoke about the interest in the Euro barometer.  We would have been very interested if those in Europe had not stifled it for the past six months and refused to ask questions about the response to the treaty.  Why did they do that?  Why did they muzzle their own Euro barometer?</P>
        <P>There is an issue of trust regarding politicians and the issues raised.  I will answer the question in that regard.  The Minister of State spoke about a setback.  Since when was the exercise of a democratic vote a setback?  There may have been a certain situation created in Europe but it is not a problem of the making of the Irish people; it is a problem endemic to the entire institution.  The Minister of State said there is a need to reconnect the Union with the citizen.  That is right.  He said there is a need in particular for the Union to speak to all of its citizens in language that they can relate to and to consign to the bin the jargon, the special language and terminologies that exclude people.  I fully agree, but was that what those in Europe were doing?</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde correctly asked if people trust politicians.  Perhaps they do not, but it is not confined merely, exclusively or even principally to the politicians of Ireland.  Why should anybody trust people who, like President Nicolas Sarkozy, said of the treaty that if one opens the toolbox lid, one will see all the same tools, that it is just a cosmetic job and that it has been repackaged?  I put on the record of this House what another person said about the treaty some months ago and this is one of the reasons I voted against it.  I am delighted we defeated the treaty because these people now have to reconsider their position with regard to a major issue for democracy.  Mr. Giscard d&rsquo;Estang said of the treaty that:</P><Col N="238"/>
        <P LI="1">Public opinion will be led to adopt, without knowing it, the proposals that we dare not present to them directly . . .  All the earlier proposals will be in the next text, but will be hidden and disguised in some way.</P>
        <P FLI="0">How does that square with what the Minister of State said about openness and easily accessible language?  Mr. Karel De Gucht, the Belgian Foreign Minister, said in June 2007 said, &ldquo;The aim of the Constitutional Treaty was to be more readable: the aim of this treaty is to be unreadable&rdquo;.  How does that square with anything the Minister of State said or with the context of the questions that were properly addressed by Senator Ormonde?</P>
        <P>Those in Europe promoted the European constitution, but it failed in a series of countries.  They would have liked to have punched the individual citizens in those countries because there is a two-tier, two-speed system in Europe.  There is the speed at which the meglocrats &mdash; the bully boys &mdash; in Brussels want to go and there is a speed at which the ordinary people of Europe want to go.  Those in Europe dare not risk this again.  When they ran this new painted cosmeticised toolbox, the people in most of the countries, except Ireland, were not permitted to vote and we were the people who voted against it.</P>
        <P>I consider myself a good European.  I always voted for the treaties, but I got increasingly disenchanted by the insulting language that was being used.  I listened to one such person on a  radio programme today, a German MEP blackguarding Commissioner Charlie McCreevy and saying he should be fired because he was off gambling on horses when he should have been in the Parliament.  A German person of any kind should be very careful about racial tinges.  He said that he had to use the translation system when Commissioner McCreevy spoke because he spoke English so badly.  How dare these people treat us in this way?  They talk about money being returned but we got nothing to which we were not entitled.  We gave our fishing stocks.  We have employed hundreds of thousands of European people.  We have been pretty good to Europe, as Europe has been good to us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister of State will take this point back to Government.  The principal reason I opposed the treaty was my concerns about neutrality.  I am not a naive nincompoop, I know that Fianna F&aacute;il has no commitment to it.  DeValera was pragmatic about it and sold out to the Six Counties.  Fine Gael is perfectly honest about it; it has no interest in it and it would like to walk us into NATO.  I am glad that as a result of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote we have not institutionalised the European Defence Agency, which was the old European armaments group.</P>
        <P>The problem for the Minister of State and for politicians generally is that the main political parties have no principled loyalty to neutrality, but the Irish people do.  How do those parties gull them once again?  I say this in the context of the prevarication and queasy evasion of this Government and its predecessor about the subject of extraordinary rendition.  I gave the registration number of a plane on this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business that was last seen in Guantanamo Bay and that is now in Shannon.  These are reasons for this vote &mdash; neutrality renegotiated, the expansion of the Petersberg Tasks to allow us to intervene in a third country on suspicion of terrorism &mdash; that is the way to Iraq.  I oppose it.  If the Minister of State gets a protocol about these issues, I will be out voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not too early.  The Minister of State should have thought of it six months ago.  It seemed to have been an impossibility to the political parties that this treaty would have been beaten.  So arrogant and disconnected had they become, which they admit, that they never conceived that there would be a situation like this.  We are bankrupt of ideas about it.  That is a terrible reflection on the body politic here.  It is also a terrible reflection of the people and the institutions the Minister of State listed.  I do not welcome the fact that he said that the Government had the support of all the political parties.  He went on to say that it had the support of ICTU, IBEC, the chambers of commerce, the IFA, ICMSA and all those other bodies.  What does that tell us about these institutions?  It is not only that they are in the Government&rsquo;s pocket but that these people are also out of touch with public opinion and that there is a lovely club at the top whose members all combine when there are issues of this sort to ram through.  It did not succeed and it does not succeed in Europe.</P>
        <P>What I am appalled at more than anything else is the dismissive way that people say we will be able to satisfy a few of the objections and then we will get it through another referendum.  I thought that Senator Ormonde was doing extraordinarily well when she said it was a victory for democracy until she started talking about how she met people at the doorstep and explained to them time and again what the treaty was about and they still voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they did not understand it.  That is so patronising.  Of course, they understood it.  They listened to her, as I often do, and voted the opposite way.  People are entitled to do that in this House as are those the Senator meets at the doorsteps.  They understood the treaty just as well as those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  To suggest that the people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side did not know as much as people on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side is patronising and wrong.  It is symptomatic of the attitude of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side to this campaign.</P>
        <P>I wish to turn to an issue on which I found a defining reason for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that is the issue of tax.  Every time I came forward with this issue I was patronised by Ministers who said, &ldquo;Do not worry, there is unanimity about it; we will be able to put down the veto and that will be the end of it&rdquo;.  There is unanimity apparently about this treaty, yet we are told it is will be ratified anyway.  Where is the unanimity in that?  If there was unanimity about this, the Lisbon treaty would be dead.</P>
        <P>I would thank the Minister of State if he would listen to me on this matter.  I do not believe for one moment &mdash; it is a legitimate belief and neither he nor I can prove whether it is true &mdash; that the Government would ever have used its veto on tax because it would not have felt capable, courageous or strong enough to do that.  What was to happen now and next week was that all the initiatives on tax were to be buried by the French particularly, and the Minister of State knows that.  Last week the French Minister for Finance let it slip in an interview with <i>Le Monde </i>that the top of their agenda was tax harmonisation.  What does that mean?  If they thought the Irish veto was going to work, they would not bother their barney coming forward with tax harmonisation.  Tax harmonisation was on the agenda, it was going to be used and forced through.  The Government would never have used its veto.  Instead, it would have threatened to use it only for France, Germany and some of the other large member states to make clear their intention to punish us in some other way for taking that course.  We would have been told, for example, that the &euro;200 million already allocated to the national development programme was no more.  In those circumstances, the Government would have withdrawn its veto and obtained concessions elsewhere.  That would have been the end of it.  The Minister of State can shake his head as much as he likes but he must take these points seriously.  One of the problems with the Government&rsquo;s campaign was that he refused to do so.  It is legitimate to express a lack of confidence that the Government would use its veto on tax.</P>
        <P>It is my job as a public representative to ask the Minister of State to go back to Europe to demand confirmation, before we sign this treaty, that we have the right to set our own corpor<Col N="240"/>ation tax rate and manage our own tax affairs.  That must be written in stone as of 2008 or 2009 rather than in some future treaty which nobody believes will be effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross&rsquo;s final comment says it all.  I have heard many opponents of the treaty, and even some who support it, make the point that we must go back to Europe.  What do they mean by this?  This is Europe.  We are part of Europe; it is not something separate.  That type of mentality is entirely alien to the vision of Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, who recognised in the early 1950s, in the wake of the events of the first half of the last century, that there must be a better way, a way which would allow European states and their citizens to live in peaceful coexistence.  Ireland played its part in the realisation of that vision.  Hundreds of thousands of Irish people died in the early part of the last century in wars initiated, generated and fought on the battlefields on Europe.  There had to be a better way.  The vision of Schuman and Monnet, which they brought to fruition in the first instance via the establishment of a coal and steel trade agreement, has developed to the extent evident in the benefits we now enjoy from our membership of the Union.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, alluded to a possible disconnection between the peoples of Europe and the institutions of the European Union.  The development of the Union represents probably the most successful political adventure in international history, with member states coming together in a spirit of common interest to pool their sovereignty for the mutual benefit and advancement of the peoples they represent.  In the pursuit of that objective, we must ensure the connectivity with citizens is as strong as possible.  There is no doubt that we face challenges in this regard.  These are illustrated not only by the result of last week&rsquo;s referendum but also by the results of the referenda on the constitutional treaty in France and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>We must take a positive approach.  This referendum result affords an opportunity to reassess this great adventure to which the majority of citizens throughout Europe subscribe.  Ireland represents a small percentage of that total population.  It is encouraging to see that a poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicates that some 80% of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum have a positive view of Europe.  In the course of canvassing for the referendum, I made the point on more than one occasion that a referendum is not the ideal means by which to ratify a treaty.  Treaties are complex by nature and the issues involved can become even more convoluted as they are discussed by advocates of either side.  That is what happened in this case.</P>
        <P>Many issues emerged in the course of the campaign.  The objective now must be to identify the main components of the opposition to the treaty and to consider how they can be addressed in a manner that will allow the EU to move forward.  I join my colleague in complimenting the Minister of State on his efforts in the campaign.  He has made an intellectual and energetic contribution not only to this debate but on an ongoing basis for several years.  We must take on board the views that have been expressed.  The Minister of State referred to the global challenge facing Europe.  We have evolved in the past decade into an entirely new era of globalisation.  In the past, the main economic power was the United States.  It retains its might but we have seen also the emergence of China, with a population of 1.3 billion, which is some two and a half times that of the EU.  India&rsquo;s population is more than twice that of the EU, while Russia, an emerging powerhouse, potentially could evolve into the richest country in the world by virtue of its tremendous reserves of natural resources.   It is important that the EU operates co-operatively and cohesively.  To do so, we must have institutions which are efficient and focused on meeting the emerging challenges.</P>
        <P>None of the opponents of the treaty has offered a convincing argument for how the rejection of the Lisbon proposals will help us to achieve those objectives.  I acknowledge that Sinn F&eacute;in, <Col N="241"/>as the &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo; party, has an ideological objection to the treaty.  I spoke to some of its members at the count centre and heard their view that we should return to depending on our own natural resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the world has moved on into the arena of globalisation.  We have built our economy on various intellectual competencies and services which are sought after throughout the world.  It is extraordinary that Ireland has become the world&rsquo;s largest exporter of computer software.  This small island nation on the west coast of Europe has achieved that pre-eminence through foreign direct investment.  We must not allow that to be put at risk in any way.  We must pool our resources and engage constructively with both the proponents and opponents of the treaty to ensure what emerges from this process is something which everybody can support.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to leave uncontested the comments made by a particular Senator to the effect that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Eamon de Valera, in some way sold out on the Six Counties.  Anybody remotely interested in or aware of our history would know that Mr. de Valera took the absolutely opposite position in the Civil War that followed independence.  Through his leadership of the diplomatic process in the 1930s, he recovered the ports from the British and resolved the land annuities issue.  Shortly after coming into office, he abolished the oath of allegiance.  It is an absolute rewriting of history to contend the contrary.  The enormous progress we have made since independence has been contributed to substantially by our constructive engagement with the European Union.  By continuing that engagement, the prospects for future generations of Irish people will be enhanced.</P>

	<P>I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is in attendance for this debate.  It is great to have him in the House given his role in the formulation of the Lisbon treaty.  There is no doubt that the rejection of the referendum represents a significant embarrassment for the Government.  On this occasion, we were on the Government&rsquo;s side.  It is not as if due warning had not been given, but the Government was not listening.  In this House I spoke about a survey I conducted in the streets of Galway, involving 115 people, three weeks ago.  Nine of ten of those people told me the Government had not adequately explained the treaty.  That was with three weeks to go.  Two thirds of the people I met said they had low to very poor knowledge of the treaty.  I agree with Members on the other side of the House that this treaty was rejected because people were confused.  There was a poor campaign by the Government largely, as my colleague, Senator Regan, said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We have been in the Union for 35 years so we had better stay with it.  However, there are many issues to address.  A total of 75% of the people I met on the streets of Galway told me that they believed Europe is good for Ireland but 20% of that 75% &mdash; this is when I knew we were in difficulty &mdash; intended to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and another 20% were undecided.  Those margins were critical in this referendum.</P>
        <P>We must now address the issues to move forward.  This responsibility rests with the Minister and the Government.  In the last few days I have been working with young people and teachers in schools.  It is significant that a 12 year old said to me that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side won the Lisbon treaty referendum because, when the campaign started, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, was telling people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; while the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side was telling them about the treaty.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach was undermined by his Government because none of the Ministers campaigned.  He was let down.  Let us continue with what the young people said to me.  Some said: &ldquo;My mother voted &ldquo;No&ldquo; and I told her to do that because I do not want to be conscripted to an EU army&rdquo;.  The issue of neutrality was not understood and people did not feel it was safeguarded.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that due to the disconnect the Minister mentioned and the lack of listening the people saw this treaty referendum as an opportunity to hit out at the Government on a plethora of domestic issues.  I am pleased that my electoral area of Oranmore carried the treaty but in another part of the Galway West constituency, Connemara, 81% of the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Let us consider why they did so.  A total of 80% of their land is designated special areas of conservation.  They are sick and tired of EU directives that prevent them from keeping sheep on the mountains and from fishing and cutting turf.  This was a case of the people taking back their power.</P>
        <P>People are fed up and cynical about second referenda being held in this country.  The Government must learn to do things right the first time; otherwise, we are learning nothing.  I urge the Minister to examine the real concerns that must be addressed before anything is put again to the people.  There are real concerns about neutrality and corporation tax, as Senator Ross admirably explained.  Above all, there is concern that people should have a say on European directives before they are imposed.  The Irish people have spoken and we must accept it.  They are weary and need help to move forward at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator de B&uacute;rca for allowed me to speak before her.  I welcome the Minister of State.  His contribution was worthwhile and contained nothing with which I would not agree.  Everybody on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side is very disappointed with the result, but it is a time for reflection, not blame.  It is the second time in eight years that Irish people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to an EU treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am worried that Ireland will be seen as Eurosceptic.  I was hurt and disappointed to see people in the House of Commons last night wearing green T-shirts carrying the message: &ldquo;Respect the Irish vote&rdquo;.  Last Friday, we saw television footage showing the Eurosceptic members of the English Parliament using the Irish flag as a beer mat.  I am disgusted with that.  My first thought on seeing it was to wonder how Sinn F&eacute;in feels when it looks at the people with whom it has aligned itself.</P>
        <P>We must be very careful at this juncture.  As my colleagues Senator Walsh and Senator Ormonde said, we respect the democratic Irish vote.  A large group of Irish people will claim to be pro-Europe, yet there is a cohort that believes that the EU wishes to conscript children into a European army, a cohort that believes the EU wishes to ruin our economy with the tax regime it wishes to introduce and a cohort that believes abortion and euthanasia will be available on demand in this country and that God will be removed from the Constitution.</P>

	<P>A nun in Sligo whom I canvassed told me that we will not be allowed to say Mass or to pray and that it would be like a return to penal times.  I said to her: &ldquo;Sister, as a teacher who has taught all your life, can you not see further than your nose?  How can those things happen?&rdquo;  Furthermore, many people did not realise why they were voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Many considered it sexy, with it and cool to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, in the same way they thought it good to listen to a celebrity telling them to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I believe that if the referendum was put to them again, it would be a different kettle of fish.  Senator Ormonde referred to a two tier Europe, with a fast lane and a slow lane.  We do not wish to be anybody&rsquo;s poor relation.  We <Col N="244"/>have done very well as a result of our participation in Europe and we must always remember that.</P>
        <P>I met people who said they did not have enough information.  I tried to engage with them and tell them the little I knew.  Rather than appear arrogant by telling them I knew it all, I told them I knew a little and asked to discuss the things about which they were unsure.  They did not want that information.  There are people who felt disconnected.  There were also people who were cross with Irish politicians, regardless of whether they were on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  People said that campaigners for the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side did not come out onto the pitch early enough, that they came out at half time.  I disagreed with that.  I told them we came out to campaign at the same time as in other referendum campaigns.  When we did come out, we were catching up and putting out fires because the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side misrepresented everything that was good in the treaty.  It was spinning not white lies but big black lies.</P>
        <P>There is a need for a national debate on the EU.  We are part of the Union, are proud of it and have to stop blaming Brussels for this, that and the other.  Those days are over.  Let us be proud to be part of it and to move it on.  We also have to evaluate why the vote went the way it did.  In doing so we still accept democracy was at its best.  We got the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote returned and we accept that but there are issues that arise and have to be looked at.</P>
        <P>Given the way the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side treated the unrelated issues in the treaty, such as tax and abortion, and given all the misrepresentations, there was very little time to get the positive elements across, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, prioritising climate change and energy security.  They are the issues on which we should have been concentrating.  Every time we came out to put out one fire the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side built the fire even higher.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;No&rdquo; side was let set the agenda by the media.  It is very unfair and unbalanced when the national broadcaster allocates equal speaking time to such an unrepresentative &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  If one looks at the Houses of the Oireachtas, there are about ten members of both Houses who called for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  They were given exactly the same time as the majority of the people in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank God the majority of the people have some people in this House to represent them on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair and it should be looked at.  Currently there are no limits on what one can spend.  One organisation that represented the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote spent &euro;2 million on its campaign.  That is more than the three large political parties spent.  I call for further regulation on how we spend and on enforcing a spending limit.  Perhaps the Standards in Public Office Commission will do that.</P>
        <P>It is not about a blame game but it makes my blood boil when I hear people purporting to have been on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side and yet in my own town of Sligo, for example, and I speak only for myself, I saw only one member of this House from Fine Gael out canvassing.  I met nobody else.  I met Fine Gael councillors who told me their parents were voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I met staunch Fine Gael people.  It is a bit rich of Senator Healy-Eames&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>As other speakers have stated, we touched on this matter briefly on the Order of Business when the matter arose.  The question of accepting or respecting the decision of the Irish people does not arise for discussion.  It is a constitutional imperative that we not just respect but accept the decision of the Irish people.  While it does not arise for debate, we will not be ratifying that treaty that was put to the people of Ireland last week.  Let us leave that aside and move forward, lest there is any concern about people&rsquo;s motivation or otherwise.</P>
        <P>There cannot be a rerun of the Lisbon treaty that was put to the people last week.  I have been listening to some of the debate but have been detained at another meeting also.  It has been acknowledged there were difficulties in the campaign.  I disagree with some of the last speakers on the other side.  I think the campaign was slow to get started.  It is manifestly clear that the political difficulties at the top end of the Fianna F&aacute;il party were a factor in that party&rsquo;s overall readiness or approach to the campaign.  That is just a matter of fact.  I am not seeking to open it for a row.  Any fair-minded person looking at those few months can see that was clearly the case.  If Members on the Government side are honest about it, they will have to accept that as well.  However, it is in the past and we are facing the future.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the Minister of State, he put in enormous effort and energy to the campaign, and I congratulate him on that.  He was in this House on several occasions.  It has been said in this debate that there was no big idea or that it was not fought in a manner that pointed to one big idea on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  Perhaps in that statement we can identify the problem.  In fact, there is one big idea at the heart of the European project and at the heart of the European Union, and it is an incredibly successful idea and achievement of historical proportions.  Perhaps we did not emphasise that enough.  Perhaps we allowed ourselves in the months and weeks coming up to the vote to be distracted by the individual claims made, many of which were entirely false.  We felt we had to answer this, that and the other one.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should have concentrated more on a visionary approach to what we were putting to the people.  Perhaps we should have been up there on the higher ground of what Europe has actually achieved, especially what it has achieved for Irish people and Irish workers and what it has achieved in a range of different areas for us as a nation.  I do not mean largesse.  I am not talking about good to Ireland but good for Ireland and Ireland being good for Europe.  There is an incredible achievement in that and perhaps we were too slow to claim that ground for ourselves.  In this I include all of the parties, not just one or the other.  The parties supporting the treaty allowed themselves to be on the defensive.</P>
        <P>During the course of the campaign many people on the doorsteps said they took one look across at who was on the other side.  Some said they saw Sinn F&eacute;in on the other side and that they would not vote for the treaty.  Others said they saw that the political parties were for it and decided to go against them.  There was much negative decision-making about it.  People decided to vote in a particular way because of who was on the other side, not just Sinn F&eacute;in but others as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps there is something inevitable about a treaty that is so complex in that people decide where they stand based on who is for it and who is against it.  That has actually continued for me, to some extent, since last Thursday.  As others have asked, who is happy that this has gone down?  What groups and the political organisations not just here but around Europe are happy that the treaty was defeated last week?  The Eurosceptical far right of the British Conservative Party is up and at it and revived in the past week, scarifying its own leadership into making somewhat disturbing statements as to where it might go, although it seemed to pull its act together this week.  The UK Independence Party is happy, as are the right wing freedom party in Austria, the National Front in France and the Civic Democratic Party in the Czech Republic, all organisations that have been out of the traps in recent days celebrating what they would <Col N="246"/>see as a mortal wound inflicted by the Irish people on the European project.  There may be some sense in people standing back and asking who is on the other side and who is against it because this was a deal that was made.</P>
        <P>I turn to the issue of where we should go next.  I say this to all my colleagues.  Anybody now can put together a list of issues we would like to reopen.  I am sure the Minister of State, who comes in to the House frequently and who often would not admit to any problems with the treaty because of the rhetorical approach in which he engaged in terms of the campaign, could do it.  I doubt if there is anybody in these Houses who could not sit down and make a list of objections or problems with what was in the Lisbon treaty.  Anybody who has experience of negotiating knows that the easy part is to make the list of demands; the difficult part is delivering them.  It is fine for Sinn F&eacute;in to say what the Taoiseach must do tomorrow or in the coming period.  I will add some more to that list.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question is not whether one can put together a credible list but whether one can deliver it when one is going to face 26 other countries and a new set of political parties since the treaty was negotiated.  We now have Mr. Berlusconi.  What side of the tracks is he on in terms of workers&rsquo; rights and employment rights?  We also have Mr. Sarkozy.  A number of European governments have changed their political colour since the Lisbon treaty was negotiated.  The idea that we can turn around and go back and that we can be confident that we can deliver something better was a central dishonesty in the conduct of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.</P>
        <P>I do not underestimate the difficulty faced by the Government &mdash; and it is for the Government principally to come up with a solution.  The Labour Party supported the Lisbon treaty and we stand over everything we said about it.  We respect the will of the Irish people but there will be a significant reckoning to come in terms of what it is possible to deliver.  I do not say that in the sense that I hope I am proven right that the treaty cannot be delivered in the way we want.  We all want what is best for the country but I have serious concerns about the danger of a significant shift to the right as an outcome of the defeat last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House.  Like the rest of us he is probably trying to digest the verdict of the Irish people on the Lisbon treaty, which we became aware of last Friday.  There is an opportunity to define what is the problem.  Given this unpredicted result, I have great sympathy for the Taoiseach who has to attend the European summit tomorrow and see what possibilities exist for moving forward.  There is a danger that Ireland could get boxed into a corner and that we have put a halt to something that has support from other member states and that therefore it is up to us to solve the problem.  I hope the same kind of EU-wide solidarity that we talked about during the referendum campaign will be in evidence.  I am sure that will be the case tomorrow when the Taoiseach goes to the EU summit because this is not strictly an Irish problem.  The outcome on the referendum to the Lisbon treaty could have been the same in any other member state had they decided to have a popular referendum on the treaty because the disengagement citizens feel from the European project runs across the EU.  That feeling is not particular to Ireland and it has been in evidence in regard to all the recent treaties.  It is a long-standing problem in the Union.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will take on board my view on the danger that in looking to respond to the Irish &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on last Thursday the problem will be defined as how we salvage the Lisbon treaty and that the issue of the democratic deficit and the disengagement of citizens will be overlooked.  There is a certain level of fear among the political class in the European Union in terms of trying to engage with people and bring them along because there is a sense that they are unpredictable and appear to be very hesitant about the whole European project.  However, <Col N="247"/>as politicians we cannot continue to get treaties ratified without the support of the public because there will be increasing resistance on their part.  In time, when the European Union tries to implement directives and other legislation without public support there could be a fundamental crisis in the Union.</P>
        <P>Popular support and consent is very important and the last thing we need is European institutions having authority without popular consent.  As a polity that is putting itself forward as a beacon of democracy and a political entity that is trying to promote democracy internationally it is not desirable to have that kind of fundamental flaw in its own democratic system.  I hope that at tomorrow&rsquo;s European summit and in the coming weeks and months when this issue is discussed, the Ministers and heads of State will look at the whole issue of how we address the democratic deficit and the disengagement of many citizens of the European Union from the project, which has delivered so many benefits to them.</P>
        <P>I support the interesting proposal made by my Green Party colleagues in the European Parliament on the possibility of a democracy Bill whereby an EU-wide referendum would be held and which would contain the Charter for Fundamental Rights, an expanded and improved role for the European Parliament and the national parliaments, and innovative ways for citizens to participate in the politics and the governance of the European Union through mechanisms like the citizens&rsquo; initiative.  We have to start thinking in terms of EU-wide referenda.  We cannot run away from our electorates or try to proceed on a state-by-state basis.  What has happened in the case of Ireland is that we are seen as holding up the progress that all of the other member states wish to make.</P>
        <P>I support the notion of EU-wide referenda that put issues to the citizens.  What the Green Party had proposed in regard to the original constitutional treaty was a double-majority referendum where we would look for a majority of states and a majority of the citizens of the European Union to support it.  We have to start looking at such mechanisms.  Perhaps that is the kind of thinking that the heads of state and the various Ministers should adopt in approaching this issue and that it is not just seen as a question of how we salvage the Lisbon treaty but that there is focus on the much broader issue of how we address the disengagement of our citizens.  We can possibly use the mechanism of an EU-wide referendum to tackle some of the issues relating to the democratic deficit.  That is the way forward.  I hope the Minister of State will bring some of that thinking to the meetings he will attend on behalf of this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Government for facilitating the debate.  As somebody who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; it gave me no pleasure to oppose people for whom I have the highest esteem.  I acknowledge the patriotism, good sense and honest toil of politicians and officials who have worked at EU level over many years, especially in the context of the Lisbon treaty.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and acknowledge his efforts in particular.</P>
        <P>I opposed the treaty on the basis of my honest assessment of where Ireland&rsquo;s best interests lie.  In no sense do I wish to detract from the patriotism, honest toil and sincere effort of those who were on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  Listening to the speeches of the Minister of State and Members across the floor I am left with the impression that people are still not listening.  I have heard more demonisation of people today, the same kind of demonisation I heard prior to the referendum last Thursday.  I hear and sense a determination to suggest that the Irish people did not vote in an informed way but that they allowed themselves to be hoodwinked and panic-stricken into a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  That is to do no credit to the intelligence and good sense of the Irish people.  It is true that there were wide and varied groups and agendas opposed to the treaty.  I am reminded of Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s farewell message to her supporters when she withdrew from the campaign for the Democratic Party nomination.  She said it was not the party she had hoped for but she sure loved the company.  Perhaps there were people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side last Thursday who said it is the party they hoped for but they were not so sure about the company.  The same would be true on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side.  It is interesting to note that our former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was on the same side as Senator Eugene Regan.  To my mind that is a motley crew also.  The fact is people were under pressure from their party whips to call for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote so let us be honest about it, there was exaggeration on both sides.  There was bogus argumentation on occasions on both sides and there was a certain amount of emotional blackmail on both sides.  The Government must start by refusing to apologise or allow even the body language of apology at European level.  The Government&rsquo;s job now is to represent the expressed will of the people.  I accept that a process of discernment is now needed in order to understand precisely what the people have asked for.</P>
        <P>When we hear the Government constantly reassuring people that this is not about abortion we get a sense of the problem.  While I know some people were saying it was about abortion, we should consider that the Maastricht protocol was negotiated more than 20 years ago in Charles Haughey&rsquo;s time.  That illustrates that there have been no serious efforts since then to secure for Ireland the necessary subsidiarity on social issues.  I will conclude with the example of Article 13 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which does not even nod to national laws in establishing freedom in artistic and scientific research.  Future decisions could be taken at European level that would cut across our constitutional values.  I plead with the Government that among the issues it must take into account now is the need to negotiate proper subsidiarity for Ireland so that, liberal or conservative, we may decide certain issues for ourselves, particularly in areas that are socially sensitive.  That is not about being in a two-speed or a two-tier Europe.  It is about recognising that regardless of how much we support an integrated EU it must be on the basis that diverse national personalities are also allowed to breathe.</P>
        <P>The next few months will represent a test of just how much respect the European Union has for smaller states.  We should look for no less than the French and Dutch got when they rejected a substantially similar arrangement in the form of the EU constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>A Government Senator asked to which side Sinn F&eacute;in is now aligned.  I am glad to say that Sinn F&eacute;in is aligned to the majority of people who came out on Thursday to cast their votes and to the people of France and Holland.  The overwhelming majority of people across the European Union, as shown in opinion polls, would have voted in <Col N="249"/>the same way.  The people have spoken.  The Lisbon treaty is over.  This is not a crisis as suggested by many in this House.  This Lisbon treaty was put to the democratic test in Ireland and it has been rejected.  Those are the facts before us.  It has not just been rejected here.  The same formula has been rejected by the people of Europe.  It has been put on five occasions and on three different occasions it has been rejected, in France, Holland and now here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>What should we do now?  I am not interested in the blame game between those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side or the lies that have been told.  What is the challenge ahead of us?  The answer is as obvious as the nose on one&rsquo;s face.  The Government must use its strong mandate, provided by the people, to renegotiate this treaty.  It needs to view the result as an opportunity to get back around the table with our EU partners and secure a better deal for all the people of Europe.  It is not acceptable for EU leaders to seek ways of avoiding or circumventing the democratically expressed wishes of the people.  The ratification process must end just as it did following the rejection of the EU constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people must be listened to.  Throughout the referendum campaign a number of key issues arose repeatedly &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s loss of power in Europe, EU militarisation, workers&rsquo; rights and public services, and the treaty&rsquo;s impact on the developing world.  These issues need to be addressed.  It is now the responsibility of Government, and particularly of the Taoiseach, to listen to the people and commit to the task of securing a better deal.  These are very practical and reasonable demands, which can, despite the hoopla and palaver be delivered.</P>
        <P>I interrupted the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Senator who was talking nonsense.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to constructively engaging in this process.  Today we are submitting a detailed written proposal to the Government, which we believe would address these concerns in a new treaty.  We will also meet the trade union movement, farmers, business and civic society to encourage them to use their influence to ensure the Government secures a deal that best reflects their needs now and into the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any new deal must address the much talked of EU democratic deficit.  It must fundamentally secure Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality and protect workers&rsquo; rights and public services.  Time and time again the same sensible rational concerns emerged on the doorstep, local media and from interest groups.  The retention of a permanent Commissioner, our current voting strength at the European Council and key strategic vetoes such as on the outcome of international trade talks, were regularly outlined  throughout the campaign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to see the removal of the controversial self-amending articles.  We need a specific protocol in the treaty protecting neutrality and opt-outs from other aspects of an emerging EU common foreign and security policy such as an end to taxpayers&rsquo; money being diverted to the European Defence Agency or being used for any EU military purposes.  We also need a protocol to opt out of the EURATOM treaty.  Explicit amendments are required to ensure greater protection of workers&rsquo; rights and to stop the opening up of vital public services to competition.  We also need measures to strengthen the social content of the EU project in order to balance the need for economic competitiveness with social cohesion and sustainable development.</P>
        <P>Another deal is possible for Ireland and the EU but only if the Government steps up to the plate by acting in accordance with the outcome of the referendum.  There are already concerns about the Government&rsquo;s approach given its total opposition to the loudly voiced wishes of the people on this issue.  Again I repeat the Lisbon treaty is finished, as it needs the support of all 27 member states in order for it to come into effect.  It cannot be reheated and put to the people again.  If the Government is serious in its commitment to listen to the people and to uphold democracy then it must secure a better treaty for Ireland and Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The last time he was here it was in happier circumstances when we were planning the campaign and debating the issues involved.  The late Charles Haughey was advised one time by a Senator how he had lost the election.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il leader said he would like to know how we would win the election.  In this regard we must look to the future and be positive about the situation that has arisen.  That we had two referenda on the Nice treaty gave the people clear example that it was possible there would be a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  It was not possible to argue the case that we did not have a repeat of the Nice treaty referendum.  That argument was not that strong.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier today I certainly voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the first referendum on divorce and I also voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the second one.  However, in the interim there was a change of view and a change of emphasis and it was accepted on the second occasion.  When we applied for membership of the European Economic Community we were rejected at least once.  The Minister of State will have the record on the matter.  The French certainly kept us out at one time.  However, we persisted.  Se&aacute;n Lemass initiated the application to the Common Market and we succeeded when the late Jack Lynch and the late Paddy Hillery, both fantastic members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, signed our accession to the European Economic Community in 1973.  We have been there for 35 years and it has been a great success story.  I will not go through all that again.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Taoiseach and everybody else did their very best to explain the situation.  It is a very comprehensive and complicated treaty.  In hindsight irrespective of the cost, it would have been worth circulating a clear version of the treaty.  I hope that on the next occasion we will circulate a copy to every house.  It is important that people cannot have that argument.  That argument was made by Libertas, which then circulated a select number of copies to make the point that something was being hidden from the people and that was why it was not circulated.  It was very effective propaganda.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In the final few days of the campaign, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party published a document clarifying many of the issues.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a wonderful document that took considerable negotiation.  Many of the countries that now accept the treaty probably would not have accepted it at that point in time.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was used against the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign on the basis of the possibility, however remote, that at some stage the court in Luxembourg would accept the possibility of abortion.  Under Article 6 of the Maastricht protocol we were exempt in that regard.  They did not accept it.  In churches in the region documents were circulated urging people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because of that situation.  The Pope was depicted in those documents as advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, although he did not do so.  I am sure he would be in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  When the Minister visited Roscommon, the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee had a document entitled &ldquo;Support Roscommon Hospital, Vote &rsquo;No&rsquo; to Lisbon.&rdquo;  I met two dedicated Fianna F&aacute;il supporters who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they said they wanted to keep their hospital.  There was nothing in the Lisbon treaty about that.  Those are the kinds of issues that arose.</P>
        <P>I wish the Taoiseach well tomorrow and on Friday in his meetings in Brussels.  Time is on our side.  Maybe when the Minister sums up he would outline that.  This treaty was not to be implemented immediately.  There was to be much discussion on the details.  One point made to me during the campaign and at public meetings held by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs was the question of the commissionership.  It was an issue.  In discussions that will go on, countries that have no Commissioner should have a permanent representative as an observer at the Commission meetings.  It would be useful to put across that point.  While it is not possible or practical to renegotiate every clause, one can have protocols and derogations on certain issues that arise.  I hope we will reflect on this issue in the next 12 to 18 months and <Col N="251"/>hopefully return again when all the other 26 countries have ratified the treaty.  We will then know exactly the situation.  Nobody voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they were anti-Europe but because they felt they were pro-Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>As I begin my contribution to this very important debate and before I go on to my observations as a politician, I want to reflect on how I felt as a person when I heard the result last week.  As a person, the abiding feeling I had on hearing the result was loneliness.  I felt my country, of which I am a member, is on the margin.  So much of the success we have had in progressing our economic and social interests is because we have been able to create solidarity with our neighbours and rely on that solidarity to progress what we believe is important.  When that result came in I felt, for the first time in many years, I was a member of a small island country off the coast of Europe.</P>
        <P>My second impression was a worry that the opportunities and benefits I have enjoyed might not be extended to my children as a result of the decision.  People on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side who hear my points will accuse me of scaremongering.  I respect the decision that was made but those two emotions will drive the points I will make as a politician and the work I hope to do in the future.  The first emotion is loneliness and that we have the potential to be marginalised in what will happen in the future.  The second and probably more important feeling is worry about the effect the result will have on the prosperity and social wealth I have been lucky enough to enjoy and concern that I might not be able to pass that on to my family and the people I try to represent.</P>
        <P>As a politician I want to offer my reflections on what happened during the campaign and my pointers on what we need to do differently, particularly given the debate I have just heard.  The first vital point is that if we end up in a mind-set that the treaty was good and the communication of the treaty was bad, we will not progress this.  If we say we need to better explain the merits of what we have to the people than we did during the campaign, that indicates a lack of respect for and understanding of the motives of many people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I can see the Minister nodding as I make this point.  I hope as we move forward we do not look back and say it was a failure of our communication strategy and posters.  We must accept that our people weighed up the treaty and decided, on the substance of it, that it was not acceptable.</P>
        <P>My second point was on the attitudes of young people.  This was the most significant thing I learned during the campaign.  My attitudes to the European project are driven by two experiences.  The first was of going to Dublin Airport with all my belongings in a suitcase to emigrate to the UK to get a job that I could not get in Ireland.  The second was watching what happened in Srebrenica in the 1990s, the miracle of the EU managing to bring peacefully into the EU countries that were at war with and suspicious of each other earlier in our century.  Those experiences, so recent for me, forged my opinion on the EU but are not shared by people who are just a few years younger than me.  They see the prosperity and peace of the EU as a given.  They have only ever enjoyed economic prosperity.  That has had a decisive influence on how young people in particular have viewed this.</P>
        <P>My final point is on the view people have of our political institutions.  A poll taken at the start of this year found that 22% of people in Ireland trusted our political institutions.  Of the last five referenda, all of which were supported by the mainstream political parties, three have been defeated by the people.  I hope I am correct; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  The people have not accepted what the politicians have said.  That must give us great pause for thought in analysing what is happening and deciding what we want to change.</P>
        <P>The Monday morning after the defeat of this referendum I was out doing a leaflet drop in my constituency when I met a person who said I had lost the battle but, clearly, not the war, because I was out engaged in political activity.  We need to step up to the plate, engage with <Col N="252"/>our electorate and offer them a way to move this forward.  As politicians it is our responsibility to lead, not that of the voters.  Respecting the substance of the decision, understanding why young people did what they did and pausing to recognise there is a crisis in the faith people have in these institutions are pointers towards our delivering an outcome that will be successful for Ireland and Europe.  Both can happen at the same time and are not mutually exclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche)</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators.  I will take Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s last point.  The debate was demeaned earlier today when people shouted at each other.  This is not a time for shouting at each other but for calm reflection.  It is a time to respect the people, who have given us a very clear view.  If we value anything in this country we should value our democracy.  In this matter the only sovereign authority in this State is the people.  The people have given an answer and we must analyse that and understand what they are saying.  I do not believe the Irish people have taken the view that we should disconnect from Europe, however they have given us a very challenging position.  The verdict of the Irish people must be respected in all the political debates.  However, first we must try to understand what the people are saying to us.  They were not simply saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  As we see from today&rsquo;s poll analysis, they said different things.  As Senator Donohoe pointed out at the end of his very thoughtful contribution, young people pointed out different things, because they have a different perspective of Europe.  The economic well-being and political progress we have enjoyed over all these years are taken for granted.  We should communicate the basis on which that has taken place.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand the excitement Senator Ross generated within himself in the debate.  The treaty cannot come into force until it is ratified by all 27 member states in its current format.  That is EU law.  I also disagree with Senator Ross&rsquo;s view that he can dismiss all the political parties on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side in this country, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, 60 chambers of commerce and the Irish farming organisations.  It seems the proposition he was putting forward is that one can be dismissive of all of these organisations.  I do not believe one can take that view from this result.</P>
        <P>It is clear we must consult widely, both at home and within the European partnership.  I agree with the points made by several Senators, including Senators Alex White, de B&uacute;rca and Feeney, that this is not just an Irish problem; it is a European problem.  The disconnect which exists between the citizens of Europe and the European Union is a dangerous one.  I also share Senator Alex White&rsquo;s view &mdash; he made the point eloquently &mdash; that one has to look at who is celebrating this victory in Europe.  It was not people who I would normally regard as being advocates of the kind of democracy to which we assign ourselves in Europe.  The UKIP party represent some views, as do those on the extremes of the Conservative Party, and I respect those views.  I am not sure I respect, for example, Mr. Le Pen and the National Front &mdash; I certainly have difficulties in that regard.  However, they represent something, although, in my view, it is something which is unacceptable and for which the Irish people do not sign up, and for which they did not vote last Thursday.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach has stated, we want to make it clear to our European partners that Ireland has no wish to halt the progress of the European Union.  We are not a destructive nation.  We are certainly not a eurosceptic nation.  However, we are a nation which does things in our own way, and we show a way to the European Union by holding a referendum.  The greatest expression of democracy in the Union is asking the people what are their views.  The people have come back to us with an answer for which we would not have wished but they have nonetheless presented us with an answer and we must understand, as must Europe, what it is that this sovereign people have said.</P><Col N="253"/>
        <P>It is not disrespectful to the Irish people to say we must now have a period of reflection because that is exactly what the Irish people would wish.  I do not believe for a moment that the Irish people would take it as being a positive sign of politicians on any side of this debate if we were to jump quickly into solutions which are facile and which would not work.  As Senator Alex White said to Sinn F&eacute;in, it is easy to draw up a list; it is a question of how one delivers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a reality that other member states are engaged in their ratification process.  They too have a right to express their view in their own democratic way.  It is not for us to tell them how they should operate, no more than it is for them to tell us.  We need to identify clearly the reasons the Irish people voted against the treaty and then see where that takes us.  We need to complete our analysis of the result and draw the necessary lessons from it.  The next step is for the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and myself to give the initial assessment in the Council tomorrow and in the bilateral meetings we will have tomorrow and on the following days.</P>
        <P>It is a very important point in history and in the history of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in Europe.  We have reached a critical point.  I disagree with the Senator who suggested there was exaggeration on both sides.  I have campaigned the length and breadth of this country since last December and I can truthfully say I never intended nor can I ever be shown objectively to have exaggerated any of the issues.  However, it was an exaggeration, as Senator Mullen noted, for people to talk about abortion, which has no part in this treaty, or about euthanasia, the incarceration of young children or the reintroduction of the death penalty.  Those were untruthful statements and they were not made from the point of view of political discourse or balanced debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen is taking a rather distorted view of what political debate should be to suggest that somehow we can dismiss untruths and mendacious argument as simply the exaggerations of the heat of the moment.  If they were just that, I would find them forgivable but the fact they were constructed over a period and repeated time and again despite evidence being produced speaks about those who put those arguments forward.</P>
        <P>The debate is over, however.  The campaign has taken place and we should not refight it.  What we should do is look at how we protect the interests of our people and our nation in the period ahead.  We should not dismiss it as easy or simple.  There are 27 states that negotiated the treaty.  It is possible that 26 other states have a different view than we have and certainly the 18 that have already ratified have a different view.  We must respect their views also.</P>
        <P>It is a challenging period.  The verdict of the Irish people above all else must be respected as we go forward.  We must look for solutions and we will have to look carefully at the message the Irish people have given.  We must then take that message to our European colleagues and say that this is a message not just from the periphery of Europe but, I have no doubt, from the people across the Union.  As I have said time and again, including when I was Minister of State responsible for European affairs in 2002, the European Union has to reconstruct its connection to its citizens, not just the citizens of this nation but the citizens of all 27 member states.  It must bring to light the continuing benefits the European Union has for us all.  I agree with Senator Doherty in that regard.</P>
        <P>My biggest passion on this issue is driven by the fact that I want my four children to have a future in Europe.  I see their future as being in Europe and I see that Europe is critical to our future and to all of our children&rsquo;s futures.  In particular, the Union will need to speak to the people in a language they understand.  The European project is a wonderful one.  As Senator Walsh reminded us, it has brought peace and prosperity to a continent that tore itself apart in <Col N="254"/>wars of unimaginable bestiality in the first half of the last century.  The prize we are fighting for is a Europe that will continue to bring peace and prosperity into the future.</P>
        <P>It is worth our while, therefore, to put the recriminations to one side, to forget the campaign but not to forget the messages that come from the campaign, and to work for a better future and a better response.  Above all else, we must work to respect the views of the Irish people, to respect the fact they gave us a complex answer, to examine that answer and to see exactly how we go on from here.  Future generations will not thank us if we drop the ball because our attention is on tearing each other apart.  The people of Ireland have a right to expect something higher from politicians on all sides of these Houses than recrimination.</P>
        <P>At the outset of this campaign, I welcomed the fact that the main political parties were our supporters in this campaign and I do so now.  I recognise the difficulties that existed in parties that came through an election campaign last year and faced some disappointment.  It takes courage and a degree of patriotism to put one&rsquo;s own personal animosities and individual attitudes to one side.  The test we face in the months ahead is that we continue to do that.  We showed solidarity with the people and the nation in the campaign, and we must now show solidarity with the aspirations, wishes, hopes and the future of the Irish people in the weeks ahead.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators on all sides.  There was some heat in the debate on occasion but if there was no passion in it, it would not be worth listening to.  As a final point, I want to put on the record of the House, as I did in the other House, my personal gratitude to politicians from all sides of the political divide who engaged actively in the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign.  I understand the sense of triumph there may be on the other side but the reality is that our job now is to serve the Irish people and to do it well.</P>

    <Title>National Drugs Strategy: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the public consultation period of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy Curran, on his first outing to the Seanad.  I move this motion in the hope of encouraging a wide-ranging debate during the public consultation phase of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  I framed the motion broadly to prevent the debate from becoming adversarial.  I am somewhat disappointed, therefore, that the Opposition has chosen to end the debate with a vote.</P>
        <P>My thinking on this matter was stimulated by a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reason for our amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That programme asked whether it was wise to keep to the strategies that have been implemented by governments internationally over many years or whether an alternative was available to this war without end.  It investigated the issue of drugs at the international, national and local levels and asked what we can do to help.  It made a compelling case for a review of our policies, which is the reason I tabled this motion.  It might be useful to include the Seanad in the public consultation phase of the strategy to draw attention to the strategies as they are developed.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>International strategies have been weak in tackling the organised crime which fuels the drug culture.  We need to learn lessons from international thinking on this issue, so I hope to use the opportunity of this debate to explore policies which have been implemented elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State has seen the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.  I found it extraordinary that so many law enforcement officers with years of experience, including former garda&iacute;, thought that the policy of prohibition should be reviewed.  They suggested that no politician would have the courage to make such a statement because of the risk of being regarded as wanting to legalise drugs.  The issues are not so black and white, however, and that is why I sought this debate.  As always, I am delighted to see Senator Donohoe in the Chamber because he is a reasonable man and I am sure he will appreciate my reasons for tabling this motion.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

	<P>The Senators can continue the niceties outside but Senator O&rsquo;Malley should be allowed to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am encouraged by his smiles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is clutching at straws now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want this debate to be framed as calling for the legalisation of drugs because that is not what I am doing.  However, I am seeking a debate on the solutions because if we continue to do more of the same, we will not make progress.  We should not close the door on positive elements of previous strategies or enlightened policies implemented in other countries.  The law enforcement officers interviewed on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; held the opinion that a blanket prohibition is not necessarily the correct way to proceed.  I want to widen this debate so we can critically analyse the issues.</P>
        <P>One academic called for a cost-benefit analysis of prohibition.  That would be useful because we need to consider the real cost of drugs, including alcohol, to society.</P>
        <P>The national drugs strategy comprises four pillars.  The Opposition amendment addresses the first pillar, treatment, and the Minister of State is very familiar with the treatment services needed and how best to target resources.  The previous drugs strategy helped to build the infrastructure for treatment.  Money was available for discussions on what needed to happen and to establish systems.  We have made significant progress but the next phase must include an audit of treatments to determine whether the resources invested are directly benefitting patients through streamlined services.  We need to build a strong conduit that reaches the end user.  Treatment should become a major element of the national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>The second pillar of the strategy is availability.  The Garda has had major success in seizing drugs but only 10% of total imports are detected despite the investment of huge sums of money and resources.  We need to examine how we can improve on that.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, empowered by various items of legislation, has done a tremendous job of pursuing major drug barons.  The CAB is another of the successes of the existing strategy.  Further successes of this nature are required.  The work of the CAB proves that when we are determined to take action, make changes and tackle crime head on, we are well able to do so.  This gives me great encouragement regarding the political will to act, which is vital.  I have no doubt that during his term of office the Minister of State will see to it that practical steps are taken, in the context of the national drugs strategy, to deliver better resources for <Col N="256"/>patients, in the first instance.  Such resources must also be delivered in respect of tackling the cancer that is the major criminal element involved in the supply and distribution of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>In a sense, harm reduction lies at the heart of the prohibition argument.  We do not want people to abuse drugs but they always will.  It is human nature.  We must, therefore, reach out to them in the best way possible.  Harm reduction strategies have been extremely useful in allowing people who are isolated to lead as normal a life as possible.  I would like harm reduction initiatives to form one of the major pillars in the new drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the remainder of the debate and I hope it will continue in the spirit to which I referred earlier.  We must seek solutions and encourage inclusivity.  I look forward to the contributions of Members and the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  I have not consulted Senator O&rsquo;Malley on this matter because I did not have the opportunity to do so.  However, I also have a major difficulty with the way the Opposition drafted its amendment to the motion, which was framed in such a way as to allow all Members to air their views on this issue.  I am somewhat disappointed it has not been taken in that spirit.</P>
        <P>One of the major challenges facing us is the need to guide and nurture our young people in order that they might emerge from our homes and schools as well-rounded and independent individuals.  They need to be well equipped to face the many challenges of the 21st century and they must be well informed of the dangers they face and how these can be overcome.  While this task is not, and never should be, the sole responsibility of Government, we do have a major role to play.  We need to view our society holistically.  It is not possible to fix a systemic breakdown without simultaneously changing every interconnected problem that young people face.</P>
        <P>Drug abuse in all its forms robs young people of their futures.  I include alcohol and tobacco in my description of drugs.  Statistics from the United States show that tobacco kills more people every year than all of the people killed by all illegal drugs in the 20th century.  Alcohol kills 80,000 Americans each year.  In the context of what Senator O&rsquo;Malley said with regard to enforcement and an appropriate response to the different levels of drug abuse, it is interesting that statistics from the US Drug Enforcement Agency indicate that there were no deaths attributable to the use of cannabis.  That is a matter we should re-examine.</P>
        <P>If indignation and impatience could stop the problems of drug abuse, they would have done so long ago.  Righteous though they may be, however, they cannot replace the need for effective strategies that deal with the entire web of problems behind drug abuse.  It is my firm belief that we can make real progress in tackling the drug culture by beginning at the very basic building blocks of society, namely, our homes and communities.  Community-based, collaborative efforts have proven to be the key to reaching out to those at risk and preventing abuse and neglect.  If we take responsibility for ourselves, our families and our local communities we can ensure that neighbourhood by neighbourhood and town by town, abuse rates will continue to fall.</P>
        <P>The Government is intent on supporting this type of local based effort and a further &euro;2 million has been allocated in 2008 to develop and strengthen the work of the local drugs task forces and facilitate the implementation of projects under the emerging needs fund.  More than 440 local drugs task force projects, including those under the emerging needs fund, are in receipt of moneys from the Department.  The 2008 allocation of &euro;22 million for such projects shows an increase of 9.5% over the amount spent in 2007.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on one aspect of the battle against drug abuse, namely, the provision of credible and appropriate social outlets for young people, particularly those in the 13 to 18 age <Col N="257"/>group.  Research carried out on behalf of the Government in recent years shows that children in this age group are most susceptible to alcohol and drug abuse.  If we can succeed in getting young people in this age group through this difficult period, unscathed by the effects of drug abuse, we will be well on the way to solving this problem nationally.</P>
        <P>A nationwide network of youth caf&eacute;s forms the centrepiece of the Government&rsquo;s policy on developing recreational facilities for young people.  The need for improved recreational options has consistently been raised by teenagers in consultations with and surveys carried out by a range of bodies in recent years.  In particular, young people have said they want a place where they can hang out with friends, where they will be safe and over which they will have a sense of ownership.  This policy has been welcomed by many youth representatives around the country. Comhairle na n&Oacute;g &mdash; our young people&rsquo;s parliament &mdash; has highlighted a grave lack of recreation facilities in some areas, particularly for teenagers who are not sport orientated.</P>
        <P>I was recently fortunate enough to be asked to speak to a local junior certificate class about the wonders of the democratic process.  In light of his comments earlier today, perhaps I should have allowed Senator O&rsquo;Toole speak to them because he might have had a far more interesting perspective on the matter.  Towards the end of our discussion, I asked the 15 year olds in the class what would be their priority if they were allowed to govern the country for one day.  Without hesitation and with total unanimity they said they would provide a youth caf&eacute; in every town.  The young men in the class pointed out that there were only four pool tables in their town and that all were located in pubs.  These young men told me that, despite what people might think, they do not want to go into pubs.  They stated that they feel extremely vulnerable in the pub environment and would give anything to be able to meet and play pool in a space they could call their own.  Young people themselves have identified recreational opportunities as one of the most important quality-of-life issues in Ireland in recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased the Minister of State with responsibility for children and his officials are examining various models of youth caf&eacute;s and that a template could be ready soon for the development of such facilities in our communities.  However I suggest that we already have a model or template which, with a little modification, could be used to empower communities to provide youth caf&eacute;s for their young people.  The equal opportunities child care programme is a shining example of how self-sufficient and proactive communities can be empowered to provide facilities for themselves.  Since the programme&rsquo;s inception in 2000, more than 50,000 child care places have been provided by communities.  This is the model we could use for youth caf&eacute;s.  Young people and their mentors could identify and substantiate a need for a youth caf&eacute; in their area.  They could be directly involved in designing it and, with capital investment from the Government similar to that relating to child care, we could easily roll out a nationwide network of youth cafes in record time.  With respect, there is no need to reinvent the wheel in this instance.  I ask that at some point in the near future the Minister of State with responsibility for children return to the House to debate this matter further.</P>
        <P>I am heartened by the approach taken by the Government in respect of education on drug abuse.  The main focus of the national drugs strategy regarding education is on preventative strategies, targeting the primary and secondary levels, as well as the informal education sector, which includes youth services.  Arising from this, all schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes included on their curricula.  A consequence of this policy is that we are equipping all students with knowledge regarding the dangers of drug misuse.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has in place a national curriculum for social, personal and health education, SPHE, which is backed up by teacher guidelines and a full-time support service through which teacher training is provided.  The programme consists of a number of modules, including one relating to substance abuse, at both primary and post-<Col N="258"/>primary level.  Within the SPHE programme, the Walk Tall programme has been developed, in co-operation with the health sector, as the substance misuse prevention programme at primary level.  The latter programme is part of the primary school curriculum &mdash; from junior infants to sixth class &mdash; and is supported by the primary curriculum support programme on a national basis.  Social, personal and health education is a mandatory component of the junior cycle curriculum at post-primary level and is supported by the SPHE support service.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that progress is being made in the area of education on the dangers of drug abuse.  This policy of education is without doubt the most important and powerful tool we have in the war against drugs.  Empowering young people to make the right decision in respect of drugs is the real issue.  Armed with the right information and provided with the facilities to socialise in a safe and credible environment, they will make the decision that they do not need drugs of any kind.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />introduce additional residential services in line with recommendations, in order to reduce waiting times for drug treatment services.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.  The motion before us is welcome and timely but I make no apology for proposing the Fine Gael amendment.  I do so on behalf of the ordinary people of Ireland who have asked us to represent them in this Chamber.  These are people whose family members have been victims <Col N="259"/>of drugs and who have today and this week on TV3 painted a very graphic story of what it means to be a citizen of Ireland in this century.</P>
        <P>This Government came into power more than 11 years ago with a national drugs strategy we all welcomed and bought into.  We can consider its four pillars.  Supply reduction has failed and a 10% detection rate with regard to prevention is not good enough.  With regard to treatment, residential treatment centres are not available and detox beds are not in place.  There are waiting lists for methadone treatment.  It is not good enough.  We have research coming out of our ears but there is no leadership or Government action.</P>
        <P>I make no apology for tabling an amendment to the motion.  I am not being adversarial.  I have listened to the people of Cork who attended the consultative process and read or heard what they said.  The character of drug use has changed from the 1980s and 1990s to today, which the Minister of State himself knows.  We should not bury our heads in the sand.</P>
        <P>In a very eloquent opening, Senator O&rsquo;Malley asked if there was an alternative to this war without end.  I hope there is.  Senator Cannon spoke of empowerment and that we should educate people but such action needs genuine political leadership which challenges, provides resources and empowers people.  That is not happening.</P>
        <P>Senators can give me all the replies in the world and speeches with statistics concerning money and local drugs task forces, but this action is not happening locally.  The figures, unfortunately, prove this and I get no joy from saying that.  I have visited classrooms where people have seen their peers committing suicide because they owe money to drug barons which they cannot afford to repay.  I have gone to the homes of families run out of estates because they are afraid of living in Ireland today.  That is the war we are talking about.</P>
        <P>The people in question are not grandiose but are ordinary people struggling and trying to get out of a mire.  Senators should not lecture me about being adversarial.  This Government came into power and indicated it would have a consultative process and drug strategies.  We have not learned.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Government is presiding over.  With regard to residential treatment centres and detox beds, there are nine counties with no such facilities after 11 years of prosperity.  Senators have the temerity to come in and lecture us on how to tackle drugs but we should get real.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to talk about the twin pillars of education and enforcement, we should have real and meaningful education that will tackle the core of the issue and give young people an opportunity to buy in.</P>
        <P>I subscribe to Senator Cannon&rsquo;s comments on the use of youth caf&eacute;s.  We have one in my local election area of Togher and it is brilliant.  We also have a brilliant example in Ballinlough.  The Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il have been in Government for 11 years but we have seen no national roll-out strategy of youth caf&eacute;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>What would the Senator do differently?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I would introduce them immediately.  We should empower, enforce, educate and resource.  We should not kid ourselves.  Senators on the Government side have come to this debate to lecture us.  We accept money is not the answer but the essence of what we are at is down to problems such as a sevenfold increase in the use of cannabis.  If we need to take in the variations across the counties of the country, we should do so, but we need absolute consistency from Government, which we have not had.</P>
        <P>What did the Progressive Democrats former Minister do when he was in Government on the issue?  He did nothing.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, who formerly had responsibility in this area, he went out to meet the people, listened and engaged.</P>
        <P>I have a fundamental difficulty with this Government because there has not been a reduction in the availability of illicit drugs.  The national drugs strategy aims to enable people with drug misuse problems to access treatment and other supports in order to reintegrate into society.  Since this strategy came into being, the reality has been very different.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must accept that we have seen an increase in drug use in rural Ireland, cities and townlands across the country.  The process of making treatment available has not been given the necessary priority, which is a point on which Senator O&rsquo;Malley and I differ.  There is also the issue of residential detox bed availability, the number of which remains at 23 in the most recent report of the working group on drug rehabilitation.  The report stated that for our population we should have 89 beds, yet it only recommends an increase of 25 beds.  That leaves a deficit of 41.</P>
        <P>Today we welcome an opportunity to offer input to the next stage of the national drugs strategy.  The previous strategy did not meet its own aims and aspirations, even in a time of unbelievable wealth and boom in the economy.  Given the people now in charge, although with a new Minister, what is the likelihood of the next phase meeting its aims and objectives?  I hope they will be achieved and that there will be no difficulty in convincing this side of the House about it.  We need action rather than just talk.  It is time to deliver and it is time for accountability in this war against drugs.</P>
        <P>I am sceptical because after 11 years in power, what have we seen from this Government?  Why have we seen members of the Coast Guard or Garda on television this week lamenting the lack of resources and joined-up thinking?  We should have investment in youth.  We are <Col N="261"/>hiding behind RAPID and Leader programmes as we have done nothing for middle class areas.  People are crying out for help in such places but because they have a certain income, help cannot be provided.  RAPID and Leader areas are correctly prioritised but this is a classless war.  Drugs go across the boundaries of society.</P>
        <P>It is for such reasons we have tabled our amendment.  Blame can be apportioned with regard to the lack of treatment facilities, and this blame must be political, involving the Government and Health Service Executive.  It is paradoxical that on one hand the Government is extolling people to stop taking drugs and seek treatment and yet these people cannot access treatment.  Why is that the case, particularly in considering the rehabilitation pillar of the national drugs strategy?  Why has it not been fulfilled?</P>
        <P>We welcome the debate on this side and I am not being adversarial.  I have been involved in my community helping young people all my life.</P>

We must learn from the mistakes that have been made and go forward.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, will, like a new broom, bring an enlightened vision to this area.  I look forward to his input and he will not face difficulties from this side of the House.  However, he should not come to this House to tell us all is well when his party has been in Government for the past 11 years and has never had more money at its disposal.  Like everything his party has done in Government, it has blown it on this issue.  We are talking about people, young and old, not commodities or statistics.  They are our fellow citizens.  Some of them have died, some are struggling and, thankfully, some have been rehabilitated.  It is the job of Senators on this side of the House to point out deficiencies and challenge the Government to lead.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to second the amendment to the Government&rsquo;s motion tabled by my colleague, Senator Buttimer.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the House.</P>
        <P>My support for Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s amendment is forged by the constituency I represent, Dublin Central.  In recent months I have had two experiences that emphasise that this amendment is correct and that it is important we debate this issue.  The first experience occurs annually in my constituency.  The inner city portion of Dublin Central is the cradle that gave birth to the citizen-led, people-driven movement that was so successful in tackling the heroin epidemic in the area in the 1980s.  The ordinary people we represent saw the failures of the State and of politicians and decided to take power into their own hands, take to the streets and set up organisations that survive to this day.  They give people the power to recognise the scale of the <Col N="262"/>epidemic they face and the fact that more needs to be done to tackle it.  Every year one of these organisations organises a mass for people who died due to drug abuse, the victims of a scourge.  Their families come together to pay homage to their memories and reflect on what they have lost.  Seeing people come together to mourn the tragedy of lives lost and potential unrealised should give all politicians pause to question how current policy in this area should be changed.  The scale of damage to communities is immense.</P>
        <P>The second area I wish to allude to is more positive and gives me more hope.  Work is being done in local communities to tackle this issue and provide leadership, but often this is due to the failure of Government initiatives.  The Minister of State attended the launch of the annual report of the Anna Liffey drug project last week, as did I.  It is based in Abbey Street and is at the cutting edge in dealing with homeless people and those with chronic addiction problems.  I recognise the recent intervention of the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor in stepping in to meet a funding gap faced by the project and making new facilities available.  I know the Minister of State was supportive of this action.  Owing to the services the project provides, it is at the cutting edge of giving treatment and hope to these people.  The leadership provided by the likes of Mr. Tony Duffin in addressing this issue is inspirational.  We must look to the models provided locally as a source of inspiration for how to move forward nationally.</P>
        <P>The North Inner City Community Forum and the North West Inner City Community Forum are brilliant in this regard.  These organisations were set up owing to frustration in communities at the lack of recognition of the issue that exists and at the fact that not enough is being done to address the it.  Seeing the work done by these groups makes it clear to me why an amendment to this motion is necessary.  The role of politicians and the Government is to provide leadership on this issue.  It is not our role to form a consensus, for its own sake, on what needs to be done.  We can see many examples of agreed strategy not being implemented.</P>
        <P>Listening to this debate unfold reminded me of G.K. Chesterton&rsquo;s sentiments on Christianity.  He felt it is a great idea and we should give it a try.  Strategies and pillars on this issue have been laid out but, as Senator Buttimer outlined, in many cases they are not implemented.  Before we move on to the next model we must see what has been implemented and what is working of what was agreed.  The need for this debate was highlighted by the contributions of my colleagues from the Progressive Democrats.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley suggested the need for a strong, liberal review of current policy and the possible examination of whether prohibition is working, with a debate to follow.  On the other hand, Senator Cannon spoke of the need for youth caf&eacute;s.  The attitudes behind these contributions are remarkably different and that is why this debate is so important.  The pillars outlined by Senator Buttimer indicate that the strategy we are discussing has not been implemented and young people have lost their lives and potential because of this.</P>
        <P>There is a 12-month waiting list in Dublin for people seeking access to treatment and this indicates, contrary to what Senator Butler may think, that in many cases money is still the issue.  It would be premature for us to start considering the next model to address this issue when in our capital and in cities and counties throughout the country people must wait 12, 14, and 15 months for the treatment they need.</P>
        <P>If we are to reduce the supply of drugs, the Criminal Assets Bureau must complement its focus on large-scale drugs sources with a focus on middle men and small-scale suppliers.  We must look at those who get drugs abroad and take deliveries from large-scale suppliers.  The Criminal Assets Bureau should focus on tackling middle men and suppliers on the street.  We want to see the funds confiscated from such people reinvested locally to supply treatment beds and ensure people need not wait 12 to 14 months for the treatment they require.</P><Col N="263"/>
        <P>I appreciate Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s recognition of my reasoned approach to some aspects of this and am all in favour of a debate on new approaches and strategies.  However, we must first examine whether the current strategy is being implemented.  I am not sure we need to reinvent the wheel.  We know what the model is for success.  We need to ensure the funding and the will exist to make it happen.  As we have already pointed out, this is often not the case at present.  That is why we are pushing this amendment, which is badly needed in a debate such as this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate, which is long overdue.  I agree that it is the job of the Opposition to be critical of various things we do.  However, it is important to bear in mind that we are opening up this debate to the public.  We are reviewing the current strategy, which is a good thing.  I attended some of the strategy meetings myself, and one aspect of the working group was to examine what is working and what is not working.  The aspect that continues to be relevant is the operation and effectiveness of the structures involved.  They are very important.  People now see that good work has been done in various communities down through the years.  Nowhere was worse affected by the drugs problem than certain areas of Dublin, such as the north inner city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and telling me how to deal with drugs is preaching to the converted.</P>
        <P>It is not an easy subject.  Money is not the be-all and end-all.  It is good from a budgeting point of view for delivering services in certain areas, but the big problem in many cases is the money available to young people who are able to buy these drugs.  That is one of the issues we must tackle.  Family is the basis for the social behaviour of young people who get involved in drugs.  I believe that families must be responsible and take into consideration that ten to 20 year olds are liable to get involved with drugs.  When the family unit works strongly together, these are the people who are taken into consideration.  This is one of the ways in which we can confront the drug addiction problem.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, has several projects which deal with young people and tackling behavioural problems which in part may lead to substance abuse.  This must be tackled and it cannot be left unchecked.  We must consider what programmes are to be delivered by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Home life is very important.  Young people are affected by seeing the abuse of prescription drugs in the home.  Even the local GP who dishes out prescriptions willy-nilly is implicated.  This is highly relevant.  Drugs are left around the house, unprotected, and young people will get involved.  Alcohol is not a prescription drug but it is also abused within the home.  There is no control and it is not kept under lock and key by parents, and young people have access to it.  The family is the most important thing in the fight against the drug culture.  The mid-term review of the national drugs strategy suggested building on the role of families in the rehabilitation process.  We must give these families the help they require.</P>
        <P>With regard to the prevention pillar of the national drug strategy, the Government has enjoyed some success in the area of social, personal and health education, including the Walk Tall programme mentioned by my colleague.  Government has also acted swiftly on the recommendations of the alcohol advisory group and has introduced the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which tackles the sale and consumption of drink by strengthening the powers of the Garda to confiscate drink and controlling the physical environment of shops in which alcohol is sold.  This is a vital first step.  Alcohol is a gateway drug that leads to abuse of other drugs such as amphetamines.  Nine thousand members of the public, which is a significant number, visit our accident and emergency departments every year due to the effects of alcohol.  We must deal with this.  I would also go further and advise that a heavy excise duty be put on alcohol, alcopops, &ldquo;baggies&rdquo; and cigarettes.  This would certainly help reduce their use among some young people who can readily get them.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>The Government has an awareness campaign, organised by the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, which targets young people of between ten and 20 who are at risk.  With regard to sport and recreational facilities, &euro;125 million has been spent on 500 projects.  It is important to bear in mind that the project has been responsible for the introduction of many sporting facilities.  Several successful cocaine projects in Tallaght and in various other areas have helped.  Education is another pillar of the national strategy.  It is essential that we take every opportunity to educate young people on the consequences of drug and alcohol abuse.  Treatment facilities are also important.  Approximately 8,600 clients are now undergoing methadone treatment around the country, which is a significant increase.  This is an important aspect of the campaign that is now, in timely fashion, being reviewed.</P>
        <P>Society must take a harder stance against drugs.  There seems to be an acceptance of soft drug abuse in our society.  A policeman told me recently that he caught a young guy with some hash in his pocket, but when he rang the boy&rsquo;s mother she asked him whether he did not have something better to do than to pull up her son for carrying soft drugs.  While we have that sort of attitude our approach will certainly not work.  We must take a tough stance in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are currently taking a joint approach to implementing the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy.  The inter-agency approach includes an increase in the number of residential detoxification beds, investigation of the impact of community employment schemes, and broader life issues such as education and medical support.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a key role in tackling the problem of drug misuse locally, nationally and internationally.  The Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminals and networks in order to tackle the distribution of illicit drugs.  These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in drug distribution, including the support structures underpinning these activities, and conducting target operations on criminal networks based on intelligence and collaborative work.</P>
        <P>The review of the drugs strategy is important.  It is not the case, as Senator Buttimer said, that we simply have not delivered in various areas.  By discussing this issue and reaching conclusions we could have collaborative support in the House on the way to tackle the drugs problem.  It is too serious an issue with which to play politics.  Too many people have died in this and other cities for us to be political about this issue.  We must find a solution to this problem, a political one if we can, although that will be difficult.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  I know he will do a good job.  His predecessor brought this issue into the domain of public contributions on a new way forward to tackle this problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his new appointment.  I thank the Progressive Democrats for tabling this motion.  It is good to have a debate on the new national drugs strategy and I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to it.  Many people were disappointed with the previous strategy.  There has been a failure to implement many of its recommendations.  It is for that reason that I wish to state my party will support the Fine Gael amendment to the motion.</P>
        <P>We had an opportunity in recent months to debate the drugs problem and the national drugs strategy with the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor.  I would like to reiterate a few points I have raised previously, mainly centring on harm reduction, the introduction of a modern approach to drug treatment and the control of diseases associated with drugs.</P><Col N="265"/>
        <P>Dealing with drug addiction will be a pivotal part of the new strategy, but we cannot ignore the peripheral issues associated with drug addiction such as infection and homelessness.  The spread of infectious diseases among drug users is a growing and dangerous problem facing us all.  The Merchant&rsquo;s Quay Project has been at the forefront of drugs counselling in Dublin for almost 20 years.  I read with interest its new submission on the new drugs strategy and once again it centres on the issue of harm reduction.  It is still calling for a 24-hour needle exchange programme that can be expanded throughout the country, as was promised in the previous strategy but still has not been delivered.  We need to revisit that issue and introduce one as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>We know that 60% to 70% of intravenous drug users are infected with hepatitis C.  There is no vaccine to prevent contracting it, but treatment is available in the form of drugs such as Interferon.  Drug users, under the Merchant&rsquo;s Quay plan, access primary and mental health care where necessary.  They also obtain clean paraphernalia and access to hepatitis C treatment.  However, we also need to focus on promoting immunisation against other diseases such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the incidences of which are high among drug users.</P>
        <P>We need to re-examine the issue of clinical treatment.  Methadone is the drug of choice in terms of treatment, but often it is not effective.  Some people cannot use it and some users react badly to it.  Any treatment plan needs to move beyond the issue of the usage of methadone to include, perhaps, morphine and other substances.</P>
        <P>The new drugs strategy needs to have a comprehensive picture of how to deal with the issue of homelessness and drug use.  Ireland has a rapidly growing homeless population and we would all agree that the link between homelessness and drug addiction is undeniable.  Homeless drug users have always proven to be the hardest people to help.  It is estimated that 45% of Dublin&rsquo;s homeless population has a dependence in some form or other on drug use.  A recent Merchant&rsquo;s Quay Project survey revealed that 93% of the drug addicts surveyed were homeless at some point and 63% of them were homeless at the time the survey was conducted.</P>
        <P>Other sections of society still suffer from the ravages of hard drug use.  Probably none is more ignored than our prison population.  We can argue all night about how drugs get into our prisons.  We should be able to find some way of preventing that, but the fact is there are drugs in our prisons.  We have to deal with that issue and ensure prisoners are kept safe from potential infections.  One way we can do that is to ensure there is an effective needle exchange programme in our prisons.  A survey of drug users in prison in 1999 revealed that 21% &mdash; one in every five &mdash; of intravenous drug users first injected when they went to prison.  Is there still no plan to introduce a needle exchange programme in Dublin&rsquo;s Mountjoy Prison?  Such a programme is the single most effective way of combating disease and infection among addicts in prisons.  We need to examine the introduction of such a programme in our prisons.</P>
        <P>Switzerland was the first country to initiate a needle exchange programme in prisons in 1992.  The prison staff quickly became supporters of it because they found they were working in a safer environment and the incidence of infection among inmates declined.  In 1996 Germany introduced a needle exchange programme in three prisons initially and quickly extended it to a fourth prison when they recognised the success of the programme in those three prisons.  However, there was a change of ideology which resulted in that programme being removed even though the prison staff were quite supportive of it.  It is prison staff who are always the first to criticise the removal or cessation of needle exchange programmes within prisons.  We need to examine that issue.</P>
        <P>We must learn valuable lessons from aboard for our national drugs strategy in the area of harm reduction and also from projects in this country such as the Merchant&rsquo;s Quay Project.  We need a comprehensive and nationwide needle exchange programme.  We need to revise <Col N="266"/>and rethink our attitude towards medical treatment.  Importantly, we need to find a way of locating homeless people and ensuring drug use among that population is well categorised.  We need to tackle that issue to ensure these people can become clean and have a new start in life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  As was mentioned, this is my first official visit to the Seanad.  I was on the far side of the glass partition any time I was here previously.</P>
        <P>I thank the Seanad for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the development of a new national drugs strategy.  I welcome it and it is important that Members of this House have an opportunity to contribute to what will be a new national strategy.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the fact that the current national drugs strategy grew out of the efforts of Members of the Oireachtas across various parties in the mid to late 1990s and I acknowledge the work and commitment of all involved at that time.  The Government is determined that the new strategy will facilitate its tackling of the illicit drugs problem in a comprehensive and effective way.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer passed significant comment on the current strategy and raised a number of issues.  He can put forward figures on what was not done and find flaws with the strategy and I can rebut them and point out the aspects of it that worked.  It is much more important that we analyse the current strategy and ascertain what worked well, why it worked well and what did not work.  It is important that we embark on a new national strategy because the problems we face today are somewhat different from those that were faced when the first strategy was formulated.  In many ways the first strategy reflected a problem of the time &mdash; a particular drug was prevalent in particular areas.  The scene has changed completely now and some of the gaps the Senator indicated are in areas that traditionally would not have had a drugs problem.  It is in that context we need a full debate on a new national strategy to tackle this problem.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Senator about the need for an analysis of the current strategy.  That is taking place as part of the public consultation process. We must learn from the mistakes made but  we also must learn from our successes and achievements.  We need to recognise what is working well and why.  I agree with the Senator that the services provided throughout the country are considerably different.  That all forms part of our debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>The issue of problem drug use is complex and difficult.  It is a global issue and no country has succeeded in coming to terms with all aspects of the problem.  Our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in that context.  The current strategy represented our first attempt to develop a fully co-ordinated response to the threat from problem drug use.  It grew out of the threat posed at that time, by heroin in particular, to individuals, families and communities.</P>
        <P>It is important to put on record that the strategy has had many achievements.  One is the significantly increased level of drug seizures by the Garda and Customs and Excise.  I wish to make a point in this regard. Senator O&rsquo;Malley made the point that this may represent only 10% of the total volume of drugs in circulation.  That is the figure that is generally referred to in the media.  There is no certainty in this regard.  For example, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, suggests the EU-wide seizure rate is 25%, while the UN goes further in stating that 40% of world drug production is seized.  By their nature, the figures are not definitive and there is a broad range of views, from the 10% usually put forward by the media to the UN estimate of 40%.  We must be careful, therefore, when discussing the figures.  What is certain is that any critical analysis would show that the Garda <Col N="267"/>has become much more successful both in terms of the number of seizures and the quantities of drugs intercepted.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant increase in the availability of treatment facilities, with the national drug treatment reporting system, NDTRS, indicating that more than 12,700 people are in treatment for problem drug use in a range of services provided across the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  Approximately 8,600 of these are in receipt of methadone.  Preventative measures have been put in place, such as the roll-out of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, and Walk Tall programmes in schools.  The success of the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund is such that it is being extended to operate in Arklow, Wexford, Athlone and Dundalk.  Research is taking place in areas such as drugs prevalence, cocaine use, treatment outcomes and the effect of drugs on families which inform our current programmes and help us to map out our future approach.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to outline briefly the process by which the new national drugs strategy is being developed.  A steering group was appointed at the end of 2007 to develop proposals and make recommendations on a new strategy.  This group comprises representatives of the key statutory, community and voluntary interests involved in tackling problem drug use.  Consultants have also been appointed to assist the steering group in its work.  The group is examining the progress and impact of the current strategy, considering the degree to which it continues to be relevant in a changing Ireland and looking at the operational effectiveness of the structures involved.  It is also monitoring developments in regard to drug policies at EU and international level to ensure any new developments and approaches are considered for incorporation into our strategy.</P>
        <P>To obtain the views of as wide a range of interested parties as possible, a broad consultation process has been overseen by my Department.  I am directly involved in these consultations.  As part of this, a series of 15 public consultation meetings was held throughout the State.  Meetings with relevant Departments and agencies are now nearing completion and a series of meetings with key sectoral groups and organisations working in the drugs area is about to commence.  Further meetings are planned with appropriate focus groups, including problem drug users, young people at risk and immigrant groups, while submissions in writing and by e-mail will continue to be accepted until the end of this month.</P>
        <P>I have attended several of the public consultation meetings and most of the consultation meetings with the relevant agencies.  Some of the bodies with a role to play include the Health Service Executive, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Customs and Excise, the probation and welfare service, the Courts Service and the Department of Education and Science.  We have had consultations with all these parties on the aspects of the drugs strategy for which they have responsibility.  My role is largely to co-ordinate the services, in education, health and so on, which are delivered by other Departments and bodies.  The consultation process thus far has been extensive and detailed.  Senator Buttimer asked whether it involved a review of the current approach.  That is the correct way to begin any process &mdash; by looking at current practice and moving on from there &mdash; and that is what we have done.</P>
        <P>The public consultation meetings are central to the work of formulating a new strategy.  These meetings sought to identify the concerns facing individuals and communities, the successful aspects of the existing strategy and the gaps that must be addressed with a view to identifying the main priorities for any new strategy.  We recognise that the current system is not perfect.  That is why we are affording the public the opportunity to have an input into how it might be improved.  Most of the people who attend these meetings are directly affected by drug abuse.  They know what they are talking about.  There would be no point in my claiming at <Col N="268"/>these meetings that everything is perfect.  This public consultation process proved to be a genuinely beneficial exercise at which we learned more than we would by sitting in Leinster House.  We engaged directly with the public and received excellent feedback from those who are involved in this area daily.</P>
        <P>While there were interesting regional variations, there was a reasonably significant level of consistency in the views expressed at these meetings.  Some of the concerns identified were the level of heroin use outside Dublin and the availability of drugs services generally outside the Dublin area.  Other issues identified were addiction to prescription and over-the-counter drugs, the level of acceptance of alcohol abuse in Ireland, the importance of engaging and supporting families, and issues of family intimidation.  In regard to the latter, the need for increased supports for families, as referred to by Senator Buttimer, came across strongly.</P>
        <P>In terms of efforts to deal with the problem of drug misuse, participants in the public meetings acknowledged the increased rate of drug seizures and the improved performance of the Garda in this regard.  Other improvements that were mentioned included increased funding, the usefulness of integrated services when they are in place, and the increased utilisation of a community partnership approach.  The latter was of particular importance to participants, with many emphasising that the new strategy must have links to the community.  People also referred to various individual initiatives in different areas.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe asked about the Criminal Assets Bureau going after middle-tier dealers.  It is often the case that some aspects of illegal drugs activity receive little media attention because they are not seen as glamorous.  However, at my meetings with the Garda I have been given clear indications that they are going after the middle men.  For example, they have seized vehicles and other assets from what we would loosely refer to as middle dealers.  This is something the Garda and Criminal Assets Bureau have already embarked upon.</P>
        <P>Key priorities for the future were identified at the public consultation meetings.  These included the provision of preventative initiatives in schools as well as in out-of-school settings; an increased range and availability of treatment services, with a continuum of care for individuals and an integrated multi-agency approach; more widespread availability of methadone, with options to move on from this treatment; a greater focus on rehabilitation of problem drug users; more family support measures; and a more integrated approach to the problems of illicit drugs and alcohol, with some favouring a joint strategy.  This gives merely a flavour of the views expressed.  Comprehensive outcome reports of the 15 public consultation meetings are being posted on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pobail.ie.</i></P>
        <P>There has been a quantum leap in the range and quality of work being undertaken under the existing strategy compared with what was in place in 2000.  In that regard, I acknowledge the dedication and commitment of those involved at the coalface in delivering these services.  In speaking to some of these people since my appointment, a constant theme that arises is the importance of inter-agency co-operation across all sectors and organisations.  That type of inter-agency co-operation to maximise the impact of initiatives for the benefit of problem drug users and for society generally is something we must aim to get right.  This is also emphasised in the report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, the implementation of the recommendations of which is envisaged under the programme for Government.  In that regard, the HSE is progressing the recruitment of a senior rehabilitation co-ordinator and will establish the national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee by September.</P>
        <P>The drugs situation in this State and worldwide is evolving constantly and we must endeavour to be flexible in our attitudes, structures and policies so that we can adapt our approach to meet whatever challenges arise.  I stress that the relevance of all aspects of the current national <Col N="269"/>drugs strategy are subject to scrutiny, whether the five pillars, the structures for implementation, the roles of the various players or the more detailed actions outlined in the strategy.  The partnership approach of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors has been key in achieving progress thus far.  While a continuation of that partnership approach is envisaged, we now have an important opportunity to look at the structures through which we deliver that partnership and to consider whether there are more effective ways of achieving our goals.</P>
        <P>Ireland has changed significantly since the current strategy was activated in 2001.  Our increased prosperity has had many benefits for our people.  However, prosperity has also brought challenges, not least in the context of drugs.  We must not underestimate the need to continue to focus on the heroin problem, particularly in the context of social disadvantage.  At the same time, cocaine has emerged as a significant problem.  In addition, polydrug use, involving a combination of illicit and legal drugs, including alcohol, has become common during the lifetime of the current strategy.  The use of illicit drugs now occurs across all social strata and, it would appear, is increasingly spread geographically across the country.</P>
        <P>The joint report of the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, and the national drug strategy team, NDST, on cocaine forms the basis of a co-ordinated response to the emergence of the cocaine issue and many of the recommendations of the report are in the process of being implemented.  The central conclusion of the report was that treatment in the form of counselling works and the Health Service Executive, as well as some community-based services, are working to develop and re-engineer services so that those who present with a cocaine habit can receive appropriate treatment.</P>
        <P>Apart from the appalling consequences for the people directly involved, drug use also causes social and economic harm to families, friends, communities and society as a whole.  Despite the best efforts of many, some communities are experiencing anti-social behaviour, intimidation and violence which is linked to the criminal activity associated with the supply and use of drugs.  Furthermore, great economic loss to the country is involved through the waste of the potential input that many people who get caught up with drugs could have made to society and through the costs that arise from their involvement with drugs, particularly in the areas of health care and the criminal justice system.  People are increasingly exercised about the issue of alcohol use, and alcohol as a gateway to illicit drugs is also a real issue.  The process of developing a new national drugs strategy affords the opportunity for debate on how synergies between alcohol and drugs policies can be improved and, indeed, whether a single substance misuse strategy is now appropriate to cover all.</P>
        <P>I am cognisant of the all-party motion passed by the Seanad in December recognising the problems of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use in our society, and acknowledging the need for a co-ordinated cross-departmental approach to these problems.  I am determined to tackle the problems arising into the future and the new strategy is vital in forming the framework through which this will be done.  The comments and suggestions of the Members who have contributed to the debate are appreciated and have been noted.  This might be a Private Members&rsquo; debate but I am using it as part of the public consultation process.  I have listened carefully to the points and noted them.</P>
        <P>One of the Senators spoke about education.  There are various relevant modules within SPHE and the education curriculum.  One of the keys to dealing with this issue is prevention, so we must develop those models further.  It is my belief that education and prevention must be stronger.  We have created awareness.  However, as a father of two schoolgoing children aged 11 and 16, who would be mad if they heard me mention it, I am, perhaps, conducting my own research and evaluation in the home.  The education aspect is one I wish to see further developed and examined.  I thank Members for the opportunity of participating in this debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  It is my first opportunity to participate in a debate with him.  I was in Slieverue in my constituency last Friday after the Lisbon treaty referendum count.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the area.  People were raising the green flag at the local national school and a little fellow approached me with a trophy he had won after captaining the Slieverue school team.  He asked me if I knew his cousin, John Curran.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s mother is from that part of the country.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his office.  His comments indicate he has a good grasp of the issues in this area.  I was not present for the start of the debate so I am not familiar with what other Members have said.  Unquestionably, over the past 15 years this country has changed a great deal.  One of the changes for the worse is the spiralling problem of the misuse of all types of drugs, be they illegal substances, prescribed drugs or alcohol.  I welcome the opportunity the Progressive Democrats have given Members to discuss the drafting of the new national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the problems associated with the misuse of drugs, especially anti-social behaviour.  All Members are aware of the trauma that is caused and the anti-social behaviour that takes place in our communities as a result of people&rsquo;s dependency on drugs.  I firmly believe that insufficient resources have been allocated to the relevant authorities, particularly the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In certain urban areas additional resources have been provided to the Garda but that has not happened in rural areas.  It is a sad statement about Ireland in 2008 that at every crossroads in the country, be it in Slieverue or my local area of Tullogher in Kilkenny, one can acquire an illegal substance of any description.  We are not doing enough to help the Garda to police those communities.</P>
        <P>I am not seeking a heavy-handed approach.  However, if it is well known in an area that there are suspicious activities at a particular location, the Garda authorities should be informed.  I have had reason to do that on a number of occasions, but the Garda does not have the resources to police those areas at the times these activities are taking place.  Something as simple as policing those areas can act as a basic deterrent.  One could argue that those activities would be moved to another location but the Garda resources could move with them.  However, there is no move, particularly in rural areas, to provide those additional resources.</P>
        <P>I learned an astonishing statistic shortly after I was elected to the Seanad six years ago, that is, that the highest proportion of heroin users outside the city of Dublin is in Carlow town.  That is probably related to the proximity of Carlow to Dublin but I have not seen and do not see sufficient resources being given to the local community in Carlow to confront what is a relatively new problem in the area.  It is a problem that has grown exponentially even during my few years of involvement in public life.</P>
        <P>In the midst of this is the ongoing problem of the lack of facilities in many new communities and in rural areas for young people to distract them from the lures of drug abuse.  One might consider it a case of seeking to close the door after the horse has bolted, given that the years of the Celtic tiger are over but insufficient moneys were invested in developing amenities that would have distracted young people from drug use over the years.  There is also a problem in many communities with regard to the re-investment of the funds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The funds have been gathered from the proceeds of the illegal activities taking place in many communities throughout the country and radical improvement is required in that regard under the new national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>One of the best rehabilitation centres in the country is the Aislinn Centre in Ballyragget in my constituency.  It has been recognised as such over recent years.  I welcome the call in the Fine Gael amendment for additional residential services for people who are addicted to sub<Col N="271"/>stances.  There is a shortfall in such services.  Again, this comes back to the issue of providing resources and ensuring these facilities are provided.  It is not an easy task, especially in light of the new economic circumstances, but it must be addressed if we are serious about dealing with the drugs problem in this country.</P>
        <P>I share the views of other speakers and the Minister of State with regard to whether alcohol should be discussed in the context of the drugs strategy.  At the end of his contribution the Minister of State asked whether we should have a strategy for the misuse and abuse of substances across the board.  I think we should have such a strategy and look at the bigger picture.</P>
        <P>I am not a saint and I am partial to the odd drink, as is the Minister of State, but I believe there is a connection.  Alcohol has become a gateway drug.  We have a problem in this country.  We often laugh about it and even now I made a joke about it but the abuse of alcohol goes unnoticed in Ireland.  If we are serious about our drugs strategy, alcohol must be included within it.  As a nation we no longer can afford to turn a blind eye to the abuse of alcohol as a substance which takes place much more regularly throughout the State than that of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>The final issue I wish to raise is the abuse of prescription drugs.  I was not familiar with this until a case presented itself to me recently.  It concerned a person who became addicted to prescription drugs.  I hope the new strategy will include a provision on tackling this growing problem because it is becoming a much greater problem.  The Minister of State has a difficult responsibility and I do not envy him his job but he has the capability to do it well.  It will be difficult because the financial position is not as buoyant as it has been for the past ten years.  If we are serious about tackling the drugs problem we need additional resources in certain key areas in terms of amenities for young people, additional residential units and more resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which tries to police the situation locally.  If the Minister of State can deliver in some of those areas he will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I was impressed by his response to some of the earlier contributions and I may cover some of the same ground.  That the Minister of State would use this debate as part of the consultation process is a good way to benefit from the various perspectives that Senators will articulate on the national drugs strategy.  I thank the Progressive Democrats for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  As we are starting to look at the next phase of our new national drugs strategy we should, as the Minister of State has said, evaluate how we have done so far, the approaches we have used and look at some fresh thinking that may be required in particular areas.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on the issue of drugs.  The message I took from that was that policy makers and politicians need to be courageous in their approach to the problem of tacking drug abuse and substance abuse generally in society because it appears the older prohibition model has its limits.  If we are to seriously tackle some of the social and crime related problems attached to substance abuse, we may have to look at a model other than prohibition.  It does not always have huge social support and much public education and so on is needed.  I hope that in the new drugs strategy that thinking will be reflected.</P>
        <P>I will be quoting from the recommendations of the Merchants Quay Project which has developed much expertise in the area of working with drug abusers.  It has welcomed the inclusion of alcohol into a single national drugs strategy.  Most members will be aware that a motion was agreed by the Seanad last year on the issue of alcohol abuse in society.  It is a good idea to integrate the issue of alcohol.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P>Alcohol is the drug of choice for many Irish people.  We do not think of it as a drug because we use it so widely in so many social contexts.  It is one that needs to be addressed within the drugs strategy in the same way as other substances that are being abused.  The point made by the Merchants Quay Project is that appropriate resources and funding need to be provided to facilitate service development and staff upskilling and not to assume that alcohol can be included and that the resources that have been used to tackle other substances can be automatically applied to address the issue of alcohol abuse.</P>
        <P>The submission from the Merchants Quay Project highlights some of the structural and reporting mechanism changes it would like to see.  These are sensible suggestions.  It seeks clear formal mechanisms for ongoing consultation with drug users and users of drug services.  That would be a welcome element of any new drugs strategy.  The Minister of State and his predecessor have been involved in the national consultation process which has involved consulting former drug addicts and those using and providing State services, as well as medical experts.  The expertise and the experience that substance abusers have of the services is invaluable in terms of ongoing evaluation of the services.  That those clear structures would be established as part of the process of implementing the new drugs strategy would be welcome.  The timely reporting of data submitted to the national treatment reporting system has been mentioned.  Timely reporting is important.  It is impossible to assess how the strategy is being implemented and to respond to new trends emerging unless that data are available.</P>
        <P>The Merchants Quay Project has called for needle exchange to be included and counted as a treatment intervention within the national drug treatment reporting system.  I hope the Minister will consider that recommendation and also the establishment of a drug trend monitoring system as a matter or priority.  The level of cocaine use has exploded in recent years.  It appears the profile of people who abuse cocaine is very different from that of those who abuse heroin and so on.  Research has identified that it is predominantly the 15 to 34 age group who abuse cocaine.  The side effects and the problems associated with cocaine use are different from other drugs.  The drug trend monitoring system is a good idea and it is to be hoped that it is one that will be established with the new drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>The  issue of funding has also been highlighted by the Merchants Quay Project.  This is the key issue.  It states that the following are essential in regard to funding. There should be a single funding channel for the national drugs strategy, annual funding for the regional development task force and also the local development drugs task force and funding for projects for three years.  There should be ring-fenced budgets for each pillar of the national drugs strategy, full cost recovery for projects paid in advance and a commitment to multi-annual funding to facilitate proactive service planning and delivery.  I realise that in difficult budgetary situations it is not always possible to do that but that is the ideal in terms of funding certainty.  It also seeks regular reporting on the progress of the strategy.  I am interested to hear whether the Minister of State has plans in regard to regular reporting.  It also recommends that the Oireachtas committee on drugs link in to existing national drugs strategy structures.</P>
        <P>In the area of harm reduction, some of the suggestions made by the Merchants Quay Project are interesting.  In terms of the new thinking, one of its new proposals is that the new drugs strategy would look at establishing a pilot safer injecting facility or facilities in Dublin city and, perhaps, in one or two other cities with a view to assessing the impact of such a service on drug related harm.  Certainly the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, which looked at the issue of drug abuse, featured a number of models of this kind, based in the Netherlands, and which appeared to be successful in terms of harm reduction.  While they do not cure the problem or wean the users off the drugs, they are injecting in a much safer way and avoid many of the problems, infections and diseases that go with hard drug abuse.</P><Col N="273"/>
      
        <P>The Merchants Quay Project is also seeking a full spectrum of outreach services for hard-to-reach groups, better access to primary health care for drug users and more immediate access to mental health services for drug users experiencing acute mental health issues.  I hope the Minister of State will take all these points on boards in putting the new strategy together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State mentioned prevention in his contribution.  The Green Party believes the targeted Garda anti-drug use programmes in schools and third level institutions are very important.  We hope the programmes will continue and that the Garda will be properly resourced to provide them.  We also recommend that the Garda be given search powers along the lines of the new random breath testing model for drink driving to allow for random searches at particular places, times and events where senior garda&iacute; believe there is a risk of drugs being present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the important issue of the national drugs strategy.  I do not support the motion but I will support the amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party because it best reflects the current crisis we are in.  Chronic underfunding has been a feature of this area.  It is one thing to have a strategy but one needs to look at the reality to date with the national drugs strategy from 2001 to 2008.  During that period the Exchequer purse was overflowing but the NDS was crippled by underfunding.  Under the 2008 budget the finance afforded to the drugs initiative-young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, which includes the NDS, is set at &euro;64 million.  Let us contrast that figure with the horse and greyhound racing fund which is to receive &euro;76.6 million.  It is clear where the Government&rsquo;s priorities lie.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive provides a total budget of only &euro;83 million to support drug and alcohol services.  It already has made cuts in the area of drug treatment and has reneged on promises to deliver.  While the HSE has plans to develop drugs services, it is not intended to do so until the end of 2008 and even then they will only be progressed if the HSE has met its overall financial targets by that time.  Everyone looks at how things appear in the media.  We all know the reality in this House of how likely it is that this will happen.  The way things are going, there will be no service development at all.</P>
        <P>The HSE recruitment ban, or &ldquo;employment controls&rdquo;, which is the HSE&rsquo;s preferred term, is preventing the replacement of staff who have left existing drug treatment services and, in addition, it is preventing the introduction of new much needed services even where funding for same has been approved.  By its own admission the HSE is short more than 350 detoxification and rehabilitation beds and it has fewer than half the beds required.</P>
        <P>Much has been made of the recent cocaine awareness campaign but the feeling locally is that it was not hard hitting enough.  To make an impact we need something akin to the seat belt awareness campaign.  We must not be overly reliant on billboard-driven awareness campaigns either.  Solid educational modules in schools and initiatives through sports clubs, business, trade unions, professional bodies, etc. all could make a positive contribution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the new national drugs strategy from 2009 we must ensure a number of criteria are met and that funding to frontline services is sufficient and secure.  It is important that staff should not be unduly hindered by having to complete endless evaluations and reports.  Successful pilots must be mainstreamed without undue delay and with the additional funding that is necessary.  Service delivery must be integrated and joined up.  The user&rsquo;s first point of contact, whatever agent or agency that happens to be, should be in a position to line everything else up, that is, to make the necessary referrals to treatment, social welfare, accommodation or employment supports or other such facilities, and to ensure they are delivered to the user.  Waiting lists for treatment must be eliminated.  Support must be on hand and available during the crucial window when a user decides to seek it.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>In terms of supply reduction, the recent growing number of drugs seizures is very welcome but we must remember that is also an indication of a growing drugs market.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that the &ldquo;dial to stop drug dealing&rdquo; scheme is to be rolled out.  My party has been calling for that since 2006 and it must happen without further delay.  As with the successful pilot in Blanchardstown it must be a confidential non-Garda line.  It is this characteristic that allows it to serve as a bridge between communities and the Garda.  Under the new NDS, communities and joint policing committees should have a role to inform the allocation of Garda resources and Garda operations, especially those of the national and local drugs squads.  In addition, a constructive link between communities and the Criminal Assets Bureau should be developed.</P>
        <P>The Minister with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, who is based in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, must take responsibility for all aspects of the delivery of the new NDS and he or she must have real clout in the important Departments of Finance, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science and with the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to sound a note of caution on the extension of the NDS to include alcohol.  Any move to include alcohol under the remit of the NDS must be given very careful consideration.  While there are obvious advantages to the inclusion of alcohol in a national drugs strategy, such as for the treatment of polydrug users involving alcohol, there is a real danger that illicit drugs would get lost alongside the nation&rsquo;s mammoth and culturally entrenched problems with the legal drug of alcohol.  Funding to the NDS would have to be increased by many multiples if such an extension were to be at all feasible.

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the former Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, on the hands-on role he took to the drugs industry.  We complimented him in the House a number of times on being one of the most successful Ministers of State in terms of drug seizures.  He was responsible when a series of big Garda raids took place and I commend the Garda, Customs and Excise and everybody involved.</P>
        <P>I also wish the best to the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, as he takes on that mantle.  I am heartened by the fact that he came to the House tonight to ensure he heard at first hand from many speakers the issues that are to the fore as far as we in the Seanad are concerned.  We have had many debates on alcohol in particular.  I sent a note to him recently to the effect that if I were to make one submission to the national drugs strategy, it would be that alcohol would be brought under its remit.</P>
        <P>I say that with some level of experience because as Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, we compiled several reports on drugs.  One such report was The Inclusion of Alcohol in a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  I am sure the officials are familiar with the report and if they are not, I ask them to re-read it.  Another report was The Treatment of Cocaine Addiction, with Particular Reference to the Irish Experience, which was published in 2005.  Drug Abuse in Ireland &mdash; a Waterford Perspective was published in 2007.  The Effectiveness of Investment in Sport and the Arts as a Deterrent Against Youth Substance Abuse was published in April 2004, and The Relationship between Alcohol Misuse and the Drinks Industry Sponsorship of Sporting Activities was published in March 2007.  The final report we produced was entitled What Everyone Should Know <Col N="275"/>about Cannabis.  There is no shortage of information from both Houses in the recent past on drugs and drug misuse.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>To be parochial, I commend the support services that exist in my area in the form of a rehabilitation centre called White Oaks.  I will ask the new Minister of State to take a continued interest in that, as the previous Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, recently went there to meet with Fr. Neal Carlin and his board of directors.  They provide a very important service that cuts across both alcohol and illegal drugs.  There is a strong case for a detoxification unit for the north west.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our strategies must operate on an inter-state basis.  When I was campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the Lisbon treaty one of the things that was greeted on the doorsteps with great enthusiasm was the concept of more inter-state police co-operation on the drugs issue.  I accept the unit in Portugal has an Irish input and the people who are involved there are aware of the significant work taking place on a trans-frontier basis.  In the same way as trans-frontier co-operation to find the drugs, there should be trans-frontier co-operation to deal with issues such as rehabilitation and detoxification.  The latter is not available in the White Oaks centre because of the lack of designated medical supports.  I ask the officials and the Minister of State to consider introducing a detoxification facility in the north west.  When a person presents it is important that there be as much intervention as quickly as possible, not only for the individual but also for his or her family.  For many people, especially those in rural areas, discovering that their son or daughter may be a drug user or has experienced a drug overdose is a frightening experience, particularly if the resources are not on their doorstep.  While I accept there cannot be such facilities on every doorstep there must be access to someone&rsquo;s door when this issue arises.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Buttimer on the issue of using drug dogs.  I remember the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform telling me that after dogs were introduced into prisons, the number of prison visits declined by approximately 75% for a while.  Having the dogs trained to detect drugs is not as relevant as the visibility of what could be a drug dog in an area.  Unless it has changed in the very recent past it is not acceptable for the Garda and Customs and Excise combined to have only 20 drug dogs.  If dog handlers were patrolling a town or going through a nightclub, people who are up to no good would not be as confident about doing what they do when there is a potential of being caught.  It would be far easier to catch such people by using drug dogs than by using many other techniques.</P>
        <P>Regarding cross-Border matters, there has been considerable talk about the alcohol issue.  Any change in alcohol policy in the Republic will not be successful in areas such as mine.  For example, price increases which would be seen to be the biggest deterrent and work well in areas like Scandinavia will not work in my area.  If there is a significant increase in the price of alcohol in my town, it will not work because I could go 18 miles and buy it cheaper.  Human nature is such that people will go where it is cheaper.  Any initiatives must be Border tested, so to speak.  In the post-Good Friday Agreement period we should work in close co-operation with people who have exactly the same problems in the North.  I understand Bangor has taken a particular initiative, involving the police, the community, the publicans and all the different entities to try to ensure that town is safe at night.  It wants to ban anti-social behaviour and anybody caught engaging in serious anti-social behaviour knows he or she will be in serious trouble.  That co-operation between different bodies should be explored.  I believe something similar is happening in Cork.</P>
        <P>The answer to why alcohol should be in the national drugs strategy is contained in the joint committee report.  The Minister of State said today that he wants to be in charge of dealing with the issue.  If alcohol comes under the remit of the Department of Health and Children, <Col N="276"/>and drugs come under his remit and never the twain shall meet, he cannot be in charge.  Polydrug use is the issue.  In the past cocaine and heroin have been the problem.  People did not want them mixed.  However, contrary to what Senator Doherty says, people now know they need to be mixed and not just for polydrug use.</P>
        <P>We should reconsider the money that is invested.  Enormous sums of money are invested in sport and certain people get involved in it.  The initiatives being taken by the GAA are very good and very influential.  The schools do not have as much influence as people would like to think.  The GAA and other sporting bodies have such influence.  Similar consideration should be given to the arts.  Recently &euro;500,000 was allocated to all the marching bands in the country.  If people are not interested in sports they might be interested in the arts.  Keeping young people interested in drumming or playing in traditional bands would have them usefully occupied and would keep them away from inappropriate activity.  If I had the time I would speak about closed circuit television and other issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I thank everybody for their contributions to this debate.  I do not want to be accused of trying to silence Senator Buttimer, which would be a considerable task.  I do not mean he had no right to table an amendment to highlight areas where he feels there are shortcomings.  However, I believe he will be impressed with the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and how he recognises the shortcomings in the existing strategy.  An audit needs to be done on the shortcomings and the things that worked well in the previous strategy to identify how the strategy can be improved and made worthwhile and workable in future.</P>
        <P>Even though we will have a vote on the amendment, the spirit of what was intended in this motion was honoured in the debate.  We got contributions from many Senators.  The officials and the Minister of State, who stayed as long as he was able to stay, are keen to see this debate as part of a public consultation process in a public forum before the strategy is set in stone.  That was my intention.  People were able to make their contributions in a calm and informed way.  The purpose of the motion was to cast more light than heat on the drugs strategy and I am glad contributions were made in that spirit.  In particular, Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s contribution was very worthwhile in focusing on the harm reduction strategies of which we need to be cognisant as we formulate a new strategy.</P>
        <P>The other benefit of this debate was that it gave Senators an opportunity to talk about extremely good work taking place in their communities in which people who have been touched by the ravages of drug addiction and other drug problems were able to speak knowledgeably of the work being done.  Senator Donohoe in particular mentioned one of them.  We need to be funding these kinds of organisations where the work is targeted at the communities and people who are suffering as a result of drug addiction and other drug problems.  The debate gave us the opportunity to highlight the good work that is being done.</P>
        <P>The new strategy needs to be based in reality and needs to face the problems as we see them.  Most contributors in the debate suggested including alcohol in a strategy, with which I agree.  Alcohol addiction is much more prevalent than we will admit.  It causes great damage in families.  We need to be more honest about the level of the alcohol abuse problem.  People are now talking about alcohol as being as much of a problem as drug addiction.  That is not a bad thing because it forces us to think about our attitudes to alcohol.  As a nation we have a particular reputation for the way we use and speak about alcohol.  We need to move beyond that point and have a more mature attitude.</P>
        <P>Some important points were made about prevention and education.  Children and more vulnerable people will be susceptible to drug pushers.  The only way to build confidence is through <Col N="277"/>education programmes.  I hope they form a pivotal part of the strategy.  I welcome the contributions to this debate and I thank the Minister of State for attending.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 85:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="7">In page 84, before section 78, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="7">&ldquo;78.&mdash;(1) The Authority shall not conclude a satellite content contract with a person for the purpose of material being supplied for its transmission as a broadcasting service (intended for reception in the State) by means of a satellite device unless satisfied that recipients of the service will be in a position to receive by satellite device each free to air service provided by RT&Eacute;, TG4 and the television service programme contractor as a basic programme service.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="7">(2) This section applies to satellite content contracts whether concluded before or after the passing of this Act.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="7">(3) In this section&mdash;</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P LI="2" el="7">&ldquo;basic programme service&rdquo; means the programme material made available to persons by means of a satellite device at the lowest rate in any scale of charges that are made for the reception of such services by means of a satellite device;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="7">&ldquo;free to air services&rdquo; includes such free to air services as are available at the date of passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Right" el="7">&mdash; (Senator Michael McCarthy)</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take amendments Nos. 101 to 103, inclusive, together relating to the operation of RTE&rsquo;s long wave service.</P>
        <P>As the Senators are aware, primary legislation in the main outlines objectives rather than the specific technology standards and parameters needed to support such objectives.  This is a logical approach given the rapid pace of technology and service development.</P>
        <P>Section 114(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill sets RTE the objective of providing a broadcasting service to be made available in so far as is reasonably practicable to the whole community on the island of Ireland.  Section 114(1)(<i>f</i>) sets RTE the objective of providing a broadcasting service to be made available in so far as RTE considers reasonably practicable to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland.  Section 114(1)(<i>d</i>) gives RTE the objective of co-operating with public bodies in preparing for the dissemination of information to the public in the event of an emergency.  Section 121 provides that all spectrum-based services provided by RTE shall only be provided under licence from the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>The Bill as drafted sets RTE these specific objectives.  It allows it the latitude to choose the most appropriate economic and technological means to fulfil these objectives and establishes various accountability mechanisms under which RTE accounts for its decisions.  At present, RTE uses a wide variety of different platforms and technologies to ensure diversity of choice for the listener and to maximise these.</P>
        <P>For the home audience, Internet, satellite, FM, long wave and DAB services are provided and for the Irish abroad, Internet, satellite and long wave services are available.  In respect of satellite services, I would point out that anyone with a satellite receiver in Ireland, the UK or France can at present tune in to all four of the principle RTE radio services 24 hours a day, should he or she so wish.</P>
        <P>In respect of emergencies, to which a number of Members referred, RTE has indicated that in the event of an emergency, it is important to have the resilience to provide its services over different broadcasting platforms and technologies, not just long wave.  In this way, it is not reliant on one platform or technology but can continue to provide services even in the event of a failure in any particular platform or technology.</P>
        <P>I have concerns about providing instructions to RTE on the type of technologies it should deploy or how these services should be operated from a technological point of view.  As a consequence, I am not in a position to accept the amendments as proposed.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has the power to bring RTE before it if concerns or questions arise.  When the Bill is passed, the committee will also be given the responsibility for suggesting names to the Minister for the new authority.  It will, therefore, play an active and important role.</P>
        <P>I have sympathy with the proposals contained in amendment No. 85 in light of the concerns that have arisen regarding the carriage of such free-to-air services on subscription based satellite services which are not regulated in Ireland.  I believe in principle that Irish public service channels should not be tied to any one platform on an exclusive basis.  However, under the <Col N="279"/>current situation broadcasters are free to negotiate contracts on a commercial basis with satellite providers not regulated in Ireland.  Providing broadcasters with this ability is important because it ensures television viewers in Ireland can subscribe to satellite television services without having to establish a separate receiving device.</P>
        <P>I also understand that ensuring the availability of Irish broadcasting channels as part of a basic or minimum package gives rise to certain practical difficulties relating to a satellite&rsquo;s footprint or coverage area.  Satellites are used to provide broadcasting services in several countries, which gives rise to rights issues because Irish broadcasters have rights to broadcast certain programmes within Ireland only.  Expensive encryption systems are therefore required to ensure content is only received in Ireland.  Subscribers to a service would need a decryption card to view programmes.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment also seeks to ensure a carriage obligation in respect of Irish public service channels on satellite.  This objective will be achieved under section 77 of the Bill if a satellite service comes under Irish jurisdiction.  However, at present no satellite system comes under this jurisdiction.  In order to continue to provide maximum choice and flexibility to Irish television viewers, I cannot accept the amendments as proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and cognisant of the fact that we have already debated this section for several hours, I withdraw my amendment.  The Minister of State has shown flexibility in regard to amendments, so I may revisit the matter on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s lamentable response but I will put him on probation and will not push this to a vote.  I ask him to reconsider, however.  He argued that the matter is more appropriate to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources but I disagree.  RTE is to be urged to provide this signal but we know perfectly well it is not doing so at present.  The evidence we are placing before the Minister of State reveals it is not happening.  The signal is down to half power, so people in the south east are not receiving the signal, let alone England and elsewhere abroad.  We need a requirement because urging RTE is not sufficient.</P>
        <P>In light of the Government&rsquo;s planned response to a disaster, I have demonstrated with a fair amount of technical backup from broadcasting engineers, retired RTE personnel and other knowledgeable people that the system is inadequate.  In the event of a national emergency, half the Government&rsquo;s plan would fall to pieces due to the lack of power in transmission.</P>
        <P>It is not acceptable to say we will urge or encourage RTE because it should be required to provide an adequate signal.  I will not press these amendments and I understand Senator O&rsquo;Reilly agrees.  We will leave them until Report Stage but I would like a commitment from the Minister of State that he will at least re-examine the matter in light of the evidence Senator O&rsquo;Toole, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and I put before him today.  Our arguments were strongly supported by the Leader of the House, so even from a political point of view it would not be wise to completely ignore the amendments.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate that he will reconsider them on Report Stage.  We will play our part in the political dialogue and will not push the amendments to a vote but will resubmit them on Report Stage in the hope that we can make progress.  If this matter is not addressed in the Seanad, which is charged with refining legislation and pointing out gaps, it may arise in a more argumentative fashion in the other House.  The Government may have voting strength in the D&aacute;il but the debate there will possibly be more awkward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State is not accepting the amendments Senator Norris and I have proposed.  The Bill asks RTE to provide coverage in <Col N="280"/>so far as it is reasonably practical to do so.  That is not acceptable, however, because we should have blanket coverage for the entire island.  RTE radio programmes should also be broadcast to our emigrant communities in the UK and the Continent.  It is not my intention to rehearse the compelling arguments that have been advanced for doing this, other than to note the need to legislate for the possibility of emergencies.  The current reduced power long wave transmissions will not suffice in the event of an emergency.  I have also set out the moral case in respect of our emigrants and the fact that parts of the south east of Ireland are affected by a buzzing sound at night.</P>
        <P>I am aware the Minister of State responded positively to earlier amendments, so I reserve the right, with my colleague, Senator Norris, to resubmit these amendments on Report Stage in anticipation of a positive response.  We cannot leave this matter to anyone else because we have a legislative duty and a moral prerogative to our emigrants, the Good Friday Agreement and this country&rsquo;s commercial and cultural interests.  We could speak about the matter until midnight but there is no need to do so because the major points have been made.  However, we cannot allow the resolution of this ambiguity to the goodwill of others or to allow RTE to provide coverage only in so far as it is reasonably practical to do so.  That will not suffice because the answer must be definite.</P>
        <P>Our emigrant communities in England, including great people in London, Coventry, Manchester and Birmingham, are watching and listening to this debate.  They need a proper radio signal but they also need a signal from the Legislature that we are on their side.  We should be nowhere else but with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to what the Minister of State had to say and some of his points were valid.  Given the proliferation of English channels here, there should be some reciprocity because there is a large Irish diaspora in Britain.  Our television and radio stations should be readily available in that jurisdiction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the issues that arose in the referendum campaign relating to the Lisbon treaty is that of the disconnect that exists.  Most of the diet of foreign news we receive comes either from America or Britain.  Unless there is a major catastrophe, we receive very little in the way of news items from the remainder of Europe.  There is a need to bridge the gap.  As the Minister of State indicated, the transmission of news programmes is facilitated by satellite.  However, there is a need to consider the position as regards transmission by means of radio.</P>
        <P>Members received representations, couched in reasonable terms, from people who maintain &mdash; there is no reason to disbelieve them &mdash; that they carried out their own testing on the strength of signals, etc.  All the evidence with which we were supplied indicates that something went wrong during the changeover from medium to long wave and that the availability of signals has been curtailed as a consequence of this move.  This is either fact or fiction.  It appears to be a fact and I would lend my support to those who state that the Department should establish the position, one way or the other.  If it is established as a fact, action should be taken to ensure that the national broadcaster is meeting its responsibility and applying sufficient power levels in order to ensure that signals can be received everywhere on this island and also by members of the Irish diaspora in the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We could debate this matter all night.  RTE&rsquo;s decision to end its medium wave service is not really relevant to the Bill in many respects.  However, the station indicated that the service was inefficient to operate and that very few people listened to it.  Apparently 90% of people listen to its FM service and the remaining 10% listen on other frequencies.  The FM service is able to provide much better audio quality than that which was provided on its <Col N="281"/>medium wave counterpart.  RTE will now be in a position to use the moneys saved by discontinuing its medium wave service to improve FM reception further and to help fund its new digital radio network, which will be available over the digital audio broadcasting, DAB, system.</P>
        <P>We will make further inquiries in respect of this matter in the interests of obtaining greater clarity in respect of it.  A number of Members made statements on this issue which, if true, would give one cause to be concerned.</P>
        <P>There is no such thing as perfect legislation.  At a concert at the weekend, Leonard Cohen performed a song which contains the lovely line, &ldquo;There is a crack in everything, that&rsquo;s how the light gets in&rdquo;.  The Bill is not perfect.  I will consult with my colleague and the officials from the Department to see if we can improve on what is already contained in it.  I am not refusing to accept amendments for the sake of doing so.  If we were of the view that certain amendments would improve the legislation, we would be more than happy to accept them.  I will reconsider the position and return to the matter on Report Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 85<i>a</i>, 86<i>b</i>, 88<i>a</i>, 90<i>a</i>, 96<i>a</i> and 128<i>a</i> are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 85<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 86, subsection (1), between lines 35 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>m</i>) sport,&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Some of these amendments relate to the recognition that must be included in the Bill in respect of domestic sports coverage.  I wish to ensure that domestic sport is afforded its rightful place in television and radio broadcasts.  A domestic sporting event such as track racing, GAA or soccer might be taking place on any given day but the first item on the sports news will probably relate to the Champions League or the FA Cup.  I am seeking to ensure that a balance will be struck in respect of domestic sport.  Thousands of people have made great efforts &mdash; in many instances, on a voluntary basis &mdash; to develop domestic sports to the levels they have reached and the national broadcaster should give these sports the coverage they rightly deserve.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 85<i>a</i> seeks to deal with the criteria relating to membership of the board.  Section 82 states that a people to be appointed to the board should have experience or show a capacity in respect of one or more of the matters listed, which include business or commercial affairs; trade union affairs; digital media technologies; arts, music and culture; science, technology or environmental matters; legal or regulatory affairs; and social, educational or community activities.  I would not want to remove any of these from the list of criteria because they are all laudable.  However, the amendment seeks to include a knowledge or experience of or a capacity in respect of sport as one of the criteria governing suitability to serve as a member of the board.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 86<i>b</i> relates to the duties of members of the board.  The proposed new paragraph (<i>e</i>) contained in this amendment would &ldquo;ensure that the corporation fulfils its commitment with regard to programme content reflecting the promotion of Irish language and culture, including domestic sport&rdquo;.  The amendment would also strengthen aspects of the Bill <Col N="282"/>relating to the concept of domestic sport.  However, similar to amendments tabled by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, it will further strengthen the Bill in the context of the Irish language and culture.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 88<i>a</i> relates to the audience council for which section 96 makes provision.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) In appointing the members of its audience council a corporation shall endeavour to ensure that the audience council includes persons representative of cultural organisations including those devoted to the promotion of Irish music and domestic sport.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment is designed to ensure that the audience council will encompass balanced and diverse views and that its members will include those who represent the organisations to which the proposed new subsection (5) refers.  This would not give rise to a financial constraint.  The intention behind the amendment is that due regard be given to our culture and domestic sport.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will take these amendments seriously.  Amendment No. 90<i>a</i> relates to section 101.  This is a good Bill but as the Minister of State indicated not every item of legislation is perfect.  Even if all the amendments tabled in respect of the Bill were accepted, it would still not be perfect and we would probably be obliged to return to it.  However, there is a need to make specific provision in respect of the Irish language.  Such a provision is not made at present in section 101, which relates to the public service broadcasting charter and refers to the nature and hours of children&rsquo;s television and science and technology programming to be broadcast, the number of magazines and books to be prepared and the recorded audio material to be compiled, published and distributed in pursuance of the corporation&rsquo;s public service objects.  However, it does not refer to Irish language broadcasting.</P>
        <P>There is a need to include two new paragraphs in section 101, namely:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>e</i>) the nature and number of hours devoted to Irish culture including sport,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>f</i>) the nature and number of hours devoted to the Irish language.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This matter is important and not only to those who speak Irish or people who live in Gaeltacht areas.  One of the objectives of every political party on this island is the restoration of our national language.  The Irish language belongs to all of us.  Any steps we can take, small or large, to support the language should be taken.  The amendment does not compel RTE to do anything and it does not state that 90% of broadcasting content should be in Irish.  However, it suggests that regard should be had to the language in the context of the charter.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the amendment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are two other amendments which have been grouped together.  Amendment No. 96<i>a</i> deals with section 114.  It seeks to provide that RTE ensures Irish communities abroad have access to digital and radio wireless broadcasts of domestic sporting events.  I will not rehash the debate which has just taken place because everybody has articulated very eloquently the need to ensure we have a service to our emigrants abroad.  People continue to tune into sport and they want to know how their local teams are doing, whether in the championship or in the league.  It could also be the local soccer team.</P>
        <P>The Bill indicates that, in so far as possible, RTE will provide services to emigrants abroad.  There is a need to strengthen this by including a provision to ensure Irish communities abroad have access to digital and radio wireless broadcasts of domestic sporting events as a starting point.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>The final amendment in this group relates to section 154 and deals with the broadcasting funding scheme.  It seeks to include a new subsection that would give priority to domestic sport, along with the other subsections.  I ask the Minister to consider those amendments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt dos na leasaithe ata molta ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Doherty.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-th&aacute;bhachtach don Teach seo cabhair agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt go rialta d&rsquo;fhorbairt agus labhairt na teanga.  T&aacute; &aacute;r gcult&uacute;r agus &aacute;r dteanga an-bhun&uacute;sach d&uacute;inn go l&eacute;ir sa Teach seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta tac&uacute; leis na leasaithe at&aacute; os comhair an T&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The amendments put forward by Senator Doherty should be accepted.  The Minister of State will recall that on Second Stage I spoke about these issues.  I tabled amendments related to programming in the Irish language and our culture which, regrettably, were not accepted.  The objection of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department was that they suggested a mandatory amount of programming, which was problematic.  This proposal might be more practical as it suggests arranging the number of hours and putting it in writing, which I support.</P>
        <P>I also support the concept of having somebody with an interest in language and broad Irish culture on the audience council.  I accept that relevance to sports and cultural Ireland should be among the criteria for membership of the board.</P>
        <P>The amendments are broadly positive and would enhance the commitment of the legislation to the Irish language, culture and heritage.  That is not an issue on which the House should divide as it is a basic component.  It is important that we always remain conscious of our national identity and the richness and preservation of our heritage.  Without being over the top, in the words of Senator O&rsquo;Toole earlier, we do not want to go down the road of fascism with regard to language or culture.  That is neither progressive nor successful and would not be recommended by any sane person.</P>
        <P>At the same time we should have a vigilance in maintaining the culture and the place of language.  I support the amendments of Senator Doherty and congratulate him on bringing them forward.  They would enhance the Bill and I commend them to the Minister of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am struck with admiration for Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s fluent Irish with its Cavan blas.  I did not realise he had it but it is lovely to hear.  I will not hazard it this evening, although I have spoken Irish here in the past.  It is, in its own way, something dear to my heart.</P>
        <P>I rise to formally second the number of amendments in the name of Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole.  It is notable that a number of them have &ldquo;including&rdquo; as the first word.  They make the Bill more inclusive of the Irish language and the Irish-speaking community.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to accept amendment No. <i>a</i>83<i>a</i>, which seeks to add &ldquo;including programmes in the Irish language and programmes pertaining to Irish Culture.&rdquo;  I cannot see what could possibly be against including that provision.  There may be some technical reason.  The amendments also provide for including the Gaeltacht and the Irish language community.</P>
        <P>It may be that the Minister assumes that in the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; ar an dtaobh eile mar gheall ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; sp&oacute;irt, traidisi&uacute;nta agus cult&uacute;rtha.</P>
        <P>In the area of Irish culture and music, local radio has played a very important role, along with TG4.  RTE and TV3 have not been as proficient in that respect as we would like.  I am unsure as to whether we need to be prescriptive in legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to sport, all the broadcasting media &mdash; radio and television &mdash; deserve mention.  I note RTE and particularly TV3 for moving into the area of our national games.  That station has provided an innovation in placing the camera on the opposite side of the pitch from the main stand, which brings another dimension to showing games.  I presume RTE will follow in time.  The stations should be commended on their coverage of sport, in which there is a wide interest.</P>
        <P>To go back to the earlier comments regarding advertising and the problems in this regard with the drinks industry, the more we promote sport on television, the better we will advocate it to our young people.</P>
        <P>With regard to criteria for board membership, the arts, music and culture make up one area which would qualify people for being members of the board.  I am inclined to agree with Senator Doherty that sport should be also included, particularly given our interest as a people in all codes of sport.  Perhaps the Minister of State might consider the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Doherty for his amendments.  He has given us some food for thought.  Section 70 provides for the award of an analogue television broadcasting contract to a television service programme provider and sets out certain terms and conditions that shall apply to the television service programme contractor, which is currently TV3.</P>
        <P>Section 70(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>d</i>) require the BAI to ensure that a television programme service contractor shall be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community and ensure the programmes reflect the varied elements that make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland.  It should have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied sports coverage is adequately encompassed within the text of this provision and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P><Col N="285"/>
        <P>Turning to amendment No. 85<i>a</i>, section 82 of the Broadcasting Bill outlines the experience or capacity required of persons to be appointed to the board of RTE and TG4.  The Senator seeks to include sport as one of these criteria.  I agree with Senators Doherty and Walsh that such a competence would be beneficial and as such I propose to consider such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 86<i>b</i>, section 87 imposes certain duties on the board members of RTE and TG4.  The proposed amendment seeks to include a requirement that every member of the board shall perform his or her functions in such a manner as to &ldquo;ensure that the corporation fulfils its commitment with regard to programme content reflecting the promotion of Irish language and culture, including domestic sport&rdquo;.  I agree with the Senator that this should indeed be the case and this is exactly what is provided for under section 87(1)(<i>b</i>) whereby board members, in performing their functions, are required to ensure that the activities of a corporation in pursuing its objectives, as set out in section 114 for RTE or 118 for TG4, are performed efficiently and effectively.</P>
        <P>Section 114(2)(<i>a</i>) requires RTE to &ldquo;ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 114(3)(<i>a</i>) requires RTE to &ldquo;provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English languages that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and include programmes that entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting, religious and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests and which, in every case, respect human dignity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 118(3)(<i>a</i>) requires TG4 to &ldquo;provide a comprehensive range of programmes, primarily in the Irish language, that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and include, programmes that entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting, religious and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of those of all age groups in the community whose preferred spoken language is Irish or who otherwise have an interest in Irish&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I therefore consider that these existing provisions encompass what the Senator is proposing.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>I turn now to amendment No. 88<i>a</i>.  Section 96 requires RTE and TG4 to establish audience councils to represent the views and interests of the viewer and listener to the boards of RTE and TG4.  The amendment proposed by the Senator seeks representation on the audience councils of RTE and TG4 of persons representative of cultural organisations, including those devoted to the promotion of Irish music and domestic sport.  I am anxious to ensure that RTE and TG4, in establishing the membership of their respective audience councils, select persons to represent the interests of the viewing and listening public rather than individual sectoral interests.  An exception to this has been made in respect of ensuring that the interests of persons with a hearing or sight impairment are represented on any audience council, but this exception has been made given the critical need for feedback to public service broadcasters in respect of the particular broadcasting needs of such persons.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 90<i>a</i>, section 101 requires RTE and TG4 to prepare public service broadcasting charters outlining the activities that they propose to undertake over a five-year period in order to fulfil their public service objectives.  The Senator will note that the broadcasting charter must set out the principles to be observed and activities to be undertaken by the corporation in order to fulfil its public service objectives.  While I believe that the first part of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment is too general and unnecessary, I do see merit in the second <Col N="286"/>part in respect of the nature and number of hours of Irish language programming.  As a consequence I propose to review the wording of that part of his amendment with a view to amending section 101 on Report Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I turn now to amendment No. 96<i>a</i>.  This amendment proposed by the Senator seeks to ensure that Irish communities abroad have access to digital radio and wireless broadcasts of domestic sporting events.  Section 114(1)(<i>f</i>), requires RTE to &ldquo;establish, maintain and operate a television broadcasting service and a radio service which shall have the character of a public service, which services shall be made available, in so far as RTE considers reasonably practicable, to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland&rdquo;.  Section 114(9) requires RTE to ensure that such a television service is representative of the RTE 1, RTE 2 and TG4 channels.  In response to this requirement, and in addition to its existing long wave radio service, RTE is developing a special television channel to be carried on freesat satellite in the UK with a view to a launch before St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2009.  Accordingly, I consider that these provisions adequately address the concerns raised and as such I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>The Senator has also sought in amendment No. 128<i>a</i> to include prominence for domestic sport as one of the objectives of the broadcasting fund.  As a form of state aid, the broadcasting fund was notified to the EU Commission which concluded that the financial support for radio and television programmes under the broadcasting fund constituted state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, but that it was compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 87(3)(<i>d</i>) EC.  The fund offers financial support for the production of new television or radio programmes of all genres on Irish culture, heritage and experience, on adult literacy and, in particular, on the above mentioned topics in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Programmes considered acceptable under the scheme include factual and fictional programming, including documentaries, educational programmes, drama productions, feature films and animation.  Also considered acceptable are one-off programmes, multi-episode projects and programmes targeted at the general public or towards a specific audience group, such as children.</P>
        <P>The Senator will note that the fund, as originally envisaged, was not intended to aid domestic sports programming nor, indeed, is it likely that the European Commission would approve such funding in the context of EU state aid rules.  Accordingly, for the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to the amendments I tabled and will not press them at a later stage.  I thank him for his contribution on all of them, particularly amendment No. 85<i>a</i>, as he suggested he would consider including sport as one of the criteria for members of the board.  We will return to this on Report Stage to see what has been done in this regard and I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State explained the duties of members in section 87 so I will withdraw that amendment.  Regarding members of the audience council, I feel an exception is needed for people who represent those cultural organisations but the Minister of State has made his point and I reserve the right to raise this on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on amendment No. 90<i>a</i>, particularly the later section, and the fact that the nature and number of hours devoted to the Irish language will be considered on Report Stage.  This will be welcomed by political parties across the board along with the Irish language sector outside these Houses.</P>
        <P>I have listened to and understand what the Minister of State has said on my other two amendments, particularly amendment No. 128<i>a</i>.  The free-to-air television station for emigrants <Col N="287"/>will address this issue to a degree but this was to deal with radio and there was a specific demand in that regard.  However, I will not press that amendment.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>This is another amendment proposed by Senator Doherty.  This is one in which we find a great deal of merit.  The amendment proposes that a member of the board of RTE or TG4 be disqualified from board membership if he or she is a shareholder or director or is otherwise commercially involved with another broadcasting company.  We agree with the thrust of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, but I believe the position is already dealt with in the existing text of the Bill.  In particular, section 85(5) provides that a person who is employed by or has an interest in a commercial or community broadcaster or multiplex operator is generally automatically disqualified from becoming a member of the board of RTE or TG4, save in respect of employment that relates to educational matters or the performance of creative work.  I thank the Senator for his amendment and as a result of it we will revisit the text of sections 12 and 86 on Report Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this section, which deals with access to archives.  It is a very good provision in the Bill.  In the 46 years since RTE was established it has built up quite an archive, and it is important that this be available to historians and other researchers.  It is very much to be welcomed.  In addition, given that RTE has some new competitors, it is important that these companies are in a position to obtain archival material.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this.  For example, TV3 has a contract with the GAA to show national games and it is doing a good job, as RTE has traditionally done and is still doing.  However, it is important that it be able to access archival film from some of the older matches, going back 30 or 40 years, which the producers might like to include as part of the build-up to certain games.  This is the type of issue about which I am talking.  I would prefer if no obstacles were placed in the way of access to archival material for reasons commercially advantageous to RTE itself.  I welcome the provision in this regard, which is a step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not going to intervene at this stage but I welcome the fact that Senator Walsh has opened up discussion on this matter.  I am chairman of the Friends of the Library association in Trinity College and I take an interest in archives.  We have a fine national archive and there are archives in the National Library.  In addition, an important social archive was delivered to the National Library on Bloomsday.  I did not agree totally with its name, which is the Irish Queer Archive &mdash; I would have preferred the Irish National Gay Archive &mdash; but the material is very important historically.  RTE &mdash; and other stations, but principally RTE because it is our national broadcasting corporation &mdash; should be encouraged by all means possible to retain significant items.  I think with great grief of some of the things that have been wiped in the past, such as the superb performances by the late Marie Kean, who was one of the finest actresses this country has ever produced.  Most of her work is gone, simply because someone wanted to record something else on top of it.  That is a shame.  I welcome anything that encourages the national broadcaster to retain material for future generations.  There is a public interest in this regard.  RTE has been broadcasting a series &mdash; I am not sure whether it is over now &mdash; called &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;, in which it used archival material going back to 1962.  We saw what was happening in that year &mdash; or at least a selection of what was happening &mdash; and fascinating it was.</P>
        <P>This is a very good provision and I commend the Minister on its inclusion.  I hope it will send out as strong an encouragement as possible that a proper archive be maintained, not just for us but for future generations.</P>

	<P>I very much commend the inclusion of this provision in the Bill.  It is an innovative and important element of what is generally a good Bill.

There is much that is innovative and important in the Bill and this is one such aspect.  </P>
        <P>Having had the experience of working in RTE for ten years, people still ask me for recordings of matches held in the 1960s and 1970s.  They seem to believe I can procure those recordings for them.  However, I am just as powerless as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Exactly.  It is true that much of the material that was recorded and broadcast and much of the live material from the 1960s does not survive for all sorts of reasons.  However, it is important to emphasise the huge progress RTE has made in its archiving of television and radio broadcasting.  Huge strides have been made.  That should be acknowledged.  With the advances in technologies much of the material can be kept on disc; it is easier to hold and there is no excuse for not doing so.  I recall being frustrated at a time when some senior and well known broadcasters instead of centrally archiving the material, as they were required to do, kept it themselves.  They said the reason they did so was not that they  were trying to <Col N="292"/>hoard it at home in the kitchen press but because they did not have full confidence that the central archiving system was working and they wanted to hold on to what they had.  However, it is a long time since that was case.  The archiving system has moved on.  Great strides have been made by RTE.</P>
        <P>It is right that the Bill provides that a scheme be drawn up by the corporation to be approved by the Minister.  It ought not to be a free for all.  The archives are held by RTE.  It is its property.  As a public body, it holds it in trust for us, but it belongs to RTE.  It is right that the Bill provides that a scheme be drawn up.  Commercial interests and commercial bodies, as Senator Walsh will appreciate, can avail of that scheme and can be brought into it for a payment, as is appropriate.  The Senator&rsquo;s concerns are well placed, but they are dealt with in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make an additional comment.  I sympathise very much with what has been said about GAA matches.  I do not watch a great deal of sport, but I fear if it was required that RTE broadcast a match that was nearly a half century old, this kind of material has a tendency to deteriorate fairly badly, particularly having regard to the way in which it was originally held, and the transmission quality may not be of any use except to somebody who is a sports fanatic.  I listen to ancient jazz records, with which most people would not bother.  They are not broadcastable, but I love them.  The same may apply to these recordings.  I would be careful about requiring RTE or even being strong in demanding that it reshow these recordings.  It might do so if the transmission quality is sufficient, but if it is not, it would simply alienate the audience.  That is a small caveat I would make.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>At the risk of setting loose another hare, I wish to comment on the dissemination of information, a matter on which I have a strong view given the events of last week.  EU members states are covered under subsection (2), but there is no mention of the EU institutions, namely the European Parliament or the Commission.  I have been conscious of this issue for a while but it became more pronounced during the referendum campaign that there is a dearth of information in this regard, which is leading in part to the disconnect between citizens and the EU institutions.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough for the national broadcaster to broadcast occasionally, perhaps once a month when the European Parliament is sitting, a half hour programme on its proceedings very late at night.  That does not convey what is happening in the EU to the public at large.  The conveying of such information should be part of the remit of the broadcaster to ensure that people are kept very <i>au fait </i> with what is happening within all the institutions to address this sense of a disconnect.  More than that is needed, but this would be an important component of addressing it.  If this is not reflected elsewhere in the Bill, this point might be considered between now and Report Stage to ascertain if its the view of the Department and of the Minister that there is some justification in the point I am making.  Perhaps it should be reflected somewhere in the legislative framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to made a brief comment on that.  I will not follow all the hares because I have few hairs left.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about hares rather than hairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I cannot let the idea go unchallenged that the sense of a disconnection was because of a lack of information and a lack of information and broadcasting, although that may have been an element.  When the most senior politicians in Europe are saying the Lisbon treaty was deliberately obfuscated so that it could be sold to the Irish people, who could then be relied on to do what they were told, and that whereas the first treaty was written so as to be readable, the second, on which we have just voted, was made deliberately illegible, it is time to look elsewhere for that disconnect.  It is time to look into the heart of Brussels.</P>
        <P>I accept that the broadcasting of the proceedings of the European Parliament might be of interest.  I have sometimes come across those proceedings when I fiddle around with the monitors in Leinster House.  I assume this may be covered as part of the proposed Oireachtas channel.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 97:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 117, lines 10 to 18, to delete subsection (15) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(15) In the first financial year following the year of the passing of this Act, a minimum of 1.25 per cent of the monies paid into the account shall be used by RT&Eacute; for the purpose of&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for the commissioning by RT&Eacute; of the making of the above programmes,</P>
        <P LI="1">and for no other purpose.</P>
        <P LI="1">The percentage specified above shall be increased to 2 per cent in the second financial year, 3 per cent in the third financial year, 4 per cent in the fourth financial year and 5 per cent in the fifth financial year following the year of the passing of this Act.  It shall remain at 5 per cent minimum in each subsequent financial year.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I hope my earlier effusive praise for the Bill will stand me in good stead as I put forward this proposal.  I strongly urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.  I welcome the inclusion &mdash; for the first time in legislation, as far as I am aware &mdash;  of a provision for an independent radio production sector.  There has been much discussion in the course of this debate and elsewhere about the importance of the independent television production sector.  That sector has rightly been promoted and funded under the provisions of several Bills.  However, we have never properly addressed the necessity of supporting and funding an independent radio production sector.</P>
        <P>We are all agreed that we should have the maximum number and range of voices on the air.  This issue was first raised in the mid-1980s when there was a debate about promoting diversity in broadcasting.  It arose first in reference to news and current affairs programming but it is relevant across the board, in culture, the arts and so on.  There must be a diversity of voices contributing to the airwaves in both the public and private sectors.</P>
        <P>The provision in section 116 (15) is welcome as a first step.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In each of the five financial years following the year of the passing of this Act a minimum of &euro;500,000 standing to the credit of the account shall be used by RT&Eacute; for the purpose of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) commissioning the making of independent sound broadcasting programmes,</P><Col N="295"/>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for the commissioning by RT&Eacute; of the making of the above programmes,</P>
        <P LI="1">and for no other purpose.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">My amendment proposes that instead of a fixed sum of &euro;500,000, a minimum of 1.25% of the moneys paid into the relevant account should be used by RTE for the purpose of commissioning and making independent sound broadcasting programmes and procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for the commissioning by RT&Eacute; of the making of these programmes, and for no other purpose.  It further proposes that this percentage should rise in gradations in subsequent years, to a 5% minimum in the fifth year, at which level it will remain in each subsequent financial year.</P>
        <P>It is extremely important that we support the significant work being done by independent radio producers in producing material for broadcast by RTE and local radio stations.  There would be no documentaries on local radio were it not for the work of independent radio producers.  We are aware that the infrastructure and paraphernalia involved in television production is vastly more expensive than what is required for radio.  That is all the more reason not to consign radio to the bottom of our priorities.  It is vital that the funds are available to support and promote independent radio production.  I am advised by people in the industry that if the provision of &euro;500,000 is maintained, a huge proportion of it, perhaps as much as one half, will be needed simply to manage and administer the unit in RTE before a programme is ever put on air.</P>
        <P>According to my amendment, even after five years, 95% of the budget will still be allocated for television production.  What is envisaged is a relatively modest target of 5% after five years.  Radio will continue to play catch-up with television.  Television is incredibly important in terms of the fantastic service it can offer in sports, current affairs, film and so on.  However, radio has shown itself to be an extraordinarily enduring medium.  Radio audiences in this State have increased with the introduction of independent radio.  There is great support and affection for radio.</P>
        <P>Support for the independent radio production sector must go further than what is provided in the Bill.  The provision under section 116(15) must be increased from &euro;500,000 to a level that can deliver results.  I should mention that I have a background in this area, having worked in RTE for many years, where I had the privilege of training young people in radio production.  It was amazing to observe the fantastic level of innovation and creativity that is out there and the enthusiasm that exists for making radio programmes.  Why should it be that only those who work in RTE get a chance to make those programmes?  There must be real diversity in this medium.  I strongly commend my amendment to the Minister of State.  I hope he takes it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendments Nos. 98 and 99 are similar to Senator White&rsquo;s amendment No. 97 and Senator Doherty&rsquo;s amendment No. 97<i>a</i>.  Like Senator White, I feel strongly about these proposals.  I appeal to the Minister of State to round off the evening on a positive note by accepting our proposals, which are of extraordinary importance.  The more I examined this issue, met the interest groups and came to appreciate the exciting potential of the independent radio sector for the State and what it had already achieved, the more persuaded I became of the necessity of support for the sector.  I am almost fundamentalist in my conviction that this is the right action to take.</P>
        <P>I spoke on Second Stage about the specific achievements of the independent radio sector, including award-winning productions at local and national level.  The independent radio sector is a new and exciting development in Irish broadcasting.  It is made up of small companies and <Col N="296"/>individuals based in at least 13 counties making high quality radio programmes in a wide range of genres, including documentaries and features, art and music, children&rsquo;s radio, drama, science and technology, popular music and entertainment.  It is an indigenous industry in 13 counties that is creating jobs for our creative fraternity and it has the potential to create more jobs.  It can keep the genius of this sector of the population in this country by giving its members employment and making their genius available as a rich resource for the betterment of all our lives.  It is important that we recognise its indigenous quality, hold onto it and not export these people for want of opportunity at home.</P>
        <P>Independent radio producers work closely with broadcasters to bring a greater variety of programmes to listeners in a cost effective manner.  The sector is bringing different voices and viewpoints as well as a strong regional content to Irish radio.  It is in the interest of listeners to grant it a secure national platform on RTE radio.  This is an important point.  It means bringing local and regional voices onto the airwaves and focusing on communities, areas and issues such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland as they affected local communities.  The recent documentary by Mary Owens on Hanna Greally in Roscommon is an example.  The tragic life of Hanna Greally, the author of <i>Bird&rsquo;s Nest Soup</i> and an extraordinary woman who had a unique and difficult existence, was worthy of study.  That study and studies of Northern Ireland, young people and culture are hugely important.  I recall the beautiful documentary about the dreadful fire and resulting tragedy in the Poor Clare convent in Cavan town 40 or 50 years ago that was broadcast on local radio.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting Bill introduces a requirement for RTE to commission programmes from the independent radio production sector.  That is an innovative provision.  The fact that the requirement is included is welcome and an important advance.  I commend that aspect of the Bill.  However, the Bill does not provide adequate funding for the growth and viability of the sector.  Therein lies the reason for the amendment.  An annual sum of &euro;0.5 million for independent radio production will bring negligible benefits for RTE radio listeners.  A more secure foundation is required to allow the sector to expand, innovate and invest in capital and new talent, as happened in the independent television sector 15 years ago.</P>
        <P>The requirement is a great advance but the level of funding for independent radio must be such as to give the sector viability.  What can happen as a consequence is exciting.  It is also exciting to think of the requirement there will be on third level institutions to produce graduates for this sector.  There could be a large spin-off.  It could be an exciting sector if it is properly funded and given impetus.  For this reason I am proposing an amendment to raise the minimum amount guaranteed for independent radio production in the RTE independent programme account from 1.25% per annum to reach 5% within five years.  This would bring the amount for independent radio production from &euro;500,000 per annum to a modest &euro;2 million per annum by year five.</P>
        <P>What is logical about this amendment and should be persuasive for the Minister of State and the Department is the fact that the figure is increased incrementally; it is not a wildcat figure but is set at a reasonable pitch.  That is perhaps the most important aspect of the amendment.  The Bill increases the RTE independent programme account to &euro;40 million per year and guarantees a minimum of 90.5% for independent television production.  We are happy with the provision to adequately fund the independent television producers.  There is no conflict with that.  It would be bizarre if there were or if any Member of the House suggested any limitation or barrier be imposed on our independent television producers.  On the contrary, we wish to enhance and encourage that sector.</P>
        <P>What we are discussing, however, is the disparity that exists at present and the lack of a level playing pitch for our independent radio producers.  A modest level is proposed in the amend<Col N="297"/>ment.  When framing the amendment we were anxious to produce one of sufficiently reasonable quality that it could and should be readily accepted.  Our independent radio production sector deserves our support so radio audiences can enjoy the benefit of independent production in the same way as television audiences in Ireland have over the last 15 years.</P>
        <P>I propose that the increase be incremental so the independent radio production sector can expand its capacity and output in line with the needs of RTE.  This will enhance the Bill.  It is in the spirit of the legislation.  We are anxious to have the increase enshrined in the legislation in an incremental, gradual, realistic and modest fashion.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to divide the House on this.  If we have to divide on it, we will because we feel strongly about it.  The Minister of State should accept that this issue is almost above division.  It is a matter of the well-being of our society and the independent radio sector, as well as the cultural enhancement of our country and quality of life.  There are so many profound issues involved, it would be bizarre to divide a legislative assembly, particularly the Upper House of the country, on such an issue but if we have to, we will.  I hope that will not be the outcome and that the Minister of State can accept this in the positive spirit in which he accepted other amendments.  This is a genuine effort to enhance the Bill and nothing else.  It is an attempt to enhance and empower a sector that is important to our country.  We are proud to have it in 13 counties where it harnesses our own personnel and their natural genius and creativity.  We should do nothing to stultify it but give it full support.  I hope the Minister of State accepts the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues on this issue although I will not choose between the amendments.  The Minister of State has a couple to choose from.  I strongly support the objective of the amendments.  Statutory provisions were made some years ago in the television sector and they led to an efflorescence of talent in drama and other programmes.  One need only look at TG4 and some other stations to see the remarkable dramas, documentaries and so forth that were produced as a result.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the funding outlined in the Bill for the radio sector will not be sufficient to have the type of effect the Minister of State desires.  All Members have been lobbied by various sections of the independent radio broadcasting sector seeking the type of changes my colleagues have proposed in the amendments.  I strongly support them.  It is instructive to discover that, as Senator Alex White pointed out, up to 70% of the moneys could be used internally in RTE for the administration of the unit.  That would leave very little; it would be pathetic to let that happen.  As I said earlier, to avoid this there should be a type of sifting process which could be related to the committee on broadcasting.</P>
        <P>Is it correct that there is no provision for financing recurring strands?  If there is a successful programme, it should be encouraged and not ruled out automatically simply because it was an artistic or other success.  I might have misunderstood but there appears to be some type of inhibition on the funding of recurring strands, recurring programmes and so forth.</P>

	<P>The arguments have been well made by the Opposition.  I lend my voice to support the call for an incremental increase to 5%.  That appears to be the optimum and something in which the industry is interested.  As Senator Norris has said, the independent television arising from this fund has produced interesting, informative and excellent programmes.  I have no doubt the same will happen in regard to radio.  One caveat I would put on it is that I have a concern that while it will be produced by the independent sector, the fund is controlled by RTE.  Whether it be done now or down the line, I would like that the transmission of these programmes be available to the broader broadcasting media because it is funded primarily from part of the licence fee.  I have argued that some of that should be available to others, apart from RTE.  </P><Col N="298"/>
        <P>I join with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly in asking the Minister of State to field this ball and run with it, to go back to the parlance we used earlier on the sporting issue.

If he can run with this, I hope the reciprocity from the other side will be that it will not divide the House on any other issue between now and the time we finish and that we can deal with the other issues expeditiously.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">D&eacute;ile&aacute;lann an moladh seo le ceist TG4 agus maoini&uacute; TG4.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; nuair a bh&iacute; muid ag pl&eacute; seo ar Ch&eacute;im 2, bh&iacute; a fhios ag an Aire &oacute; bhuna&iacute;odh TG4 nach raibh an maoini&uacute; cu&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il don st&aacute;isi&uacute;n.  T&aacute; an sc&eacute;al mar an gc&eacute;anna le sc&eacute;imeanna m&oacute;ra a thug d&oacute;chas do mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute;.  Molaim an sc&eacute;al m&oacute;r i dtaobh broadcasting de &mdash; an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag TG4.  &Oacute; thosaigh muid ag pl&eacute; an Bhille seo, luaigh go leor daoine cl&aacute;racha &eacute;ags&uacute;la agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag TG4 &oacute; thaobh an sp&oacute;irt de agus documentaries agus a leith&eacute;id.

        <P Just="Left">The amendment seeks to add that TG4 continues and that it be given a set budget for each financial year.  That is in recognition that TG4 has been underfunded.  Every Minister until now has recognised that TG4 is underfunded.  It does not state what the set budget would be.  An issue which is of concern to me and others who have an interest in TG4, which is an excellent broadcaster, is that before implementing any part of the Bill we need to deal with the shortfall that TG4 is currently experiencing.   It has done tremendous work against the odds.  Members spoke about the dedication a broadcaster has to sport and the old games of the 1960s.  It was TG4 that started to show those elite championship finals a long time ago.  It has given scope to independent producers to do their own documentaries through the means of Irish which are some of the best documentaries I have seen on the television screens.  It has been a great success story.  The Government is committed to TG4 and the Bill ensures its continuation.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response in terms of setting a financial budget for the broadcaster in each financial year.</P>

        <P>We could not let the opportunity pass without congratulating TG4.  It is the great success story of Irish broadcasting in recent years.  As a nation we are very proud of it.  I enjoy it very much when I get the opportunity to watch it but the opportunities do not arise very often for <Col N="300"/>us to see and enjoy any media or television.  When it does, TG4 is exceptionally good and is very creative.  Cathal Goan deserves the congratulations of the House for pioneering the concept and getting it going.  It is a great achievement and it has done wonders for the Irish language.  It is extraordinary that it has done so much compared to other methods of trying to propagate and develop a love of the language.  The success of TG4 is wonderful.</P>
        <P>I will not speak on the amendment or its content.  Senator Doherty proposed that very well.  I avail of the opportunity to say I am proud of TG4.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad I congratulate TG4 on the exceptional job its does.</P>

	<P>In respect of amendments 99<i>a</i> and 103<i>a</i>, section 123 of the Bill provides the legal mechanism by which the Minister, subject to consent of the Minister for Finance, can make Exchequer funding available to TG4 for its public service purposes.</P>
        <P>Section 124 provides that on an annual and five-year basis the new broadcasting regulator, the BAI, will conduct reviews and make recommendations to the Minister as to the adequacy or otherwise of public funding for TG4 to fulfil its public service remit as set out in section 118(1).  In carrying out the five-year review, the BAI is required to consider, among other matters, the existing financial resources available to TG4 and the current level of public funding available to TG4.  I believe that this review mechanism on implementation will ensure that sufficient attention is given to the adequacy of public funding for TG4.  As such, I do not propose to accept the Senators&rsquo; amendments.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  As that was my last amendment I thank the Minister of State for the way he has dealt with the amendments, especially the ones I tabled.  I am disappointed with his response to the final amendment and I urge him to reconsider as the amendment does not deal with the specific issues TG4 faces currently but it proposes to deal with problems it may encounter in future.</P>
        <P>A major review of funding will take place after five years but there is a need to deal with the current shortfall.  If we are able to get &euro;6 million from Gordon Brown for Irish language broadcasting in the North where it does not even have official status and where there is no Irish language Act, I am sure we can squeeze a few euro from the Government to support our own Irish language broadcaster.  I urge the Minister of State to consider other mechanisms that he has at his disposal to deal with the current shortfall experienced by TG4.  I reserve the right to raise the issue again on Report Stage.  I thank the Minister of State for the way he dealt with the amendments.</P>

        <P>Amendment No. 125 tabled by Senator Norris relates to the consequences of a person failing to pay a court imposed fine in respect of the non-possession of a television licence.  Will I deal with that amendment now or will I allow Senator Norris to speak?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a complex matter that has much wider policy implications than broadcasting legislation.  As such, it falls to be dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the context of the Fines Bill 2007, which is currently on the D&aacute;il Order Paper.</P>
        <P>The Fines Bill proposes two key mechanisms that are intended to reduce the likelihood of imprisonment in respect of the non-payment of court imposed fines.  The first mechanism is an equality of impact assessment that would allow the court to consider the ability of a person to pay a fine.  The second mechanism provides for the payment of fines by instalments.</P>
        <P>The Fines Bill is currently being reviewed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to making additional mechanisms available to the courts in the event of persons defaulting on payment of fines by the due date.  I understand that the Minister hopes to finalise shortly his proposals in that regard.  Given these developments and the complexity and extent of the issues concerned, I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s proposed amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 126 to 128, inclusive, provide that an officer of An Post may deliver reminder notifications and the fixed payments notices provided for under section 149 personally as well as by means of post.  This is intended to allow officers of An Post additional flexibility in terms of the application of such notices with a view to enhancing the efficiency of the television licence fee collection system.</P>
        <P>We are not trying to hound people.  One must have a system in place where as many people as possible will pay their television licence.  With any tax people do not feel as bad when they know everyone else is paying it.  We are providing a service and it is important that we have a system in place to encourage as many people as possible to pay the licence fee.  We recognise that the payment of a licence fee creates difficulties in families where resources are scarce.  However, we must have a system that does not create undue hardship for people.  We have a system in place and we must collect the licence fee.  The Bill provides that people are given ample warning that there is a liability or debt that needs to be honoured and gives them every opportunity to pay it without penalising them too much.  Court proceedings represent the last throw of the dice.  Every effort will be made to reach an agreement with the person to pay the licence before court proceedings are even considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am extraordinarily disappointed in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  He seems to be having it from both sides.  On the one hand, he is suggesting that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will provide for some movement in this area in the fines Bill.  On the other hand, he mouths a defence of this situation, which is indefensible, as everybody knows, including many of the judges.  I had dinner this evening with the former Senator, Mary Henry, and two people who were briefing me on an important medical matter in the Third World.  The other woman involved was a senior magistrate from Britain who had heard of these kinds of cases.  She said that she routinely refuses to send people to jail for this type of offence because it is madness.  It is madness because it is socially destructive.</P>
        <P>It is immediately relevant because within the past six months I believe a single mother in Cork had her six year old child yanked out of her arms.  Luckily some of her neighbours looked after the child while the woman was jailed for approximately a week.  It was madness.  She did not have the money to pay and she was put into jail.  How much did that cost the Exchequer? <Col N="304"/> What kind of economy is that?  I have suggested applying an attachment of earnings.  It is obscene to send poor people to jail for non-payment of television licence fees.  I doubt if people are as mean-minded as the Minister of State says and that they are looking over their shoulders and saying the single mother did not pay her television licence fee.</P>
        <P>I agree that people ought to pay their television licence fees.  However, the penalties should be proportionate and should take into account the social circumstances of the person involved.  I have included in my amendment a mechanism whereby an attachment could be made of the earnings in cases where there are earnings.  I will not press the amendment, partly because there is practically nobody from either side here to vote.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the matter.  To refresh his mind, there has been the one case I mentioned and there were several others.  I believe there was one in Limerick approximately a year ago.  It is an obscenity in this day and age that people should be sent to jail for such offences.  I will not stand over it.  While I will not call a vote tonight, I sure as blazes will on Report Stage.  While I know the Minister of State is a decent man, he has tried to defend something that is indefensible.  He did not even give an assurance that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would abolish this.  It is nonsense.  Jails are a mess and should be used for the most dangerous criminals.  Stuffing people like these into jails is an obscene farce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Norris has said, which raises a much wider debate about the overuse of jail sentences in respect of non-payment of fines across a range of different breaches.  Senator Norris is right.  For someone to be sent to jail for non-payment of a television licence fee offends against all sense of proportion and justice.  There is no basis for it.  It is the legacy of another era where we were able to apply only two types of sanctions, a fine or imprisonment.  There are many more innovative ways now to deal with these sorts of breaches.  It is indefensible.  I support what Senator Norris has said.  I hope either through this Bill or through the mechanism the Minister of State has suggested that his colleague proposes that it can be addressed and for once and for all we do not have an obscene &mdash; not too strong a word to describe it &mdash; situation where somebody is put into prison for not paying for a television licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>While there can be hardship cases, equally we need to safeguard against people playing the old soldier.  I have come across people who do not pay their television licence fees and have other financial commitments they do not meet.  Often if their lifestyles are examined it is not that they cannot afford to pay, but that they have made a conscious decision to prioritise some other entertainment facet of their lives.  Therefore the system needs to have penalties.  I agree that imprisoning people for such offences does not achieve anything.  Often the money is never recovered as a consequence of doing that.  It is also a cost on the State.  There are economic reasons apart from anything else.</P>
        <P>As I have said previously, I support the principle of attachment of earnings or social welfare payments not only in this area but also in respect of a range of offences.  We should pursue that route.  I ask the Minister of State to encourage the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department to consider pursuing this route for these kinds of offences.  One of the issues that arises when we debate prisons is the overcrowding and the need to create more spaces which is very costly.  Therefore, we should have a system that sanctions as many people as possible in a different way, including community service etc., rather than jail.  I have often come across cases of people who went to jail as fairly amateur criminals and emerge well educated in more serious crime because of the friends they made on the inside.  We should also avoid that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="305"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to speak briefly in support of Senator Norris.  The brevity does not in any way reflect the seriousness of the matter.  I support the essential proposition that nobody should go to jail for non-payment of a television licence fee.  It makes moral, humanitarian and natural sense not to jail people for offences of that nature.  It makes administrative sense bearing in mind the overcrowding of jails.  There is something bizarre, ludicrous and almost Dickensian about sending an unfortunate soul to jail for non-payment of a television licence fee.  That is not to say we should not enforce licence fee collection.  Of course we should.</P>
        <P>I agree with the thrust of what Senator Walsh said.  We need to consider the method of collection of the television licence fee and methods for dealing with non-payment other than jailing people.  For a range of offences it should be possible to deal with people by other methods, including attachment of earnings and payments by instalments, as mentioned by the Minister of State.  It can be achieved by a myriad of methods.  However, it is wrong to have somebody languishing in a prison because of an offence of this nature.  There should be sufficient creativity in our judicial system and in our Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform implementation process for fines to find another methodology for doing it.  This is not a debate on criminology.  Jail should be always a last resort when there is no possible alternative after every rehabilitative option has been exhausted.  Every financial and other kind of sanction should be explored to the last, including the community service option, which is a very good one.  We have failed when we reach the stage of jailing people for such offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 149  provides for the operation of a fixed-penalty payment mechanism in respect of failure to hold a television licence in respect of the possession of a television set.  A fixed penalty payment notice may be applied only after the issue of two reminder notifications and a minimum period of 56 days.  The extent of a fixed penalty payment notice is capped at one third of the value of the extant television licence fee.  There needs to be some incentive for people to pay the fee.  We can be as nice as we want but at the same time we need to be pragmatic about what we are doing.  I do not want to split hairs but while we could say people were jailed for not having a television licence, it might be more accurate to say they were jailed for not adhering to a court decision.  I mentioned the fact that they are jailed for not adhering to a court decision and, as such, this is a matter for the Fines Bill.  We are not trying to wash our hands of it.  If a poll were carried out in Ireland 99.999% of the people would share Senator Norris&rsquo;s view.  I do not disagree with that.  However there is scope in the Fines Bill to address this issue.  It is best left there and I am confident it can be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There seemed to be a little movement there, although not much.  I will withdraw my amendment, but I still think it is appalling that somebody should be sent to jail for non-payment of a television licence or of a consequent fine.  We, luckily, are far removed from the &ldquo;hot struggles of the poor&rdquo;.  I have no sympathy with some middle class person with plenty of money who decides to spend it all on himself or herself.  That is where one can attach the earnings.  That is why I tabled that amendment.  It costs a lot to send somebody to jail, much more than the cost of the licence, so it is an absurdity.  The scale of the fines in the Bill specifies a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000 in the case of a first offence.  That is enough to frighten the life out of any person who is unable to pay the licence fee in the first place.  The fine for a second offence is not to exceed &euro;2,000.  We are happy to specify the fines and the consequence.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister said he felt that 99.999% of the people of this country would agree with this amendment.  Is the Minister among the 0.001%?  Is he with the rest of us in his heart?  I ask him, like the former leader of his party and Taoiseach, Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera, to look into his heart and find therein the capacity to ensure nobody goes to jail.  One would need the irony of Jonathan Swift to deal with this.  It has happened a couple of times in the past couple of years.  Yanking a six year old child from the arms of his or her mother punishes the child as <Col N="306"/>well, and that is not fair.  I cited the experience of meeting the senior magistrate, which was unsolicited.  I did not know this woman was a magistrate.  She is also a doctor.  She said this is the worst possible principle.  Many people would subscribe to that view.  I will not press my amendment tonight but I ask the Minister to consider it again and consult with his colleague to do something about it.  I would be surprised, but maybe he could urge him to do something about this.  If it did nothing else, this amendment, which I am not pressing, might inspire the Minister&rsquo;s colleague to remove this nonsense, which is a blot on the Irish Statute Book.</P>

	<P>As we are not sure whether the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, will take Report Stage, I would like to compliment him on the exemplary manner in which he has dealt with Committee Stage in recent days.  It is a huge Bill consolidating many of the Broadcasting Acts and that whole important area.  The manner in which he engaged with the Seanad exploited the parliamentary process to its full potential.  His clarity in dealing with areas, spelling out clearly why he was not accepting amendments in some instances and in other instances engaging and taking them on board where he felt they would enhance the Bill was an example for many of his colleagues to follow.  It should be put on the record lest he is not <Col N="310"/>in the House for us to make those points next week.  As others will know, I am not given to patronising Ministers when they come to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the remarks of thanks to the Minister of State for the manner in which he approached the Bill and the way he engaged with the amendments.  He was very positive and co-operative in that respect and did not adopt a dictatorial approach, which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I again welcome that the Bill was initiated in the Seanad, which is encouraging for the House.  I must confess the Bill was a learning curve because it is a new area for me.  I found it an exciting experience to read into the issue, meet the interest groups and learn about the Bill, and I also found the amendments interesting.  I thank the Minister of State for the way he engaged with the Bill.  He was neither patronising nor arrogant, which is appreciated.</P>
        <P>I hope Report Stage will go well.  Unfortunately, I will not be here to take it but one of my colleagues will do so extremely ably, I am sure.</P>

	<P>I also thank the Minister of State for his attention and generosity in the course of the debate.  I look forward to the fruits of our discussions turning up on Report Stage.  It is important and, broadly, very good legislation.  As was said on Second Stage, it replaces 50 years of legislation in broadcasting, which is a massively important area.  Very good work has been done on Committee Stage and I thank the Minister of State for that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Power, to the House.  His endurance has been tested today.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on behalf not just of the students, parents and teachers of the Cork School of Music but of the people of Cork.  Cutbacks affect people and in this case it is young people, be they boys and girls at primary level or second level, teenagers, adults, parents and staff.  It is a concern that in a changing economic environment and in a climate where we are reducing expenditure, we are taking a stance against creativity, arts, culture and music.  Any cuts in teaching hours are regrettable but especially so in the case of the Cork School of Music.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell the House there will be no cuts with regard to part-time teaching hours at the school.</P>
        <P>The school, which is a constituent college of Cork Institute of Technology, is celebrating 130 years of the provision of music but concerns now arise in that regard.  A year ago, there was a <Col N="311"/>fanfare to welcome the opening of the new school of music, which was built through public private partnership.  Many people campaigned for what is a magnificent facility, and its reputation, integrity and provision of service in terms of music go beyond Cork.  There are now more than 2,000 students at primary and post-primary level, along with third and fourth level students, resulting in a college that is vibrant, active and has waiting lists for many of its courses.  What will happen now?</P>
        <P>It is ironic that there are cutbacks.  There is a reduction of 2,000 teaching hours, which will have a profound and immediate impact on teachers, students and parents as well as on the world of music and arts in Cork.  There will be a lay-off of temporary teachers and a reduction in the enrolment in many classes, including no harp enrolment, no new wind enrolment and a 50% reduction in both piano and violin enrolment.  Choirs and musicianship classes will be cut and current students will not be offered second instruments.  While I had hoped this would not have an impact on third and fourth level, I am sure it will.  After campaigning for years for a new school of music, we are reducing service and output, and dumbing down the entire service and the provision of facilities.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Authority is providing funding and the Cork Institute of Technology is trying to manage its budget, but what happens?  There is a restriction of the student intake and a complete, systematic rowing back of the provision for the school for the 2007-08 academic year.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Education and Science is not present because this is a matter of grave importance to the people of Cork and beyond.  Will the Minster of State ask the Minister for Education and Science to confirm how the Cork School of Music can continue to provide the full range of music tuition currently available when there will be no intake of students?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In conclusion, this is a matter that requires urgent attention.  We have a wonderful facility, a dedicated staff who are the best in Europe and a renowned school.  We are taking this away and affecting people through cutbacks which are a consequence of bad economic management.  For the sake of a percentage of a budget and on behalf of the parents, students and staff, I appeal to the Minister of State not to proceed with the cuts.  I look forward to his reply because this is the beginning of a change in education policy.  It does not augur well in a time of economic change if we treat education negatively.  It is a bad way to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I will reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the Cork School of Music is a constituent part of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  As institutes of technology are autonomous institutions, the Department of Education and Science has no role in their operational affairs.  The institutes of technology receive a block grant from the Higher Education Authority and it is a matter for each institution to determine how this is allocated internally.  In the case of the Cork School of Music, the CIT will determine the level of funding to be allocated to the school.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of the annual demands for additional resources for the higher education sector and he has afforded priority to investments in this area.  Spending on higher education has increased dramatically over the past decade.  When all higher education funding is taken into account, the overall provision by the Department for the sector amounts to &euro;2 billion for 2008.  This is an increase of 25% since 2005, when the provision amounted to &euro;1.6 billion, and an increase of 135% on the &euro;850 million provided in 1997.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P>I understand that recurrent funding for CIT has been increased in recent years from &euro;57 million in 2005 to almost &euro;64 million this year.  Its 2008 allocation represents an increase of 2.5% over its 2007 funding and an increase of 12% since 2005.  CIT has also benefited from substantial capital funding of &euro;80 million allocated since 1997.  In addition, the Cork School of Music was one of three pilot public private partnership projects undertaken by the Department and was completed in 2007 at a cost amounting to &euro;51 million, excluding VAT.</P>
        <P>It is understood from CIT that in the context of the normal cycle of review and planning for next year, all faculties and constituent colleges have been requested to achieve efficiencies.  It is also understood that while there will be some small reduction in new part-time student intake, the Cork School of Music will continue to offer the full range of music tuition currently available, including for first and second level students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and appreciate this is not his brief.  However, three quarters of his reply was irrelevant to the matter I raised.  There will be a reduction in the number of part-time students.  I impress upon him the need to ask the Minister for Education and Science how the Cork School of Music can continue to provide the full range of music tuition given that there will be no intake of students.  That is the question to which the pupils, parents and teachers need an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry if the reply I gave to the Senator was not exactly what he expected.  I have outlined the commitment that has been made to the Cork School of Music and the vast sums of money that have been made available.  I am not familiar with the plans for the future intake of students but I will consult the Minister and revert to the Senator on the issue.</P>

    <Title>Fuel Prices. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak about the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the Government&rsquo;s plans to curtail the increase in the price of diesel fuel in light of the knock-on effect on the consumer price index.  I just met a businessman whose business has a small turnover of approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  He told me that the increase in fuel prices, and diesel in particular, is going to increase his costs by &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>The extraordinary aspect of the increase in diesel prices is that nobody seems to know why it is happening.  No credible explanation has been given but it appears it is due in part to speculation in world commodity markets and is related to the increase in oil prices.  While it is difficult therefore for the T&aacute;naiste to provide a solution, the first thing we should require is an explanation for why the price of diesel, which has traditionally been cheaper, is increasing at a much faster rate than ordinary fuel.  I hope this is not because the tax incentives which will be introduced at the end of June to make people switch to diesel vehicles are being exploited by profiteers.  It may be that unscrupulous dealers are profiting unnecessarily from efforts to make the area more environmentally friendly.</P>
        <P>Hauliers are among the people most affected and the Minister of State will be aware that they are up in arms about the increases.  They need relief or, at least, to be pointed in the right direction because they will get into serious trouble if the price of diesel continues to rise at this rate.</P>
        <P>When I checked this afternoon, the average price of a litre of petrol was up 6% to &euro;1.30 in May, while the average price of diesel was &euro;1.42.  This increase is causing a great deal of concern not only to the individuals affected but also to the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland.</P><Col N="313"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Diesel cars currently represent 27% of overall sales but this proportion is expected to increase to 50% in 2009 with the implementation of the tax incentives.  If the price of diesel remains higher, people will have been misled, to say the least, into believing that switching to an environmentally friendly vehicle would be cheaper.  It will be more expensive and the incentives will backfire.  I ask the Minister of State to investigate this matter as well as to look more generally at the behaviour of Topaz and others.  I am not saying they are doing anything wrong but they appear to be buying up an enormous number of garages, thereby putting them in a dominant position.  That will certainly not reduce the price of fuel.</P>
        <P>Speculation may be the cause of this damage.  I deplore the fact that we do not know why diesel prices are increasing so much more quickly than petrol and I ask the Minister of State to outline the Government&rsquo;s plans to counter this trend.  It has serious implications for the economy at a time when the consumer price index is increasing at an alarming rate and when everybody in the country is being hit by food prices.  Energy prices are set to rocket and the unknown factors operating within the fuel market threaten us during this period of economic vulnerability.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this topical and interesting matter.  I am responding to it on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan.</P>
        <P>The retail price of all carbon fuels, including diesel, has increased significantly in recent months.  This essentially reflects the considerable increase in the global wholesale price of oil.  As Senator Ross will be aware, the Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market and prices at the pump for petrol and diesel reflect market factors, notably global market price, transportation costs, euro-dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.</P>
        <P>In analysing how the retail price of fuel products such as petrol and diesel is calculated, a number of facts should be borne in mind.  First, excise duty rates in Ireland for auto-diesel and petrol are &euro;368.05 and &euro;442.68 per 1,000 litres of fuel. respectively.  These rates are lower than the EU 15 average and than those of our main trading partners, especially our nearest neighbour, the UK.  Furthermore, excise rates for diesel, petrol and other fuel oils have not been increased in the past four budgets.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer yield from excise does not increase as the price of fuels increases because excise is set at a nominal amount.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT increases as the price of fuels rises because the former is set as a percentage of the price.  However, it should be borne in mind that in the context of the extent to which spending in the economy is reallocated to petrol, diesel and other oil products and away from other VAT-liable spending, and the extent to which the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.  Businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including that incurred in respect of fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</P>
        <P>In so far as calls for reduced taxes are concerned and in light of the impact high oil prices can have on growth rates, the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, considered the issue of an appropriate policy response to the price increases at its meeting on 3 June 2008.  ECOFIN confirmed the agreement reached in Manchester in 2005 to the effect that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided because they have the effect of preventing necessary adjustments by economic agents.  Reducing taxes on fuels would send the <Col N="314"/>wrong signal to consumers and oil producers.  We must be careful, therefore, not to exacerbate an already difficult situation.</P>
        <P>Any measure relating to fuel prices would have to be targeted at the most vulnerable in society.  The Government has taken successive opportunities to make real and significant increases to payments to pensioners and the socially excluded and also to reduce the levels of tax paid by lower income earners.  The national fuel allowance scheme and the household benefits package provide specific assistance to the less well-off in respect of fuel costs.</P>
        <P>In so far as the relativity between the price of diesel and petrol is concerned, as Senator Ross stated, diesel traditionally has been less expensive than petrol at the forecourts in Ireland.  This was due to the fact that the international prices for both products were previously at a similar level and that excise duty is lower on diesel.  European production was also closely matched to demand for both products.  The international price of diesel has, however, increased relative to petrol for a number of reasons.</P>
        <P>Demand for diesel is rising in Europe and China and also in other rapidly developing economies worldwide.  According to the March and April International Energy Agency oil market reports, Europe has been experiencing lower imports of distillates from the US and elsewhere because cargoes have been diverted to Latin America, South Africa and the Middle East.  The increased demand for aviation fuel, which comes from the same part of the barrel of oil as diesel, is also a contributory factor.</P>
        <P>European refineries are unable to keep pace with the demand for diesel.  Each barrel of oil can only be used to produce a certain percentage of diesel and European diesel demand now exceeds production.  This means that diesel must be sourced from further afield, particularly from Russia, and the price is thus affected.</P>
        <P>The International Energy Agency has reported that US refiners have been producing substantially more barrels of petrol than usual and that domestic US stocks have been well above their five-year range.  High US stocks, coupled with lower than anticipated demand and low prices in that country, are likely to have curbed flows of exports of petrol from Europe to the US.  This has resulted in higher stocks of north-west European petrol.  The combination of these market factors has contributed to the rise in diesel prices relative to petrol.</P>
        <P>The increase in the price of diesel is affecting all of Europe.  According to recent EU data, out of 27 member states, Ireland is in the mid to lower range for petrol and auto-diesel prices.  Furthermore, it is mainly the newer member states which have lower fuel prices than Ireland.  These comparisons demonstrate that Ireland is by no means the worst affected country in Europe in respect of the retail price of diesel and petrol.</P>
        <P>The rising cost of fuel will clearly impact on all aspects of our economy.  In so far as consumer prices are concerned, Senator Ross will be aware that Government policy in respect of prices, including the price of commodities such as petrol and diesel, is concentrated on the promotion of competition, consumer choice and awareness.  There is no price control on these products and in common with most other goods and services, price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy.  It is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur.  The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997 requires petrol stations to display their prices in a clear and prominent manner so that consumers can make an informed choice.  This order enables consumers to compare prices readily and purchase their fuel on the basis of such a choice.  The National Consumer Agency is responsible for enforcing the order.</P>
        <P>The upward global trend in oil prices reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its oil dependency and to use energy wisely and efficiently.  Senator Ross will be aware of the actions being taken by Government to accelerate delivery of our targets in respect of renewable energy <Col N="315"/>and energy efficiency, which are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and consumers.</P>
        <P>The Government fully recognises the concerns arising as a result of the hikes in fuel prices.  However, the increase in the price of fuels, including that of diesel, is not tax-driven but rather is an international phenomenon affecting all countries and all sectors of the economy and society.  Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors, including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates and production and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices in recent times reflects additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in countries such as China.</P>
        <P>It is clear, therefore, that rising fuel prices present a significant challenge for consumers, businesses and indeed for the whole of our society.  It is important that, as a society, we all face this challenge and play our part in meeting it.  I assure the Senator that the Government, through the pursuit of prudent policies, will play its part in seeking to ensure that the interests of all sectors of our society and of the economy as a whole will not be impacted unduly by the ongoing effects of rising fuel prices.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I neither accept nor reject his analysis of the reasons for the rise in the price of diesel as against that of other fuels.  I just do not know whether what he said is actually the case.  There are many disparate reasons for this rise and the Minister of State&rsquo;s assertions, which were certainly given in good faith, may be true.  If the Government detects any sign of profiteering &mdash; which is exploiting tax incentives and which seems to be coinciding with the incentives being provided to encourage people to purchase diesel-powered vehicles &mdash; on the part of retailers or wholesalers of diesel, will it take action?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the matter of the Dublin-Derry air service.  A number of years ago, everyone became excited when P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;ide of Aer Arann agreed, without the provision of any subsidies, to set up operations at Derry Airport to try to progress a service between Derry and Dublin.  At the time, Donegal County Council did its best to provide assistance.  The issue of State aid stopped or stymied the best possible service and we only took what we got.  The service was operational from almost midday, which was not the best timing so the uptake was not great.</P>
        <P>People in Donegal must get to Dublin early.  Although people in Dublin do not need to get to Donegal as early, they must be able to return having had a reasonable amount of time to carry out work.  Many Ministers have been able to come up, do a day&rsquo;s work and get back in a reasonable time with the current PSO, awarded to Loganair under BA.</P>
        <P>I am concerned.  A new PSO is to launched on the 22 July.  Loganair-BA had the service, operating a 36-seater which left Derry at approximately 7.30 a.m. and arrived at Dublin at approximately 8.10 a.m, which meant a person could get to Dublin city by 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m.  The person could do a day&rsquo;s work and leave at approximately 6.30 p.m. with the air service.  The return service left Dublin at 9 a.m. and got to Derry at approximately 9.40 a.m.; it would then leave Derry at approximately 5.10 p.m., reaching Dublin by 6 p.m.  The flight would overnight in Derry.  It was an ideal situation.</P><Col N="316"/>
        <P>We have a new PSO and I am delighted Aer Arann has returned to receive it.  I look forward to the service consisting of a 48-seater instead of a 36-seater as the demand has been such that the 36-seater was often full and many businesspeople were not able to get a flight when they needed one.  The bigger plane will be very important.</P>
        <P>I am in a difficult position in that although I welcome the new service and the competitiveness of Aer Arann, the departure will now be from Dublin instead of Derry.  It will not be able to leave Derry until 8.40 a.m. to arrive in Dublin by 9.30 a.m. if on time.  This means a person getting to the airport by 9.30 a.m. will need until 10.30 a.m. or 11 a.m. to be able to start a day&rsquo;s work in Dublin.  It might sound reasonable to some but it would be more reasonable if a person was to arrive in Derry at that time for a meeting at 10.30 a.m. or 11 a.m.  Most people need to be in Dublin earlier than that, even when there is no delay and the service has run like clockwork.</P>
        <P>I have been approached by a significant number of people from the business community who would have been regular users of the previous service and they are very upset.  They are worried that they will have to consider the alternative of coming to Dublin the night before for an overnight stay or getting into the car for a four-hour journey because there is no train service.  They are also considering connections to US and European destinations, as many of those are mid-morning or late morning slots, and we are not sure this new service will facilitate a quick enough turnaround time for travellers going from Derry to Dublin and on to another destination.</P>
        <P>The new 8.40 a.m. service is also very close to the very busy 8.50 a.m. Ryanair flight to London.  Although the ground staff in Derry are excellent, very friendly and great people, the reality is the airport is not set up for two busy flights going out at the same time.  There could be a bottleneck at check-in and security, and I have been caught in that a couple of times.</P>
        <P>The service provides a vital commercial link for the business community in the north west, which has been growing.  This 48-seater service would improve that growth.  Some people may wish to know why Donegal people want to know about Derry city airport but between 48% and 51% of passengers are from my part of Donegal.  We are worried that this change of timing and the fact that the plane is not based in Derry will alienate the people using it as it is the only way for a business person to operate other than getting into a car and driving.</P>
        <P>The ground handling manager in Derry city airport has indicated its preference is to retain the existing schedule.  Aer Arann is restricted in its operating times as it is now based in Dublin because of the PSO agreed by the Department.  It is also restricted by available slots in Dublin, although this relates to it having to base an operation out of Dublin.</P>
        <P>According to Derry City Airport, Aer Arann has indicated that although it will start with a schedule, it will take into account passenger opinions and load factors to revise timings and possibly even base an aircraft in Derry.  People are wondering why if Aer Arann can make the decision, it does not make it now.  When I spoke to Aer Arann I was told it cannot make it because the option was given to the Department but not accepted.</P>
        <P>It will be very difficult to prove the case.  If people walk away from this service it will be very difficult to sustain the investment made by the Government.  Aer Arann has indicated that upon application for tender, it proposed two schedules to the Government, the first being an early morning departure and the second being the 8.40 a.m. departure.  Upon award of the contract, the airline was advised to operate the latter departure time and once slots were confirmed, the schedule was published.  The airline put the issue firmly back to the Department.</P><Col N="317"/>
        <P>This involves a PSO and runway development, which are major investments for the Government.  I underline our appreciation of the serious investment made by this Government in the Derry airport for the good of the north west, its business travellers and all kinds of commuters.</P>
        <P>When the service began, Belfast&rsquo;s international and city airports sent letters to MLAs and MPs asking them to stop it at any cost.  They saw Derry as a competitive service, which would undermine Belfast&rsquo;s airports if people used Dublin as a gateway.  We have worked very hard to have a successful service operating from the north west.  It was a success because the aircraft was based in Derry.</P>
        <P>Why did the PSO not remain as it was for an aircraft based out of the North, which facilitated people getting out of the north west early to get to Dublin, where they must arrive early?  It should not be as it is now, where I would have to try to get to the airport for 6 a.m. to sign in and be in Derry much earlier than I would need to be if I was a business person.  It does not make sense.</P>
        <P>I would hate to think this service will fall at a time when we are giving it such investment.  It does not make sense to break what was not broken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising the matter but it is up to the airlines to come up with the most attractive packages in terms of price and operational arrangements, such as aircraft types and service timetables, which meet the basic specifications laid down for the PSO programme.</P>
        <P>I have heard what the Senator stated in that when this flight began, there were no subsidies.  There is now a very considerable subsidy, which the Senator acknowledged.  Having considered such information, it is very hard to understand the story that the Department laid down the schedule in question.  It is for the airline, subject to the terms of the PSO programme, to come up with the plan.  In the case of the Derry route, a bid submitted by Aer Arann emerged as the very clear winner, having scored higher than the competing bids in both price and non-price terms.</P>
        <P>In terms of proposed operating timetables, the bid met the requirement as set out in the specification published in the EU Official Journal, which stipulates that on any weekday, it should be possible for passengers from Derry to make a round trip to Dublin.  Perhaps the Senator is arguing that the specifications were too loose.  Nonetheless, this very competitive bid met the specifications and criteria we laid down.</P>
        <P>Under the arrangements that apply to the Derry service at present, there is a weekday departure from Derry at 7.40 a.m. followed by a flight back to Derry which leaves Dublin at 9 a.m.  It was clear from the tenders received for the new round of contracts that maintaining that type of schedule by basing an aircraft at Derry, for example, would have meant choosing a tender that involved a higher cost and had received a lower score.  Not surprisingly, the evaluation panel favoured the Aer Arann bid.</P>
        <P>The decision on the new Derry contract is fully consistent with the existing specifications for public service obligation services and with the rules for evaluating PSO tenders.  If these were to be changed, for example, to introduce more specific requirements about scheduling, the way would be clear for a significant escalation in costs which would immediately call into question the continued viability of the PSO programme.</P>
        <P>Aer Arann is anxious to make a success of the new service and it is mindful of the views of its customers.  I understand a small change to the timetable is planned and Aer Arann now proposes to change the Derry morning departure, from Monday to Thursday, to 8.30 a.m.  The company will also keep the schedule under review to see what opportunities may arise for further adjustments in the future within the framework of its successful tender.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>The bid scored well on price and other aspects and met the criteria laid down.  Satisfying the case put forward by the Senator would have meant ignoring costs and our own scoring system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The executive officer of Derry City Council said it was consulted at an early stage.  The council advised that its preference was to retain the existing schedule and that if this was not possible, it would have liked the new schedule to be as close to the old schedule as possible.  The plane is now an hour later leaving Derry and I do not know who will be able to get up early enough for the flight from Dublin to Derry.</P>
        <P>Given that the current PSO is for a plane staying in Derry overnight and the perfect timing can be seen by all, will the Minister of State come back to me in the near future on whether a similar bid was tabled?  I accept that one thing can be cheaper than another but we wanted to retain what we had in Derry.  I do not underestimate Aer Arann&rsquo;s desire to make this work.  We just want to use our experience to help this to work for that company and for ourselves.</P>
