	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the steps that will be taken by the Government to increase public understanding of any agreements between Ireland and other European countries in relation to the Lisbon treaty before the running of any future referendum.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the way in which he can ensure value for money in expenditure on school building projects, in particular at Ard Mhuire national school in Belgard, Tallaght, in light of the current economic crisis and the need therefore to ensure value for money with all State expenditure.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the plans he has to reverse the budget decision to eliminate the grand aid to Protestant fee paying schools with particular reference to Kilkenny College.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>If ever there was evidence that the Oireachtas should not be adjourning until 27 January, which is such a long time without democratic accountability, it is certainly to be seen in today&rsquo;s news.  There is news on the economy and on banking regulation that is very disturbing and that needs to be discussed in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and in the finance committees of these Houses.</P>
        <P>On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, the ESRI spokesman described yesterday&rsquo;s launch of the Government economic strategy as an interesting, aspirational document which did not deal with the immediate crisis facing us or the hard decisions that need to be taken to protect jobs and the economy.  That is a damning indictment.  He stated that the current crisis needs a far more detailed and immediate response.  The document contains very disturbing news, as we meet on the last sitting day of the Seanad this year, in that it forecasts that unemployment will rise, possibly to 10% and beyond, that more than 50,000 people will leave the country by April 2009 and that the deficit will be even more than was imagined until yesterday, with a potential rise in public borrowing to &euro;18.2 billion in 2009.  It is a disturbing story about our economy and our public finances.</P>
        <P>These are challenging times for the Government and the people.  It has also been an extraordinary political year from an economic point of view.  None of us will forget the sight of those thousands of elderly people in the church protesting against the budget decisions.  That really was a defining moment to see those people packed into the church, so disturbed by the decision to take the medical card from them.  As Fine Gael said in the House this week, we are not happy with the current decision on the medical card.</P>
        <P>Many Senators spoke yesterday about their concern that none of these issues was discussed in the House.  The report that was launched yesterday will not be discussed.  It will come up during the debate on the Finance Bill today, but we needed a discussion on that report.  Therefore, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we will have an opportunity to discuss the Government&rsquo;s strategy, as outlined in the report that was launched in Dublin Castle yesterday.  That is the least that should happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also must talk about the governance of the banks, especially following the issue that came into the public domain yesterday about Anglo Irish Bank.  Mr. Sean FitzPatrick has resigned as a result of this.  This astonishing news, which raises most serious questions about the regulation and governance of our banks in recent years, must be discussed by this House.  The amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business that I have proposed includes a reference to the need to discuss the governance issues in the banking sector that arise from what has emerged today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about the economy during the debate on the Finance Bill 2008.  It is worthwhile to focus on the second point that was made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I argued three months ago that the Financial Regulator was the most appropriate authority to make a statement about the capitalisation of the banks, as no other body had seen the books.  That point was not accepted by any commentator or politician in either House.  The Financial Regulator was right, but nobody noticed that either.  It was not said again.  It should be noted that despite all the criticism of the public service, the problems in Anglo Irish Bank were discovered by the Financial Regulator rather than by a team of high-powered auditors.  The regulator brought the problems to the attention of the board after they were discovered earlier this year.  The regulator works to the best of its ability, even if some people suggest otherwise.</P>
        <P>The Deputy Leader suggested last week that the Financial Regulator did not do its job properly when it failed to take action against those offering loans of 100% and 110%.  I remind him that the regulator was unable to take such action because the Oireachtas did not give it the authority to do so.  When the regulator was being established, I tried to give it additional <Col N="167"/>authority but my proposal was rejected.  I spent weeks fighting on the floor of this House for legislative provision to be made for a directors&rsquo; compliance statement, which would have dealt with the issue that arose last week.  With the exception of the Labour Party, I did not get any support from either side of the House for my proposals in respect of huge issues like compliance statements and governance.  It appears that we are being asked to give control of the &euro;10 billion recapitalisation package to the same people who were involved in the transfer of loans worth &euro;87 million.  I will ask the same questions I have asked time and again.  How can we do that?  How do we know it will work?  Why should we give this money to the people in question?  What is the next step?  A clear and old-fashioned case needs to be made.  We will have much more to say about this.  I thank the Financial Regulator for uncovering these problems.  These people have pulled the wool over our eyes.  Fool me once, blame on you.  Fool me twice, blame on me.  That is what we are looking at.  I would not trust these people with &euro;10 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said about the banks.  It seems there will be an initiative early in 2009.  We need to pause before we consider putting taxpayers&rsquo; money into those banks in which certain activities, which have been exposed in recent days, appear to have been occurring.  We do not know precisely what has been happening.  We do not have the precise detail of the story that has emerged this morning.  Like many such stories, it appears to have been dragged out rather than revealed publicly in an open fashion.  Senator Fitzgerald is right to suggest that there is very little cheer, Christmas cheer or otherwise, in the ESRI report.  I am sorry if it seems a little harsh, but we got some good news this morning when we heard of a resignation in the banking sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  It is good news.  It is about time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was about time for a resignation in that sector.  I have to say, without trespassing too far into a personal matter, that the resignation about which we heard this morning was particularly welcome for me.</P>
        <P>As the Labour Party leader in this House, I ask the Cathaoirleach to allow me to briefly note the death in the past 24 hours of Dr. Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien, who was a Member of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il at various times.  He made an enormous contribution to Irish life as a politician, diplomat and journalist.  When I was a student of politics in the 1970s, I had to read Dr. Cruise O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s book, <i>States of Ireland</i>.  Along with other books that were published in that era, <i>States of Ireland</i> had a huge impact on the way we viewed our country, particularly in the context of the Northern crisis.  While I did not agree with many of Dr. Cruise O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s opinions, I cannot deny that as a politician and intellectual, he introduced a very high level of debate to Irish politics and public life.  One had to raise one&rsquo;s game if one wanted to take him on or disagree with him.  I convey my condolences and those of my party to Dr. Cruise O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s family on his sad death.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a formal expression of sympathy at a later date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that there is a need for a debate on the banking sector.  Such a debate will take place.  I would like to respond to Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on remarks I made about the Financial Regulator last week.  I pointed out that the standard of regulation in this country is in line with the hands-off approach to regulation throughout the world.  Internationally, there have been substantial failures in the regulation of financial institutions in the western developed world.  I accept that the legislation pertaining to the Financial Regulator needs to be reconsidered by both houses.  As an Opposition spokesman on finance when that legislation was originally introduced, I made several of the criticisms Senator O&rsquo;Toole has made today.  The resignation of the chairman of one of the banks represents the start of the process <Col N="168"/>of restoring public confidence in the banking sector.  I do not know of anyone in public life who is prepared to support a State programme of recapitalisation of the banks in the absence of strict conditions applying to those who have shown they are incapable of inspiring public confidence.  I am confident that such conditions will be set out when a decision on the matter is made in this House.  All Members of this House have a role in identifying and applying such conditions, in the interests of the health of our financial services and the recovery of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  She spoke about three matters, the first of which was the ESRI report.  It is frightening to think that 117,000 people will lose their jobs in 2009.  She also mentioned the Government plan that was announced yesterday, which this House will not discuss.  I have not been able to read all the editorials in all the media this morning, but I understand the plan has been branded as a failure.  The Leader, who will have his own comments to make on the matter, will correct me if I am wrong in that regard.  We need a debate on the meat of the plan, if there is meat in it.  Perhaps it is merely aspirational, as has been suggested.  Senator Fitzgerald also referred to the important banking issues that have been brought into sharper focus by the two resignations of the last 24 hours.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I have always believed in strict compliance with directors&rsquo; compliance statements and the best corporate governance practices.  Things have gone amiss.  Perhaps the Financial Regulator spotted certain things a long time ago.  He may have complied with his own requirements.  There has been a breakdown.  I agree with and support Senator Boyle&rsquo;s suggestion that the matter needs to be revisited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the proposal that was made yesterday to restart the economy.  At a difficult time, the Government is trying to put a positive slant on enterprise in this country.  I note that the Financial Regulator has made significant progress in rooting out bad practice.  It is important to note that provision was made a long time ago to allow the Central Bank to deal with issues of this nature.  I refer to section 6 of the Central Bank Act 1942, which makes it clear that the Central Bank has wide powers.  I am glad the Financial Regulator has been enabled in a similar manner.  I do not believe further legislation is necessary under this heading.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise two matters.  I have been shocked by this morning&rsquo;s financial developments.  When I interviewed the gentleman in question on the radio, I found him to be very pleasant.  It is astonishing to think that the entire establishment has been impugned.  Leading people from practically every pillar of our community &mdash; politicians, clergy of various denominations, lawyers and bankers &mdash; have gone to jail.  It is astonishing.  I was involved in a directors&rsquo; loan some years ago.  I gave money to a company to keep it going.  That is my understanding of how a directors&rsquo; loan works.  Directors should not take one third of their companies&rsquo; funds, which really belong to other people, for themselves.  It is clear to me I simply do not understand high finance, but I think it is sometimes fairly low finance.</P>
        <P>I refer to another matter I regard as quite serious.  On foot of newspaper reports, without any personal animus against people whom I do not recall ever having met and about whom I do not know anything, I have raised questions about the way in which the chief executive officer of the Equality Authority was driven out of office.  He is a person of the highest integrity.  I asked a series of questions.  I wish to put on the record of the House that attempts have been made by senior members of Government to intimidate me, to indicate to me that I would be politically punished if I attempted to continue to raise these matters.  If that ever happens again, I will name the Minister who did it, and I will not stop in this House.  I will do the same outside and I will let anybody who dares to intimidate me or to interfere with the democratic process <Col N="169"/>take his or her chance against me in the courts.  I am one of the most litigious people in this land and I have never lost &mdash; the worst I had was a draw.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have indicated that we will celebrate the first meeting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1919 and it is perfectly proper, wonderful and honourable that we should.  In the context of the attacks upon human rights and the swingeing cuts, the Government should bear in mind these two sentences from the programme of Government for the First D&aacute;il in 1919:</P>
        <P LI="1">We declare that we desire our country to be ruled in accordance with the principles of Liberty, Equality, and Justice for all, which alone can secure permanence of Government in the willing adhesion of the people . . .</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as Citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the test against which the Government will be judged.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="170"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with much of what has been said about the overnight revelations on the banking sector.  For some time there has been a need to strengthen corporate governance, particularly for public companies.  Salaries, remuneration packages and obviously now other aspects of benefit to people who are directors and chief executives of those companies are alarming and very detrimental to the interest of shareholders in those companies.  When we come back we should have a full debate on that matter.</P>
        <P>I point out to those who might seek to exonerate people who work in the public service, which has regulatory control over these matters, that the episode highlighted last night has been going on for the past six or seven years, according to reports, but it is only now coming to light.  It is not good enough that people within the regulatory authorities are not more diligent.  I fully agree with what Senator Boyle said.  Internationally and domestically there are serious questions to ask of those who regulate the banking sector and those who operated and ran the banking sector, in many instances for their own benefit rather than for the benefit of the organisation for which they were working and for the benefit of society generally.  When we resume in the new year we should have a debate on all these aspects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is little wonder that people are losing faith in the system.  We have proof yet again this morning that the banks have not told the truth or the whole truth.  How can we trust them with taxpayers&rsquo; money?  It is incumbent on the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, to find ways to make them more accountable and to make that as foolproof as possible.  There has been one rule for one and one rule for the other.</P>
        <P>I was saddened this week when I heard the news of the resignation of Niall Crowley from the Equality Authority.  In my constituency I had at least two cases where I found him very helpful.  He was straight-talking, with no bureaucratic rubbish and he gave good advice.  The issue was sorted without huge fees being encountered.  What is the Government doing by cutting the authority&rsquo;s budget by 43%?  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to seek the reinstatement of Niall Crowley.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should also make a statement indicating the Government is committed to equality, fairness and non-discrimination.  Cutting a budget by almost half basically indicates that the Government wants to get rid of the body concerned.  The Minister must come good on this and do the honourable thing before Christmas &mdash; he should meet Mr. Crowley and ask him if he will reconsider his position and return.  We should support and congratulate a person who is doing a good job.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and the rest of the Members of the House a happy Christmas on this final sitting morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add a few words to concentrate the minds on what happened last night.  I gather that the Labour Party spokesman on finance has asked for a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on Monday to question the Financial Regulator and maybe others.  This House should support that call, even though it is for Monday.  Senator Healy Eames touched upon this point.  What is happening here is a complete and utter collapse of regulation in this country.  It is not just an isolated incident.  What the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank was doing has been going on for eight years.  It did not just happen yesterday.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole touched on it when he asked what were the auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, doing.  Had they not issued a warning about this and, if they did, was it ignored?  It is not just the auditors who are involved in this, it is the loan committees, the audit committees, the board and everybody else.</P><Col N="171"/>
        <P>A serious question must be asked of our old friend, the Financial Regulator.  It is absolutely plain that the Financial Regulator knew about this matter much earlier this year.  It appears that he knew about it in January, and it is now December.  What has the Financial Regulator been doing?  The only reason this has emerged now is that the &euro;87 million in loans must appear in the accounts to be published in the next few days.  Credit is due to the Minister for Finance that it has emerged because the chairman and some other people from Anglo Irish Bank met him on Tuesday and this issue arose then.  If that had not happened, we would not have known about this at all and it would probably go on for many more years.</P>
        <P>Financial regulation in this country is a joke.  The Financial Regulator is ultimately responsible for that.  The Financial Regulator has known about this since January and apparently has done absolutely nothing to insist&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.  The time is just up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that those responsible for it took the rap.  We have a very serious situation which many Members of this House are very happy to ignore because the appalling vista of removing the Financial Regulator, which is necessary, is one that people are not prepared to tackle in the present circumstances.  It is essential and we should do it.  We should debate it and support the Labour Party&rsquo;s call for the Financial Regulator to come in and answer questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the situation in the banking sector, how have we allowed it to go so far?  Senator Ross made a very eloquent point in this regard.  I do not blame the regulator on his own.  Where was the governance in the banking fraternity?  Where was the sense of trust?  It was breached.  This emanated from Government due to a lack of leadership.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As a representative of the Government, the Leader is presiding over a five-week break in the House.  I am not playing politics.  There are real concerns about three issues, namely, the banks, unemployment and general living conditions among ordinary people.  The fourth issue, which was the subject of the committee chaired by Senator Donohoe, is the Lisbon treaty.  We adjourned yesterday at 2 o&rsquo;clock.  We could have started our deliberations on the Finance Bill, had the Minister for Education and Science in the House or had a discussion on the Lisbon treaty, but we did not.

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning when listening to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; I was outraged to hear that Mr. FitzPatrick of Anglo Irish Bank had been taking a salary of &euro;430,000 and that he had lent &euro;87 million to his directors and to other banks.  He was secretly moving it around from director to director.  We discussed the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the House the other day, and as spokesperson on social welfare I appealed to the Minister to raise the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week.  This Government has bailed out the banks and this carry-on has been accepted.  That is the bottom line.  We are accepting this sort of carry-on.  I am not, but the Members opposite, in Government, are, by turning a blind eye.  It was a coincidence that the chief executive resigned last night after the D&aacute;il broke up.  Is that not interesting?  The Minister for Finance refused&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are representing the honest, poor taxpayer.  The ESRI has said that 10% of our people will be unemployed next year.  What are we doing?  We are breaking up now, as Senator Buttimer said, for five weeks to go away and forget about the whole thing.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said he realised only in July what was coming down the tracks, even though the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was previously the Minister for Finance.  What is going on?  What are we doing?</P>

	<P>I join with Senator Alex White in mentioning the sad passing of Conor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien.  The former Deputy and Member was a very strong-minded man and made an immense contribution in his time.  He was a central figure in Irish society for much of the last 75 years.  I pass on our condolences to his wife M&aacute;ire and his family.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Coghlan, Hanafin, Norris, Walsh, Healy Eames, Ross, Buttimer and McFadden expressed their shock and horror on matters pertaining to the banking sector, its governance and regulation, the role of the Financial Regulator, and the news that has been divulged in the past 24 hours.  I have no difficulty in having time left aside for a special debate.  I will propose to the House today to adjourn <i>sine die</i>, but I will review the situation on a day-to-day basis if required.  As we know, the regulator has an extremely difficult job.  The task on hand now, especially in view of the possibility that taxpayers&rsquo; money is involved, is extremely onerous.  I have no difficulty in convening the House at short notice to support the strengthening of regulation, as the Minister may request us to do from time to time.  I note the views of the Senators, particularly those who have experience in the area of financial services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance is waiting to come into the House so I do not intend to take up any more time on the Order of Business.  I have noted the various points made about the ESRI.  The Taoiseach and Ministers launched a framework document yesterday inviting everyone to <Col N="173"/>participate.  Those of us who were heavily involved for many years in the area of enterprise, trade and employment know that the smart economy framework proposal encompasses high value research-intensive multinational activity.  We know the importance of the contributions that Google and Microsoft have made to the world.  All these new initiatives may inspire new Irish innovators in creating high value jobs.  That is the direction in which we need to go.  I compliment everyone concerned &mdash; the Ministers and the Taoiseach &mdash; on developing a plan for fighting back when the American economy starts to recover.  That is sensible and wise.  With regard to the request made by Senator Norris, I am endeavouring to obtain the responses he asked for, and I will relay them to the Senator directly from the Minister&rsquo;s office as soon as I receive them.</P>
        <P>As this is the final day, I wish everybody a happy Christmas, including the Cathaoirleach, his staff, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the very efficient Clerk of the House, Deirdre Lane, her Clerk Assistant, Jody Blake, and all the staff of the Houses who have assisted us during the year.  I thank the Captain of the Guard, Comdt. John Flaherty, who has been helpful to us every sitting day, his staff, the Superintendent, the ushers, and all the ladies who help keep the House to the standard it is.  I also thank the staff of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; for all the exposure they give our proceedings, and we must not forget Jimmy Walsh in <i>The Irish Times</i> for his accounts of the proceedings in the House.  I thank the leaders of the groups and the Whips for their great work and assistance throughout the session, the Deputy Leader for the assistance he has given me, all the Members of the House and their families, and everyone who helps us from time to time.  I wish all these people a happy and holy Christmas and look forward to working with them in 2009.</P>

    <Title>Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008 (Certified Money Bill): Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that Seanad &Eacute;ireann has set aside this day to debate the Finance Bill and I look forward to hearing the views of Senators.  The Bill before us has been framed in the context of the most difficult economic and fiscal climate in a generation.</P>
        <P>The speed and depth of the economic downturn has surprised even the most pessimistic of the commentators.  It is important to remember that despite the gloomy short-term outlook, our economy retains the structural achievements of the past decade.  We still have in excess of 500,000 more people at work than ten years ago.  Our export levels are much higher than in 1998 and the living standards of ordinary workers have risen substantially.  We also have one of the lowest public debt levels in the EU and a low tax regime for both business and individual income earners.  In public debate, we are inclined to focus on the contraction in the housing cycle as the source of our difficulties.  It is true that it has contributed to our economic difficulties, but these difficulties now have been compounded by an international factor, namely, the lack of confidence and distrust in world financial markets.  Concerning the Irish banking system, I am determined to ensure the financial stability of all our institutions.  The Government stands behind these institutions and all capitalisation arrangements will be completed in the shortest possible time.</P>
        <P>Our main economic focus must be the restoration of cost competitiveness so that we will be able to take advantage quickly of any emerging global recovery.  The first prerequisite for this is the restoration of credibility and sustainability to the public finances.  Accordingly, the budget set out a medium-term strategy to ensure this by, <i>inter alia</i>, reducing and prioritising public expenditure and adjusting taxation levels to take account of the reversals in economic growth.  This responsible approach underscores and maintains Ireland&rsquo;s well-earned international reputation as a good place to do business.  This approach is also taken in the framework for sustainable economic renewal, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy, published yesterday.  The Finance Bill makes a significant start in implementing this strategy by providing targeted support to enterprise and economic activity.</P>
        <P>One key measure in the Bill to bring the public finances back into order is the income levy.  As Members will be aware, this will now apply at a rate of 1% to gross income up to &euro;100,100, at a rate of 2% to the next &euro;150,020, and 3% on the remainder.  The tiered rates ensure that the levy, as currently structured, is highly progressive and bears least, if at all, on the most vulnerable sectors.  For example, the Bill provides an exemption threshold of &euro;18,304 per annum to exclude those on low incomes, all social welfare and similar type payments are <Col N="175"/>excluded from the levy, and those with an entitlement to the medical card will also be exempt from the income levy.  The Bill protects the vulnerable and the elderly while those best able to pay, pay the most.  Those paying at the top rate of 3% will contribute 20% of the total take from the levy.</P>
        <P>In the case of income tax, the standard rate bands will increase by &euro;1,000 from &euro;35,400 to &euro;36,400 for single individuals, from &euro;44,400 to &euro;45,400 for a married one-earner couple and an increase of &euro;2,000 from &euro;70,800 to &euro;72,800 for a married two-earner couple.  This measure will help to cushion the effect of the income levy on middle-income earners.</P>
        <P>There is also provision for an increase in the rate of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers from 20% to 25% in years one and two and from 20% to 22.5% in years three, four and five.  While the measure also provides for a reduction in the rate of mortgage interest relief for non-first-time buyers from 20% to 15%, it is broadly revenue neutral.  This rebalancing makes for a fairer system and helps those buyers with the biggest financial exposure and those facing falling property values.</P>
        <P>The Bill confirms the budget increases in excise duties and it provides for an increase in betting duty from 1% to 2% from 1 May 2009.  It allows deducibility for betting duty in computing the amount of profits or losses of a bookmaking business for income tax or corporation tax purposes.</P>
        <P>New arrangements for the VAT treatment of tour operators and travel agents are also contained in the Bill.  A margin scheme for tour operators and a measure making travel agents liable to VAT on their commission is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2010.  Most EU member states operate a margin scheme for tour operators whereby they are taxed on the profit margin realised on the supply of a domestic or EU travel package.</P>
        <P>To support the sale of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> efficient cars a partial removal of the block on VAT deductibility in respect of business cars is being introduced.  This will allow a business to deduct 20% of the VAT incurred in respect of a car, purchased or leased for business purposes, which is first registered for VRT on or after 1 January 2009 and has CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of less than 156g/km, that is a car that falls within CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission bands A, B and C.</P>
        <P>Owing to the worsening budgetary position, we faced difficult choices but in making those choices and in subsequent constructive debate, we made every effort to protect the truly vulnerable. To take one example, despite the economic circumstances, we increased the State pension by &euro;7 per week and all working age payments by &euro;6.50 per week.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to maintaining a pro-business and pro-employment environment and this is reflected in the framework for economic renewal.  The Bill delivers a number of significant pro-enterprise measures.  These include improvements to the research and development tax credit regime that make it one of the most attractive in the world and provisions to support small start-up companies, along with the reintroduction of the remittance basis of tax so that we can attract in scarce skills to our economy.  It will incentivise to help provide venture capital for start-up companies involved in innovation.</P>
        <P>The Government has long supported research and development as the fundamental key to a successful knowledge-based economy.  The Bill increases research and development tax credit by 5% and provides other measures of benefit to business, in particular small companies and those in the start-up and expansion phase.  These include an option to carry back unused tax credits for set-off against the previous year&rsquo;s corporate tax liability, thus generating a tax repayment.  There is also a further option, where there is insufficient or no corporation tax liability in the previous year, to claim payment of the remaining unused credit which will be paid in instalments over a three-year period.  The base year, 2003, will be permanently set as the base year for calculating incremental research and development expenditure under the scheme.  Over <Col N="176"/>time, this will have the effect of turning the scheme into a volume-based scheme.  The Bill also provides that a tax credit will be available in respect of a proportion of the expenditure incurred on a new or refurbished building used in part for research and development activities.  This change reflects the reality that research and development takes place in manufacturing or production environments and not only in laboratory conditions.  These combined changes make our research and development regime one of the most attractive in the world.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Bill also provides for a three-year exemption from corporation tax on trading profits and chargeable gains for new companies commencing trade in 2009.  Full relief applies where corporation tax liability in any of the first three accounting periods does not exceed &euro;40,000.  Marginal relief will apply where the corporation tax liability is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000.  Furthermore, the Bill legislates for the tax treatment of restricted share awards.  Such share awards have traditionally been dealt with on an administrative basis by the Revenue Commissioners.  Restricted shares are often awarded by companies that are in start-up and expansion stages, as part of an overall remuneration package when access to capital may be limited.  They are particularly important for small businesses in the current economic climate as a performance incentive and employee retention mechanism.  Restricted share awards are also beneficial to the employee as the income tax charge due on the value of the shares awarded is reduced progressively, depending on the period of the restrictions.</P>
        <P>At international level, double taxation agreements have been concluded with Turkey, Malta, Vietnam, Macedonia and Georgia.  These agreements significantly improve our bilateral trading and investment opportunities in the countries concerned.  Ratification of these agreements can take time because of lengthy parliamentary procedures in the other countries so I am providing for the recognition of payments to and from these countries for preferential tax treatment as soon as the agreements are signed.  This will accelerate reliefs to relevant businesses in the area of dividends, interest and capital gains tax.</P>
        <P>The Bill amends Revenue&rsquo;s civil penalties regime across all taxes and duties except customs so as to ensure its compatibility with the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It provides that tax and duty penalties will not be imposed against the wishes of a taxpayer unless a court has determined that the penalty is due.  The Bill also places on a statutory basis the current practice of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the level of tax-geared penalties sought in settlements arising out of Revenue audits and investigations.  In addition, a number of fixed penalties are updated and standardised and the amounts of such penalties are accordingly increased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill runs to 102 sections and six Schedules and is structured by tax headings.  In the time available to me, I will recall some of the main provisions in sequence.  Section 2 describes the income levy.  I have described the percentages that apply to the relevant limits.  All social welfare payments will be excluded from the levy, as will similar type payments made by Departments and agencies other than the Department of Social and Family Affairs, in addition to similar payments from other states.  Those with an entitlement to the medical card will also be exempt from the income levy and an exemption threshold of &euro;18,304 per annum excludes those on low incomes from the levy.  An age-related exemption threshold of &euro;20,000 per annum applies for persons aged 65 years and over.  Where the age-related or general thresholds are exceeded the levy will be payable on all income.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for a parking levy, which is to apply where an employer provides car parking facilities for employees.  The levy will apply where an employee has an entitlement to use a parking space and such space is provided directly or indirectly by his or her employer.  It will not apply to disabled drivers or to employees of the emergency services in the context of <Col N="177"/>responding to an emergency position.  The charge for a full year will be &euro;200 where an employee has an ongoing entitlement to use a parking space.  Where parking spaces are shared by employees, the levy is reduced to &euro;100 where the ratio of the number of employees to the number of parking spaces is two to one or more.  Section 4 provides for an increase in the standard rate bands.</P>
        <P>Continuing the work commenced earlier this year, section 6 will provide for a new CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> based system of calculation of benefit-in-kind in respect of company cars provided for employees.  The new system is structured on the seven bands adopted for vehicle registration tax.  Cars in the three lowest bands of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions remain at the current level of benefit-in-kind charge and higher charges apply for vehicles with higher emission levels.  Existing vehicles retain the current method of calculation of benefit-in-kind.</P>
        <P>As regards health expenses relief, section 8 provides that the relief will be granted at the standard rate only from 1 January 2009, with the exception of nursing home expenses which will continue to be allowed at a the marginal rate.  In providing tax relief, we must ensure as far as possible that it is targeted on those who need it most.  Section 14 provides for an increase in the rate of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers, refocusing the relief on those buyers with the biggest financial exposure and facing falling property values.</P>
        <P>The so-called Cinderella rule is changed by section 15.  Hitherto, presence in the State during a day did not count in determining residence for tax purposes where the individual leaves before midnight.  In future, a presence in the State at any time during a day will be counted for determining residency, so the midnight flit will no longer facilitate tax avoidance.</P>
        <P>As regards pensions, section 16 provides that the annual earnings limit for determining maximum tax-relievable contributions for pension purposes is being set at &euro;150,000 for 2009 as compared with the 2008 limit of &euro;275,239.  It also amends the formula for determining this limit and the standard and personal fund thresholds to provide the Minister for Finance with discretion as to whether those thresholds should be indexed.</P>
        <P>In the area of farming, section 17 extends the farm pollution control relief to 31 December 2010.  This relief will continue to encourage farmers to make the necessary and sometimes costly investments in pollution control measures while section 18 renews the 25% general farming stock relief and the special 100% stock relief for the same period.</P>
        <P>A scheme to facilitate the removal and relocation of certain facilities where potentially dangerous activities are undertaken is introduced by section 21.  Such industrial facilities can hinder the residential and commercial regeneration of docklands in urban brownfield areas.  The scheme arises from the EU Seveso Directive, which seeks to protect public safety near locations where potentially dangerous activities are undertaken.  The relief, given by way of accelerated capital allowances and additional relocation allowances, covers the removal costs of the industrial facilities and the cost of building the relocated facilities, including land purchase costs.  Costs are limited to the net costs of the removal and relocation.</P>
        <P>The rates of tax that apply for DIRT and other investment products are increased by sections 26 and 27.  Section 28 increases the amounts eligible for tax relief for investment in films and makes our fiscal incentive for film making one of the most attractive around for prospective investors.</P>
        <P>To support new companies, section 31 introduces the three-year tax exemption for new start-up companies that commence trading next year.  In support of business, section 33 provides for the recognition of payments to and from countries where double taxation agreements have been signed, for preferential treatment, rather than awaiting the completion of the ratification process.  Sections 34, 35 and 36 deal with various amendments to the provisions relating to the research and development tax credit, the main elements of which I have outlined.</P><Col N="178"/>
        <P>Building on the initiatives in the Finance Act 2008, section 37 extends from three to seven the categories of energy-efficient equipment included in the scheme of accelerated capital allowances for energy-efficient equipment.  The scheme provides for 100% capital allowances in the year of purchase on expenditure incurred by companies on qualifying equipment bought for the purposes of the trade.  The new categories included in this scheme are information and communications technology; heating and electricity provision, process and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, HVAC, control systems and electric and alternative fuel vehicles.</P>
        <P>All sectors must make a contribution to stabilising our public finances.  Accordingly, section 38 provides for revised arrangements for the payment of preliminary tax by large companies with a tax liability of more than &euro;200,000 in their previous accounting period.  It also revises the dates for payment of capital gains tax on asset disposals by individuals, thereby giving effect to the two measures announced in the Budget Statement.  The section provides for payment of preliminary tax by large companies in two instalments, the details of which are set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  Regarding capital gains tax, the payment date for disposals made in the period 1 January to 30 November of a year of assessment will be 15 December, while the payment date for disposals made in December will be the following 31 January.  The revised payment dates apply to disposals made in 2009 and subsequent years.</P>
        <P>To ensure consistency with the EC treaty, section 42 amends the existing provision that provides that any gain arising from the disposal of assets situated outside the State and the United Kingdom to a person who is resident or ordinarily resident but not domiciled in the State is based on the actual amount received in the State, that is, in accordance with the remittance basis of taxation.</P>
        <P>Section 44 increases the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 22%, in respect of disposals made on or after 15 October 2008.  Excise duties are dealt with in sections 46 to 66, inclusive.  These sections set out a range of changes in regard to excise duties, including confirming the budget day increases in excise on tobacco, wine and petrol; the introduction of a lower rate of excise duty for low alcohol beer and cider; and increases in excise duty payable in respect of licences, other than pub licences, permitting the sale of alcohol.</P>
        <P>The provision to increase betting duty from 1 % to 2% from 1 May 2009 is set out in section 53, as is the provision to allow deductibility for betting duty in computing the amount of profits or losses of a bookmaking business for income tax or corporation tax purposes.  The introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009 is provided for in section 55.  The general rate applying will be &euro;10 per passenger, with a lower rate of &euro;2 for shorter air journeys.  I have taken account of concerns raised by the regional airports, particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of &euro;2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300 km or less from Dublin Airport.  This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the &euro;2 rate.</P>
        <P>To address ongoing concerns about both road safety and VRT evasion, section 61 provides for the introduction in respect of VRT of a pre-registration test for vehicles, including used imported vehicles, being brought into the State while section 64 provides for the setting up of a temporary registration system for non-Irish registered vehicles being brought into the State for a period of more than 42 days.</P>
        <P>In addition, provision is being made for the introduction of estimated excise assessments in cases where excise duty, including VRT, has not been paid, extending more specifically the principle of unjust enrichment to VRT, and for changes to the VRT relief scheme for short-term car-hire including phasing out the scheme over a period of two years by October 2011.</P><Col N="179"/>
        <P>VAT is dealt with in sections 67 to 77, inclusive.  These sections set out a range of changes in regard to VAT including, as announced in the budget, the increase in the standard VAT rate by 0.5% to 21.5% with effect from 1 December 2008.  This increase applies to all goods and services which were subject to VAT at 21%.  The other VAT rates are unaffected.</P>
        <P>Section 79 amends several sections of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to allow for the introduction of the e-stamping of instruments for stamp duty purposes.  To facilitate the introduction of e-stamping, section 81 provides an incentive to encourage the presentation to Revenue of instruments executed before the enactment of the Bill and in respect of which the stamp duty chargeable has not been paid within the prescribed period of 30 days.  Provided such instruments are presented to Revenue for stamping within eight weeks of the passing of the Act together with the full stamp duty and appropriate interest, a penalty will not be applied to such instruments.  This measure is intended to facilitate a smooth transition to e-stamping.</P>
        <P>Section 82 repeals section 110 of the Finance Act 2007 from the enactment of the Bill and reinstates it again with the same charging provisions but subject to certain exemptions being made to those charging provisions.  These exemptions relate to certain transactions involving public private partnership arrangements and certain incentive schemes for capital allowances purposes.  The section is subject to a commencement order being made and it is my intention to commence the provisions early next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 86 amends Part 9 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to confirm the new reduced charges, already announced in the budget, for ATM, debit and combined ATM debit cards.  The new rate on ATM cards will be &euro;2.50, on debit cards &euro;2.50 also and on combined cards &euro;5.00.  The reduced charges for ATM, debit and combined cards take effect for the year ending 31 December 2008.</P>
        <P>Among other things, the reduction in the top rate of stamp duty for non-residential property from 9% to 6% is dealt with in section 87.  The purpose here is to stimulate business and commercial activity and hence employment.  Section 90 increases the rate of tax on gifts and inheritances from 20% to 22%.</P>
        <P>The tax reliefs in respect of the donation of heritage items to approved State institutions and the donation of heritage property to the Irish Heritage Trust are amended by section 94 to 80% of the market value of the items and property donated, respectively.  The ceiling on the aggregate value of donations qualifying for each of these schemes in any one year will remain at &euro;6 million.  This measure will ensure that the State achieves value for money and that there is a greater philanthropic element in the schemes.</P>
        <P>To further facilitate business, section 96 and Schedule 3 give effect to the budget day announcement of an extension to return filing and payment deadlines where returns and payments are made electronically via the Revenue Online Service.  A number of amendments are being made to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and to the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 to extend and align the existing deadlines for corporation tax, relevant contracts tax and value-added tax.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2009, where returns and payments are made electronically the return filing and payment deadlines for these taxes will be the 23rd of a month.  This has the effect of extending the existing filing and payment deadlines by two days for corporation tax, four days for VAT and nine days for relevant contracts tax.  A similar extension to the 23rd of a month is also being made for PAYE and PRSI by way of an amendment to the PAYE regulations.</P>
        <P>Likewise, section 97 and Schedule 4 streamline and simplify the provisions in various Acts relating to the collection and recovery of taxes and duties, except customs, and replaces them with an integrated collection and recovery regime across the various tax heads.</P><Col N="180"/>
        <P>I hope Seanad &Eacute;ireann has benefited from this explanation of some of the measures in the Bill.  The measures it contains strike a balance between the need to protect those on low incomes, the need to restore order to our public finances and providing targeted incentives to facilitate economic recovery.  In this latter regard, the Bill also contains a number of measures to promote enterprise and business in this country so that we can return as early as possible to the path of growth.</P>
        <P>A finance Bill is necessarily of a highly technical character and contains a diverse range of provisions in regard to the rates of tax, the collection of taxes and the administration of the tax system.  The Finance Bill is part of a wider philosophy and direction which the Government is taking on our national economy.  It is essential that we recognise the fact that our public finances are out of order and that the fall in tax receipts means our anticipated revenue is back to 2005 levels.  Expenditure adjustments are and will be required to deal with this position.</P>
        <P>Last July, I brought forward a package of measures which has been implemented in full since.  The savings secured on that occasion have benefited the Exchequer position.  We brought forward the budget to October, and I have been much criticised for doing so.  However, it served the need to bring to public attention the difficulties which exist in the public finances.  Naturally, the public expressed their views on this and that is legitimate and correct in a democratic society.  However, we as a Government have to give leadership and make the necessary adjustments that are required to protect our economy.</P>
        <P>Likewise, with the further deterioration that has occurred since budget day we will take the necessary measures in January after consultation with the social partners.  We are determined to lead but we want to lead with the social partners working with us so that we can put this country in a position to benefit from an upswing in the world economy.</P>
        <P>The budget contains an increase in taxation and I have heard calls for further additional increases in taxation rather than an adjustment of expenditure to tackle our problems.  The amount of the tax increase in the budget is the most the economy can sustain in the year ahead.  We must protect jobs.  The decline in the tax receipts has been most marked in those areas where there is a discretionary element on the part of the purchaser of an item, be it a house, motor car, goods, services, cigarettes, tobacco or alcohol.</P>
        <P>The declines in all of these areas are caused by the fact that consumer sentiment is weak and purchasers are not buying goods, services or houses or disposing of them.  Given this circumstance the only effective way of increasing taxation is through the method of income taxation and this is why the levy is contained in the budget.  However, I believe the levy is as far as we can go next year because further increased taxation on labour would result in further joblessness and we must recognise this.</P>
        <P>With regard to the general philosophy of the budget, it is important that we send a clear message in the Finance Bill that we continue to incentivise business to come here and invest and create jobs.  This is why the Bill contains a range of measures such as the research and development credit, the restoration of the remittance basis for certain restricted categories of employees in international companies, interest in venture capital being invested in research and development and other associated provisions.  All of these measures are contained in the Bill to ensure Ireland remains as one of the most attractive places in the world in which to invest and create jobs.  It is noticeable in the midst of this recession that those enterprises we have attracted here are proving durable.  Many of them contribute an enormous amount to our economy and it is important that as well as addressing our cost competitiveness and ensuring we are competitive ourselves in selling goods and services to other countries that we sustain confidence in the inward investment sector in Ireland.</P><Col N="181"/>
        <P>I thank Senators for arranging to debate this Bill today.  I appreciate the fact that a day has been set aside and I will attempt to hear as many Senators as I can and conclude the debate.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  When we discuss such a serious issue as our economy we need to be far more straightforward in what we state to the Irish people.  The public finances have gone rapidly from boom to bust and we need to restore order to them.</P>
        <P>The first thing that someone of the Minister&rsquo;s calibre should do, if he is taking the issue seriously, is to stop playing a charade with the social partners with regard to a 6% pay increase.  Playing a charade that the 6% pay increase may still be paid gives the impression to the general public that the people in Dublin Castle are completely disconnected from, and not paying attention to, what is happening.  On one level, that makes the Minister appear incompetent but, on another, it appears he is out of touch with what is happening.</P>
        <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the financial tsunami that will hit this country next year in regard to the economy and we should be talking about the crisis in those terms.  We should not spook people too much but leave them in no doubt about what is facing us next year.</P>
        <P>When people compare what happened in Dublin Castle yesterday when the Minister announced the framework policy document with the stark results in the ESRI report in terms of what will happen next year, it makes them believe the Minister is disconnected.  The ESRI has indicated that by the time these Houses sit again at the end of January there will be thousands of people on the live register and the economy will be showing signs of entering an even more serious recession than the one we know we are in now.  We need to talk seriously about what is going on.</P>
        <P>The social partners, whether it is Jack O&rsquo;Connor, David Begg or Tom Parlon, are all the same in the sense that they represent vested interests.  The Minister&rsquo;s role is to represent the public and it might not be wise of him to refer frequently to the social partners in terms of every decision he is making.  They are part of that process but the most important part of it is what the Minister is supposed to do, which is represent the general public.  The Minister should be talking about the reforms he is prepared to make in the public service next year and in subsequent years and point out to the people in a genuine way the differences he would like to see happen, not in broad terms but in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have highlighted in this House the difference between the way the National Health Service operates in Northern Ireland and the way the Health Service Executive runs in the Republic of Ireland.  The NHS spends approximately &pound;2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United Kingdom.  We are spending &euro;3,000 for every man, woman and child in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The NHS pushed for the provision of colonoscopies to diagnose bowel cancer within six weeks and they have achieved that target.  From working as a general practitioner, I am aware one would not get a colonoscopy in this country within six months.</P>
        <P>Hospital consultants in Northern Ireland are paid significantly less than &euro;100,000 for all grades, yet we are talking about giving academic grade consultants here &euro;300,000.  I am using those figures because it helps to highlight the contrast when people talk about competitiveness, transparency and reform of the public sector.  The NHS is able to provide much more in terms of services to its citizens than the HSE can provide to its citizens here.  In other words, the NHS is getting more for less but we are getting less for more.  That is the problem we have failed to deal with, but I do not hear that from the social partners or from Government.</P><Col N="182"/>
        <P>We must stop the charade about a 6% pay cut.  It should be off the table.  We will not talk about pay cuts yet &mdash; the ESRI took a hard line on that &mdash; but we must talk about serious reforms not just in the health care sector but throughout the public sector.  That is what we need.  We must begin talking as if we believe in something.</P>
        <P>The Minister was in Dublin Castle yesterday, but he should stay out of Dublin Castle, especially as we are coming up to the 90th anniversary of the first D&aacute;il, because it never had a good name for the people of Ireland.  Everything should be brought back to the Oireachtas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We might win over the people of Ireland and they will stop referring to him as the Castle&rsquo;s man.  </P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s announcement yesterday, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy &mdash; A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, has been dismissed to some degree as aspirational.  The innovation fund was probably the only new aspect about which he spoke.  One aspect that makes the people and ourselves cynical about all of this is the greening of the Irish economy and the provision of &euro;30 billion over ten years.  In the Lower House the Minister, replying to Labour&rsquo;s Deputy Burton, stated: &ldquo;Deputy Burton may think &euro;3 billion can be loosely thrown around the street like that and turned into dead money in the hands of shareholders ...&rdquo;  He was referring to capitalising the Irish banks because of the other crisis currently in the banking sector.  How will we spend &euro;3 billion on the greening of the Irish economy if the Minister is clearly stating that he will not waste &euro;3 billion on nationalising the Irish banks?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the banks, the Minister must come out stronger on that issue.  We must be more clear on that area.  Almost 11 weeks to the day we spoke about giving every depositor in the country a guarantee to the tune of &euro;400 billion.  I stated that we should ensure we spend no more than &euro;10 billion on recapitalising the banks.  The Minister said he did not envisage having to expend &euro;10 billion on nationalising the Irish banks but now we are talking about putting in that money &mdash; it was clear there was a need to put that amount in at that time.  I know the Minister has had all the audit reports since and because he is the Minister he has to say that he must get all that information first, but there is a need for him to make some definitive statements.</P>
        <P>In the House this morning we called for the Houses of the Oireachtas to come back earlier in January because there is a need to keep the Irish people up to date, and it is best to do that within these two Houses.  The Minister attacked me on a previous occasion when I made the same comment about Lisbon.  We must have those debates in this House, not in Dublin Castle.  I am worried about the Minister becoming a Castle man.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no danger of that, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Those debates should be held in these Houses.  The Houses should return earlier than the end of January because that is what the public expect of us.  They do not want us to have a show case day in the Mansion House.  They want us to show the real leadership they are looking for now to deal with the domestic crisis in the public finances, the economic crisis which is caused by outside influences and the banking crisis, which has the potential to worsen.  They want us to start making those changes to show that we are in touch with their concerns.</P>
        <P>One of my fears is that if Ministers are seen to be out of touch there will be a sense that the entire political establishment is out of touch and that makes it more difficult to win over the <Col N="183"/>people to our arguments.  Many people do not see much difference between Opposition and Government.  They see us all as politicians who are out of touch.</P>
        <P>The Minister should examine how the measures in the Finance Bill affect him because people like to see how it affects us.  I spoke in this Chamber about us paying ourselves a 2.5% increase in September, and there is talk of another 6% increase next August while at the same time we are taking away universal entitlement for those aged over 70, refusing to vaccinate young girls of 12 years of age against a form of cancer and making savage cuts in education.  In some respects, some of the measures in this budget are a betrayal of older people.</P>
        <P>The Minister should ask himself how these measures affect him.  The Minister is quite privileged.  He is very well paid.  He has a Government car but the benefit in kind in terms of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions does not apply to him.  The Minister will say it is a Garda car but he should consider how these measures would affect him to show that he is in touch with the ordinary man and woman in the street.  Ministers who live outside Dublin get significant allowances on second homes yet when it comes to everybody else the Minister regards that as something he must tax.  We have very generous pensions, yet we are not doing much to help out people in that regard, although I appreciate people can now postpone buying their annuities</P>
        <P>It is because of those issues that the hair cut of the Minister, Deputy Harney, being paid by F&Aacute;S upset people so much.  They see us as being very privileged.  We have many benefits which we refuse to give up, yet we are asking the people to do that.  We are taxing them also, yet the Minister would not pay for a hair cut out of her own salary.  That should be taken on board in these difficult times.  The flaithi&uacute;lach good days of being a F&Aacute;S executive are gone.  The Minister should start connecting with ordinary people in his approach to the budget and its effect on them.  I hope to be able later to discuss other issues, such as health expenses and changes to the VHI.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will take on board some of my opening remarks.  We have not yet dealt with the issues of competitiveness and public sector reform.  The contrast I mentioned between the NHS in the North and the HSE in the South shows how disconnected we are from the reality of being an open small economy and how it affects us.  That is driving up salaries, which is why we have lost our competitiveness.  Public sector reform has failed dramatically in recent years and it is having a detrimental effect on efforts to restore order to the public finances and in the provision of services through the civil and public service.  A proper and honest debate is required on this issue.  It is not a political attack on anybody but the reality of people&rsquo;s view on the matter.  We must focus on that issue in the next year and be sensible about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In supporting the Finance Bill, I am conscious that this was probably the most difficult climate, in terms of instability, a Minister for Finance has found himself in when framing a budget since the foundation of the State.  Certainly the 1930s were more difficult but the uncertainty of the current situation is totally outside our country&rsquo;s control.</P>
        <P>The price of property in Ireland was too high, but prior to recent external events there is no doubt the property market was heading for a soft landing.  With the economy powering along as it was, against all the odds, we would have got through the slump quite rapidly.  However, the failure internationally in national regulation of the banks and what were eventually found to be illegal practices, which nearly brought down the financial system, created a thunderstorm in the financial world.  A total of $1 trillion in sub-prime loans were created in America, repackaged and re-sold.  The finance from the repackaged and re-sold mortgages was used to sell more sub-prime mortgages.  The name &ldquo;sub-prime mortgages&rdquo; is a misnomer as they were not prudent lending.  In fact, what happened will probably go down in history as one of the great scandals, like the South Sea Bubble or the tulip crisis in the 1600s in Amsterdam.</P><Col N="184"/>
        <P>There is no doubt we are now faced with one of the biggest bubbles in financial history.  The financial mis-selling brought down banks and almost brought down governments.  The Minister found himself in the most extraordinary circumstances.  Yet he balanced the budget in many difficult ways.  He ensured there was sufficient funding in the economy so the construction industry could continue.  Money is being spent to assist our competitiveness, whether that is in roads, railways or other infrastructure.  Most importantly, the Minister looked after the less well off.  I commend him on that.</P>
        <P>He also examined the opportunities for the future and provided incentives for business.  He got rid of some of the abuses in the system, such as where exceptionally wealthy people acted in their own and not the national interest by staying abroad so they would not have to pay tax on vast amounts of money earned in this country.  The Minister closed that loophole.  It was fortunate when the financial tsunami struck that this country had low taxation, a reserve fund and the lowest debt of any major economy in western Europe.  In other words, despite what has been said, the economy was exceptionally well managed.  We are in a good position to deal with the crisis as it unfolds.</P>
        <P>In the future it might be necessary to consider pay freezes rather than pay increases.  A group I wish to particularly commend this morning is the group of workers in Dublin Airport, and Jack O&rsquo;Connor and SIPTU, who are well known for protecting the rights of the worker.  They accepted, on behalf of the workers, a pay cut of 10% to preserve their jobs.  That is a practical move in the current climate.  It does not mean the unions are rowing back or retrenching in the advance in workers&rsquo; rights and terms and conditions of employment, but that there is a practical application whereby it is better to have a job with 10% less pay than no job at all in the current climate.  This is an issue we should examine.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to workers&rsquo; co-operatives.  If a business is pulling out of Ireland because it can secure a lower cost base in Morocco, why not establish a workers&rsquo; co-operative in that business?  Let us face facts.  This State was founded by men who had no experience of running a state.  Did the Cosgrave and de Valera Administrations not do a fine job?  We have made much progress since the 1920s.  If any group has proven there is no merit in the concept that only certain people are capable of managing, it is Lehman Brothers and their belief that they were masters of the universe.  They nearly destroyed the financial universe.</P>
        <P>There is hope for the future.  There are low oil prices &mdash; a barrel of oil was $36 this morning &mdash; and low interest rates.  In fact, interest rates are almost nil.  We also have low inflation.  Best of all, we have low expectations, which means we can get on with starting to rebuild.  The Government started that in Dublin Castle yesterday in announcing the incentives for research and development and investing again in the future of Ireland.  There are wonderful opportunities at present in nanotechnology and biotechnology.  In the depths of the depression in the 1930s, certain businesses powered ahead, such as the automotive and electronics industries.  They were the new industries at the time.  The new industries today will derive from adult stem cells.  The debate on that issue has been well won because everybody knows that in 30 years there has not been one clinical application of embryonic stem cells.  The application simply does not work.  However, there are currently 70 to 80 applications for adult stem cells.  We have an opportunity to make this country an ethical centre for development in the world.  I hope we grasp that opportunity.</P>
        <P>The challenges faced in the budget were well met.  It is unfortunate that our colleagues in the North do not have the opportunity to merge the tax rates.  At present people are streaming into the North to buy goods and services.  It is difficult for people to seek an increase in public <Col N="185"/>services if they are spending their money where the VAT and other revenue go to a different jurisdiction.  This is an ideal opportunity to examine harmonising VAT rates and excise duties with the North.  As an island nation it is difficult for somebody to bring petrol in from Scotland or the UK without being noticed but it is easy to move it across the Border.  The abuse must be tackled.  There are good reasons for examining harmonising the tax rates.</P>
        <P>The economic situation is fluid.  We will experience more shocks that are not of our making.  In fairness, however, no bank in this country has been lost.  Consider the situation in America where AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns and so forth are gone.  Northern Rock, Alliance and Leicester, HBOS, Lloyds and other banks in the UK have had to change their ways of operating.  The Minister, by taking strong and immediate action, ensured that our economy was seen as solid and stable.  It will be ready for the upturn.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the quick management of the pork crisis, which was vital for this important industry.  If we sell computers worth &euro;1 billion, only &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million stays in the country whereas the full value of &euro;1 billion worth of meat products sold stays in the country, thus creating more jobs.  In addition, software, research and development and royalties do not flow abroad.  The handling of the crisis ensured Ireland will again be regarded as a guarantor of good quality, clean and green foodstuffs.  This is essential for the economy.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the difficulties caused by the current value of sterling.  We have, in our Central Bank, the means of ensuring that the board of the European Central Bank, at its meetings in Frankfurt, learns of the difficulties facing Ireland arising from our strong trading relationship with the United Kingdom and United States.  I am certain the Minister will ensure our voice is heard when the ECB board next meets and the ECB rate will decrease further.  In light of the stimulus packages announced in Europe, the United States and the Far East, and the low rates of inflation and interest, is it not reasonable to believe that we will come through the current crisis?</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has been served well by one of its key priorities.  The depression caused by the Wall Street crash did not reach Europe until 1932, the same year as the party formed a Government.  It remained in government for 16 years, which included the height of the depression, because it looked after everybody.  In this crisis, I commend the Minister on ensuring the less well-off are looked after and ask him to continue with the traditional Fianna F&aacute;il policy of looking after the less well-off, irrespective of what price, whether pay freezes, pay cuts or higher taxes, the rest of us have to pay in the future.  As he correctly noted, however, removing a large amount of money from the economy creates further difficulty.  I ask the Minister to continue his current approach of looking after the less well-off so that we emerge from this crisis stronger than ever and come through the gates like a lion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I recognise his Department is under extraordinary pressure at this time, it is a good time to place on record my views.  The Minister will be aware that I approach this issue from a disinterested, non-party viewpoint.  The Government is making a serious error in its dealings and relations with the Opposition parties.  It is time the Opposition was taken into the tent to the greatest degree possible.  I say this not to make a political point but as one who has considered the issue from the outside.</P>
        <P>The Government failed yesterday because, in not allowing the Opposition parties to buy into its economic plan, it ensured it had nothing else to do except tear strips off it on the one o&rsquo;clock news.  The Minister will be aware of my views on social partnership.  The social partners have a major role to play in the economy.  However, in addition to meeting the social partners, the Government should have invited the Opposition parties to engage in a process of consultation in which they could express their views.  The Government could have taken on board some of their views.  I am not proposing a national government but describing strategy and tactics.  I am <Col N="186"/>uncomfortable with what I see taking place because it maintains an unnecessary divide in politics.  While I accept that oppositions must oppose and governments must govern, I ask the Minister to bridge this gap in an appropriate fashion.  Perhaps he needs to use a pontoon or lifting bridge which can be taken up or down.  If we expect the Opposition to wear the green jersey, we have to make some move towards them and this has not been done.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s economic plan should have been launched simultaneously at Dublin Castle and in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A Minister of State could have presented it in each of the Houses at the same time as the launch in Dublin Castle.  That would have presented an image to the public that the entire political system, the social partners and others were focused on the issue.  If this image had been sent out, we could have coped with the differences afterwards.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler has asked on several occasions where the unions have been throughout this period.  I am sure he will have noted the comment by the former president of ICTU, Mr. Peter McLoone, who bravely stated on the news last night that salary issues must be discussed.  He showed bravery in saying this because his telephone will be ringing this morning.  While there is no shortage of people who are willing to engage, the Department also has a duty to draw them in.  It does not matter if there is disagreement provided there is some degree of involvement.</P>
        <P>On a positive note, the Government has done as well as it could in its dealings with the banks.  This may not be a popular a view but the bank guarantee and the decision not to put taxpayers&rsquo; money into the banks has been well handled.  As we are all aware, however, it could go wrong at any time.  On the Order of Business, I expressed serious reservations about handing &euro;10 billion in trust to the people who got us into the mess about which we learned last night, and Senators on the Government side nodded as I spoke.  I should declare that I am a member of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and have an insight into the audit process.  The audit and accounting issue must be re-examined.</P>
        <P>Four years ago, I pleaded in the House to provide in legislation for the making of decent directors&rsquo; compliance statements.  We need a legal requirement for a proper, extensive directors&rsquo; compliance statement.  This is not a 40-page document but a short statement in which a director states that he or she has complied with the laws of the land and good governance.  Under the current legislation, if he or she makes a false statement, the auditors will pick it up.  What is required, however, is to provide that directors who make a false statement or fail to declare a matter are in breach of the law.  It is unfortunate that in the case which arose last night no law was broken.  Trust has been broken, taxpayers have lost out and the Minister, the Government and the Houses have been damaged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A second bank was involved in the case.  A first-year accountancy student knows that if &euro;87 million goes in and out of a bank once a year for a couple of days, it is not an appropriate movement.  It is also one which information technology systems in banks are designed to detect.  This transaction should have jumped off the screen and I have no doubt this occurred.  I want to know about the other bank, Irish Nationwide, and the Minister&rsquo;s views on the issue.  As the name of the bank was referred to in the media, I am not taking advantage of the privilege of the House.  This case raises serious issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also want to know how the audit committee of Anglo Irish Bank operates.  Did it have knowledge of this case?  Did the governance of the bank require that the risk committee be made aware that the director had received &euro;87 million?  These are simple questions which do not breach confidence.  It would be a confidence boosting measure if the Minister were to state that the risk committee was not informed but should have been informed or, alternatively, that <Col N="187"/>it was informed but took no action and he has asked its members to resign.  We need to see clear action within the law.  We do not need witch-hunts or lynch mobs but the spirit and letter of the law requires that clear steps be taken.</P>
        <P>I want to know whether the audit committee met the bank&rsquo;s internal and external auditors without the chief executive being present.  What were the external auditors doing?  It appears they simply looked at the books on one day.  If this is the case, it raises a difficulty.  The Minister will recall the long night we spent in this House discussing the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill.  During that debate, I pointed out that a new audit had begun on 1 October.  I want the Minister to tell me that the auditors were not so idiotic as to look at the accounts of the banks on a single day.  They must examine the flow of cash in and out of the banks over the year.  When the Minister sent PricewaterhouseCoopers into the bank two months ago, did it unearth this information?  Major questions arise from this case.  If the auditors did not find the information, what else did they not find?</P>
        <P>As a public representative, it is my duty to put the case of the Financial Regulator.  Senator Boyle and I had an exchange on this issue on the Order of Business.  The authority of the regulator needs to be strengthened.  I want the Minister to say we did not give the regulator authority to deal with matters such as 110% loans.  The Oireachtas decided four years ago not to give him authority to do that.  There is no point in asking now why he did not do it.  We need to revisit the matter and should do so.</P>
        <P>The regulator may have done nothing wrong.  If there is such a thing as vicarious liability, someone should have done something.  He is the guy behind the eight ball, as it were, and may have to take the hit on this issue even though he may have acted within the regulations.  I want to see how we approach these matters.</P>
        <P>The Minister should look at where Ireland stands on the implementation of the eighth or ninth financial directive from Europe on international financial accountancy standards.  A Member mentioned matters in the Irish Financial Services Centre were not properly regulated.  We are one of the last few laggards in the European Community who have not implemented those standards.  We should have done so on 30 June.  It still has not been done.  Why not?</P>
        <P>Attached to that set of standards is the quality assurance requirement which Commissioner McCreevy, who is not known for interfering in the market or over-regulation, has asked we also adopt, despite the fact it is optional.  Will the Minister tell the House he will apply the quality assurance standard and implement all other standards?</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are examples of the things we are not doing.  How do we approach what we are doing?  I want the Minister to respond to the issues.  I am not saying Government could have sorted out what happened to the banks.  Whoever is appointed must be put in place on the basis of trust.  Therefore, we must have people we can trust and who can prove we can trust them.  The Minister has put forward a fine selection of people acting for Government into the various banks and it is beyond question that they are solid people.  However, that is not enough.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have no doubt they have been and they are people of the highest quality and with the intellectual power to back that up.  That said, there needs to be an oversight body for banking.  We have an oversight body for accountancy and other matters.  If we had an oversight body for banking, what would it do?  There would be basic uniformity of standards which they would have to apply and conform to, and it would be checked and tested annually.  Any changes in governance or association rules would have to be cleared at some level.</P><Col N="188"/>
        <P>People may think this is over-regulation and ask if it will be another quango?  Most of the latest quangos set up in the past ten years are self-financing.  I am a member of two semi-state bodies, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  They are fully or partly self-funded.  If we set up a bank oversight body, it should be paid for by the banks.  My proposal should not cost the State money.</P>
        <P>This can be done and it works in other places.  We have seen failure in the US.  The Securities and Exchange Commission in the US does not work, nor does the Serbanes-Oxley Act.  In the US everything works on the basis of rules.  There is no rule to cover every situation.  We need to apply principles and have people of quality, trust, confidence and intellectual capacity to examine what is being done, check it, look under stones to see what is going on and ensure we take control of the situation.</P>
        <P>There is a lot to be done and a lot can be done.  It must be done quickly, however.  I understand the regulator brought the matter to the attention of the bank immediately, indicated it was not illegal but was unacceptable practice and on that basis it was declared to the auditors this year.  I do not know why it was delayed; perhaps the person involved refused to resign.  It is not difficult to work out the possible and probable scenarios.  We can discuss the matter again.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to take firm action on some of the issues I raised to give confidence to ordinary people.  He has given confidence on the basis of the deposit guarantee scheme, which has been very important in creating stability.  He also created additional liquidity.  He is now discussing recapitalisation.  I have asked him privately and publicly six times to show me the connection between recapitalisation and loans.  He cannot do it and neither can anyone else.</P>
        <P>I have a difficulty in giving money unless I know it will come out the other end, so to speak.  I believe it would be better to buy the cheapest bank, and one is going cheap this morning.   The Minister can then do what he wishes with his &euro;10 billion.  He can then run the bank, make it available to people under proper, old fashioned banking standards and lend on that basis.</P>
        <P>Much can be done and I recognise that we need to get rid of the perks and million euro salaries for directors.  Action is needed on those issues and the Minister should say what he has been reluctant to say previously but has been thinking.  These matters need to be in the public arena to show people the Minister is in control, we will not stand for this carry-on and the banks will toe the line and come down to our planet.  They must be beamed down to earth, as it were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We live in unprecedented times.  There has been a downward trend nationally and internationally in key economic indicators unparalleled in economic history.  How we deal with it is a challenge for our generation.  In Ireland we are feeling it more markedly than most because it has come on the back of the longest sustained period of economic development in the country&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>There is a need to examine critically and appraise how we got to where we now are.  The main priority is to decide what can be put in place to achieve stability and sustainability in our society and economy.  There is no doubt the Celtic tiger years brought about a degree of superficiality that gave us some false comfort of the actual wealth of the country.  I would like to see a movement towards a more sustainable society and economy and a questioning of the value of real wealth.</P>
        <P>The Government publication, which has been treated quite cynically by some sources, is an honest attempt to point a way forward, identify action areas and inject an element of specificity on where we need to get to from here.  As a society, we need to have a debate on the fact that while there was a growth in confidence and development in entrepreneurial abilities during the <Col N="189"/>Celtic tiger years which had not existed in the State to the same extent previously, negative factors also developed, such as the growth of individualism and the leakage between community and commercial interests.  I, and my party, believe that we need to establish a more sustainable society by returning to a debate on values.  The news today indicates that one of the factors of the Celtic tiger years was a diminution of many of those values.  The increase in greed and individualism are some of the factors which have brought us to where we are today.  I sense the Minister is facing those problems, in addition to the direct day-to-day difficulties to which the Government and political system must respond.</P>
        <P>We are in a situation where the State has already made policy decisions and indicated that key resources will be made available to sustain the economy into the future.  We need to ask who works with the State.  I have stated on the record that many of those running our financial institutions are not and cannot be those who work with the State on where we go from here.  It is a violent word but there should be a cull of executives in the banking system.  Public confidence is needed from now on, and it does not and cannot exist with many of the people running our key institutions.  Yesterday&rsquo;s resignation is the start of a process, and many people involved in financial institutions need to look to themselves to right the wrong.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We have insufficient regulation.  This is not necessarily a flaw of Government policy.  The legislation that exists was predicated on existing international regulatory practices which were flawed.  They were flawed in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and especially in this country.  The laws need to be reviewed and strengthened and as part of the public confidence process, the people doing the regulations need to be critically examined and, if necessary, changed.  My personal opinion on that has not changed.  Today&rsquo;s news means whatever oversight that has existed has not been to the degree we expect from a regulatory body.</P>
        <P>I disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on some of the powers the Financial Regulator does not have directly but should have been able to apply through a moral authority.  The regulator has supervisory and prudential powers but also consumer interest powers.  When products such as 110% mortgages were made available, the only person I heard speaking about it was a Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  I heard no one in the financial services industry or the Financial Regulator say this was a poor product and would be dangerous for people who used it.  That is the ultimate failure of regulation, not only omitting to say whether a product should exist but also not warning the public on the danger of its existence.</P>
        <P>I see the Finance Bill as the brighter side of the coin of the budget for 2009.  Many difficult decisions were made on 14 October, many of which had to be reassessed in light of justified public concern.  The nature of decisions made on budget day are part of a process.  If public expenditure is to be controlled, it will require a series of such decisions, but I have not heard that in wider political debate.  Not only have difficult decisions been made, there will be more of them and the decisions to be made will be even more difficult and will excite much more public apprehension and reaction.  To be honest, anyone who is or aspires to be in Government must make that public declaration because there is no alternative.</P>
        <P>The Finance Bill reverses many of the beliefs that existed in the Celtic tiger years, including that we had to incentivise people who were already wealthy.  We have learned that, despite giving tax reliefs for many spurious areas, people who wrote off large amounts of tax and did not pay them to the State coffers still paid themselves exorbitantly high salaries and indulged in practices where they loaned shareholders&rsquo; money to themselves.  There was no system to bring them to account.  We should be discussing the culture and lack of values as well as the euro and cent approach to making an economy work.</P><Col N="190"/>
        <P Just="Left">Despite what I said since beginning my contribution, I remain confident that this may be a period of a number of years in which difficult decisions will be made.  I have faith in the people&rsquo;s ability to understand the nature of the difficulties we are in and in their having the resourcefulness to deal with those problems in a society we forgot during the Celtic tiger years.  If we are to have a more sustainable society and an economy that is predicated on real wealth and lacks the superficiality of the Celtic tiger years, we must debate society and see the economy as an engine for that society rather than the focus of all our endeavours.  When we get to that stage, Ireland will be better for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  We need to begin the difficult work of rebuilding the Irish economy from the bottom up, and protecting and creating jobs.  This Finance Bill does none of this.  It puts short-term accountancy over long-term recovery.  It puts balancing the books over rebalancing our economy.  The budget was brought forward to give the impression of activity on behalf of the Government in dealing with the declining economy.  Old age pensioners, schoolchildren and their parents, and taxpayers have been lamenting ever since.  Where is the strategy?  Does this Finance Bill help or hinder the economy?  That is the test.  We needed a budget that helped to stimulate the economy, stem job losses and get people who had already lost their jobs back to work.  We needed to see businesses, big and small, regaining confidence that their bank would be open for business and that the Government would be proactive in this for them.</P>
        <P>Governments around the world are reflating their economies and reforming their banks to give fresh hope to their people.  Our Government, in this Finance Bill, is doing the opposite.  In this Finance Bill, the Minister increases VAT by 0.5% to 21.5%, one of the highest in Europe.  Only Poland and Sweden have higher VAT rates.  Our VAT is 6.5% above the new rate of 15% just across the Irish Sea and in the North.  The Finance Bill imposes an income levy on all incomes over &euro;18,304 without any marginal relief.  Anyone earning slightly above the minimum wage who works overtime to boost their income risks being hit by a 1% charge on the whole of his or her income.</P>
        <P>The news that there will be a 6.5 percentage point difference between VAT rates in the Republic and the UK, including Northern Ireland, has hastened the stampede of shoppers from the Republic to the North and the UK.  It seems unbelievable that when the British Chancellor is slashing VAT rates from 17.5% to 15%, our Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan is increasing our top VAT rate from 21% to 21.5%, one of the highest rates in Europe.  The proposed VAT increase is one more own goal in a budget that has not stopped unravelling since 14 October.  Just when Governments around the world are trying to stimulate consumer demand, our Minister seems to want to strangle it.  It was the wrong signal at the wrong time to Irish consumers.  Leadership was required in this area and, sadly, is lacking.</P>
        <P>The Government forecast an average unemployment rate of 7.3% for 2009, which was hopelessly optimistic as we learned yesterday when the ESRI forecast an average rate of more than 10%.  An entire generation of young people could find themselves locked out of the jobs market.  Tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs from building sites and factory floors, as we are all aware.  We need a major programme of training and upskilling to help people acquire the transferable skills needed for the 21st century.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A related matter regarding people&rsquo;s capacity to enter the marketplace is social welfare.  The Social Welfare Bill withdrew child benefit for 18 year olds while hiking up college registration fees by &euro;600.  The parent of an 18 year old child stands to lose in excess of &euro;1,000 in 2009 and just under &euro;2,000 in 2010 from the changes to child benefit alone.  Some 100,000 more people are on the live register than a year ago.  In one of the meanest budgets ever, qualifying for <Col N="191"/>jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit has been made much more difficult.  This is a slap in the face to the many thousands of people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  They also have to wait seven to eight weeks to have their claims processed, which is scandalous.</P>
        <P>Investing in public transport, promoting green technology enterprise and shifting to eco-friendly energy will stimulate the economy while providing the foundation for long-term sustainable growth.  Growing the green economy now is not just good for the environment, it is also good for the economy.  If we invest in Government action now, we can set out on a path to smart, green growth.  Limited initiatives such as the bicycle grant scheme and home insulation are small pieces in the jigsaw, but they do not help us see the bigger picture.  We need to overhaul radically the way our country is powered and the way we do business.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains some positive measures.  Significant measures to increase and broaden the tax reliefs on research and development expenditure, including for qualifying buildings, is welcome.  These are necessary if we are serious about moving up the value chain.  If we are serious about winning jobs in emerging high-tech sectors and attracting laboratory jobs of the future to replace those being lost on factory floors and construction sites, we need to match the research and development investment of those countries at the top of the competitiveness league.  We support these limited measures, but when it comes to the type of economic transformation that the country now needs, they are insufficient.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future with confidence is not easy.  People have lost confidence in the triumvirate of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance to lead us out of the economic mess in which we now find ourselves.  That is not just a political point, but is the reality we are hearing on the ground.  The much heralded plan for economic recovery was launched yesterday and turned out to be very little beyond aspiration.  There is no new money, no actual decisions, and nothing from which we can take hope.  It contained 100 pages of restated and rehashed old ideas with the exception of those stolen from the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>The transport element of the plan is short on specifics on public transport.  Priority is given to additional buses and bus priority measures, but there is no mention of the metro and no timeline for the rapid transit systems needed to make our cities low carbon and attractive to young people and investors.  Even the flagship idea of a venture capital fund is vague and unspecific.  Borrowing to boost the economy in the short term by investing in education and infrastructure will see us in a better position to develop the economy over the medium term and balance the books over the long term.  Putting money into the economy rather than taking money out is what we need at this point.  It should happen as part of a coherent, co-ordinated economic strategy, but it is sadly lacking.  Has the Government any strategy to generate stimulus at this stage to replace some of the demand which has been wiped out by the credit crunch?  I do not think so.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party, through our leader Deputy Eamon Gilmore and our finance spokesperson, Deputy Joan Burton, has set out the framework of a billion euro stimulus package.  This package would include a significant primary and secondary school building scheme, putting construction workers to work building new schools, refurbishing old schools and improving educational opportunities for future generations.  It would also include a meaningful and comprehensive insulation scheme to retrofit houses and schools across the country, putting construction workers to work at reducing Ireland&rsquo;s energy dependency, as well as a significant investment in public transport to improve quality of life, to reduce carbon emissions and to ensure that our infrastructure is good enough to attract the very best international businesses to the country.  The &euro;1.2 billion in development levies currently held by local authorities should be allocated for immediate use, putting construction workers to work building much needed community infrastructure around the country.  New SME centred credit lines from the Euro<Col N="192"/>pean Investment Bank must be utilised to the fullest extent.  Small and medium sized businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and can be the engine of our economic recovery, but they must have access to the credit they need to grow and prosper.</P>
        <P>The challenge for politicians in the debate on this Bill is to chart a strategy for economic recovery that is both realistic about the challenges we face and optimistic about what we can achieve in the future.  We need to invest in our people and in our infrastructure so that we are poised to profit from an upturn in the global economy whenever that may come.   We need to begin the hard work of rebuilding the Irish economy from the bottom up, retaining, protecting and creating jobs.  The reason the Finance Bill 2008 is so inadequate is that it does none of the above.  It puts short-term accountancy over long-term recovery and puts balancing the books over rebalancing our economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an t-Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach chun an &aacute;bhar tabhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  I welcome much of what the Minister had to say this morning.  He pointed out that Ireland is a good place for business, which has meant that we have attracted much more foreign direct investment than our population would indicate.  Much of that success is predicated on a well educated workforce with a very good work ethic.  I am always surprised to see young, well qualified people who apply themselves so diligently to their jobs and who work long hours without overtime, especially in the private sector.  That is something that has stood us in good stead.</P>
        <P>Our taxation policies over the past ten years or more have facilitated the growth in our economy.  While we have been playing catch up with our infrastructure, there has been significant improvement through the national development plan in the past few years, and much money has been ploughed into improving transportation, communication and other areas that are vital for business.  The investment climate has generally been good.  In the current situation, it is important that the fiscal policy we adopt maintains these gains.</P>
        <P>Comments have been made in this House and elsewhere about the budget and about the rapid deterioration in the economy and in our public finances.  It is a global phenomenon, and countries much larger and richer than Ireland are struggling to cope with their difficulties.  Shortly after assuming office last July, the Minister took remedial action on public finances, which is to his credit, by looking for savings of &euro;500 million due to indications that our public finances were going into deficit.  Much has been made of the decision to introduce an early budget.  At the time, I thought it was a good idea and was done for the right reasons.  When the budget is left until very late in the year, the planned savings will come in after a few months of the following year, and the Exchequer does not get the full benefit.  Therefore, it was right to do it.  However, there has been a significant yet unforeseen deterioration in public finances since then, and we have seen the many problems that have been occurring worldwide.</P>
        <P>I have heard a number of economists asked in the media whether they would like to be a Minister for Finance at this time, and they all said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Nobody envies the challenges confronting the Minister.  I honestly think he has performed well in the short time that he has been there.  During the banking crisis in September, our banking system could have collapsed, but very quick action was taken to give the guarantees which stabilised the situation.  The Minister has been right to take his time on the capitalisation issue.  Other countries took decisions on capitalisation early on, but this has not improved the banking situation for them and the volatility in the sector certainly has not been stabilised.</P>
        <P>There are many aspects to this Bill that I would commend, although I would have reservations about some.  In his speech, the Minister mentioned mortgage interest relief, and that is not just important for the construction industry.  When house prices were seriously escalating, <Col N="193"/>many people were not in a position to get on the property ladder, but now they have been given the opportunity to do so by the increase in mortgage interest relief and through the stimulus package introduced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">About 18 months ago, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, came together to launch a greater emphasis on research and development.  This area provides potential for job growth in the future, and I am glad the new plan announced will ensure the benefits and the ideas that come from the research and development will result in job creation.  It is essential that we obtain the benefits, and that they do not end up in other economies.  That we have targeted that area is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I listened to what Senator Ryan had to say about VAT.  Quite honestly, I do not think the 0.5% increase in the VAT rate will have a positive effect on our fiscal position or a negative effect on consumption levels.  The real issue is the deteriorating value of sterling.  I do not think any change in our VAT structure would offset that in any way.  There is precious little we can do to reduce the financial impact of the decline of sterling.  It is obvious that we have to try to cope as best we can until the various currencies regulate themselves and find their own levels.</P>
        <P>We have gone as far as we should in respect of pension tax relief.  Pension provision will be a major issue in the future.  I am not sure the increase of 2% in capital gains tax and the increase from 23% to 26% in certain insurance-wrapped investment products represents a step in the right direction.  I can understand why these increases are being provided for in a tight fiscal situation.  I would like to think they will be reversed when we get an opportunity next year or in 2010.  I think we should have reduced capital gains tax to 18% to attract investment.  Fiscally, the increase in capital gains tax means nothing because people are suffering losses at present.  It will be of very little benefit in the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the overall position.  I concur with the ESRI&rsquo;s prediction that unemployment will increase to 10%.  It will be well in excess of what was predicted when the budget was drawn up.  The current budget deficit of &euro;4.7 billion will probably increase to &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion, unfortunately.  The Minister emphasised that there is a real need to restore cost competitiveness.  I wish to mention a worrying factor in that regard.  I refer to a survey that was conducted in 2007, which involved a comparison of salaries in many EU capital cities.  The second highest wage levels, of approximately &euro;38,000, were found in Stockholm.  The highest wage levels, of approximately &euro;52,000, were found in Dublin.  That indicates to me that our wages and salaries are probably between 25% and 30% higher than those in the countries with which we are competing.  It is an enormous difference.</P>
        <P>I suggest, from a fiscal point of view, that we should do what companies in the private sector are doing.  Rather than merely freezing wages and salaries in the public service, we should claw back the 10% wage increases that were awarded under the benchmarking system.  We need to look at numbers in the same way as the private sector.  I suggest that a 15% reduction in staff levels would be appropriate.  We may have to do this over a couple of years.  We should aim to reduce our salary bill by approximately &euro;4 billion.  We should try to save a further &euro;4 billion by eliminating wasteful and unnecessary expenditure that does not yield any services or add anything to the economy.  I suggest that actions of that magnitude are needed if we are to overcome this serious and difficult challenge.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that a national consensus is needed if we are to achieve our aims.  As politicians, we should be more than hurlers on the ditch.  We should act as statesmen.  If we fail to do so, we might still be talking about these issues five or ten years from now.  That would be a sad reflection on all of us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  Three aspects of this country&rsquo;s economy will be important in the coming years.  First, we need to address the question of public debt.  The Government expects the budget deficit to be approximately 10% of national income next year.  Our national debt will probably equate to almost half of next year&rsquo;s overall national income.  The substantial increase in personal indebtedness that is taking place at present is as much a cause of concern as the public debt.  People&rsquo;s credit card bills and mortgage arrears are increasing.  At a time when there is so much public debt and the public finances are in such difficulty, the same is happening to people&rsquo;s private finances.</P>
        <P>Second, we need to take a position on living standards.  The ESRI report that was published last night contains an extraordinarily disturbing statistic that should give us all pause for thought.  I refer to the prediction that <i>per capita</i> income in this State will decrease by 9% next year.  When one refers to percentages, one can lose sight of what one is talking about.  If a person had &euro;100 to spend this year, he or she will have &euro;91 to spend next year.  That reduction will have immense implications for consumer confidence and people&rsquo;s private finances.  Third, we need to consider what is happening to our national competitiveness.  Senator Walsh acknowledged the importance of this issue in his contribution.  I have spoken about it on the Order of Business over recent days.  We need to focus particularly on the impact of currency movements.  It is likely that the value of sterling and the dollar will continue to fall, which will mean that this country&rsquo;s cost structures, which are already uncompetitive, will come under even more pressure.  The interplay between the three factors I have mentioned will affect this country&rsquo;s ability to move forward in 2009 and beyond.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a point about the Government&rsquo;s management of this county&rsquo;s finances in recent years, which has been ignored in this debate so far.  I was particularly struck by Senator Boyle&rsquo;s suggestion that all politicians, including the members of the Government, should take time to reflect on the values of the business community.  I would add to that by suggesting that the political system &mdash; I refer in particular to the Government &mdash; should take time to reflect on the values that underpin the management of the public finances.  It is apparent that various taxes, particularly income tax, were cut too quickly in the past ten years, to levels that are now unsustainably low.  This point has not been emphasised in the debate we are having.  As this country enters a period of global recession, it has a structural deficit of at least &euro;7 billion around its neck as a consequence of the mismatch between its income from taxes and the cost of the services it needs to fund.  It is a stunning indictment of the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the public finances.  If the Government now had the ability to deliver the rates of income tax reduction that were so rapidly delivered some years ago, it would have an extraordinary effect on our confidence and the national economy at a time of crisis.  The reductions in income tax and many other taxes that were provided at a time when such decreases were not needed by the economy are examples of the appalling manner in which budgets have been managed over many years.  Now would be a more appropriate time for the kind of income tax reductions we saw in previous years.  The Government has to take responsibility for the fact that such decreases are not possible.  It cannot be blamed on the global recession or other international circumstances.  This act of economic illiteracy on the part of the Government should be acknowledged and its lessons should be learnt.</P>

	<P>The ESRI has described the report that was launched by the Government yesterday as an interesting aspirational document that does not deal with the real issues.  We have a very real issue on our hands today.  The headlines in today&rsquo;s newspapers say <Col N="195"/>it all.  The main headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> is &ldquo;Anglo Irish chairman quits over transfer of loans&rdquo;.  The main story in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, under the headline &ldquo;Anglo chief quits after hiding &euro;87m bank loans&rdquo;, states that &ldquo;Analysts were shocked to learn last night that the true figure of directors&rsquo; borrowings at present is actually &euro;150m&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We are talking about trust in banking and trust in our economy.  The challenge for the Minister is how he can possibly restore citizens&rsquo; trust in banking.  What action will he take to restore trust?  Trust is gone given the information that has become available today.  This is a most serious day for Irish banking.  How can citizens reading this have any trust in banking here?  How can the international community, which we will approach shortly looking for money, have any trust in our economy?  This is a most serious challenge for the Government.</P>
        <P>We need to answer these questions.  How has the regulation gone so wrong?  Why did no one know this had happened?  When this House discussed the bank guarantee scheme, was this known by the Financial Regulator and not brought to the attention of the House by the Government?  I reiterate what our party leader, Deputy Kenny, asked last night.  Who knew about this?  When did they know it?  When was the Government informed?  What action did it take?  What will it do now?  Many citizens will be worried about their car and health insurance because of the connection of the Quinn Group to Anglo Irish Bank.  They will worry about what could happen.  We in Fine Gael believe the board of Anglo Irish Bank should resign and the Government needs to take over the bank.  We need action from the Government to restore trust and faith in Irish banking and the economy which has reached level zero after these revelations.</P>
        <P>There is a complete failure of governance and regulation.  How can we go ahead and lend more to this sector unless we put safeguards in place?  We must clarify what the role of the directors will be.  This cannot be allowed to go on.  Corporate governance is at the heart of this.  There has been a dismal failure.  It is extraordinary to think that this has been going on for eight years.  I want to know about the involvement of other banks to which this money was moved.  Why was activity on this scale not picked up by those other banks?  These are the most serious questions that have ever arisen on Irish banking governance and oversight.  When this came to the regulator&rsquo;s attention, what was done?  When did the Government find out and why were these Houses not informed about this most serious situation in Anglo Irish Bank?</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that action must and, I am sure, will be taken.  I commend and support the budget.  It was a most difficult one and was not the choice we would normally like to introduce.  However, when one considers the economic problems not just in this country but globally, we had no choice but to introduce a very difficult budget.</P>
        <P>I disagree with some of the speakers on the Opposition side of the House who said we had too much consultation with the social partners.  I believe we do not have enough consultation with everyone.  We made some mistakes in the budget, including the medical card changes.  That is an example of not having consultation with the social partners and others.  We have learnt a lesson in that regard.  The Government is right in consulting the social partners.  The economic problems are now so big that we will not do this on our own.  We need to show statesmanship and leadership.  There is also a responsibility on people on the Opposition side of the House who know the situation not to make political issues and to tell the truth to the people.  We are doing that now, which is very responsible.</P>
        <P>The economic plan we produced yesterday has not received a fair hearing and has been dismissed by some who did not even read it .  The jobs arising from research and development into green and renewable energy will be vital.  A sum of &euro;500 million has been allocated to research and development.  We need to consider how we will implement reform of the public service.  Will we reduce the numbers?  Will there be a 10% pay cut across the board?  We are <Col N="196"/>now looking at different ways of doing things.  What happened in Aer Lingus sets an example.  When it was planning to outsource some of the jobs, the unions played an important role, which was very responsible on their part, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A realisation may be dawning that if people spend &euro;100 outside the country, &euro;20 will not go to health services and schools and may jeopardise our jobs.  We need to be serious about becoming responsible to ensure we keep our jobs.  Even though we do not have VAT on food, people are going across the Border to spend money.  How can it be 20% dearer here given that we do not charge VAT on it?</P>
        <P>The health service delivers very good service when one gets into it.  However, there are certain areas such as accident and emergency units which I believe the Minister is trying to streamline.  Some &euro;15 billion or &euro;16 billion is being pumped into the health service each year over which we have not had control.  It is time we took back control of the health service.  Instead of having the Health Service Executive as an autonomous body, it should be more answerable to this House.</P>
        <P>Before there is any recapitalisation of the banks we need to ascertain their loan to asset ratio, especially in the land area, and asset values need to be written down.  When we spend public money, we need to know we are not spending it badly.  It is quite right for the Minister to take time over this.  Action must be taken.  The phantom loans revealed in Anglo Irish Bank yesterday are of grave concern.  Having read the newspapers this morning, the public will not have been reassured about our banking system.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on trying to shelter the least well-off, including old age pensioners and people on social welfare.  In difficult times we would have liked to have been able to give them more.  They can be assured by Fianna F&aacute;il that we will never let down older people or less well-off people.  We will try to give them as much as we can.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.</P>
        <P>When I came into the House almost 16 years ago, I did not have much experience of how to look at a Bill.  I had experience of being in business and looking after customers.  I began to consider Bills as though I was dealing with a business, whether they were health Bills, education Bills or any other type of Bill.  How would a business person consider a particular Bill?  Thus, I considered the Finance Bill and the budget as would a business person.</P>
        <P>I agree entirely with Senator Butler&rsquo;s statement that we had no choice but to have a difficult budget.  However, as a business person I lived through the 1960s, early 1970s and mid-1980s, which were very tough times.  I examined what businesses, including my own, had to do.  One of the first things one must do to survive is to look after one&rsquo;s customers.  Who are the customers?  In this case the customers are the citizens of Ireland, and the Minister&rsquo;s duty is to consider how he can act in the best interests of these citizens.  That is a wide remit.  He had a choice; he could have done something else, as businesses sometimes do.  They sometimes decide to balance the books and forget about their customers for a particular year.  I have a fear that this is what the Minister tried to do.  I do not think he looked at the broader picture.  He decided he had to balance the books immediately, and he therefore took steps that a business would not have taken.</P>
        <P>A business would normally try to generate income and cut costs in tough times.  I remember those tough times; we did have to cut costs and we did have to generate income.  This Finance Bill does not seem to do that.  Instead of looking after the customers and trying to generate income, the Minister decided not to cut costs.  The costs of the public sector are large.  Business managers would have said to their employees that they must take a cut this year and would have <Col N="197"/>reduced prices in order to generate more business.  We have learned so well that sometimes a lower percentage brings in more money.  If one brings down one&rsquo;s price one generates more money.</P>
        <P>It appears as though the British Government, the supposedly socialist Labour Party Government, has taken this attitude.  It has decided to generate more business and to get people to spend more.  I do not know whether it is the right thing to do, but it has at least given the example of cutting the VAT rate rather than increasing it.  What did we do?  We increased the VAT rate, although not by very much.  We also raised taxes by introducing a 1% income levy, or 2% if one earns over a certain amount, although this will apply for only a couple of years.  In other words, we have decided to solve this by putting up our prices.  What do we do with capital gains tax?  We said the same thing: we will put it up, at a time at which it is highly unlikely there would be any capital gains anyway.</P>
        <P>The Minister has taken the opposite attitude to that of a business person.  A business person would have said, &ldquo;I am going to do something to generate more income.&rdquo;  We have done that over the years.  We brought down corporation tax from 30% to 12.5%, and every time we brought it down we took in more money.  I remember the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, coming in here and saying he was going to reduce the betting tax from 20% to<?oasys _jy ?>10%, and there were howls.  People said he was looking after his pals, because he is from County Kildare, which is great racing country.  He came in a year later and said he had taken in far more money at 10% than he had taken at 20%, and he decided to reduce the tax again to 5%.  He came in the following year and said he had again taken in more money.  I mention this example because we are talking about the business of running our finances.</P>
        <P>The objective of the Finance Bill is to make sure the citizens of Ireland do better.  There may be a time in which we must cut costs and make sure we generate more income.  The message we see in this Finance Bill is wrong.  I may not have thought that on the day of the budget, but looking back I realise there were two steps we could have taken, and we took the wrong step.  I would have preferred to see the Minister generate more business and cut costs instead of putting up prices, because in the business world that usually ensures that one loses one&rsquo;s customers and gives one less chance of survival.</P>
        <P>There are steps the Minister can now take and should have taken in this case.  One of them involves retailers and small businesses &mdash; those small and medium-sized enterprises that are trying to survive.  How do we manage at a time in which there are major difficulties with finance and liquidity?  One of the things the Government could have done was to give these enterprises a little break and, instead of asking them to pay their VAT within 30 days, stretch the length of time required for payment.  It would provide a little more liquidity and give them a chance.  I am talking about 60 days, 90 days or 120 days.  Yes, it would cost the State that liquidity, but it would not cost it any money because in the long term it would get back its money.  For one year the Government could say that retailers do not have to pay their VAT within those 30 days.  That would encourage retailers, manufacturers and those who export goods by giving them a belief that the Government is supporting them and is trying to generate income rather than increase its prices.</P>
        <P>I am drawing what is perhaps a facile comparison with business.  However, a person with business experience would have done something different.  A very successful businessman once said to me that he always worried when he saw someone running a government who had no experience of getting money together at the end of the week to pay the wages.  There is a danger that in these Houses &mdash; I will upset many here by saying this &mdash; those who have never run a business or had to worry about getting money to pay the wages at the end of the week do not have that experience, although they may be well educated and experienced in many <Col N="198"/>other ways.  I may be too simplistic in my description, but I am expressing a concern that we have gone in the wrong direction this year.  At a time when there are major financial difficulties, I would like to see small and medium-sized entrepreneurial businesses encouraged.  I would like to see them generate activity and income.  I would like to see the Minister&rsquo;s message go much further in that direction rather than being about balancing the books and raising prices.  Of course it is important to balance the books, but this may be the very year in which he should have cut costs.  There was a time to do it.  It was possible to say to the public sector that we are facing a difficult time and everyone should take a pay cut.  Those earning less than &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 could take a 10% or 5% pay cut and those earning more than &euro;80,000 could take 20% or 10%.  It would be possible to do this with the support and enthusiasm of the population.</P>

	<P>The background to the budget and the Finance Bill consists of three problems, namely, our place in Europe in view of the Lisbon treaty referendum, the banking crisis, and the setting of a base for economic recovery.  What we have from the Government in these areas is a framework with no specific decisions made.  That is the problem we have here.  The Government has failed to act.  It continues to procrastinate and put off the decisions on which there is a broad consensus in the country.  In his statement, the Minister said the priority is:</P>
        <P LI="2">. . . the restoration of credibility and sustainability to the public finances.  Accordingly, the budget sets out a medium-term strategy to ensure this.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, it does no such thing.  It does not even set out a strategy on how to balance the books between now and the end of 2009, which is what a budget is supposed to do.  In fact, on the Minister&rsquo;s own admission, the budget is out of date.  We know this from the November Exchequer returns.  The Minister has not dealt with this.  The latest is that we will have some announcement in January.  The problem we have, to the disappointment of many people, is that there is no strategy or plan by this Government in which one can have any confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a situation where the State intervened, particularly, we understood, because of the perilous state of Anglo Irish Bank.  We now know more about that bank than we did yesterday regarding the loans made available to directors and especially the loans to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  The Financial Regulator says these loans are under investigation by him but the board of Anglo Irish Bank denies any rule was breached.  I question how long the Financial Regulator knew about the situation and how long the Minister knew about it.  Did the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, know this when he provided the State bank guarantee?</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to a number of measures that apply in this situation.  One is the market abuse regulation where it is a requirement to disclose any price-sensitive information, and we know how price-sensitive is the information about these loans.  The second is the Stock Exchange and accounting standards, where related party transactions are supposed to be fully disclosed.  It is only when such disclosures are made that one can have a true and fair view of financial accounts.  A State guarantee has been put in place for these banks and the Minister must be upfront on what he is doing with regard to the recapitalisation and the appropriateness of the directors of particular banks remaining in office in circumstances where these types of activities have gone on.</P><Col N="199"/>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Finance Bill proper, we do not have a normal budget situation where a Minister will set out how he intends to balance the books, how he intends to control expenditure and deal with the revenue and bridge the gap in borrowing.  We know the figures are out of date yet the Minister has given us no indication today of how he intends correcting that situation.  The latest ESRI report clearly shows just how out of touch he is.</P>
        <P>The budget is characterised by the 0.5% increase in VAT which shows just how out of touch the Minister is with the real state of the economy.  To have an increase in VAT when our nearest neighbour has reduced its VAT rate and the resulting disparity with Northern Ireland is a clear indication the Minister does not understand the fundamentals.</P>

        <P>The framework for economic renewal programme announced yesterday contains many issues and policies that have been announced with great fanfare over recent years, whether that is Transport 21 or the establishment of the new &ldquo;bord snip&rdquo;, yet none of these measures is new and none of them indicates the Government has a handle on the real problems that exist at present.  This is the Government that got us into this mess and it is becoming increasingly apparent that it is not capable of getting us out of it.  It is not up to the task.  With the 40-day recess over Christmas, the Taoiseach and the Government, in all the circumstances, should consider throwing in the towel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Finance Bill represents depressing evidence of a Government continuing to sleep-walk through a crisis that is not just threatening the banking system or the construction sector but is also slowly bleeding dry the small businesses that employ most workers and which are the heart of the economy.  Even worse is that the hundreds of thousands of working families whose efforts drove this economy through the Celtic tiger years have all but been abandoned in this Bill.  They have been condemned to endure higher taxes and more stealth charges, all to fund the policies of failure.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed on income tax, VAT, the tax exile status, reforming tax relief and tackling tax fraud.  It has failed to protect the vulnerable and most important in terms of ensuring economic growth.  It is penalising rather than rewarding working families.  There is nothing in this Bill to incentivise or stimulate enterprise.</P>
        <P>I belong to one of the few parties in this House which were regularly castigated in years past for pointing up the structural flaws in the economy.  There was a brief moment in September to October when it seemed that the Minister for Finance finally grasped the seriousness of the economic crisis threatening the economy and he scheduled an early budget for 2009.  Ten weeks on, however, it is clear this was simply a public relations stunt devoid of any substance and lacking any direction to drive the economy forward over the next three years.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in had proposed increasing the PAYE tax credit by 5% so that those on low incomes would get some respite from the higher energy costs, mortgages and food prices they have endured over the past year.  This Bill leaves the personal credits unchanged and only widens the 20% tax band marginally.  It does nothing to help families deal with increased costs of living in an economy where inflation is more than 4% and with double digit increases in electricity and energy process already being levied on households this year.  Many families face new transport charges for school buses, higher hospital charges, a new VHI levy and increasing university registration fees.  When all these charges are added up along with the increases in taxes for low and middle income families, even at a conservative estimate hard-working families will see their income reduced by up to &euro;1,500 in 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Not only has the Minister done nothing to restore the purchasing power of Irish families, his proposal to increase VAT to 21.5% is another regressive step and will hit Irish families unfairly.  With Border towns in the Twenty-six Counties being emptied of shoppers, the 2.5% cut in VAT announced by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer will exacerbate an already gaping imbalance between the two economies.  The Minister for Finance is actively encouraging shoppers to leave his tax jurisdiction.  It is more the economics of &ldquo;Fianna Fawlty Towers&rdquo; than the financial stability he promises us.</P>
        <P>The 1% income levy on workers who earn more than &euro;18,305 is unwarranted and will damage low income families.  The levy should apply only on incomes in excess of &euro;38,000 and Sinn F&eacute;in believes the 3% levy should apply on incomes in excess of &euro;200,100.  Our proposal to remove the PRSI ceiling would have had the double effect of raising much needed tax revenue while cushioning those on low and middle incomes from the worst effects of the increase.</P>
        <P>While Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the ending of the Cinderella clause for tax exiles, it questions the Minister&rsquo;s claim that tougher restrictions cannot be placed on Irish tax exiles because of double taxation agreements.  Are we really to believe the Minister cannot act?  He can raise taxes on a whim, he can write a blank cheque for banking, but he cannot act on a handful of supposed Irish citizens who do not want to pay tax here but demand to enjoy the benefits of Irish citizenship.</P>
        <P>The Government stood by in recent years as billions of euro poured out of the economy into property investments in Britain and Europe.  Forf&aacute;s estimated in 2006 that the economy had become a net investor outside of Ireland since 2004 when Irish citizens invested &euro;12.7 billion outside the economy.  In 2006 Irish investors spent almost &euro;8 billion on commercial property in Europe.  Now, after the horse has bolted yet again, the Government arrives with half-hearted measures.</P>
      
        <P>Another suspect measure is the proposal on changes to research and development tax credits.  IBEC described the changes as disappointing and there are questions about the whole research and development strategy being adopted by the Government.  It has to make sense in the boardroom and on the workplace floor.  What is being proposed does not make sense and much more serious action needs to be taken.  The Minister either believes in empowering the knowledge economy or he does not &mdash; there can be no halfway house.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the budget was unveiled Sinn F&eacute;in said we could rebuild the economy but that would mean taking bold decisions.  There is no evidence of that in this Bill.  Where is the investment in infrastructure that will create jobs and build competitiveness?  How will we help those who have lost their jobs get back into the workforce as quickly as possible and ensure they are supported properly while that happens?  When will we end the era of tax breaks for the rich while PAYE workers struggle to survive?  Time and again, the Government gets the small things wrong, such as the failure to tackle the flooding of the Irish market with cheap imports. <Col N="201"/> It has not dealt with contentious issues such as sell-by-dates or the incorrect guaranteed Irish labelling.</P>
        <P>Small businesses are being starved of capital with overdrafts cut while new businesses cannot get seed capital or start-up loans.  The Bill, however, gives even more tax breaks to the private health service but cannot find a tax incentive or funding initiative for small business or retraining redundant workers.  How is that possible?  The Minister proposes that struggling businesses declare their corporation tax earlier.  A four-year process of claiming research and development tax credits has been telescoped into four weeks.  The Minister is more concerned with short-term cashflow than he is with long-term company strength.</P>
        <P>The economy is in danger of a serious meltdown and this Bill does not reflect the gravity of that situation.  What will it take to get the coalition Government to wake up?  For now we have a Minister for Finance asleep at the wheel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, gave us an overview of the Bill&rsquo;s proposals.  I recognise it is his responsibility to encourage, stimulate and talk up the economic situation as best he can, but to judge by yesterday&rsquo;s ESRI report and other indicators, not alone are matters bad, they will get worse in 2009 and 2010.  I agree it is time for a pay freeze for several years throughout the entire economy.  I would like to see more agreement across the political divide on that matter and reform of the public service.  I have no doubt that is a matter to which political leaders are giving attention.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I had hoped the Minister for Finance would have refined certain budgetary measures to bring about a better economic situation for our people, particularly those in Border areas.  The different VAT rates of 21% and 15% that apply between the two jurisdictions have led to problems.  While we all want more revenue to flow, the Minister could have removed the VAT differential.  The high VAT in the South affects a range of products, such as clothes, groceries and alcohol.  People can make up to 30% in savings if they shop across the Border and this is widening with the increasing strength of the euro against sterling.  This disparity will come more into play and will be to our disadvantage in the financial short term.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Government launched its economic revival plan, which we wish well.  However, all commentators think it is too aspirational.  There are some good measures for the smart economy and, hopefully, in time they will bear fruit.  People seem to be despondent, however.</P>
        <P>We are all concerned with the unfolding developments with the banks.  The Minister is certainly taking his time with the recapitalisation programme.  It is 12 weeks since the bank guarantee scheme was put in place.  We gave it all the necessary urgency and the House sat all night to get it passed.  Unfortunately, it did not steady the markets but was necessary for depositors to prevent any runs on the banks.  The Minister has made subsequent announcements about the banking system but has not taken any measures.</P>
        <P>I hope the &euro;10 billion co-fund with investors and shareholders for banking recapitalisation will be developed more with shareholders than investors.  We do not want foreign equity houses or venture capitalists funding our banking system.  The Minister has stressed the banking system is one of the essential cornerstones of the economy.  However, earlier he spoke of a rationalisation of banks with a reduction from six to two banks.  While it might be necessary to strengthen the banks against foreign competition, it might not be good for competition.  We need to hear further from the Minister on this matter.</P><Col N="202"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the one hand, the Minister speaks confidently but takes a softly-softly approach to bank recapitalisation.  While some claim he is prevaricating, I believe he means well, but it is taking a long time.  We wish it did not have to take so long but we will have to bear with it.  While I am not seeking an SSIA-type scheme, perhaps a tax incentive for bank shareholders could be included in the co-funding arrangements.</P>
        <P>Our tax exiles are as Irish as ourselves.  Many of them have done much good work in making large amounts available to charity.  In this time of great need, we need them.  Will the Minister talk to them and see how they can be harnessed for the good of the economy?  No one should be outside the fold now.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, and his officials to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an important debate.  Our job must be to get the economy moving and working for the people.  I feel a great sense of powerlessness, however.  No matter what I say, it makes no difference.  The economy is in free-fall and nothing serious is being done to intervene.  The public, too, has lost faith.  When I informed people I would be contributing to the Finance Bill debate, they told me to tell the Ministers to make up their minds and present a plan that will work.  Over the years Deputy Cowen always postponed decisions.  He is always one report away from important decisions.  The most recent example is &ldquo;an bord snip&rdquo;, another high level group being put together to make decisions that should be made by the Cabinet.</P>
        <P>The experience of this Government has been largely in good times.  It was easy to spend money when it was available.  Now the Government is being challenged and its competencies are being tested.  I ask the Minister to show bravery and neck for the people because this will not go away by itself.  Decisions are needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When will the Government recapitalise the banks to provide credit to the many perfectly fine businesses in danger of going to the wall?  A month ago, the Galway Chamber of Commerce said to me that the question was how many businesses would make it to Christmas.  The question in January will be how many will make it to February.  Why is the Government not providing the necessary credit lines for those good businesses so that they can pay wages?  Otherwise they will have to let their employees go.  The businesses will keep going but with fewer employees.</P>
        <P>We must look at being responsible and suspending the pay deal.  We must examine introducing a redundancy scheme to get rid of waste in the Health Service Executive.  When the health boards were merged into the HSE, people found themselves at middle management level without job descriptions.  They are still there.  Let us make decisions and provide a way out for these people.  Let us cut the waste.</P>
        <P>We must reverse the increase in VAT.  We must stop our consumers voting with their feet and shopping the North because of the attractive VAT rate.  We should watch the trends in the economy.  The people are telling us how they feel when we see these patterns.</P>
        <P>I recommend that the Minister provide PRSI relief for employers taking on new workers in 2009.  Employers are our income generators and the Minister should not tax them but incentivise them.</P>

	<P>They are worth anything to this country now because they will give hope.  Imagine if we had a bunch of new employers, indigenous people in small businesses ready to employ people.  Would that not inject confidence? That is what the Government needs and Fine Gael is advising the Minister of State of that.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance could intervene with the banks now.  I have been contacted by couples who took out fixed rate mortgages a year ago.  The ECB interest rate kept going up and, now that it has come down, they are trapped in fixed rate mortgages.  The Minister should intervene with the banks to help them renegotiate their fixed rate downwards.  They will suffer a six month penalty, which could be up to &euro;15,000 in some cases that have been brought to me, to get out of those mortgages.  We rescued the banks, as did those caught in fixed rate mortgages.  We are in different times and all the ground rules have changed.  Will the Minister for Finance help to rescue those people so that they can renegotiate with the banks?  He should use his leverage.  With every move, the Minister for Finance can make a proportion of the people happy and make a difference to the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the real Minister for Finance is not present because there is a clarion call for change in the Government.  The patriotic thing the Minister of State and his colleagues could do is to dissolve both Houses of the Oireachtas, call a general election and let the people decide.  It is time for leadership, new beginnings and prudent investment that has not happened for the past 11 years.  We hear nauseating calls about national governments.  The Government has had a majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas for the past 11 years, more so in the past two years, and it has done nothing about it.  Let us stop talking about national governments and start talking about real leadership.</P>
        <P>I refer to the importance of choices made by this Government.  Senator Quinn referred to choices made by consumers, the Irish citizens.  He is right.  Let us examine the choices today.  The Minster of State, Deputy Haughey, is in charge of education and lifelong learning.  Let us look at the choices made by young people with mortgages.  Some 10,000 people are three months in arrears.  People are struggling to pay child care.  This afternoon, people are visiting the money advice and budgeting service and the social welfare offices.</P>

	<P>These are decent ordinary people who were working 12 months ago, 12 weeks ago or 12 days ago.  This Government has not given them any hope.</P>
        <P>The Government, through the Cork docklands issue, has betrayed the people of Cork city.  We were promised 12 months ago that the Cork docklands would be included in the budget but they were not.  There was mention in the budget of Seveso sites.  Barack Obama is talking about investment in infrastructure.  Let us build the gateway bridge in Cork city, the Sarsfield Road and Bandon Road flyover and let us invest in construction for Cork city.  It is not happening, however.</P>
        <P>What happened this morning is the litmus test for how the Government has failed the people.  Banks, and those in the industry, think they can walk on water&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo many of the sentiments expressed by my party colleagues in this debate.  I welcome the Minster of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I have spoken on every Finance Bill since I was elected to this House six and a half years ago.  I will not support this Bill.  It is interesting, in the time since the announcement of the budget a number of weeks ago, that there have been a number of mini-budgets since then.  The Minister has rolled back on every announcement he has made on any national controversy in the period since the budget.  This does not reflect well on him and seems to indicate he accepts a number of decisions made in the budget were incorrect.</P>
        <P>We remember when the Taoiseach changed and the new Minister came into office.  There was some speculation that there would be a supplementary budget.  The Minister decided not to have one and we sailed on towards the end of the year.  The budget date was brought forward at that stage.  The Government has been slow in taking action and there was a strong case for a supplementary budget after Deputy Lenihan became Minister for Finance.  There is a strong case to be made that he must do something in the first few months of the new year.  It might be politically unpalatable as the Government faces into the local and European elections but, based on the tax returns we have seen in recent weeks and the Government&rsquo;s budgetary outlook, significant changes will be made.  Whether those are in the form of a mini-budget is unclear but action must be taken.</P>
        <P>In responding to the Finance Bill this year, I have noticed a marked change.  I remember being the Opposition finance spokesperson for a number of years in this House.  I got the impression the Government was laughing at me when I proposed changes and expressed the view we were building our economy based on a property bubble that could not be sustained.  There was a sense of mocking from the Government that of course this would continue into the future.  Obviously it has not and this has had knock-on effects in terms of the number of people employed in the construction sector and those related to it, and in respect of tax receipts to the Exchequer.  Much of the current expenditure built up over recent years was built on the back of those tax receipts.  These are gone now and are not coming back.</P>
        <P>I am sorry that Senator Hanafin has left the Chamber.  He spoke about efforts in the budget to support the construction sector.  We built 90,000 units per year a few years ago.  The prediction is that we will build 15,000 to 20,000 next year.  The construction sector has collapsed and it will never return to what it was.  This was always going to happen.  We could not keep building units at the rate we were doing and expect it to continue.  The comment made is ridiculous and bears no resemblance to reality.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin also stated we were obviously heading for a soft landing until international factors came into play.  I have not heard any economic commentator indicate we were obviously heading for a soft landing.  There was no such obviousness.  The landing would have been different if international circumstances had not occurred at the time our construction industry began to fall.  However, to state we were obviously going to have a soft landing is daft.</P>
        <P>The Senator also praised the Minister for balancing the budget.  Based on the figures we have seen since it was announced, the budget is way off balance.  It bears no resemblance to a balanced budget.  Interestingly and correctly, the Senator referred to this being the worst financial situation in the history of the State and praised the Minister&rsquo;s role.  I have some sympathy for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in his role.  The worst financial situation in the history of the State must reflect in some way on his predecessor, who is now Taoiseach.  He came into the position at a time of continued growth in the economy and managed to leave it in a mess.  Just as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, finds himself in a difficult <Col N="205"/>situation, one must acknowledge that the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, did not cover himself in glory when he was Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin made another point which had nothing to do with the Finance Bill but I want to mention it because I was gob-smacked.  He spoke about the founding administrations of the State and mentioned Mr. de Valera&rsquo;s administration, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the founding of the State.  They were the people in the ditches with guns when the State was founded, trying to undermine the people who founded the State.  They changed their minds subsequently and I acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>The difficulties we find ourselves in now are similar to the difficulties we were in during the 1930s, and Senator Hanafin mentioned that.  Again, Fianna F&aacute;il was in government and made a decision to launch an economic war with our largest trading partner at the time which led to many of the difficulties in which we found ourselves during the 1930s.</P>
        <P>We are heading towards having 10% unemployment next year and increasingly large downturns in our tax take.  The budget is already outdated, as is the Finance Bill.  At its current rate of increase, the national debt is on course to treble during the next three years, which is a phenomenal change in a short period of time.  The Government has handled this abysmally.</P>
        <P>I read the statement issued yesterday in Dublin Castle.  It was full of nice words but it was a rehash of everything we heard before.  There was hardly anything new in it.  At a time when people are looking for leadership from the Government, this was an appalling missed opportunity.  I regret that I cannot support the Finance Bill as it is drafted.  I hope that in 2009 we will see more realism and leadership with regard to the public finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their comments and I will try to address each of them as best I can in a moment but, first, I would like to outline for the House the economic context in which this Bill is being presented.  This debate is taking place against the backdrop of a dramatically changed economic environment.  We see the recent effects of developments in the international financial system and the impact that this is having on the global economy and its prospects.  The majority of our trading partners are in or are on the verge of recession and this clearly has an impact on developments here.</P>
        <P>On the domestic front, the contraction in the new house building sector, which will continue into next year, has significantly weakened economic growth.  This has also been associated with a deterioration in consumer sentiment and weakness in the labour market, as evident from the very sharp rise in the numbers on the live register.  On foot of these developments, the economy will contract this year, a fact borne out by national accounts data published recently.  Moreover, as the Minister for Finance indicated in the D&aacute;il recently, activity looks set to contract by approximately 3% to 4% next year.</P>
        <P>However, despite this poor short-term economic outlook we still retain several of the structural achievements of the past decade with more than 600,000 more people now in employment than in 1998 and a doubling of export levels over the past decade.  Our main economic focus now must be the restoration of international cost competitiveness.  It is imperative that we are in a position to take advantage of the global recovery whenever it emerges.  Maintaining public capital investment at high levels relative to national income, boosting productivity and ensuring credibility and sustainability in the public finances will all be helpful in this regard.</P>
        <P>As a number of Senators have noted, yesterday the Government published a framework for sustainable economic renewal, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.  The Taoiseach set out clearly the importance of this initiative and how it will provide this country with a platform on <Col N="206"/>which to build for the future when there will be a new economic order where we need to be positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities that will be presented.</P>
        <P>The measures contained in the Finance Bill will assist greatly as we aim to become the world&rsquo;s leading location for business innovation.  The Bill supports research and development, which is crucial as we develop a critical mass of companies, Irish and international, at the forefront of innovation, creating the products and services of tomorrow.</P>
        <P>The Government envisages Ireland as a country where entrepreneurs from anywhere in the world will want to come because it provides the best environment for the commercialisation of innovative, leading-edge products and services and a key to achieving this will be ensuring that we have the best tax regime.</P>
        <P>The framework for sustainable economic renewal sets out a number of priorities and actions that we will be taking in the short and medium term and creates a focused structure within which future initiatives and actions will be taken.  Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy is a framework that points to Ireland&rsquo;s successful future if we are to do the right things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must address the current economic challenges facing the Irish economy by stabilising the public finances, by improving competitiveness, supporting those who become unemployed and supporting Irish business and multinational companies.  We must invest heavily in research and development and incentivise multinational companies to locate more research and development capacity in Ireland.  This House has heard today how the Bill before it encourages such investment and we must ensure the commercialisation and retention of ideas that flow from that investment.</P>
        <P>It is important that we support high-value innovation of products and services that will create hundreds of thriving Irish companies and associated employment and implement a new green deal to move us away from fossil fuel-based energy production though investment in renewable energy to promote the green enterprise sector and the creation of green-collar jobs.  We must also continue to develop a first-class infrastructure that will improve quality of life and increase the competitiveness of Irish business.</P>
        <P>In each of these areas, we aim to build on our specific strengths and address the threats to our future economic performance.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, this framework should not be seen as an instant solution to all our problems.  Many of the factors that will determine the timing and pace of the recovery, such as exchange and interest rates, are beyond our control.  There are no magic bullets that can allow us to avoid the consequences of the international recession but we refuse to simply weather the perfect storm of negative international economic factors.  We should not lose sight of the fact that while we must confront challenging economic circumstances, there are also great opportunities on the horizon.</P>
        <P>A transformation of the Irish economy is necessary for sustained growth and increasing levels of future national welfare.  Innovation is the key.  Ireland must move up the value chain and assert itself not only as an open enterprise economy with a positive environment for foreign and direct investment but also as an open entrepreneurial economy with significant comparative advantages.  I remind the Senators again that this Bill contributes in a significant manner to that development process.</P>
        <P>A key feature of the smart economy is building the innovation or ideas component of the economy through the utilisation of the knowledge, skills and creativity of people and their ability and effectiveness in translating ideas into valuable processes, products and services.  The framework we published yesterday sets out the strategic direction we wish to take to manage the transition of a new model of sustainable economic growth.  It does not seek to outline all the reforms or measures that will be required across the economy.  Instead, it sets out a clear <Col N="207"/>direction the Government intends to pursue and some of the specific actions we will take in the short term to help get us there.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey also raised the issue of the social partners.  As the Taoiseach noted yesterday, and I accept, this was indeed in Dublin Castle where we will engage intensively with the social partners in the coming weeks on how we can develop and implement this framework beginning with the need to devise a credible timeframe in which to close the gap in the public finances.  The end of year Exchequer returns will inform the discussion with the social partners, which the Government views as a problem solving process.</P>
        <P>The Government believes all of the people involved in that process have the country&rsquo;s interest at heart.  More and more people will lose jobs if we do not face up to the challenges and overcome them.  At the meeting on Tuesday with the social partners, we agreed that we will work together with a specific focus on agreeing, by the end of January, an approach to manage those challenges we now face.</P>
        <P>To reiterate the Taoiseach&rsquo;s point from yesterday, there are those who seem to decry the idea of a shared purpose and a common endeavour.  Social partnership has always had its critics but the Government is committed to that process and to engagement on the basis of mutual dependence and respect, which has always brought about problem solving.  Those who expect to have their needs and ideas considered as part of the national recovery effort have a duty to participate responsibly in that process.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue of Anglo Irish Bank raised by a number of Senators, including Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Fitzgerald and Butler, the precise details of the matter are being investigated by the Financial Regulator but it is apparent that the conduct created an issue in terms of transparency.  Two board members, including the chairman, have resigned as a result and Mr. Donal O&rsquo;Connor has been appointed as chairman of the bank.  These changes will not interrupt the substantial progress which has been made with Anglo Irish Bank regarding recapitalisation.  Anglo Irish Bank remains covered by the Irish Government&rsquo;s guarantee and therefore its depositors and creditors are assured of the security of their funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Financial Regulator has indicated that it became aware, following an inspection earlier this year, of matters surrounding loans from Anglo Irish Bank to Sean FitzPatrick.  While it did not appear that anything illegal took place in regard to these loans, the Financial Regulator was of the view that the practices surrounding these loans were not appropriate.  A review of the matter is also being carried out by the board of Anglo Irish Bank, which now includes two public interest directors, Alan Dukes and Frank Daly.  The Minister for Finance will engage further with the Financial Regulator on these matters.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General of the Department of Finance was advised on Wednesday evening that representatives of the board wished to meet early yesterday morning to advise us of the position.  We had also been aware that in recent days the regulator was conducting a review of related matters.</P>
        <P>As regards financial stability, I want to reiterate that the Government will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure that systemically relevant institutions, such as Anglo Irish Bank, remain sound and viable.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the income levy.  As the Senator is aware, the levy was introduced to restabilise revenues.  As has been stated on a number of occasions, the income levy is progressive.  A rate of 1% applies to gross income up to &euro;100,100 per annum or &euro;1,925 per week, and a rate of 2% will apply to income above that amount.  The Bill provides that a further 1% will be payable on income in excess of &euro;250,120 per annum or &euro;4,810 per week.</P><Col N="208"/>
        <P Just="Left">All social welfare recipients will be excluded from the levy.  There are a number of similar payments made by Departments and agencies other than the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as well as similar payments from other states, and these too will be excluded from the levy.  Those with an entitlement to the medical card will also be exempt from income levy.  An exemption threshold of &euro;18,304 per annum is being set to exclude those on low incomes from the levy.</P>
        <P>An age related exemption for persons aged 65 years and over is being introduced.  These thresholds will be &euro;20,000 per annum with a provision for double that limit for a married couple.</P>
        <P>As previously stated, the income levy is progressive.  It does not apply to low incomes or social welfare payments.  In short, this means the vulnerable and elderly are protected while those best able to pay will pay the most.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Senator also raised the issue of VAT.  The standard VAT rate was increased in the budget by 0.5% as part of a general package of revenue-raising measures to fund key public services.  Already, we are borrowing 10% of all day-to-day public services expenditure.  That is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  Each percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost &euro;450 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points, as has been done in the United Kingdom, would cost approximately &euro;1.125 billion in a full year.</P>
        <P>Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, telecommunications and adult clothing.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that the price of goods and services, which apply at this rate, will increase by 0.41%.  This equates to an increase of 8 cent on a good costing &euro;20, or 41 cent on a good costing &euro;100.  It must be also recognised that around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard rate of VAT and therefore are unaffected by the change in the standard rate.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential on goods between the North and the South.  I would point out that the UK has increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items.  Consequently, there will be no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT rate to 15%. It is important to recognise that the weakening of sterling has had a more significant impact than any VAT changes on relative price differentials between North and South of the Border.</P>
        <P>As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own.  In other words, while it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.  There are means other than reducing VAT of stimulating the economy.  The Government is providing a long-term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the EU.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators, particularly Senators Hanafin, Walsh and Butler,<b> </b>for their support of the Bill and their endorsement of the measures the Government has taken and continues to take to deal with the exceptional economic position in which we find ourselves.  I particularly appreciate their comments on the framework for sustainable economic renewal.  As Senator Hanafin and Senator Walsh said, we have a low tax economy here.  The advances we have made in recent years have put us in a position of having one of the lowest tax regimes in Europe.</P>
        <P>In an international context, the most recent data available from the OECD show that, in 2007, Ireland had the lowest tax wedge in the EU and one of the lowest in the OECD for <Col N="209"/>single people, married one-earner couples with two children and married two-earner couples with two children earning the average wage or 167% of the average wage in the case of married two-earner couples.  It is likely that this situation will continue in 2008 and 2009.  A low tax wedge makes it easier for employers to take on new employees.  In fact, for the seventh consecutive year, when cash benefits are taken into account, married one-earner families face a negative tax burden, receiving more money in cash transfers from the State than they pay out in income tax and social security contributions.  While the Finance Bill includes a small increase in tax to restabilise revenues we, through the advances made in recent years, are in a very good position to absorb it.  I reiterate that the Government has put the minimum wage outside the tax net.  A total of 36% of workers do not pay any tax.  I agree with Senator Hanafin that this Government cares for the less well off.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I disagree with Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s comments<b> </b>that income tax should not have been reduced in the past number of years.  The Senator seems to have forgotten that reducing income tax means that average workers have more money in their pockets.  These measures have increased the take-home pay of everyone in Ireland and have resulted in our being able to remove the minimum wage earners from the tax net altogether.  They have also reduced the cost on employers of taking on employees.  This Government is committed to a low tax burden on workers.  We wish to keep people in jobs and to reduce their tax burden where possible.  Ireland has one of the lowest tax burdens in the entire OECD.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Walsh<b> </b>that the changes made to mortgage interest relief were a positive development.  The Minister for Finance has managed, without any cost to the Exchequer, to refocus the relief on those who need it most.  Senators will be aware of the changes being made to mortgage interest relief in the Bill.  The rate is being increased for first time buyers from 20% to 25% in the first and second years of their mortgage and to 22.5% in the third to fifth years.  It will remain at 20% in the sixth and seventh years.  The rate for non-first time buyers is being reduced from 20% to 15%.  As the Minister said, this ensures a fairer system and helps buyers with the biggest financial exposure and those facing falling property values.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn said that small companies must be supported.  I agree this is important.  The Minister for Finance made the point in his Budget Statement that the Government is committed, despite the need for increased taxes, to maintain and enhance pro-employment business tax relief.  The budget introduced a three year exemption from corporation tax on trading profits and chargeable gains for new companies commencing to trade next year.  The detailed provisions of this measure are set out in the Bill.  New companies commencing to trade in 2009 will benefit from tax exemption, which will be granted by reducing to nil the corporation tax relating to the profits of a new trade and the chargeable gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purposes of a new trade.</P>
        <P>Senator Ouinn also mentioned the increased yield that arose as a result of a reduction in the capital gains tax rate to 20%.  However, a substantial portion of the increased yield arose as a result of the abolition of roll-over relief which effectively resulted in a permanent deferral of the tax that would normally be due.  In other words, the reduced capital gains tax rate was levied on a wider tax base through the reduction of reliefs from this tax.</P>
        <P>With regard to Senator Doherty&rsquo;s<b> </b>suggestion to increase the PAYE credit by 5%, this would cost approximately &euro;130 million in 2009.  This is the first year since 2002 that the employee tax credit has not been increased.  Since 2004, all the main personal tax credits have been substantially increased.  The combined value of the main personal tax credits has increased by 43%.  These increases are ahead of both projected wage growth and the consumer price index from 2004 to end 2009, which are both projected to be about 20% on a cumulative basis.  As a result of the increase in credits in recent years we are now in a position where a single person can <Col N="210"/>earn up to &euro;18,300 before paying any income tax.  In addition, this ensures that minimum wage earners are well outside the liability for tax.  The comparable figure for a married one-earner couple with children is &euro;31,950 and a married two-earner couple is &euro;36,600.</P>
        <P>I must also disagree with Senator Doherty&rsquo;s contention that the changes introduced to the arrangements for the payment of preliminary corporation taxation impose undue pressures on struggling companies.  These new arrangements will impact on only large companies, of which there are approximately 2,500, and they will have no impact on 95% of companies in the State.  The arrangements we are introducing are common across the OECD and, in fact, are less onerous than the quarterly payment arrangements in some of our international competitor countries.  It is recognised that for all of these companies, the fact that the Minister is bringing forward by five months the payment date for more or less half of their preliminary corporation tax, represents an opportunity cost in terms of the alternative use to which they might put those funds.  However, I do not consider this to be onerous because the change involves only large companies paying half of their preliminary tax five months earlier than previously.  If, for example, a company has a profit of &euro;8 million after deductions and allowances and a corporation tax bill of &euro;1 million, the opportunity cost will be about &euro;10,000 &mdash; that is, just an eighth of 1% of their taxable profits.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Doherty made reference to the changes to the research and development tax credit scheme which have been broadly welcomed by industry.  Apart from the generous increase from 20% to 25% in the rate of the research and development tax credit, further significant enhancements to the scheme are included in the Finance Bill which will benefit companies generally, including small companies and those in the start-up phase.  He also expressed concerns about the time limit on companies making a claim in respect of a tax credit.  The Bill provides that such claims must be made within 12 months from the end of the accounting period in which research and development expenditure giving rise to the tax credit was incurred and applies to claims made on or after 1 January 2009.  In general, this is a reasonable requirement for the future.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, it is gratifying to hear Senator Ryan welcome the cycle to work scheme.  The scheme will encourage people away from car use, thereby reducing greenhouse gases and traffic congestion while also contributing to the health of those who participate.  Although described as &ldquo;a piece of the jigsaw&rdquo;, it is only by putting in place such pieces that we can hope to achieve the &ldquo;bigger picture&rdquo;.  I thank Senators for their contributions and hope I have, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, addressed the main points they raised.  As always in the Seanad, this has been a constructive debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">Commission on Taxation.</P>
        <P LI="1">1.&mdash;The Minister shall ask the Commission on Taxation to produce a report within 6 months of the commencement of the Act to address the following matters:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) private hospital and nursing home tax exemptions,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) property based tax breaks,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the impact of the value added tax differential between the north of Ireland and the south of Ireland,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) persons claiming to be non-resident for tax purposes,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) the impact of the 1 per cent levy on consumer spending.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a very good amendment because it examines the Commission on Taxation.  The Commission on Taxation was given a lot of work to do in the last budget.  It has to examine a range of tax concessions and new taxes which the Government would like to impose, but it is important the commission examines the effects many of these tax breaks have on our economy. <Col N="212"/> For many exemptions, such as the private hospital and nursing home tax exemptions, we do not know how much they cost the Government.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, put a clause into the Finance Bill whereby everybody who claimed these, mainly property-based, tax breaks had to fill in tax returns to let the Government know exactly how much they were benefiting from this.  The Government should easily be able to put this information together and find out how much people are benefiting from tax loopholes.  The impact of the private hospital and nursing home tax exemption, property based tax breaks and the VAT difference between the North and South of Ireland are all very important.</P>
        <P>Some are trying to make out that the only reason people are flying up to Northern Ireland is the sterling-euro exchange rate but there is a large difference between VAT rates North and South and that is having a major impact.  It also gives the perception that there is a problem.  We should be seeking to normalise trading between the North and South of this island in the long term.  We see many high profile cases of people claiming to be non-residents for tax purposes and avoiding significant amounts of tax.  The impact of the 1% levy on consumers is very important and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be difficulty with the other paragraphs but I am looking in particular at paragraph (<i>e</i>).  The Minister has made it clear that he has factored in all the costs and implications of taxation.  There is a convention in this House and in other parliaments throughout Europe that one does not mention certain events that occurred in the past, including the Civil War.  Unfortunately, Senator John Paul Phelan gratuitously mentioned the Civil war this morning.  In the spirit of Christmas, I will just say that the convention should be adhered to in the future.  It was wrong to say what he said, but I am sure it will not happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, what was the gratuitous insult to which the Senator referred?  I was here at the time and I do not remember anything more than a misinterpretation of the historical facts being put before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister of State to speak on the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Commission on Taxation was established in February 2008.  The purpose of the commission is to review the structure, efficiency and appropriateness of the Irish taxation system.  The work of the commission will set the framework within which tax policy will be set for the next decade.  It is important that the commission takes a strategic, considered and balanced perspective that recognises the evolving challenges we face.  Therefore, the terms of reference of the commission are broadly defined and far-reaching and allow for consideration of all aspects of the Irish taxation system.</P>
        <P>Introducing the type of very specific terms of reference as the Senator has proposed would only serve to restrict the work of the commission and place it under unnecessary constraints.  If we were to make the terms of reference so specific that they would remove discretion from the commission, why would there be need for a commission in the first place?  It is also important the commission retains an independent role in the course of its deliberations.  For that reason, it is not appropriate to comment on further specific proposals made to the commission at this stage.</P><Col N="213"/>
        <P>The members of the commission are drawn from the social partners and the accounting and tax advisory sectors, and they also include accomplished people with environmental and economic expertise, as well as people who have wide experience in central and local government.  The wide range of skills and knowledge of the members of the commission will help ensure that we get a report that can help shape future policy in a positive manner.  Therefore, I do not accept this recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Doherty pressing his recommendation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed, I am.  Property-based tax breaks, especially tax breaks which facilitate the privatisation of our health care system, have made very little difference to the long-term performance of our economy.  However, they have resulted in the State forgoing hundreds of millions of euro in revenue.  A recent article published in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> showed that a tax investor who puts &euro;75,000 worth of equity into a private hospital would benefit to the amount of &euro;293,000 in capital allowances over seven years.  That would offset the investor&rsquo;s tax bill on any other rental income.  The investment has been described as a State subsidised bonanza for extremely wealthy investors who will be queueing up to direct their money into private hospitals at a time when there is a property slump.  These tax breaks will do nothing for our economy, but will do more damage to our public health care system.</P>
        <P>I call for a review of the VAT system because we have continued evidence of price disparities.  A recent survey has shown that homeware was as much as 53% more expensive at Laura Ashley and 49% more expensive at Dunnes Stores, while clothing at Monsoon, Reiss and Next were 40%, 33% and 37% more expensive in outlets in the Twenty-six Counties, respectively, than in the Six Counties.  Therefore, I am pressing the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support Senator Doherty&rsquo;s recommendation, especially regarding the 1% levy.  We have a small business and I must say that it is impossible for people to make ends meet.  There have been increases in energy costs and commercial rates, and people just do not have the same spending power as before.  I admit that I am one of those desperate shoppers and the disparity in high street shop prices on either side of the Border is incredible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference of the commission are wide enough to cover the areas being raised by the Senators.  Tax incentives are clearly within the remit of the commission on taxation, but I will bring the comments of the Senators to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendation simply requires that the Minister requests a study to be done within six months of the enactment of the Bill.  If he is unwilling to give that commitment, I must press the recommendation on this important issue.</P>
        <P>Recommendation put.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, line 40, to delete &ldquo;&euro;18,304&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;37,000&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This recommendation aims to increase the number of people who are exempt from the 1% levy.  The Government decision to take cash from households at a time when their spending power has been severely diminished is a regressive one.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that the PAYE tax credit be increased by 5% to give households more purchasing power at a time when inflation is persistently above 4% and energy costs are the subject of double-digit increases.  The &euro;18,000 breather does not prevent low income families from being penalised.  Given that our economy is based on consumption and spending, why is the Minister for Finance stymying the spending power of households that could help to ease the recession at a time when economic activity is plummeting?  Why did the Minister not remove the PRSI ceiling to ensure that low income families are not touched by this tax increase?  This recommendation proposes to increase the &euro;18,000 threshold, which my party feels is far too low.  We want those earning under &euro;37,000 to be exempt from the 1% levy.  The Government should accept the recommendation because it would set a fairer threshold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Doherty&rsquo;s recommendation would almost double the exemption threshold applying to the income levy from &euro;18,304 to &euro;37,000.  The cost of such a measure would be &euro;185 million in 2009 and &euro;265 million in a full year.  Not only would this measure involve a significant cost, it would also be 7% in excess of the average industrial wage for 2009.  It should be noted that to maintain the current budget parameters, the cost of this recommend<Col N="215"/>ation would have to be recouped from elsewhere.  I believe the current structure of the levy is fair and equitable.  It is straightforward and readily collectable.  The Minister has introduced measures in the Bill to ensure the lowest paid will be exempt from the levy.  As the Minister stated in his budget speech, the levy is being introduced to allow income earners to contribute in a proportionate manner to the restoration of order and stability in the public finances.  Therefore, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the approaches to taxing income are a bit of a mess.  With the income levy a person can change from paying nothing to paying a significant amount on the flip of a euro, which is discriminatory.  This is why we propose a graded increase for people who are required to pay the levy, which would be fairer than the proposal in the Bill.  The Government may need to review all such payments.  There are different thresholds and income limits for an entire range of payments.  Some people running businesses will need to employ people to work out these rates.  Not only is this provision discriminatory against the person required to pay the income levy, but it adds an additional burden on the administration of companies with all these different thresholds.  PRSI, the income levy, the health levy and income tax itself are all taxes on the people.  They are a bit of a mess and need serious review.  The levy is bad for the person who must pay it and a mess for employers who have enough on their hands without having to deal with this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>In his reply, the Minister of State spoke about the proposal to double the exemption.  In reality this levy is not in place until the Bill is enacted.  The Government is trying to force low and middle-income earners to pay more.  These are people caught in a poverty trap.  In my Second Stage speech, I outlined the difficulties that many within these brackets face, including increases in the cost of fuel prices, food, home heating, child care and mortgages, which are all leading to a poverty trap.  The Government may not realise that people earning less than &euro;37,000 are struggling and should not be burdened with this 1% levy.  They are already paying their VAT.  The Cabinet has lost touch with the reality of the suffering and hardship people are facing throughout the year, particularly coming up to Christmas and the demands on families.  The Government is placing additional burdens on people.</P>
        <P>People I meet in my constituency and elsewhere in the State are appalled at some of the excesses at Government level.  It is clear the Government does not understand the hardships being felt on the ground.  If it did, the T&aacute;naiste would not have her toilet refurbished at a cost of &euro;47,000, nor would she spend nights in Dubai at &euro;811 per night.  The Cabinet is completely out of touch and does not understand that people earning up to &euro;37,000 are caught in a poverty trap and should not be subject to this levy.  I intend to press the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey&rsquo;s recommendation would introduce a fourth rate of 0.5% to the income levy, which would apply for incomes between &euro;18,304 and &euro;28,304 in the case of persons aged between 65 and under and for income between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000 for single persons aged over 65 and between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000 for a married couple where one or both are aged 65 or over.  This would cost approximately &euro;60 million in a full year and the maximum benefit to individual workers would be less than &euro;3 per week.  It would also create considerable difficulties in payroll implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone on standard income is paying PRSI, the income levy, income tax and a health levy.  They all have different minimum thresholds and exemption limits.  Would it not be appropriate to tidy up them all?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="216"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are step effects in our current taxation system which have been in place for a number of years.  For example there is a step in the current health levy and the PRSI system.  There is no compelling evidence that these step effects have discouraged workers from accepting increases in pay.  There is precedence for the current income levy structure.  The income levy introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Government in 1993 had a step effect, as did the income levy introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Government in the early 1980s.  The health levy is exempt for those earning less than &euro;500 per week or &euro;26,000 per annum.  Once a person goes above this threshold he or she will pay the levy on all income, including the first &euro;26,000.</P>
        <P>In the PRSI system there is an exemption limit of &euro;352 per week or &euro;18,304 per annum.  Once a person goes above this threshold he or she will pay 4% PRSI on all income except the first &euro;127.  With the income levy, once a person goes above the &euro;18,304 limit he or she will pay 1% on all his or her income.  For a person whose income increases by &euro;1 per week over the threshold they will pay an extra &euro;3.50 per week.  This demonstrates that the step effect in the income levy is smaller than the steps in the health levy or the PRSI system.</P>
        <P>This levy will aid in the restoration of order and stability in the public finances and will enable Ireland to return as soon as possible to a natural level of economic growth.  Economic growth and the provision of high-quality public services are essential in a modern economy.  This measure is forward-looking and will have a positive impact on the future.  The Minister has said in the D&aacute;il that the Commission on Taxation may consider these issues.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 2<i>b</i>: </P>
        <P LI="1">In page 38, line 18, after &ldquo;year&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>

	<P>Income tax relief in respect of health expenses will be granted at the standard rate of tax for 2009, with the exception of nursing home fees which will continue to be granted at an individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax.  The change provided for in the Finance Bill follows on from the changes made in the Finance Act 2007, that is, the removal of the <i>de minimus</i> threshold of &euro;125 for a single individual and &euro;250 for a married couple.  The Finance Act 2007 also provided for the removal of the requirement that there would be a defined relationship between the taxpayer and the person who is the subject of the tax claim.  Standard rating health expenses relief will make the tax system fairer and more equitable for all taxpayers in accordance with the commitment in this regard in the programme for Government.  The standardising of health expenses relief brings it in line with other reliefs such as rent relief, trade union subscription relief, medical insurance relief, third level fees relief and service charges relief.  In addition, the standard rating of health expenses relief will mean better value for money for the Exchequer and will ensure that the relief will benefit the broadest range of taxpayers in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
        <P>With regard to Senator Kelly&rsquo;s recommendation, while I am sympathetic to the individuals undergoing IVF treatment, given the very significant costs they face, the Minister does not believe that one particular treatment or medical procedure could readily be singled out for marginal relief while other treatments are standard-rated.  Other Opposition Members have sought the retention of marginal relief for orthodontic treatment that can also involve significant cost.</P>
        <P>I understand that what the Senator has in mind is that the higher rate of taxpayers, who are aged 70 years or over, will be allowed to deduct health expenses at their marginal rate.  The biggest health expense which an elderly person may face is nursing home fees and the Minister has introduced an amendment to ensure that such fees will continue to be deductible at a taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate.  The majority of persons aged over 70 years of age have no liability at the higher rate and many are exempt from tax altogether.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed the Minister that approximately 90% of all income tax earners aged over 70 do not have a liability at the higher rate and therefore would not be in a position to benefit from this recommendation.</P>
        <P>I do not believe it can be justified to provide a special regime to higher taxpayers based on their age and, for those reasons, I cannot accept the recommendation.  However, as I indicated, the Minister is prepared to keep the IVF matter under review.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The last couple of sections of the Bill were approved by the House.  I will point out to the Minister of State that Government Mercedes cars do not come under the heading of benefits-in-kind, BIK, nor are they liable for the parking levy.  The only thing the ordinary person gets out of those sections of the Bill is a bicycle.  We are making a special case for ourselves and separating ourselves from the public.  The provisions in these sections should apply to Government as much as they apply to the ordinary citizen.</P><Col N="218"/>
        <P>The Minister of State is painting this as trying to be fair to every single citizen and that is wrong.  These are significant costs for elderly people, especially as the Minister has got rid of their automatic entitlement to a medical card.</P>
        <P>I refer to my recommendation 2<i>c</i> on the impact of dental costs on families and children under the age of 16.  Orthodontics, dental work and health care are a huge expense for elderly people and young families.  To suggest that everyone will be treated equally is completely wrong.  The State should be providing many of these services and it fails to provide them.  The marginal rate of tax relief should be allowed to apply to this extremely costly expense for many families.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will know that many young children will receive dental treatment over a continuous period of time and they may well be undergoing treatment not yet paid for, and parents will be hammered by not getting the tax relief on the extra costs.  The same will apply to some individuals over the age of 70.  Their automatic entitlement to a medical card has been taken away from them.  If they have substantial health care costs within the community and they are not ill enough to go to a nursing home, they will be heavily penalised by this measure.  This measure is incredibly regressive and is not fair.</P>

I have pointed out the substantial cost of this to some families.  The Minister does not accept that this should be repealed and that families should be able to continue to write off the cost of orthodontics and other expensive dental work.

	<P>The initiative on health expenses relief will yield &euro;120 million in 2010 and &euro;150 million in a full year.  The changes provided for in the Finance Bill follow on from the changes made in Finance Act 2007, that is, the removal of the <i>de minimis</i> threshold of &euro;125 for a single individual and &euro;250 for a married couple.  The Finance Act 2007 also provided for the removal of the requirement that there be a defined relationship between the taxpayer and the person who is the subject of the tax claim.</P>
        <P>Standard rating health relief expenses will make the tax system fairer and more equitable for all taxpayers.  The programme for Government commits to increasing the fairness of the tax system and this measure is being introduced in line with this commitment.  The standardising of health expenses relief is in line with other reliefs such as rent relief, trade union subscriptions and so on.  The standard rating of health expenses relief will mean better value for money for the Exchequer and will ensure the relief will benefit the broadest range of taxpayers in a fair and equitable manner.  It is difficult to justify reliefs for one sector of society just because they earn more than another sector.  Health expenses relief is an expensive relief and has quadrupled in the past four years.  It has risen in cost from &euro;100 million in 2004 to &euro;400 million in 2008.  It is difficult to see how we can afford such a generous relief in these challenging economic times.  There can be no doubt that the savings accrued from standard rating health expenses relief, some &euro;150 million in a full year, will raise much needed revenue.  The Minister has received a number of submissions from the dental profession setting out its concerns in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Orthodontics have a lifelong impact on a young person if there is a failure to complete proper orthodontic work on him or her.  The availability of orthodontic work in the public system in this country is abysmal.  Most families must do this on their own.  It is not just a question of how a child&rsquo;s teeth are from a functional point of view.  There is also the psychological aspect of young children who have significant dental problems and who need extensive orthodontic and other remedial dental work.  This expensive work is not available in the public system.  We should not just look at the physical part of dentition but also the psychological effects on young teenagers when they are unable to get this work done properly.  The argument that there is a sense of fairness in this is wrong.  We should provide this service publicly to young teenagers and children.  The Minister of State should re-examine this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The dental profession has sought the extension of the relief to routine dental treatment, basing this on a comparison with relief available for routine doctors visits.  Routine dental treatment has never qualified for tax relief and dentists are not in competition <Col N="220"/>with doctors.  In any event, the cost of such a concession is estimated to be very high and, given the current fiscal situation, such a concession is out of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this recommendation.  The recommendation does not set out what relief should be imposed or if one should be imposed at all.  It calls for the Commission on Taxation to produce a report within three months on the dental costs of families with children under 16.  The report will come up with findings.  The reality is that many families cannot afford this dental work.  The longer it goes on without being dealt with, the more costly it becomes for families.  Not only is this an issue of cost, the person who needs the work done sometimes retreats within and becomes shy or embarrassed in society or among friends.  This is because of the work that cannot be done because of the extortionate cost.  This should be readily and freely available in the public sector.  I support this amendment and the Minister of State should not deny the right of the Government to ask the Commission on Taxation to examine this report.  It does not have to be implemented if the Government does not want to but we should have a report from the commission on the cost to families of this treatment.</P>

It will enable us to benefit from emerging areas of growth in the future.  These factors are especially important in light of the current increasing competition that Ireland faces from other jurisdictions in attracting highly skilled people.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the reasons given in the correspondence.  It is important that this Bill contains a measure to rule out tax incentives for private hospitals and private nursing homes.  We know the situation with regard to public hospitals.  We heard the announcements in the 2009 service plan on the cuts that will be made which, including the other &euro;400 million, will amount to approximately &euro;1 billion.  At the same time the Government is providing tax incentives for private hospitals and not everyone can avail of such facilities.  However, everyone must invest in them.  If private hospitals want to exist, let them do so but they should not be funded by people earning just above the minimum wage who will never be able to avail of their services.  I am disappointed that recommendation No. 3 cannot be pressed today but I recognise the ruling of the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="222"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We should examine the issue of private hospitals.  A new tax is being introduced on young families whereby they must pay a levy on their private health insurance.  We face increasing unemployment and an additional burden will be placed on young families which may mean they will fail to pay for private health insurance.  This in itself is wrong when we consider the savage cutbacks in the public health services.  Many private hospitals will not survive because they will have a smaller pool of patients because young families will not be able to pay for private health insurance.</P>
        <P>The Government seems to be introducing this levy to subsidise the VHI and the argument is made constantly that older people must pay large premiums.  To the best of my knowledge, the High Court judgment got rid of risk equalisation but not community rating.  One cannot be rated according to age or illness as long as community rating survives and therefore everyone must pay the same premium.  If the Minister of State is knowledgeable on this issue, I ask him to inform the House on it.  I believe the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is misleading the public on why she has increased the tax burden on young families to subsidise the VHI.</P>

	<P>Yes, but we are discussing section 16.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will broadly address the issue raised.  The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as registered nursing homes and private hospitals came into effect in April 1998 and May 2002, respectively.  The purpose of the schemes is to attract private investment into the provision of nursing homes and hospitals.  Under the schemes, investors can write off their investments in a nursing home or hospital against their tax liability over a period of seven years but are obliged to retain their investment in the nursing home or hospital for 15 years.  These tax incentives have proved to be an effective way of attracting the necessary private investment into areas of the economy where investment is needed.</P>
        <P>Senators will recall the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor undertook a major review of the property-based incentive schemes in 2005.  In this context, his Department commissioned Indecon International economic consultants to carry out a detailed review of certain sectoral property-based tax incentive schemes, including the schemes for registered nursing homes and private hospitals.  In its 2006 report, Indecon indicated that the scheme for registered nursing homes had been effective in increasing the supply of nursing home places and that many projects either would not have proceeded or would have taken longer to come on stream in the absence of the tax incentive.  Indecon identified a need for ongoing investment in private nursing homes that would assist in reducing demands on the public sector and provide a valuable service for those in need of nursing homes.</P>
        <P>With regard to private hospitals, Indecon indicated that the scheme had the potential to address supply shortages in the hospital sector and to reduce costs.  It concluded that most of the extra investment in the sector either would not have been undertaken or would have taken longer to have come on stream in the absence of the tax incentive scheme.  It identified a need for ongoing investment in private hospitals to free up beds in public hospitals currently used by private patients and to reduce demands on the public hospital sector.</P>
        <P>The Minister fully supports the recommendations made by the consultants on the ongoing need for investment in both of these areas.  The Government is committed to a health strategy that uses a combination of public and private provision of nursing home and hospital care.  Private facilities have proved to be cost effective when compared with the cost of direct provision.  With regard to private hospitals, several have been built already and are operating <Col N="223"/>successfully while several more are in the pipeline.  These include the co-located hospitals which will be constructed on the campuses of existing public hospitals and this will make a significant contribution to freeing up public beds for public rather than private patients.  The Minister is satisfied that the tax incentives have already made an important contribution to the increase in hospital beds and services and that they will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>In addition to their relative cost effectiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> public provision, the construction of new private health facilities has other positive economic and Exchequer benefits such as the additional economic activity and employment generated by construction and related services.  The creation of employment opportunities is especially important in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed recommendation, it should be borne in mind that closing capital allowance schemes suddenly can have unforeseen consequences.  As capital allowances are spread over a seven-year period, an immediate cessation of tax relief would result in an investor not being entitled to an allowance in circumstances where the investor had already made a decision to invest based on receiving these allowances.</P>
        <P>In the case of facilities that have not yet been built and are still at the planning stage, promoters and developers would expect to be in a position to recover development costs incurred by passing them on to investors who in turn qualify for capital allowances on their investments.  Ceasing tax incentives for private nursing homes and hospitals as suggested therefore could be seriously prejudicial to genuine investors and promoters alike who would have incurred costs on the basis that the properties would carry the relief and this might leave the State open to serious legal challenges in this regard.</P>
        <P>The legislation on the levy, which Senator Twomey mentioned, has not yet been published.  If we await its publication, we can discuss it then.</P>

	<P>With regard to section 16, it should be borne in mind that many private hospitals which benefit from these tax exemptions are not very profitable at present.  They are not in a great financial state.  This issue needs to be examined in the context of restricting the number of people with medical cards and people not paying for private health insurance because of what the Government plans to do in the new year and what is happening in the economy.  Senator Doherty and I may not come from the same side of the coin ideologically but I do not like to see tax exemptions wasted on white elephant projects throughout the country.  The Government needs to be careful and this should be re-examined in light of what is happening.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State quoted the Indecon report.  Let us be clear on what Indecon called for with regard to property-based tax incentive schemes.  It called for direct public investment to be used as an alternative to property-based tax breaks.  This is what my recommendation dealt with.  Tax exemptions apply only to very wealthy investors who can offset a large amount of rental income from property.  Such investors can offset hundreds of millions of euro in other rental income through the building of private hospitals and that can result in a huge reduction in their tax bills.  It is not just a question of whether this State should have a two tier health system.  It is about income that should come from wealthy people in the State to the State to allow it provide other services.  </P>
        <P>Unfortunately, as the Minister reiterated, this Government is committed to pursuing a two tier apartheid health system in this State.  It happens every time the Government pushes ahead with front-line health cuts and closure of vital services such as accident and emergency in rural <Col N="224"/>Ireland.  It is a disgrace, given the economic position, that we continue to allow the wealthiest people in Irish society to avoid paying tax and plunge money into what is an unequal system.  If that money were allocated to public services there is no doubt we would be able to save lives and provide better health care for all the people of this State.</P>

	<P>I would like to make a contribution on that issue because the position outlined by Senator Doherty is not correct.  While I will always support a measure that is good for society, there is a huge degree of risk involved and there must be an incentive for the risk taker.  As I have often said here, if there are no golden geese there will be no golden eggs.  This is a major employer in rural Ireland as well as in the towns and cities of our country.</P>

        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Sections 17 to 19, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 52, before section 20, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;20.&mdash;Section 26 of the Finance Act 2008 is repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section deals with capital allowance for qualifying specialist palliative care units.  In layman&rsquo;s terms it is similar to the recommendation ruled out of order.  It concerns subsidising private hospices throughout the State.  I propose the deletion of lines 1 to 21 and repeal section 26 of the Finance Act 2008.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that 12 counties do not have any hospice facilities and there is a national shortage of beds and care staff but, in encouraging private hospices, the Government is only exacerbating the inequality in hospice care. There should be no doubt that end of life care should be available to everyone, regardless of their incomes.  My recommendation proposes that the section in the legislation be repealed and that the State to do its job and provide public end of life care that is accessible to all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Doherty&rsquo;s comment on the availability of palliative care services, which are abysmal.  It is shocking that many areas of the country do not have proper hospice care facilities to care for people with specific and special palliative care <Col N="225"/>needs.  In my county I believe there are two dedicated beds in an ordinary nursing home that were handed over for the provision of palliative care.  We do not have a full palliative care team.  A palliative care team involves a wider structure, which I will not detail now, but it does not exist in my county.  In some parts of the country up to 83% of palliative care is provided by way of voluntary contributions, while in other areas 83% of the cost is provided by central government funds.  There is gross inequality when it comes to the provision of palliative care throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I do not mind that this exists in this Finance Bill and I will explain the reason for that.  Because of the absolute lack of available services, there are private hospice centres providing excellent services but they are very expensive because the families pay for everything.  As hospice palliative care often involves people with chronic illnesses such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other degenerative conditions, it is an unbelievable cost to the families involved.  I do not see any other way of providing these services in the short term unless some form of incentive is given.  It is detrimental to families.  It has an unbelievable long-term effect on the entire family when palliative care services are not delivered to the family involved.</P>
        <P>The Government should pay for this very expensive service.  People will not make money out of the palliative care service.  They may in time make money out of a private hospital because they can cherry-pick off the public sector in the future but they will not make money out of palliative care.  The Government might have to examine that in terms of supporting families.  They may or may not become part of the new deal in time but there is a need to support families when it comes to palliative care.  I hope they will become part of the new deal process.  I do not have an objection to that but I agree with Senator Doherty on the non-existence of these services and the fact that they be provided by voluntary organisations in most parts of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Doherty has proposed that the new scheme of capital allowances regarding the construction and refurbishment of buildings to be used as specialist palliative care units does not come into effect.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2008 but has yet to receive European Union Commission approval from a State aid perspective and be commenced by the Minister.  It was introduced in response to identified gaps in the supply of and demand for palliative care facilities around the country.  The scheme has similar terms, conditions and exclusions to those that apply in the case of qualifying private hospitals and qualifying mental health centres.  It aims to encourage private sector investment to fill some of these gaps but only where proposed developments of facilities are in line with the longer term public health policy objectives in this area.  For expenditure to qualify for capital allowances, the development of a facility must have pre-approval from the Health Service Executive, with the consent of the Minister for Health and Children, as being in line with national development plans and needs assessments for palliative care facilities.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, this Finance Bill contains amendments that will make the scheme more effective when it comes into operation.  Because the Minister was persuaded by the arguments made during the D&aacute;il debate on the introduction of this scheme in the Finance Bill 2008 that the minimum bed capacity requirement of 20 beds could be a significant hurdle for some palliative care units, he is lowering this requirement to eight beds.  He is also allowing capital expenditure under the scheme to qualify for capital allowances from the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2008 because he did not think it reasonable that legitimate capital expenditure on qualifying projects should be excluded from benefiting under the scheme in the period pending EU Commission approval.</P><Col N="226"/>
        <P>Tax incentives for similar schemes have proved to be an effective way of attracting the necessary private investment into areas of the economy where investment is needed.  The Minister believes this scheme has the potential to make a real contribution to increasing the provision of much needed palliative care facilities and, therefore, he is unable to accept the recommendation.  However, as with other similar schemes that have been reviewed in recent years, he will keep this scheme under review to ensure it meets the requirements he has in mind for it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make some brief comments on one of the urban docklands areas, Cork docklands.  While I welcome some of what the Minister has done in the Finance Bill regarding Seveso sites, he has not gone far enough.  I say that for a number of reasons.  The Cork docklands regeneration project is of particular importance not just to Cork but to the region.  Cork docklands is a pivotal part of the national spatial strategy&rsquo;s gateway innovation fund.  However, it has received lip service from the Government.</P>
        <P>Prior to the last general election promises were made about the delivery of the eastern gateway bridge and putting various funding mechanisms in place, but nothing has happened.  I welcome the Seveso sites initiative because 77% of the land in the Cork docklands area is frozen at present.  It requires a major amount of work.  Land must be levelled, Seveso sites must be removed and businesses must be relocated.  However, the landowners and Cork City Council, which are the stakeholders, are at an impasse.  There has not been a clear and unambiguous commitment to fund the gateway bridge.  The programme launched yesterday and this Finance Bill were two vehicles in which a commitment to that bridge could have been met.  I readily accept that the Seveso site tax incentive scheme announced in the budget will assist part of the process, and I welcome that.</P>
        <P>A second major piece of the jigsaw to instill confidence in developers was the funding of the eastern gateway bridge.  The Government has kicked to touch on that.  The section of the Bill dealing with relocation schemes and Seveso sites covers part of it but it is rhetoric if there is no action.  Why is there a failure on the part of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish the Cork docklands report?  That started in the Department of the iar-Taoiseach.  He established a forum but when the Government changed, the issue was moved to another Minister.  I am disappointed the Green Party Members are not present because the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, has had the report since last summer but we have heard nothing about it.  Why is he afraid to publish the report?  Surely it could have been published in tandem with the budget and this Bill.</P>
        <P>On 9 October last I raised this issue on the Adjournment of the Seanad and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, replied on behalf of the Minister.  He said: &ldquo;While the Minister is aware that the main content of the report was recently reported in the national press, he does not believe its formal publication at this time would serve a useful purpose.&rdquo;  Why is that the case?  If section 41 is implemented and if land in Cork is changed and upgraded in this major project, it will free 160 hectares in the city centre, create thousands of jobs and accommo<Col N="227"/>date new industry.  It could very well become the regeneration project for Cork just as Dublin docklands was for Dublin.  The forum report was leaked and an initiative in Cork City Council for a regeneration agency is being mentioned.</P>
        <P>There is much in section 41 to be commended.  However, parts of it are vague and do not go far enough.  Where is the report?  Where is the commitment to the gateway funding for the bridge?  Two years later why is there a failure to provide a full line commitment to the people of Cork?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be as helpful as possible to Senator Buttimer regarding the eastern gateway bridge.  There is a submission from Cork City Council to the gateway innovation fund for &euro;60 million, with &euro;20 million to be provided by the council.  Decisions on the gateway innovation funding have been put in abeyance until after 2009.  That reflects the review of capital expenditure and the Government decision of July 2008.  The forum report mentioned by the Senator has been received and is being considered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It will be considered in the overall context of the public finances.  Section 21 applies to all docklands, not just Cork.  The tax incentives are generous, with 100% capital allowances.  It is the only new incentive introduced in this year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply but this must be put in context.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach launched a programme in Dublin Castle.  If we are serious about developing the regions, Ireland does not stop at the end of the M50 or the Red Cow roundabout.  I do not subscribe to that view, and the Minister, being from Kerry, will not either.  We have dealt with the Seveso sites and given certain tax incentives but we have not expanded the most important one to give confidence to the developers to come in there.  Unlike other parts of the country, Cork has experienced massive unemployment in the past six months.  At a time of recession this scheme would have created jobs and confidence and would have given impetus to Cork city.</P>
        <P>The plan unveiled yesterday was the vehicle to promote Cork and its docklands as the project for Cork.  Why is the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, not publishing the report six months after he received it?  I do not understand it.  I accept that the gateway innovation fund is frozen and that the Government does not have the money, but it should spend money on this.  It will get a return on the investment.  Why is the Government&rsquo;s commitment waning?  Have the Cork Ministers in Cabinet lost their influence and power?  Do the people of Cork not matter?  The project has been put forward but Cork people are now being given empty rhetoric.  The Government has provided section 41 of the Finance Bill and certain tax incentives but what is it saying to the landowners, developers and Cork City Council?  The council established a separate directorate, unique to Cork city and many councils, on this project.  It beggars belief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the publication of the report, I will ask the office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to contact the Senator to bring him up to date on the position.  Given its responsibility to the entire State, the Government cannot single out a project in a given city, regardless of its merits.  I am confident, however, that the project to which the Senator refers, with its high employment potential, will be considered when resources allow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move recommendation No. 4<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 63, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>)(i), line 10, to delete &ldquo;23 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;22 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The recommendation proposes that the DIRT tax rate would be 22% rather than 23%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are various reasons for the increase of three percentage points in the DIRT rate.  It was necessitated by general budgetary constraints.  The Minister announced in his budget speech that this overall measure, including the increase on collective investment funds and life assurance products, would raise &euro;85 million in 2009.  The capital gains and capital <Col N="230"/>acquisition tax rates were increased by 2%.  While the DIRT rates were increased by 3%, unlike other types of income, the 1% levy does not apply to deposit interest.</P>
        <P>The Minister was also influenced by the fact that general levels of deposits in banks are currently high.  This specific recommendation applies to deposit interest earned on savings and special term accounts only.  Based on this recommendation, deposit interest retention tax would be charged on interest earned on those accounts at a rate of 22% rather than 23%, as is currently proposed in section 26.  The other rate change provided for in section 26, which relates to the vast majority of deposit accounts, would remain unaltered.  This amendment would also favour special savings and special term accounts over similar accounts held in credit unions.  The accounts covered by the amendment already benefit from favourable treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding special term accounts, part of the interest earned on such accounts is exempt from DIRT.  In the case of a deposit held in a medium term account, the amount is &euro;380 and &euro;635 where the deposit is held in a long term account.  Interest on both special savings and special term accounts is not liable to PRSI or health levies.  It has not been possible to open a special savings account since 1 April 2001.  For those reasons, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is unable to accept the recommendation.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 4<i>c</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 76, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), to delete lines 6 to 20 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo; &lsquo;Threshold amount&rsquo; means a baseline of zero spending on research and development as and from the start of the tax year 2009;&rdquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We would like to see all money invested in research allowed as tax deductible.  The current situation is that the baseline is only the difference between what one invested in 2003.  Only extra investment is covered in the Bill.  All research and development should be allowed for so we can generate that sort of knowledge and innovation the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, announced yesterday in Dublin Castle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>With this recommendation, Senator Twomey seeks to introduce a volume-based tax credit scheme for research and development, with effect from 2009.  There have been calls over the years for the research and development tax credit to become a volume-based scheme in which all expenditure in this area, and not just incremental expenditure, benefits from the tax credit.</P>
        <P>This would involve a dead weight cost to the Exchequer in respect of research and development that would have been undertaken without the need for a fiscal stimulus and would represent poor value for public money.  Having an incremental scheme has enabled us to provide a high rate of tax credit at 20% which the Minister is now increasing to 25% in this Bill.</P>
        <P>This represents a significant contribution to the efforts of companies in the area of research and development and will help improve the competitiveness of Irish industry internationally.  In this Bill the Minister is permanently setting 2003 as the base year under the scheme.  Expenditure on qualifying research and development in 2003 is the base against which increased expenditure on it in any subsequent year is measured for the purpose of the tax credit.</P><Col N="231"/>
        <P>Under the existing arrangements 2003 will remain the base year, up to and including 2013.  It will also now be the base year for all future accounting periods beyond 2013.  Given the time value of money, the scheme will become volume based on a gradual basis, but without the short run dead weight costs.  Together with the other changes being introduced, including options to ensure the benefit of a research and development tax credit arising in any year will accrue to a company over a minimum of three years, the Minister believes the overall budget and Finance Bill package for the research and development tax credit scheme places Ireland to the fore in terms of similar schemes globally.</P>
        <P>For those reasons, I do not propose to accept the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 35 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister of State to explain a matter to me.  We said we would like all research and development allowable for tax reductions.  He has stated this will happen after 2013 and that 2003 is the baseline level on which the entire amount will be accounted for in 2013 and beyond, but he does not want to see top loading in the system at this time.  </P>
        <P>Research is becoming incredibly important and we want to make ourselves a knowledge-based economy.  Section 35 states that buildings become tax deductible, and that allowances go to the buildings.  The Minister of State should examine the area of research and development to see if it, but not buildings, can receive tax allowances.</P>
        <P>This is a mindset that continues our obsession with property in business.  The intellectual rights of software and many computer applications do not need a physical building.  We need to focus on the fact that research work is vital and is the central core of everything, and move away from buildings.  Let the buildings be an add-on issue and not given the priority they receive here.</P>
        <P>We may find that people who are very innovative in research and development will bring their businesses around and become highly attractive to people.  People who own property may see this as an attractive issue.  If I am reading this correctly, it seems as though we are saying the physical building is part of the research and development, when it is not.  It is a means to an end.  Research and development must be housed somewhere but the concept and mentality of how we think about it must change.  We need to focus on developing concepts and not on fancy buildings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be as helpful as I can to Senator Twomey.  Since the scheme was introduced in 2004, expenditure on new or refurbished buildings used exclusively for research and development activities has attracted a tax credit of 20% of that expenditure, paid over a four year period.  </P>
        <P>Data emerging from the operation of the scheme suggest this part of the scheme is not being used.  This probably reflects the fact that in many instances work on research and development takes place in production or manufacturing environments and not only in laboratory conditions.  The Bill provides that a tax credit of 25% will be available from next year, subject to certain conditions on a proportion of the expenditure incurred on a new or refurbished building used in part for research and development activities.</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P>In this way we hope to capture not just the benefit of additional research and development activities which may be undertaken in conjunction with production and other activities, but also to have the opportunity to benefit from the fruits of that research and development with the potential for additional production activities to be undertaken here.</P>
        <P>The provision requires State aid clearance from the EU Commission, which the Department will pursue and will take effect by way of a commencement order when that clearance is obtained.  The changes to the scheme providing for the payment of any unused tax credit which cannot be offset against current or prior year corporation tax liabilities is being introduced to give companies certainty about the availability of credit.  Another advantage is that it will allow companies to plan their research and development activities in the certain knowledge that they will receive the benefit of the tax credit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>If we left out this section and focused on research and development and the amendment we proposed, we would prevent it from being all about buildings.  The tax concessions given on buildings should go directly to research and development.  This would allow what will happen after 2013 to happen sooner.  There is a mind block on what research and development is about and we should focus tax concession on the actual work.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I appreciate it is not the Minister, Deputy Carey&rsquo;s Department, but on 4 November the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, took my Adjournment debate matter in this House on the travel tax.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s Pauline conversion and flip-flop on the regional airports.  I am a strong defender of my region but I still believe the tax is wrong.  We should not impose a levy on people travelling.  Senator Twomey mentioned this earlier.  According to the Bill &ldquo; &lsquo;aircraft&rsquo; means an aircraft capable of carrying 20 or more passengers&rdquo;.  Why are the Government jet and the private airfields and aeroplanes not included?  If I am wrong the Minister can correct me, but I do not think they are.</P>
        <P>When CSO figures show a decline in tourists coming into Ireland, particularly into the south west region, it behoves us not to tax but to incentivise and attract people in.  The Minister knows the clich&eacute; that once one imposes a tax or levy it stays the same or increases, but does not decrease.  I hope the Government will not use this tax, as Deputy Breen said last week, to balance the books.  The yield of this tax does not justify the imposition on the regions.  While I welcome the changes, they do not go far enough.  Why is the Government victimising the regions, especially the people of Cork?  I will not read the reply to my Adjournment debate by the Minister, Deputy Mansergh, but this tax is wrong, even in its amended form.</P>
        <P>The Government is making up its aviation policy as it goes along.  As Minister for Transport, a couple of years ago the late Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, God be good to him, made a commitment but subsequent Ministers for Transport, Deputies Cullen and Dempsey, changed that.  We are on the cusp of Cork Airport not getting independence from Dublin.  That has implications.  This is a twin attack on tourism and our aviation industry.  Why are we penalising the airports and, more importantly, the people who have to travel while we exclude the private jets and airfields?</P>

	<P>I have a couple of points and questions for the Minister and he may clarify my reading of this section.  Will stop-over flights, which originate in another state and whose end destination is another state but which stop in Ireland to re-fuel, be subject to this tax?  Could the Minister answer this briefly so I can lead on from it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Stop-over flights are not covered by the tax.  On Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point about small aeroplanes, other EU member states and countries that operate a similar travel tax have a similar arrangement for smaller aircraft.  I have a note on the general issue of the travel tax if the Leas-Chathaoirleach wishes me to read it out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question on the two rates of &euro;2 and &euro;10 which are dealt with in subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) .  I am thinking in particular of Donegal Airport and the flight from there to Glasgow.  Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) refers to:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . the distance between the place of departure of the flight and the place where the flight ends, at the rate of&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) &euro;2 in the case of a flight from an airport to a destination located not more</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>than 300 kilometres from Dublin Airport. . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">I seek clarification.  Is it the distance between the airport from which somebody leaves, for example Farranfore or Donegal Airport, to the destination or the distance between Dublin Airport and the eventual destination?</P>
        <P>The smaller regional airports should have been exempt from this.  We have a serious problem in the north west.  Visitor numbers have declined dramatically.  In some areas, such as Leitrim and Roscommon, expenditure on tourism has been less than 1%.  An incentive is needed to get people into those regions.  Putting an additional burden on those smaller regional airports is excessive and counterproductive.  Some of these regional airports operate international flights, for example, there is a flight from Donegal Airport to Prestwick in Glasgow, which is not subsidised by the State.  It has also taken in charter aeroplanes from Rotterdam and these will all be subject to the levy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All the different agencies and partners are trying to get people into these regions, which do not have access to public transport.  A person cannot fly from Rotterdam to Dublin Airport and then get the train to Gweedore.  There is no train.  The public bus will take one as far as Letterkenny.  It is very important that the vision for these regional airports in very rural communities that need support is welcomed and applauded.  These regions, which have suffered seriously over many years and have seen a significant drop in the amount of tourism generated, should have been exempt from this tax.  I seek clarification on the broader point and an answer on whether the distance is measured from Dublin Airport or the original airport.  What rate would be imposed on the Donegal-Prestwick and Dublin-Rotterdam connections?</P>
        <P>The Minister may be aware that these airports offer a subsidised scheme to cancer patients who cannot go through a four and a half hour journey to Dublin for a couple of minutes treatment.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me there is an exemption for patients with these health needs who travel from these regional airports to the capital city.  If so, the Bill would support what the local voluntary community and airport have done to meet the needs of cancer sufferers as a result of not having the services in the north west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 55 excludes from the tax &ldquo;a person under the age of 2&rdquo;.  Why do we not exempt passengers under the age of five or seven?  Why are children not exempt <Col N="234"/>from this levy?  What do we hope to yield in revenue.  The Minister, Deputy Mansergh, said the original scheme would yield &euro;95 million in 2009 and &euro;150 million in a full year.  What is the revised figure for the scheme?  Why have we penalised families going on holidays in the summer season or coming to Ireland?  Why not put the cap at age seven or eight?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to get information on the last point raised by Senator Buttimer.  Air travel tax will be charged on the departure of a passenger on an aircraft from an airport in the State with effect from 30 March 2009.  The general tax applying will be &euro;10 per passenger.  However, a rate of &euro;2 will apply in the case of a flight from any part of the State to another airport not more than 300 km from Dublin Airport.  Therefore, for the purposes of the calculation of the tax, Sligo, Shannon, Letterkenny and so on will be considered the same as Dublin.  Senator Doherty mentioned Glasgow Prestwick and Rotterdam, for which there will be a charge of &euro;2 and &euro;10, respectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Donegal to Dublin flight be &euro;2?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  All Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the &euro;2 charge.  Airline operators are liable to pay the tax.  Detailed arrangements for the collection of the air travel tax will be contained in regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in introducing an air travel tax.  The UK, France and the Netherlands all apply air travel taxes, while countries further afield such as Australia and New Zealand also operate a departure tax.  Air travel tax will not apply in the case of an aircraft carrying fewer than 20 passengers.  Therefore, it does not apply to flights to or from the Irish offshore islands.  Planes used for these flights would have a maximum passenger capacity of eight or nine.</P>
        <P>The following persons are exempt from the tax: members of the aircraft crew, including any relief crew; a child under the age of two who does not occupy a seat on the aircraft; a disabled person and one person accompanying the disabled person for the purposes of providing care and assistance; and transit and transfer passengers.  The exemption for disabled persons applies where the disabled person had requested and availed of assistance from the airline in accordance with EU Regulation 1107 of 2006, which concerns the rights of disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air.  A transit passenger means a passenger who is on board an aircraft which lands at an airport in the course of its journey, and who continues his or her journey on that aircraft.  A transfer passenger means a passenger who arrives on a flight to an airport and who leaves on another flight other than to the airport where the passenger&rsquo;s journey started, where both flights are part of a single booking and there is not more than six hours between the scheduled time of arrival of the first flight, and the scheduled time of departure of the second flight.</P>
        <P>The amount to be raised by this measure is &euro;148 million in a full year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That amount is &euro;2 million less than what the Government claimed it was taking during a matter on the Adjournment that I raised on 4 November.  Why are we penalising children and families?  I appreciate that children under the age of two are not included.  However, we are imposing a further tax on families who have children over the age of two.  Why did we pick that age?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the clarification on the points I raised.  There is a lack of public transport in the areas where smaller regional airports are <Col N="235"/>located.  There are no other options, so people use the small airports quite regularly.  The Donegal to Dublin connection is in reality being subjected to a &euro;4 levy, rather than a &euro;2 levy.  If a person leaves Dublin to go to Barcelona or wherever, the charge is &euro;10 because the person is not levied on the way back.  If somebody is travelling to Dublin from Donegal for business, or to go to hospital or go shopping, the return flight will also be levied, which means the levy is &euro;4.  Therefore, that is excessive and the Government should have waived this for the smaller regional airports in order to give them a head start.</P>
        <P>In April 2007, the Government announced an &euro;86 million package for smaller regional airports as part of the national development plan.  We heard two months ago that such funding has now been postponed.  These airports are being starved, yet the passenger numbers continue to increase, so the Minister is introducing a regressive step here.</P>
        <P>There is much good work being done by voluntary groups and by the airlines in helping to transfer patients to hospitals in Dublin for 15 minutes of therapy, before flying them back to their native counties.  Cancer patients cannot sit in a car for a nine hour return trip in order to undergo their treatment.  They have been able to reduce the costs between the airline and between the voluntary organisation that has fundraised on their behalf.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State spoke about exemptions, including disabled persons.  However, I assume that disabled persons do not include cancer patients requiring treatment.  We have often heard about the cancer care facilities in the north west, and I know the Government is pressing ahead with the Minister in the North to develop a centre in the north west.  In the absence of such a centre, the Government should support the initiative led by the regional airport and by the voluntary group and exempt cancer patients and the person accompanying him or her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the category of disabled would likely apply to the people referred to by Senator Doherty.  The regulations are being drawn up by the Revenue Commissioners, so I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion to the attention of the Minister for Finance and we will see if it can be incorporated.</P>
        <P>I am advised that a flight from Donegal to Barcelona via Dublin would incur a &euro;10 charge, as the flight from Donegal to Dublin would be regarded as a transit flight.  The two year age limit for children is the age limit that airlines apply for charging fares.</P>

	<P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 122, line 21, to delete &ldquo;21.5 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;19 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This recommendation deals with the 0.5% VAT increase that is proposed by the Government in this Bill.  It could be argued that a 0.5% change in VAT will make little difference, but we have an option in this Bill to help the retail sector in the State.  When the Government announced the increase in VAT, I was quite taken aback.  VAT is one of the most unequal forms of taxation the State applies.  Everybody has to pay VAT regardless of his or her income.  Those with less income have to buy the same types of produce as those who are very wealthy.  The VAT increase will simply take more money from the weekly budgets of Irish families.  It <Col N="236"/>will push more people to try to find cheaper products, including food and other basic items.  It is easy to call on the public to be patriotic and to shop locally.  As people lose their jobs at phenomenal rates, they will look for cheaper products.  Belts are being tightened as people try to balance the books of their family homes.  The decision to proceed with this increase is even more bizarre when one considers that VAT receipts have already decreased by &euro;2.1 billion.  It does not make any sense to me.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The huge disparity between the rates of VAT that apply on either side of the Border has a real influence on people when they are deciding where to do their shopping.  The effect of this problem is not just being felt in the Border counties.  People in this House have told me they have travelled up the M1 and across the Border to do their Christmas shopping and would do so again.  When one hears about the savings that can be made, who can blame them for doing so?  The staff of this House and other people are willing to travel more than 100 miles, from Dublin and further afield, to cross the Border and avail of the lower prices.  I accept that such disparities cannot be solely attributed to VAT.  In my Second Stage speech, I referred to the price differences in shops and retail units like Dunnes Stores and Next.  While the VAT issue is not the only contributing factor in this context, the disparity in VAT is having a major impact and is contributing to people&rsquo;s decisions to shop on the other side of the Border.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>If we are to enable middle and low income families to pump much-needed money into the economy, we will have to reduce the rate of VAT, which is something my party has been demanding for some time.  There is an onus on the Government to deal with this issue.  We need to standardise the rates of taxation across this island.  The decision of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to reduce the rate of VAT in Northern Ireland had an immediate effect on Border towns that had built up a retail base, such as Letterkenny, County Donegal and Dundalk.  I heard last year that the Next outlet in Letterkenny was that company&rsquo;s biggest earner in any part of the world.  I am not sure whether it was taking in more money than any other outlet, or was making a greater profit, but it was rewarded for the way things were working out for it.  There were different factors at play last year.  The prices of sterling and the euro were different and there was not such a disparity between the respective VAT rates.  The Next outlet in Letterkenny will definitely not have such a good year this year.  Today, things are going well for retailers in Derry, Belfast and other towns in Northern Ireland.  Tomorrow, things might go well for Letterkenny, Dundalk, Dublin or Cork.  It is not good to have such instability in the retail sector.  We need to consider the harmonisation of VAT rates across the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill gives the Government an opportunity to intervene to help the retail sector.  Figures published by the Central Statistics Office indicated that retail spending decreased by 7.7% in October, which was before the British Chancellor of the Exchequer reduced the VAT rate in that jurisdiction by 2.5%.  The October figures were the worst since 1984, which is almost 25 years ago.  The figures for November and December will be even worse.  There is an onus on the Government to step in and do something positive in this regard.  When the T&aacute;naiste was asked how she intended to assist the retail sector, she responded by pointing out that she does not own a shop.  It was an appalling answer.  She said that the Government is not a shopkeeper and suggested that shops should reduce their prices.  The T&aacute;naiste is the second most powerful person in the Cabinet.  The Government is sitting on its hands as the retail sector goes down the swanee.  We need to step in.</P>
        <P>In this recommendation, I propose that we should reduce the rate of VAT to 19%, rather than following the Government&rsquo;s plan of increasing VAT and thereby reducing consumer <Col N="237"/>spending power.  If we adopt a 19% rate, we will not harmonise our rate with the rate in Northern Ireland, but it will suffice as an interim step.  It would allow people to shop and provide a better playing field.  In such circumstances, purchases would represent an investment in the economy as well as a spin-off for the retail sector.  More goods would be manufactured and more people would remain in employment, or enter employment in this area.  The Government needs to seriously consider this proposal.  It is not an option to stand still by retaining the 21% rate.  We need to reduce it.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to increase the rate of VAT does not make any sense.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, to the House.  He was not here when I spoke about this issue on Second Stage.  I do not want to repeat what I said earlier.  When businesses hit tough times, they have to decide how to cut costs and take in more money.  The choice faced by the Government at this time is not dissimilar.  If one wants to take in more money, one must consider whether the best way of doing so is to increase one&rsquo;s prices.  However, price increases generally lead to reduced receipts when one&rsquo;s customers go somewhere else.  In a competitive marketplace, one can take in more money by reducing one&rsquo;s prices.  The markets to which Senator Doherty referred are certainly competitive.  I know Dundalk better than I know Letterkenny.</P>
        <P>When the British Chancellor of the Exchequer wanted to encourage people to spend more and to take in more money, he facilitated price reductions.  At the same time, we did the exact opposite.  Our decision &mdash; that the best way to get more money is to increase prices &mdash; is based on the assumption that the marketplace here is not competitive.  It would have been possible to do that successfully in the old days, when we had a protectionist society.  We have taken a step in the wrong direction.  On budget day, we should have decided to encourage people to spend more money.  If people spend more, our VAT receipts will increase.  I know we are not talking about basic foodstuffs, to which different circumstances apply.  VAT is very competitive.</P>
        <P>The IKEA store in Belfast is getting a significant amount of business from people south of the Border.  The IKEA store in Dublin is ready to open but that is not allowed to happen just yet.  I estimate that the Exchequer will lose &euro;20 million this year as a result of people from Dublin and other parts of this jurisdiction going north to buy goods in the IKEA store in Belfast that they could have bought here.  Some 600 jobs will be created, and other benefits will accrue, when the Dublin store eventually opens.  I believe we should be reducing VAT, in a subtle and clever way that gives us more rather than less income, instead of increasing it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Doherty was being hard on the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan, when he referred to her comment about not owning a shop.  People have been going to Newry since the T&aacute;naiste said that we should shop around.  Perhaps that is why she is afraid to say anything at present.</P>
        <P>Senators on this side of the House are in favour of this amendment because, as Senator Quinn said, the decision to increase VAT sends out the wrong signals.  Consumers are prepared to shop around.  In recent times, many of them have decided to shop in Northern Ireland, unfortunately.  Delays in making changes to substantial charges such as expensive rates, waste <Col N="238"/>costs and company taxes have allowed our retail sector to become uncompetitive in some respects.  When the public finances hit rock bottom, the Government tried to extract a little more from the people by increasing the rate of VAT.  The signal we are sending out as we try to run our economy is completely wrong.  There is almost a sense of panic among people who feel they have to go to Northern Ireland.  We have to acknowledge that there is a significant difference between the price of certain consumer goods in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Regarding making bland statements about being patriotic, Irish people do not see much difference between buying from a British retailer in the Republic or Northern Ireland.  It is also insulting to people in Northern Ireland that the so-called &ldquo;republican party&rdquo; would treat people north of the Border as citizens of another country.  We spent years trying to get rid of that sort of mentality.  We would be far better served by a review of how VAT is applied to many goods and services to make us competitive again.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I echo the sentiments of Senators Doherty, Quinn and Twomey about the Government&rsquo;s increase in VAT rates.  At a time when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer is reducing VAT rates, it will have a detrimental effect on the take from VAT south of the Border.  In other European Union countries, virtually all finance ministers are considering reducing various tax rates, not just VAT.  Yet the Government is proposing a large number of tax increases, the most obvious of which is the 0.5% increase in VAT.  It was obvious that the take from VAT this year would reduce somewhat anyway.  The recently announced figures indicate that it has reduced significantly.  Senator Quinn is right in suggesting it will be depressed even further by this rise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some retailers have proposed to absorb some of the increase themselves.  However, not all are in a position to do so.  Following a fall in the overall VAT take, a further increase in the rate will dissuade people from spending money at a time when the Government should be doing everything in its power to encourage people to spend to keep money circulating in the economy and keep businesses running.  It flies in the face of every sort of economic view held by leading economists and part-time economists like myself and others as to how we should use our taxation system.  It is an abuse of the system and makes no sense.</P>
        <P>It has recently been brought to my attention that a number of retailers are encountering considerable difficulty with Visa card payments.  The system operates via telephone lines.  There seems to be a considerable problem with telephone lines at present adding to difficulties retailers are experiencing.  I understand a number of transactions are not being completed because of faults with the network.</P>
        <P>My substantive issue is the increase in VAT rates, which at this juncture is the last thing the Government should be proposing.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">Most of what I wanted to say has been said.  If one goes around the capital city of Dublin to places like Dawson Street, Grafton Street, Henry Street, Moore Street, O&rsquo;Connell Street, or goes to Patrick Street or McCurtain Street in Cork one will see a great number of shops for sale or to let.  In addition there is a great number of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; signs indicating reductions of 50% or 25% or offers such as &ldquo;Buy one and get one free&rdquo; or &ldquo;Buy two and get a third one free&rdquo;.  That applies across the board.  This is an indictment of the proposed VAT increase.  I am all in favour of shopping around and of competition.  At a time when we should be encouraging consumers to spend we are not doing that.  It is no wonder we have the flight of the Gaels to Belfast and Newry.  People will soon start to travel to Manchester and London <Col N="239"/>with the euro and pound approaching parity.  All that may be stopping people is the Ryanair charge for luggage because people might be paying more for their bags than they would save on their purchases.  We need to encourage people to spend.</P>
        <P>I was in the Stephen&rsquo;s Green Shopping Centre yesterday where a number of shops have signs announcing they have absorbed the VAT increase.  Senator John Paul Phelan is right that not everybody can do that.  My biggest concern is not for the multinationals such as IKEA mentioned by Senator Quinn, but rather small local shopkeepers we all know who are struggling.  We should be asking consumers to support these people.  I do not blame people going to Belfast or Newry.  I would do it myself if I were living in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Related to the VAT increase is the way the banks have collared us all.  The purpose of the bank financial support scheme was to allow liquidity into small enterprises.  This morning we heard about the &euro;87 million being hidden by a banker, which sounded like something from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  However, banks are coming after small business people for money.  Senator Quinn has tabled a very good recommendation: &ldquo;That the VAT Payment Deadline for businesses be extended to 90 days&rdquo;.  We should be encouraging people and not discouraging them.  I appreciate the Minister has a difficult job to balance the books.  In America, President Bush gave a rebate cheque to people so they could go out and spend.  Many states in America have sales tax-free days at the time of going back to school in August.  I do not disagree with what should be the Government mantra of going out to spend.  However, it is not encouraging people.  This is a further tax that will discourage people from spending and is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 72 gives effect to the budget increase of 0.5% in the standard rate of VAT from 1 December.  The budget introduced a general package of revenue-raising measures to fund key public services, one of which was increasing the standard VAT rate.  Already we borrow more than 10% of all day-to-day spending on public services before capital spending.  This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in introducing corrective measures.  The estimated &euro;227 million that will accrue in a full year from the VAT increase will go some way towards funding necessary public services.</P>
        <P>Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionary, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that the price of goods and services that applies at this rate will increase by 0.41%.  This equates to an increase of 8 cent on a good costing &euro;20 or 41 cent on a good costing &euro;100.  Approximately half the value of goods and services purchased in the State is not subject to the standard rate of VAT and is unaffected by the change in the standard rate.  All Government and local authority services are outside the scope of VAT, while hospitals, schools etc. are exempt from VAT.  The zero rate of VAT applies to the majority of foodstuffs, oral medicine, books, and children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes.  In addition housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour-intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair qualify for the reduced 13.5% reduced VAT rate.</P>
        <P>As part of a fiscal stimulus package the British Government reduced its standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  The Minister has no plans to make a similar reduction in the standard VAT rate in Ireland or to reduce the rate to the UK level of 15%.  Our starting point is different from the UK&rsquo;s.  We already have a low-taxation economy especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has a direct impact on all employment in the State.  This lower starting position for direct taxation makes it more difficult to reduce taxes further.  Each <Col N="240"/>percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost approximately &euro;450 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points to 19% would cost approximately &euro;1.125 billion in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15%, which would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points, would cost almost &euro;3 billion in a full year, which is equivalent to approximately 2.5 times the amount of revenues to be raised in the full year through the new income levy.</P>
        <P>Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential between North and South for some goods, the Minister points out that the UK has increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on these items.  Consequently, there will be no reduction in the price of these products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction of the UK VAT rate to 15%.  Furthermore, as I have already stated, around half the value of goods and services purchased in the State is not subject to the standard rate of VAT and consequently is not affected by the recent changes made to the standard rates in Ireland and the UK.</P>
        <P>The VAT rate is not the only factor in the price differential north and south of the Border.  The weakening of sterling has had and is having a far more significant impact on relative prices than any VAT changes.  As Ireland is a small, open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported and cutting the VAT rate would benefit the economies from which we import more than our own.  In other words, while it would help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.</P>
        <P>The European Commission recently put forward a proposal for a common EU stimulus package.  The Minister welcomes the Commission&rsquo;s plans as an important signal to EU consumers and business that member states and the Commission are working to boost demand and support business in these difficult times.  However, the Commission&rsquo;s plan also recognises that not all member states are in a position to contribute an additional fiscal stimulus.  Ireland is facing very challenging times and our scope to inject an additional fiscal stimulus to that already being provided is extremely limited.  The Commission mentions temporary reductions in VAT as one option among a menu of options.  At a recent EU meeting, it was clear that most member states are unlikely to pursue the approach of temporary reductions in VAT.  I do not see it as an appropriate option for Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are other means of stimulating the economy outside the VAT system.  The Government is providing a long-term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the EU average.  The Taoiseach yesterday announced the Government&rsquo;s framework for sustainable economic renewal.  This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long-term productive capacity.  Irish taxation policy has given us a significant competitive advantage over the past 15 years.  We ensured that we had the lowest levels of direct taxation on income, and therefore we have had marginally higher indirect taxation.  That model of taxation has worked well for our economy and will be even more important now in leading us back to the path of economic growth.  For those reasons I do not propose to accept the recommendation.</P>
        <P>The problem with Visa payments was mentioned.  Certainly there was a problem last Saturday, but I understand that is more to do with IT capacity than anything else.  Senator Quinn mentioned Ikea.  He knows I have more than a passing interest in its fortunes.  I hope the store will be able to open on the projected date in line with the planning permission which was granted to it, and I look forward to the creation of 550 jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the Minister&rsquo;s reply, I had a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  When we were in here last year talking about the Government&rsquo;s over-reliance on the construction industry and the need to plan for the time when the bubble would burst, the Government sat on its hands.  It only recently recognised how things are.  When we talked about the need to do something with the banks, similar responses were given, and then finally there was action.  When we said we were entering a recession the Government denied it and would not use the &ldquo;R&rdquo; word, but now, finally, we have some type of plan.  We do not know whether it will be good enough &mdash; we all have different views on that.  Belatedly, the Government came up with a package.  Let there be no doubt: we are going to be back here.  I hope it will not take seven, eight or nine months, but we will be back here with a plan to increase consumer spending.  The Government will have to reverse some of these measures, including the increase in the higher rate of VAT.</P>
        <P>The Minister gave out figures, which I am sure are right.  I am not saying we should copy what is happening in Britain &mdash; we are our own State and we will decide our own policies &mdash; but we must take cognisance of what is happening in neighbouring countries and, particularly in view of the continued partition of our country, we need to take into account what is happening in the North, which is affected by the changes made in the House of Commons.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer could have stood up and said that to reduce VAT in Britain would cost X billion pounds and he would have been right.  However, there is a belief that by reducing it they can increase consumer spending.  If we had the same argument about reducing corporation tax, every Minister for Finance would be able to come in here and say, based on the figures of the day, that reducing the tax would result in the loss of so much money.  The Minister has not taken into account that reducing VAT to 19%, for which I am calling in this amendment, will increase consumer spending.  Yes, there will be a loss, but the Government is not taking into account that confidence will be increased and more money will be put back into the pockets of consumers &mdash; in the region of &euro;1 billion per year.  People will be able to spend that money in the retail sector.  Employment will increase and companies will be able to make profits, so the Government will still get its taxes through the profits of these companies.  People will be taken off unemployment benefit and will pay taxes through PAYE.  The money will come back to the Government eventually and it should come back in bucketfuls.</P>
        <P>We are in a serious predicament in terms of retail spending.  Christmas is buffering the figures because people are going out and spending money on Christmas presents and so on.  However, after Christmas &mdash; I hope I am wrong about this &mdash; we are in for a serious wake-up call.  I believe we will be back here debating a package of measures to help the retail sector.  We can do it now.  We know what is happening and we can prevent it.  Reducing VAT to 19% is the right thing to do.  It will not solve all the problems.  Sterling at 95% and other currency fluctuations will always be a problem for us.  However, we need to send out a signal, and the Government should be sending out a signal before Christmas that it intends to support small businesses and put more money back in people&rsquo;s pockets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the basis of what is being discussed here, the Minister should consider this measure.  For example, the ESRI report from yesterday states that it sees overall consumer prices falling next year for the first time since 1946.  We actually have the wrong budget.  With all the increases we have been talking about, we are doing everything to make sure this happens.  There has been a debate in this House for the last number of weeks.  I was criticised for saying it was wrong to have a 2.5% pay increase for ourselves in September and <Col N="242"/>then preside over a harsh budget in October, yet we are still talking about pay increases next August.  Other aspects of the ESRI report will bear this out also.  We are creating a major disjunction between the public and private sectors &mdash; the same disjunction that existed a couple of years ago which we tried to rectify with benchmarking, although we did not follow through by achieving reform.  We have passed the wrong budget.  This is only compounding the problem we are talking about.  The Government should seriously consider this issue before the events of 1946 are repeated.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I move recommendation No. 5<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 122, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) That the VAT Payment Deadline for businesses be extended to 90 days.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My reason for introducing this recommendation is because the largest challenge facing many businesses is liquidity.  This recommendation would help to provide liquidity at only a tiny cost to the Exchequer.  Every business must pay its VAT 19 days after the end of the previous <Col N="243"/>month.  I propose it is extended to 90 days, three months.  The Government will still get its tax but later.</P>
        <P>We hear so much about the credit crunch.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service was recently attended by the two banks.  It is clear from the figures that the banks are not lending and have no intention of lending for some time.  As a result a large number of businesses are short of cash.  This proposal will give them cash by allowing them to hold on to their VAT returns for an extra few weeks.  It is worthy of consideration.  It will help businesses without a cost to the Exchequer.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The VAT registration thresholds for small businesses were increased in the 2008 budget to &euro;37,500 in respect of services and to &euro;75,000 for goods with effect from 1 May 2008.  Ireland operates some of the highest registration thresholds in the EU.  Some member states do not operate any VAT registration threshold requiring all business to register.  Registration thresholds reduce the administrative burden on small business, often at development stage, and on the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>VAT returns are normally made on a two monthly basis in arrears.  Traders making VAT returns on-line may do so until the 23rd of the month, instead of the 19th of the month.  There are significant cost savings and efficiency gains for business that use revenue on-line services.  It is quick and easy to use and facilitates cashflow management.</P>
        <P>For businesses with a yearly VAT liability of &euro;3,000 or less, the option of filing returns on a half-yearly basis is available.  For businesses with a yearly liability between &euro;3,001 and &euro;14,400, the option of filing returns every four months is available.  Over 76,000 traders were eligible for this initiative.  This reduces compliance costs for firms with small VAT liabilities.</P>
        <P>The 2007 budget also introduced the annual VAT cash accounting threshold for small firms from &euro;635,000 to &euro;1 million, with effect from 1 March 2007.  Traders who qualify for this method of accounting for VAT are not liable to pay the VAT until they receive payment for the goods and services which they supply.  Approximately 65,000 traders account for VAT on the cash basis.</P>
        <P>Deferring VAT payments for a reasonable number of firms would have a significant once-off cashflow cost, approximately &euro;1.7 billion, for the Exchequer in the year of its introduction.  I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a classic example of one arm of Government not listening to the other.  Over the past four months, we have raised the difficulties faced by small businesses in accessing cash.  Up to &euro;10 billion is being put in the way of the banks to help access to cash.  This recommendation provides a way in which the State could offer an opportunity to small businesses, in particular, to improve their cashflow in a significant way at no loss.  The loss referred to by the Minister of State is an end-of-year one and would only occur for the last three months of the year when the payment date would cross over the limit.</P>
        <P>From a quick calculation of the thresholds given by the Minister of State, these would only apply to businesses with an annual turnover of approximately &euro;150,000 a year, which is about &euro;500 a day.  That really would not be a business.</P>
        <P>I accept there is a cost for the first year.  This recommendation is a simple, sensible and practical way in which the Government could control access to credit for small businesses.  In giving &euro;10 billion to the banks, one does not know what is going to come out at the other end.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <P Just="Left">This recommendation allows businesses to have cash for 90 days.  For example, if a filling station is stocking up, it must make payments for fuel on a cash-on-delivery or a next-day payment basis.  Filling stations always worked on the basis they got a loan from a bank to pay these charges.  Nowadays, the banks have repayment schedules that are shorter than the time it takes the liquid gold in the filling station to be sold.  Businesses which are under no threat whatsoever are being hit by the lack of access to credit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept the recommendation will not be accepted but I would like it to be taken to the Department of Finance.  This is a classic example of one Department addressing one matter while the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment addresses the lack of credit.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s recommendation is a practical way of dealing with a problem all Members have raised over the past several months.  It is worthwhile examining.</P>

	<P>I support this recommendation.  It is very sensible and causes no real cost to the Exchequer.  It is only a delay in bringing in the VAT intake.  As I said with reference to my previous recommendation, we will be back here to revisit this problem.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s proposal and others, including my earlier recommendation, will be discussed and brought forward by this Government.  This is a problem that will not go away.  Imaginative ideas from this side of the House must be taken on board.  The reduction in VAT must be brought to the attention of the Minister.  The extension to 90 days is only an extension of seven weeks and must be brought to the attention of the Minister.  This will form a rescue package when the Government gets its act together.</P>

	<P>This section deals with public private partnerships.  What are the main changes to the public private partnership schemes?  Are many changes made to the previous schemes?  Are the changes mainly with regard to education, water and sewerage schemes and roads or are other changes also made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section repeals section 110 of the Finance Act 2007 and reinstates it again with the same charging provisions but subject to certain exemptions being made to those charging provisions along with some minor technical amendments.  The purpose of the original section 110 and this reinstated section is to address the arrangements that are being used by some developers that give rise to an avoidance of liability to stamp duty.  As the law currently stands, these arrangements are permissible.</P>
        <P>As Senators are aware, stamp duty is imposed at various rates upon specified categories of instruments subject to a range of exemptions.  An instrument concludes every written document and liability to stamp duty arises at present when an instrument of a type that attracts a charge is executed.  With regard to real property such as land and buildings the document which attracts the charge is the instrument by means of which legal title to land is conveyed or transferred from one owner to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>What does that mean in plain English?  Will stamp duty be paid on public private partnerships?  Will an arrangement be made for people to have their commission returned if a PPP falls?  In plain English, what is the substantive change?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>This new section also makes provision for exemptions from the charge.  These include public private partnership arrangements and incentive schemes for capital allowances purposes with regard to nursing homes, convalescent homes, private hospitals, mental health centres, palliative care units, the mid-Shannon corridor tourism scheme and child care facilities.  This provision is subject to commencement order and the Minister&rsquo;s intent is to commence it in the near future.</P>

	<P>This section amends section 81 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act which exempts from stamp duty transfers of land to young trained farmers.  The amendment gives effect to the budget announcement which extended the exemption for another four years until 31 December 2012.  This is an important relief for the farming sector as it incentivises <i>inter alia</i> the early transfer of the farm to young farmers.  The change applies to instruments executed on or after 1 January 2009.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have a question with regard to inheritance tax and the valuation of property, particularly where disputes have arisen and dragged on for a number of years.  What valuation is taken?  Is it the valuation at the time of death?  A valuation taken two or three years ago would be far higher than a valuation today.  A major dispute could arise in such a case.  How could one value property today?  One would not know the value of a property today unless one were to sell it and get the market value for it.  Two years ago the market value of those properties was totally unrealistic.  This is an area of dispute for people and I ask the Minister to indicate how it can be resolved because a number of cases are in dispute.  The high valuations a number of years ago were unrealistic.  How does the Revenue Commissioners intend to deal with them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The valuation date is the date of death but discussions can be entered into with the Revenue Commissioners to negotiate instalment arrangements for paying the tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Arrangements can be made for paying instalments if agreement is reached.  The Minister said the valuation date is the date of death but how does one know what the valuation is now?  How can anybody say what the valuation of a property is in the current economic climate?  Some of the properties under dispute were valued at the date of death which may have been two or three years ago.  They were unrealistic valuations.  There should be some arbitrary system in place to allow people come to some agreement but I am led to believe that in some cases where disputes have taken place there is no talking to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no doubt that any valuation given two or three years ago was unrealistic and I hope the Revenue Commissioners would look on it that way.</P>

	<P>Is there any scope for review in that regard?  Market values two years ago were totally unrealistic.  They are halved today.  In some cases one might not even sell those properties today or even value them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="247"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It works both ways.  It applies the other way when the value increases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have an explanation prepared for the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In this case more than an explanation is needed.  The Government will have to take some action on it because I know of no valuer who can put a value on any property, whether it is a house, a business or land.  That is one scenario.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of those disputes have taken place in the past two or three years but the properties valued then would not get the same price today.  The person might not even be able to sell them to pay their inheritance tax.  These properties were given valuations three years ago but if they have to put them on the market now, those valuations are unrealistic.  Some sort of intervention is required at ministerial level.  The Revenue Commissioners are considering valuations that were done three years ago but the people might not even be able to sell the properties today.  The Minister says they can pay by instalment on a valuation given three years ago.  The Revenue Commissioners might take the property off their hands in some cases, which might be much easier for the people involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The argument can be made that when values are rising, the valuation date means that less tax is paid than would be paid if valued at the price when sold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is hearsay.  Valuations made a number of years ago were unrealistic.  Every Minister knows that.  The Revenue Commissioners valued properties two or three years ago and the people have to pay inheritance tax on those valuations.  They may have to sell the properties.  There is not a hope in hell of them ever selling.  In 20 years time these properties may realise their value of three years ago.  Those poor people would have to sell those properties to pay the inheritance tax on a valuation that in most cases is probably 100% less than what they were two or three years ago.  The Minister of State should look at this in a sympathetic fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>We can look at it but I am not sure there is any scope for the Minister to do anything other than what is the current practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The point the Minister of State is making is that people will take a hit because valuations can work both ways.  If the Revenue took a hit during the past decade in terms of inheritance tax because of rapidly rising property prices, that was an issue for Revenue to decide whether it would accept that risk but the converse position is not true.  If people&rsquo;s inheritance is being put at risk because of a collapse in property prices, the Minister of State is saying to these people that the Government will force them to sell if they cannot pay the inheritance tax for which they are liable or that they must not accept their inheritance if the value of what they are inheriting is less than their liabilities and other costs that might be incurred.  It does not automatically apply that just because Revenue accepts that it is taking a hit when prices are rising, we should accept that people inheriting an asset should take a hit.  In some cases an inheritance may be a parcel of land or a family home and the valuation of a family home would have been significantly higher three years ago than it is now.  We should not just accept that a person may win one way or lose the other way.  We should be more understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Senators are asking would involve a change in the current law.  The Revenue Commissioners are implementing the law as they see it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="248"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be some room for negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners.  If agreements can be arrived at in disputes without changing the law, the Revenue Commissioners must have a way to give some latitude in dealing with a situation like that.</P>

        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 89.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 89 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain section 89?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section amends section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003.  The section grants relief at 90% in respect of the market value of agricultural property situated in the State where such property is comprised in a gift or an inheritance taken by a farmer.  For the purposes of this section, agricultural property includes agricultural land situated in the State.  To qualify as a farmer for the purpose of section 89 of the Act, at least 80% of an individual&rsquo;s assets, after taking the gift or inheritance into account, must consist of agricultural property situated in the State.</P>
        <P>The European Court of Justice, in a decision delivered in January of this year, held that a provision in tax law that confines relief to land in one member state is a restriction on the free movement of capital and is, therefore, contrary to European Union law.  Section 89 of the Bill ensures that relief will apply to agricultural land situated in a member state of the European Union.  The amendment to the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; in section 89(1) of the Act ensures that agricultural land situated in a member state of the European Union will qualify as agricultural property and that such property will qualify for 90% relief under this section.</P>
        <P>This amendment, which the Minister introduced on Committee Stage in the other House, was required because while section 82 of the Bill as initiated ensured that relief at 90% applied to such assets, those assets could not qualify for relief if the bulk of the property comprised in a gift or inheritance was situated outside the State.  The amendment corrects this anomaly and ensures that section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 is in conformity with European Union law.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This section gives extra powers to the Revenue Commissioners and provides for an increase in fines.  At a time when the economy is in difficulty, it is unbelievable to give extra powers to the Revenue Commissioners and raise penalties for hard pressed business people.  This is in addition to tax payment dates for companies being brought forward from October to March.  They will have to pay two years tax within one year.  Next year will be difficult but we are giving the Revenue Commissioners more powers to raise penalties on hard pressed people in future years.  We should take a more lenient approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section makes three amendments to sections in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which deal with Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; powers.  The definition of &ldquo;financial <Col N="249"/>institution&rdquo; has been aligned in a number of sections to include financial institutions authorised in another member state operating in Ireland under a passport arrangement.  These institutions will now come under these provisions in the same way as banks authorised by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The second area is the definition of &ldquo;professional advices&rdquo;, which has been amended in certain sections to concisely set out parameters for disclosure of third party information and professional advices.  Finally, a time limit on the submission of tax returns, within which court orders issued must be complied with, has also been inserted into the section dealing with Revenue offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean a court order must be in place before a fine can be imposed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Paragraphs (<i>g</i>) to (<i>i</i>) amend section 906(<i>a</i>) which permits access by the Revenue Commissioners to information held by financial institutions, section 908(<i>a</i>) which enables them to obtain a District Court order to access information in a financial institution to enable them to investigate an offence and 908(<i>b</i>) which enables the Revenue Commissioners to apply to the High Court for an order requiring a financial institution to supply information held by a foreign entity over which it has control.

	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Pat Carey, for coming in at this late hour to respond to this motion.  It is an odd topic to raise as an adjournment motion because it is a matter of such national importance.  I do not want to sound a discordant note at the end of festive words, but we have not been able to discuss where we stand post the European Council meeting.  </P>
        <P>I and many of my Seanad colleagues put a significant amount of work into a sub-committee which tried to play a role in helping the country move forward on an important topic.  I am very disappointed we did not get an opportunity to discuss where things stand for our country in light of the European Council meeting in Brussels.  I had to resort to putting down an adjournment motion to deal with what I believe, with the economy, is the most important issue facing our country.</P>
        <P>The main thrust of the report I put together, with my colleagues, was that we need to make the Oireachtas more relevant to European affairs.  I cannot think of a greater example of how we failed to do that than an important issue for our country is not discussed in the House, particularly given that the Seanad and chambers like it all over the world and western Europe play a strong role in contributing to European matters.</P>
        <P>We tend to have the time and capacity to discuss these matters in a more detailed manner than is sometimes available elsewhere.  I will not speak on the motion itself as it is self-evident, but I want the Government to outline its plan because the opportunity was not given in the House for this side to hear its thinking.  We all want to contribute and help, and I regret that opportunity was not taken.  I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say on such a vital topic.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and produced what I regard as a very important report which will frame the agenda for much, if not all, of next year.  I have more than a passing interest in this topic and will facilitate further debate on it in any way I can.   </P>
        <P>In the D&aacute;il, we have decided on a regular &mdash; if possible, monthly &mdash; basis to have a debate on European issues.  There are many European scrutiny reports that never see the light of day.  I spent two years on that committee and know what goes through undetected.  Perhaps that is something this House could also look at and set aside dedicated time each month for a debate on European matters.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday, the outcome of last week&rsquo;s European Council represents a very major step towards delivering the way forward concerning the Lisbon treaty.  It provides us with a clear path for how Ireland, together with our EU partners, will address the issue of the Lisbon treaty during the year ahead.  What was achieved was the product of painstaking work undertaken in the months since the referendum.  This included the <Col N="253"/>Government&rsquo;s efforts to understand and analyse what lay behind the votes cast last June; our close work with all parties in the Oireachtas in the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, the report of which was such a valuable input; and our detailed discussions and negotiations with partners at EU level, especially the French Presidency under the expert guidance of President Sarkozy.</P>
        <P>Last week&rsquo;s agreement does not mark the end of the process.  Turning it into concrete commitments &mdash; the legal guarantees promised in the Council conclusions &mdash; will be the subject of much detailed work in the months ahead.  However, it offers a solid basis on which the concerns raised by Irish people about the Lisbon treaty can be addressed.  I would highlight, in particular, the agreement to retain one Commissioner per member state.  If Lisbon enters into force, Ireland, like all member states, will maintain the right to nominate a Commissioner to every Commission.  This concession was hard won.  A considerable number of member states were strongly of the view that a smaller Commission would be a more effective one.  But, despite this, all of them listened carefully to our concerns and were prepared to compromise and to move to meet our position.</P>
        <P>We should be very clear that for this agreement to take effect, the Lisbon treaty has to enter into force.  If we remain under Nice, the size of the European Commission will be reduced from next year and there can be no guarantee that the 2009-14 Commission would contain an Irish member.  Only by ratifying Lisbon can we secure the continued presence of an Irish person at the Commission table.</P>
        <P>On the other issues of concern to the Irish people, including taxation policy, social and ethical issues, as well as our traditional policy of military neutrality, the EU leaders have given a solemn commitment that our concerns will be fully addressed to our satisfaction.  In pursuit of this, Ireland will be provided with the necessary legal guarantees.  This is a most significant undertaking and again demonstrates the effort our European partners are prepared to make to offer us the reassurances we sought.  Over the months ahead, we will have to flesh out the precise form and content of these guarantees.  I have every expectation that our partners will work with us in good faith and that this work will yield positive results for Ireland.</P>
        <P>During this time we will also be giving careful consideration to measures we can take at national level to provide further reassurance about elements of the Lisbon treaty.  Naturally, we will be giving careful consideration to how to address the recommendations of Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s sub-committee.  The sub-committee&rsquo;s report envisages greater engagement by the Oireachtas in the workings of the European Union.  This is to be very warmly welcomed and encouraged and the Lisbon treaty explicitly provides for such enhanced involvement by national parliaments in EU affairs.</P>
        <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas, including the Seanad, have a unique and critical role to play in bringing important EU issues to public attention.  Through enhanced and extended debate of European issues in these Houses, the Oireachtas can bring the work of the EU that bit closer to the Irish people.  Regrettably, it is abundantly clear from the detailed research commissioned by the Government following the June referendum that a significant knowledge deficit exists.  Not only did many people lack understanding about the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, they had little solid knowledge about the operation of the European Union itself.  It will be vital to the success of any future referendum on the Lisbon treaty, that we address this deficit and find a means to communicate to the public how important the outcome of any referendum will be for Ireland.</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P>We are working intensively to identify ways in which we can improve how European issues are communicated generally.  This is an issue on which we can benefit from a Europe-wide approach, and the Government has been working closely with the European Commission and the European Parliament to explore what can usefully be done in this important area.  Early in the new year the Government plans to sign a memorandum of understanding with those institutions with a view to progressing this co-operative approach.  The Government has sought additional expertise to assist in ongoing communications about Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership and related issues.</P>
        <P>Over the period ahead, the Government will continue to work closely with the main Opposition parties.  As the Taoiseach emphasised last week, this is an issue of great national importance to Ireland, over and above party differences.  We cannot and will not allow party politics to get in the way of pursuing the best way forward for Ireland.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his kind words on the work I did on the sub-committee.  I was honoured to be chosen and I did it as well as I could.  I make my point more in sorrow than in anger.  This is desperately important and it transcends party politics.  Over the past fortnight Members from this side of the House constantly asked for an update on where matters stand for our country after the European Council meeting in Brussels and that opportunity was not afforded us.  This was brought into the Seanad at 6.55 p.m. on a Friday, the last day of this year&rsquo;s sitting.  Voices in the Seanad will make a difference to the outcome of this referendum in their constituency.  Some voices have the capacity to make a difference nationally.  I implore the Minister to treat them with the respect they deserve.  That approach will ensure the right people come behind this referendum and give the country the result it so desperately needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for remaining to deal with this issue.  The Minister and I have soldiered long and hard on the question of primary school building.  This must be a unique Adjournment debate matter on schools in that I am not seeking for any school to be built, extended or replaced.  I am trying to deal with the Government&rsquo;s requirement of seeking value for money.  After going through many issues I am focusing my attention on Scoil &Aacute;rd Mhuire, Tallaght, Dublin, as an example of where money has been wasted, where it could have been saved and where standards have not been maintained.  The Government and every Cabinet meeting is examining these matters.</P>
        <P>I have a thick file on this school.  I have written to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister on a number of occasions.  I seek only a process and a structure.  It is not about money.  The money has been paid.  No money is involved.  However, nobody seems to want to know.  The whole process needs forensic investigation.  I refer to money being wasted, quality of work and payment being made for botched work.  I refer to architects signing off on work which, the most basic examination would show, is not <Col N="255"/>concluded and ready to be paid for.  I refer to very one-sided contracts.  Some &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million has been spent on this school in two lumps.  The first time, the Office of Public Works did the work and there was no problem.  The second time, up to &euro;3 million was spent and it has been one problem after another for the school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give the Minister an example, and this is what I want him to take from here.  The school told me it was being forced by the Department to pay a builder although the school thought the builder should not be paid until the work was put right.  I asked how much it was costing and the school said it was costing nothing.  The school had the money from the Department in its bank account and could pay it tomorrow morning.  Then I knew the school was not seeking money or trying to save itself any money but was coming to me in the public interest.  I have dealt with this for the past four or five months.  I asked for an example and I will tell the Minister the example the school gave, which I had checked.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no ventilation in the school&rsquo;s sewerage system.  In a new school on which we spent &euro;3 million there is a build-up of methane.  It could explode, and the architect has signed off on it.  I can give more examples and I can show the whole file if anybody is interested in it.  Eventually the Department said the terms of the contract were such that once the architect signed off on the project, the contractual requirement was that the builder be paid.  I said to the school and the Department that the work surely has to be up to standard.  The answer to that is that once the architect says it is up to standard, it is up to standard and the money must be paid or the school could find itself at the end of litigation.  The school was forced to pay the builder for work which the board of management, school principal and parents association all said was wrong.  They had a list of things they wanted done.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I asked about the tender document because I saw a coincidence of names between the quantity surveyor and the person who got the building contract.  I do not know this to be the case.  I raised it with the Minister but got no further with whether they were related.  I am not convinced that the opening of the tender documents complied with the public sector governance requirements in that area. However, I would be happy to be corrected on that.</P>
        <P>I raised an issue related to this during Private Members&rsquo; time.  The Government amended the motion and put in a requirement for energy savings.  These included things like energy light bulbs, dual flush toilets, sensor lights in areas not in constant use, controlled water taps and so on.  However, none of those things was done.  When the Government states there is a need for these things, it still pays for not having them done.</P>
        <P>There were also cost problems.  The builder was charging the school &euro;28,000 for changing the main electric cable in the area.  The school management referred the matter to the ESB, which stated it would cost &euro;700, yet &euro;28,000 was paid to the builder.  That is one example of many costs that the school has questioned.  The OPW finished its work two years ago, and since the new builder came in and concluded his work, the school has lost its intercom, its lockable doors and its security fencing.  I recall the Minister of State making a strong representation many years ago for his own school for security fencing, so he knows what I am talking about.  We got that security fencing for his school on that occasion.  This school had security fencing, but two sections were taken out and there have been three break-ins since.  There are no window blinds in the school, which might sound like a small thing, but teachers know what it is like with the sun coming in through the windows.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise this issue in utter frustration.  I am not looking for money; I only want this done properly.  I will take this to an bord snip as well.  I think the school building section of the Department of Education and Science should be closed and local authorities should build <Col N="256"/>schools.  We would not have had the problems that occurred in Dublin 15 and in north Dublin if local authorities dealt with school buildings in their county development plan.  Even though there is a planning section in the school building section of the Department, I could not find any evidence of any presentation being made by the Department on the county development plan of any local authority.  What are we doing?</P>
        <P>For the case of the school that I have raised, I ask that the Department carry out a forensic examination of how this thing went from point A to point B.  There is no money involved.  I want us to be satisfied that this is the way it works, but people could not be happy with it.  I could spend an hour and a half reading from my file, but I will not do that.  I am dealing with a very diligent principal and staff and a committed, responsible school board of management.  Just like the school of the Minister of State, they are really interested in their locality, but are absolutely frustrated at the waste of money involved.  They are frustrated that they are being tied into a contract that does not deliver that to which the taxpayer and the Government are entitled.  I cannot get any movement on it, and that is the issue for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not aware that the issue raised by the Senator still continues to run.  If the school principal in my school had not taken a hands on approach to supervising the contract when the school was being refurbished a few years ago, many issues similar to those the Deputy raised would have come to light.</P>
        <P>I am replying to this on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  It is important to ensure that costs are kept under control in the construction of school buildings and that those responsible ensure that value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.  In this way, we can ensure completion of the maximum number of projects from within the funds available to the Minister for the school building programme under the current national development plan.</P>
        <P>In view of the large amount of activity under the school building and modernisation programme, it was prudent to improve efficiency and ensure value for money.  In this regard, a number of innovations have been introduced in recent years.  All school building projects are tendered on a fixed price basis.  The new forms of Government contracts assist in ensuring projects are delivered within budget.  All small-scale projects are delivered on a devolved basis at local school level.  Programmes such as the devolved small schools and permanent accommodation schemes and the summer works scheme were introduced into the building programme in recent years in order to give schools control of their projects with a guaranteed level of funding and to maximise value for money.  Granted discretion and funding, schools must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  This use of devolved schemes allows the Department of Education and Science to make use of local knowledge and the skills of school authorities in ensuring efficient and effective delivery of projects in schools.</P>
        <P>The Department has developed generic repeat designs to reduce the cost and speed up the delivery of new schools, particularly in developing areas.  The Department has used design and build contracts to deliver very large school building projects.  These contracts allow for the transfer of risk to contractors in delivery of these projects.  I wonder if the Senator might pursue that avenue in his case.  The Department&rsquo;s role is concentrated in setting the initial design parameters.  Initial designs are evaluated at meetings rather than through correspondence, in order to speed up the design phase.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An extensive project for Scoil &Aacute;rd Mhuire is nearing completion.  The school&rsquo;s consultant architect provided certification relating to satisfactory progress at various stages of the works. <Col N="257"/> The Department of Education and Science funded the school, which was the party to the contract, on receipt of the certification to enable payments to be made to the contractor as required, under the terms of the contract between the school and the contractor.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department met with the school management to discuss the situation which arose and urged the school to comply with the terms of the contract regarding payment to the contractor.  I understand the school subsequently met with the consultant architect and exchanged correspondence with the contractor regarding the release of money and the completion of works on the project.  The Department is in ongoing contact with the school and its architect with a view to ensuring this agreement is implemented, and that the work on the school is completed.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position.  I will speak with the Minister for Education and Science about the Senator&rsquo;s concerns so that he can try to push the matter to a successful conclusion.  If there was never a problem with the public finances, value for money and good governance are a <i>sine qua non</i> for any spending of public money.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I know he understands the points I am making.  He stated the school management met with the consultant architect and exchanged correspondence with the contractor regarding the release of the money and the completion of works in the project.  That meeting took place on 4 November, and the contractor agreed to complete the works immediately.  However, he has not been near the school since.  That is an example of how the school is being treated.  The Minister of State stated the Department is also in ongoing contact and its architect.  I was not aware of that, and I would appreciate if the Department made me aware of the level of contact with the architect.</P>
        <P>The specifications are not being met on this.  We need to look at the process.  I have huge questions and I will certainly raise these issues again.  I thank the Minister of State and I wish him a happy Christmas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue.  It is an annual for me, as I have been raising the last matter on the Adjournment before Christmas for many years now.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has been here all day, and I know this is the last sitting day before Christmas, but we never seem to be able to get a Minister into this House from the relevant Department.  I know the Minister of State is very familiar with educational issues, and I know it is no bother to him.  I can understand why the relevant Ministers might not be available on the last sitting day before Christmas.  The last time I raised a matter on the Adjournment, all three matters related to education.  None of the many Ministers in the Department of Education and Science was in attendance for that debate, however.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the future funding of Protestant post-primary education, which is a serious issue.  I regret to say that the Government is displaying a level of discrimination against Protestant secondary schools.  Various Governments have traditionally adhered to an unwritten understanding that special provision needs to be made for the education of Protestant children in post-primary schools with a Protestant ethos.  It could be argued that it became a written understanding in the 1960s.  That position ceased to exist, unfortunately, when the Minister announced on budget day that he had decided to cut a number of grants that were <Col N="258"/>directly aimed at Church of Ireland schools.  I refer in particular to the abolition of the special service support grant, which the Department claims will lead to a saving of &euro;2.8 million.  This decision will have a hugely detrimental effect on Protestant post-primary schools across the country.</P>
        <P>I understand that there are 21 fee-paying Church of Ireland secondary schools in this country.  The largest of them is Kilkenny College, which is in my home county.  It is a fine educational institution with a long and distinguished history.  The school received funding from the Department of Education and Science and the Protestant community when it moved to a new campus within the last 15 or 20 years.  This fantastic school in Kilkenny, which has over 800 students, is the only Protestant post-primary school in the south east.  It is not exclusively Church of Ireland or Protestant.  It is not an elite school.  It operates in a similar way to a community school.  While Protestant children are prioritised on entry, many members of the school body have other religious backgrounds.  I understand that approximately 550 of the college&rsquo;s 800 students are boarders.  Some 450 boarders, almost all of whom are Protestant children, receive support grants from the Department to help to meet their educational needs.  The grants help to fulfil the desire of the students and their parents to get an education that is in line with the Protestant ethos.</P>
        <P>Many people have an image of private and fee-paying schools as dealing exclusively with people from the upper echelons of society, or with sizeable household incomes.  For the most part, we are not talking about people in that category in the case of Kilkenny College.  Approximately 450 students at the college receive assistance from the Department of Education and Science to enable them to attend the school.  It has been brought to my attention that it is projected in the school&rsquo;s budget that it will have a deficit of almost &euro;250,000 next year as a result of the cutbacks that were announced in the budget.  It is obvious that the major cutback in this instance is the abolition of the special service support grant.  It would be difficult for any school to find &euro;250,000 to offset a budgetary deficit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister and the Department can reconsider this decision.  When free education was introduced in the late 1960s, the then Minister, Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, entered into an agreement with the Church of Ireland authorities to ensure that education with a Protestant ethos would be provided to schoolchildren from such a background.  Many Protestant pupils have to go to boarding school because the Protestant community is dispersed throughout the country.  Successive Governments have supported schools catering for such children as a kind of <i>quid pro quo</i> for the free education that is provided in Catholic schools.  It seems that the Government has brought an end to that arrangement.</P>
        <P>The Church of Ireland community in my locality is made up of quiet, honest and hard-working people.  They do not tend to get worked up about educational issues.  There is an understandable level of anger in the community in respect of this issue.  The people in question think their community is being singled out.  Approximately 10% of non-Protestant post-primary schools will be affected by the cutbacks announced by the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in the recent budget, whereas all 21 of this country&rsquo;s Protestant post-primary schools will be affected.  To me, that smacks of some form of discrimination.  Given that the Minister has rowed back on some of the education cutbacks that were announced on budget day, perhaps he will be in a position to reconsider this matter next year.  Many Protestant post-primary schools are facing an uncertain future in light of the budgetary shortfalls that are projected.  A couple of them are in danger of closing as a result of what was announced in the budget.  I hope the Minister of State will have some positive news for the schools as we enter 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid I have been around the education sector for long enough to remember the genesis of the arrangement to which Senator Phelan referred.  I am fairly familiar with the issue.  There are 56 fee-charging second level schools in the State, of which 21 are Protestant, two are inter-denominational and one is Jewish.  The rest of the fee-paying schools have a Catholic ethos.  The Minister wishes to emphasise that no changes in the Protestant block grant are proposed.  Protestant fee paying schools will continue to receive the Protestant block grant, which amounts to &euro;6.25 million in the current school year.  This payment, which covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants, is distributed by the secondary education committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the central Protestant churches authority, which distributes funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil need following a means test.  The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance the Minister for Education and Science continues to attach to ensuring that Protestant students can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.  In addition, Protestant fee-paying schools have traditionally been paid a range of support service grants that the Catholic fee-paying schools do not receive.  The purpose of such grants is not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  It is estimated that savings of &euro;2.8 million will accrue as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from Protestant fee-paying schools in 2009.  The decision to remove the grants was made against the backdrop of the difficult international economic situation.  In such circumstances, the education budget for 2009 inevitably includes a number of measures that involve curtailing expenditure.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science met representatives of the Protestant churches, led by Archbishop John Neill, on 13 November last.  The Minister confirmed his budget day announcement that the Protestant block grant would continue to be paid and expressed his willingness to respond positively to any proposals on how it could be better targeted to meet the needs of the Protestant community, having regard to its dispersed population and the need to sustain Protestant schools.  The representatives of the Protestant church expressed concerns about the needs of the dispersed minority population.  They referred in particular to the need to sustain schools in the Protestant tradition that directly serve that dispersed population in certain areas of the country.  The Minister expressed his willingness to respond positively to any proposals that might be made to his Department to enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of providing access for individuals and sustaining the dispersed schools they wish to attend.  The bishops indicated that they would reflect on how the funding the Minister is continuing to make available might best be deployed to meet the needs of their schools.  Further meetings may be scheduled to develop and build on this useful and constructive discussion.  No specific proposals have been forwarded to the Department.  I thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the position with respect to grant aid for Protestant schools.</P>

	<P>I would like to briefly mention a reasonable alternative suggestion that has been made by Kilkenny College.  The school authorities have suggested that a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the block grant, which is distributed by the Department of Education and Science to Protestant schools, could be provided for.  Such additional moneys could be given to students through the Protestant schools.  The problem faced by Kilkenny College is that it serves a small community that is spread over a large area, including an interesting part of County Kilkenny that is not very far from my locality.  A large number of English people came to work in the coal mines near Castlecomer many years ago.  As a result, the largest rural Church of Ireland community in Ireland is in the Clogh, Castlecomer and Moneenroe area.  The families in question are not very wealthy.  That is the difficulty in which Kilkenny College finds itself.  Many <Col N="260"/>other schools around the country are in a similar position.  I ask the Department to increase the block grant on a <i>pro rata </i>basis from next year, so that schools like Kilkenny College might be in a position to help their students.</P>
