      <P>As the constitution of the House to-day is somewhat different from what it was when the House rose last night, I may perhaps be permitted to remind Senators that the section which is objected to is one which has the effect of giving power to the Minister to compel a midwife to call in a local dispensary doctor, if available, and that it was supported by the Parliamentary Secretary on the grounds that it was desirable for purposes of discipline.  On the Second Reading, it did occur to me that, although that was a perfectly valid reason, yet it might run counter to the demands of humanity and the needs of the patient.  It was a matter, however, about which it was obviously necessary to get some light and guidance from those who are more professionally competent to deal with those two conflicting arguments and, therefore, I took occasion, in the interval, to consult persons who were Masters or ex-Masters of great Dublin midwifery hospitals&mdash;the Rotunda, the Coombe, and Holles Street&mdash;and also with well-known gynæcologists attached to other hospitals, and I was unable to find any one of those specialists who was in favour of this section.  One of them was not anxious to decide between the view of the Parliamentary Secretary and his own view as a doctor, but generally the specialist gynæcologists were strongly against the passing into law of this section, and they assured me that the opinion <Col N="1214" /> of the medical profession, as a whole, was exceedingly adverse to it.</P>
      <P>The reasons for that opinion are simple and, although we are not doctors, I think they are within the knowledge of most of us in this House. For instance, in child-birth, certain emergencies may arise at any time. You may have to deal with a sudden hæmorrhage at any stage of the birth, either before it or after it.  You may have to deal with other sudden and dangerous emergencies, such as eclampsia or fits, and when you are faced with those emergencies the question of the mother's life may depend on promptness in attendance and skill.  Now, drafted as it is, the section imperatively requires that the midwife must call in the dispensary doctor, if available, and no standard is laid down as to the availability of the doctor.  Senators will be aware that in country districts dispensary doctors, very often, are not on the telephone, and they will be also aware that by reason of the shape or contour of a particular county, and the irregularity of the districts over which a dispensary doctor presides, a woman may have her labour come upon her when there is no dispensary doctor within many miles of her place. Apparently, however, this section would make it incumbent upon the midwife to send a message, by bicycle, by foot, or on horseback, to the nearest dispensary doctor, no matter how far away he might be, in order to find out whether or not his services are available.  He might be available, but he might be too late.  He might not be available, and it would be only when the midwife could ascertain that he was not available, that she could call in another doctor.  At the same time, there might be a doctor two or three miles away, perhaps in a nearby town which did not constitute part of the dispensary district, who could be summoned by telephone to save the woman's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that that is more than a possibility; it is a thing which is likely to occur, and I suggest that the mere statement of that as a possibility should be sufficient to induce <Col N="1215" /> this House either to reject altogether or, at least, to insist upon some strong modification of the section as it stands.  But there are other considerations. There may not be an emergency involving danger of the mother's death if it is not dealt with immediately and skilfully, but there may be long and difficult labour in which it is desirable, not only from the point of view of humanity, but also from the point of view of the health of the mother and the child, that skilled, and the most skilled, help should be available at the first opportunity.  I think that not merely the saving of life but the saving of suffering is a consideration which should be allowed to overweigh mere considerations of discipline.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will, no doubt, develop at greater length the necessity for this discipline upon which he has already touched.  But I do rather earnestly urge on this House to insist that the treatment of the patient is, and must be, the primary consideration.  We know that, even among those who are not gynæcological specialists, there are doctors in most districts who tend to pay more attention to midwifery cases than other doctors because they are more expert and more interested in that branch of the profession.  They are more skilled and they are likely to be able to deliver a woman sooner and with less suffering and, speaking for myself, I do feel that it is a wrong thing that the midwife should be compelled to call in a dispensary doctor, even if he is available, when it may be known to her, and known to everybody in the neighbourhood, that, through no fault of his, he is not as skilled an operator as other doctors equally available.  I ask the House to give greater weight to those considerations than to a rather formalistic conception of discipline.  Discipline is a good thing; it is sometimes a necessary thing, but it is not everything.</P>

      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give careful consideration to the arguments put up by Senator Rowlette and Senator Kingsmill Moore in support of the <Col N="1216" /> amendment.  It seems to me that there could be another way of getting round the difficulty and the danger of subordination, and the other problems envisaged, without making it normal practice for the midwife to call in the local medical officer of health.  But there may be occasions when, for fear of offending against the law, she may make a delay which will cost a woman's life or cause untold suffering to her and, perhaps, the loss of her baby.  For this reason, I think the whole section should be recast so as to make plain the purpose in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind.  It may be normal that the medical officer of health of the dispensary district should be called in by the midwife, but the midwife should not be prevented from calling in another doctor. The section deals with emergency cases.  We should not give the midwife an added responsibility by a drastic rule like this.  I feel that, in drafting the amendment, Senator Rowlette was inspired, as he always is, by the most humanitarian and high-minded principles.  I can speak with some knowledge of Senator Rowlette, because it has been my privilege for the past eight years, with Senator Foran, to work with him on national health matters in which, we expect, the Parliamentary Secretary takes a great interest.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been responsible for progress which, in effect, is epoch-making in our conception of national health aims and attainments.  Senator Rowlette has immense knowledge of these principles which those of us feel always inspired him, and his long association with the medical life of this country may impress the Minister to give due consideration to the difficulties which may arise if the section, as it stands, is allowed to go on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the sub-section might be recast somewhat on the lines of the first sub-section which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a child-birth, in which any emergency specified in rules made under this Act occurs, she shall call into her assistance in accordance with such rules a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> Normally that would be the medical officer of health, and I think it is what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind.  I would appeal to him not to put on the Statute Book this very drastic limitation of her power to call in another doctor if she wishes, where the life of woman and child and, if she survives, her future health, may be in question.  As a woman I am naturally interested in this question and I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider it in the light of the considerations that have been laid before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in support of the very eloquent appeal of Senator Kingsmill Moore and the very able case made by Senators Concannon and Rowlette.  I want to say that the Bill is an excellent one.  It is timely and it is extremely necessary but the amendment suggested by Senator Dr. Rowlette makes the Bill a good deal better.  If, as Senator Kingsmill Moore said, the heads of the chief maternity hospitals in Dublin are on the side of the amendment, I think that, apart from anything I might say, ought to influence the Parliamentary Secretary. If these men with their vast experience and knowledge believe that the amendment would improve the Bill, it ought to have some weight with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I sincerely hope that he will adopt the suggestion of Senator Mrs. Concannon that, if he is not willing to accept the amendment, he might recast the whole section in the Bill.  As I stated at the outset, the Bill is a good Bill but in my opinion it would make it still better if the Parliamentary Secretary would put in a provision to ensure that people who required the services of the local authority can get the best service available in their need.  The matter has been well expounded by previous speakers and I shall not go further into it.  It is only right and proper in view of the declining birthrate and the appalling death-rate that the provision should be enshrined in the Bill so as to enable the poor to get the best medical service available in time of need.  It would help very materially if the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1218" /> would either accept the amendment or adopt the suggestion put forward by Senator Mrs. Concannon to recast the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot see any justification for the implications read into this section by Senator Kingsmill Moore.  The amendment is to delete sub-section (8) of the section.  Let us picture what would be the position if that section were deleted.  What would be the position of a midwife in the country? To my mind, this Bill will affect rural areas very largely or areas other than municipal areas like Dublin where the maternity hospitals will not be at all concerned with the application of this Bill.  Here we are concerned with the assistance rendered by a midwife in an entirely rural dispensary district.</P>
      <P>If the sub-section is deleted and the midwife has reason to call in a registered medical practitioner as specified in sub-section 1, there may be several practitioners besides the dispensary doctor living in the vicinity or within a very narrow radius.  How is she going to select which of these she will call in?  If she is to select a practitioner other than the dispensary doctor, will the other doctors not immediately criticise her action?  I can see much difficulty arising if that sub-section be deleted.  If she has to call in a doctor why should she not call in the dispensary doctor who has been selected for that position by the higher members of his own profession sitting on a selection board?  I suggest that there should be an obligation on her to call in first the person who has been appointed by the Government through the Local Appointments Commission to carry out the duties of dispensary doctor.  For instance, if a gynæcological expert were spending his holidays in the district would she be supposed to call him in in preference to anybody else?  The phraseology of the section is plain, that her first selection should be the local dispensary doctor.  If he is not available I think Senator Kingsmill Moore said that she should get a neighbouring dispensary doctor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied. If he is not available, the only thing that seems to matter is how she is to estimate the degree of availability.  I think there are rules to be framed under this section and I fancy that the more or less reasonable people who will frame those rules will hold that availability means that if the doctor were out on the other side of the village on another case, the midwife, knowing that half-hours, quarter-hours or even minutes might make all the difference, would then be free to call in another practitioner in the town or from another dispensary district.  I cannot see why the Legislature should remove from the midwife the obligation of first calling in the aid of the medical practitioner appointed to carry out the duties of the dispensary district and selected for that position by the higher members of the profession in the country.  It might put her in a very awkward position if she were at liberty to select somebody other than a dispensary doctor.  Doctors are human just like the rest of us and jealousies would immediately arise if she were given that liberty.</P>
      <P>A doctor would ask: &ldquo;What authority had the midwife to select Dr. So-and-So instead of me; he is not a dispensary doctor any more than I am.&rdquo;  That would create a lot of friction, and friction can occur amongst members of the medical profession as well as amongst other members of the community.  I cannot see, therefore, why such a lot of stress should be laid on this section.  I think it is reasonable to provide that the midwife should first call in the aid of the person who was appointed specifically to come to her aid if she requires it.  If he is not available, the question of availability then arises.  If she calls in the aid of the dispensary doctor and he is called away to the other side of the parish, she would then be entitled to call in any other practitioner in the town.  On that interpretation, I think the sub-section is quite reasonable, and I cannot see any objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Second <Col N="1220" /> Reading speech in the Seanad the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the Dáil had made substantial amendments to the Bill and &ldquo;if Senators feel they can further improve it I shall be very glad indeed of their assistance in trying to make it a better measure than it appears to be.&rdquo;  I do very strongly and urgently urge him, joining my voice with that of Senator Mrs. Concannon and of Senator Foran, to listen to this appeal.  It is not a political appeal.  It is an appeal made in the highest interest of humanity. Those who have already spoken in favour of it show that there is nothing whatever political about it.  Senator Kingsmill Moore mentioned that he had consulted certain gynæcologists in the city with regard to the matter.  I consulted a lady whose experience in organising nursing and midwifery over the whole of Ireland must be unique. I explained to her without giving my own opinion previously what was being proposed.  She stated: &ldquo;That is not so at present.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;No, it is a proposed change in the law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not too much to say that she was horrified.  She said: &ldquo;You must get that altered if you possibly can.&rdquo; I answered: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;I can think of no more disastrous step for child welfare, for the bringing of children into this world, than for an amendment of that sort.&rdquo;  I again said: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She said that the dispensary doctor may be a more expert obstetrician than another available doctor or <i>vice versa</i> but, in a matter of this kind, the choice must be left to the patient.  She said that it is always unprofessional conduct for any nurse to influence a patient in the choice of a doctor.  It is a fundamental rule of the nursing service.  I need not reiterate the arguments that have been urged already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore mentioned the question of discipline.  There, again, the higher interest of humanity, the getting of the best service at that particular time completely overrides any possible injury to discipline.  A question was also raised about the fee. The mere amount of money, whatever the sum may be, must be cast aside entirely compared with the importance <Col N="1221" /> of getting the best service.  A rich person can afford to choose his or her doctor and has the right to do that. Here we are dealing with comparatively poor people, and that is why I am glad Senator Foran spoke so strongly in favour of the amendment. Why should a person because she is poor have to jeopardise the life of herself and the life of her infant because she cannot afford the doctor she wants?  Under the proposal a midwife may be required by the Minister to bring in a less experienced doctor. I strongly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, in the spirit of his own words, which I have quoted, to adopt the amendment in some way or other, whether by accepting Senator Rowlette's amendment, as suggested by Mrs. Concannon, or by adopting another form of wording which will equally meet the point at issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes I feel after listening to debates here we must be very far removed from the realities of life.  While discussing this section some speakers gave me the impression that some terrible grievance must exist among midwives on account of this section or that some grave hardship is going to be inflicted upon others.  We must have a little commonsense and understanding about the position as this event is not one that takes place without due notice. We know that the expectant mother consults the nurse some months previous to the event and the local dispensary doctor if it is a case for medical assistance.  In almost every case an arrangement is come to, if the dispensary doctor is not available on a particular day on which the event is expected, for another doctor to be available.  We heard statements to-day rather critical of dispensary doctors and their ability to carry on this work, but we know that in many cases well-to-do people, who could afford their own doctors, prefer to get the dispensary doctor in cases of child birth, because of their wide knowledge and experience.  One would imagine from Senator Kingsmill Moore that midwives were deprived of the opportunity to secure an outside doctor if such were necessary <Col N="1222" /> and that if the dispensary doctor was not available they must first scour the country to find out where he was before another doctor could be called in.  That is not the case.  The Senator shakes his head and suggests that that is not exactly what he meant to convey.  If it is not what he meant to convey, what are his objections to the Bill?</P>
      <P>The Bill says that where a midwife has to call a doctor to her assistance she shall forthwith report the nature of the emergency and the name of the practitioner to the local supervising authority.  What Senator Kingsmill-Moore fears is that in the absence of a dispensary doctor the midwife may be at a disadvantage in regard to calling in some other doctor.  That is not so.  If we pass this amendment what we would be doing would be reorganising the whole dispensary system.  I hope that it will be done in the near future.  If we held that a dispensary doctor is not the proper person to call in, and that the midwife must have the right to call in any doctor she wishes, I put it to Senators that persons suffering from any other illness and entitled to get free medical service should have the same choice.</P>
      <P>Not alone should they have the same choice&mdash;and I hope Senator Rowlette will agree with this&mdash;but when they get a ticket, and when it is presented to any doctor he should be compelled to attend them.  That point has not been brought out.  No doctor need attend in this case except the dispensary doctor, and therefore it is essential that midwives should be compelled to call him.  Any other doctor could object to coming if he did not think he was going to get a fee or if he thought it was going to be a critical case that he would not like to undertake. The Bill is a reasonable one, and I think it would be unwise to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to put my limited experience against the opinions expressed by men of the capacity of Senator Rowlette.  But, from a little experience which came to my notice some time ago, I think it would be somewhat dangerous to give <Col N="1223" /> too much power to a midwife as to the choice of doctor in such cases.  I learned that, in an area in County Clare, the dispensary doctor had occasion to tick off a midwife on some occasion.  She took great umbrage at whatever remarks he made in the course of his professional duties and became very resentful.  A new and very inexperienced doctor came into the area and she diverted her choice from the resident dispensary doctor on almost every occasion and called in the young and inexperienced doctor, not because she thought he was the more skilled man but because she had developed a spleen and animus against the dispensary doctor.  That might not occur in many cases, but there is a danger of it, and I think that it would be rather a serious matter to put that power in the hands of a midwife.  Most of the dispensary doctors have been selected by the Appointments Commission, and it is the duty of that commission&mdash;we must assume that it does it in all cases&mdash; to see that the doctor is proficient in all the arts of his profession.  In such circumstances, I should not like to give any midwife authority to override her duty to call on him when available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>If I intervene for a moment, it may save time.  Some of the Senators who have spoken during the past few minutes have completely mistaken the position.  Senator Honan has just remarked that it would be dangerous to give the midwife this liberty.  There is no question of giving the midwife liberty.  The question before the House, as postulated by the Parliamentary Secretary, is whether the midwife should be deprived of the liberty she has enjoyed during the past 26 years.  Senator O'Donovan fell into the same blunder as Senator Honan as regards the nature of the amendment. He asked where the amendment, if adopted, would leave the law.  Exactly where it is and where it has been for the past 26 years.  Nothing untoward occurred in the countryside in this connection during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant. Senator Honan referred to a difference between two persons&mdash;we do not know whether one of them was the dispensary doctor or not.  The midwife exercised a choice.  We do not know whether she exercised wisely or not. The Senator says that she exercised it because of spleen.  That is a judgment which we are not able to follow. It may be true or it may not.  The dangers that are frightening Senator O'Donovan and with which the Parliamentary Secretary tried to frighten us all a few days ago have not occurred. Friction does occur between doctors and midwives as between other people.  Friction occurs occasionally between Senators.  It is suggested that even amongst Ministers friction occurs but, of course, I do not believe that.  This position has obtained for 26 years and what I am now asking the House to do is to leave it as it is&mdash;to leave midwives free to exercise their judgment, or to misuse their conscience if that is what they want to do.  But that they should have freedom and responsibility, I have no doubt.  To fix responsibility in this case by statute of the Oireachtas seems to me to be a monstrous liberty to take with human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the fact that a birth is ordinarily expected in or about a certain time.  I was very interested in the knowledge of the physiology of maternity shown both by my colleague Senator Kingsmill Moore and Senator Hawkins.  Senator Hawkins seems to think that a parturient woman is able, with the help of a midwife or confidential neighbours, to fix, within a day or a week, the time of the expected birth.  Sometimes, it is not possible to fix that time even within a month.  To say that she is able to arrange to have a midwife or a dispensary doctor there to the tick of the moment, is all nonsense.  The Senator will excuse me for saying that.  Things do not happen that way.  Births come precipitately.  Hæmorrhage oftentimes precedes the birth.  Accidents may occur with very little warning. Yet, Senators have been talking as if a matter of hours or days was of no <Col N="1225" /> importance.  Minutes may be of importance to the lives of two persons. Are we, for the sake of some imaginary point of discipline, after the experience of 26 years, to risk the lives of two persons at a most important crisis for both?  I hope the House will not give its support to the proposal to reverse the law against humanity as it is proposed to do in the section which we are discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct a misapprehension which has, evidently, crept in regarding what I have been saying.  I am in entire agreement with Senator Hawkins that, when the midwife has ascertained that the dispensary doctor is not available, she will be at liberty to call in some other practitioner.  My point is that emergencies occur without warning, a midwife may not know whether the dispensary doctor is available or not and may not be able to ascertain whether or not he is available for a couple of hours.  The dispensary doctor may not have a telephone and may live at a considerable distance.  In circumstances such as those, if we are to read the section strictly, the midwife would have to go to the length of sending for the dispensary doctor, on the assumption that he was available, when she might have, within a distance of half a mile, a non-dispensary doctor who could deal with the emergency and save the life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last remark by Senator Kingsmill Moore brings a point to mind which requires clarification.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a childbirth in which any emergency specified in rules made under this Act occurs....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore an emergency situation such as indicated by Senator Kingsmill Moore does not arise.  He spoke of an emergency occurring in the street or on a tram or bus or something else.  But according to the clause here it is apparent to my lay mind that the question is one of a hæmorrhage or something that cannot be controlled.  According to the phraseology the emergency occurs at the child-birth.  It is not an emergency <Col N="1226" /> which has caused the child-birth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean that.  You may have a perfectly normal birth which suddenly turns wrong.  You may have a hæmorrhage at any moment.  These things may come out of the blue and what are you going to do if you are going to scour the country looking for a dispensary doctor maybe nine miles away, when the emergency is actually at hand?</P>

      <P>Senator Dr. Rowlette has, to my mind, made a very good case.  If this clause will, to some extent, endanger human life I think the Seanad ought to consider the passing of it very seriously&mdash;ought to consider the passing of any clause that would give any semblance of danger to human life.  I do not agree fully with all Senator Dr. Rowlette has said because I am aware of midwives and doctors living like cats and dogs.  We had, in fact, a very prominent law case some years ago regarding a midwife who had a libel case because she had one doctor's preference as against another. You are sure to find a lot of difference between midwives and doctors.  So far as the inclusion of this clause may cause danger to any human beings I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider whether he will press that clause.  I do not really understand why it is essential for midwives to have a particular local dispensary doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may recall that Séamus O'Kelly wrote a famous play entitled <i>The Bribe</i>, which arose out of a situation something like we are now discussing here.  It is a well known fact, in the country at any rate, particularly in the case of pregnant women, that they take likes and dislikes to certain doctors. I would not like to be a party to making it compulsory upon any woman who is going to give birth to a child to accept the local dispensary doctor. If it is going to be made obligatory on a local midwife to have a certain doctor, that, in my opinion, is going <Col N="1227" /> to have repercussions which we might well avoid.</P>
    <P>There is not, of course, any political aspect to this matter.  It is, I am sure, purely a humanitarian matter and in so far as it is humanitarian and concerns danger to life, I will support Senator Dr. Rowlette's amendment.  I would not say, of course, that the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter is himself not humanitarian or that because a person is a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister he should not happen to have some humanitarian feelings.  I am not saying that all the humanitarian feelings happen to be on the left-hand side of this House, but I am sure that when the Parliamentary Secretary is quite aware of the implications arising out of the clause he may think differently. I am pre-disposed at the moment to vote in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is one point I do not follow in connection with a case such as Senator Honan has mentioned, about midwives consistently looking for a dispensary doctor.

      <P>I think I have scarcely ever observed such confusion of thought regarding any matter as I have observed in the discussion on this Bill.  It is true that I invited the co-operation of the House and I still would welcome the co-operation of the House in improving this measure, but if I invited the co-operation of the House to improve the Bill I did not invite co-operation&mdash;I must resist any attempt to mislead the House in this <Col N="1228" /> matter&mdash;I did not invite co-operation in amending this Bill in such a way as to very seriously take from its effectiveness and to create other repercussions and difficulties that I shall have to deal with in order that the minds of Senators may be clearer on the matter than they appear to be.</P>
      <P>Whether that confusion of thought to which I have referred is to be attributed to my failure to explain the Bill at greater length, I am not prepared to say.  How far it may be due to what I consider to be misleading statements, by Senator Rowlette particularly, is a matter which the Seanad can also decide when I have made my case.  I do not desire at all to charge Senator Rowlette with deliberately misleading the House but I think that he did not fully inform himself on this matter.  I do know, and such knowledge makes one suspicious, that he is particularly hostile to the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech on the Second Reading in this House, Senator Rowlette described Section 46 as being thoroughly mischievous.  That phrasing was not particularly happy, and whether it was an accurate description or not we shall see as we pass on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is another clause which the Parliamentary Secretary passed over very lightly.  It is thoroughly mischievous and interferes with the efficiency of the whole midwifery service in the country.  The Midwives Bill, 1918, which was passed by a foreign Parliament, but a Parliament which had a great deal more care for the health of the country than any Government so far in this country, although we hoped for much better 20 years ago, had one great advantage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, perhaps, I am too sensitive on these matters, but I consider that that was a thoroughly mischievous statement, and inconsistent with the facts. Senator Rowlette may be sad of heart because the benevolent foreign Parliament of 1918 no longer regulates our destinies.</P>

Inasmuch as the Bill before the House purports to replace the Act of 1918, and inasmuch as it has been made to appear to the House that, in certain respects, this Bill is a retrograde step, I think we must advert to the terms of the Act of 1918, and must satisfy ourselves if, in fact, and to what extent, this Bill is a retrograde step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, within the Chairman's discretion.  Now, Section 22 of the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918, says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In case of an emergency, as defined in the rules of the board under this Act, a midwife shall call in to her assistance a registered medical practitioner, and the local supervising authority shall (unless the patient is entitled to medical relief under Section 9 of the Poor Law Relief (Ireland) Act, 1851), pay to such medical practitioner a fee according to a scale to be fixed by the Local Government Board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I would ask Senators to let the terms of that section sink in.  The midwife was authorised to call in any medical practitioner. There is no doubt whatever about that, but if the case were a poor law case, that medical practitioner could not be paid a fee.  Senator Rowlette, of course, is aware of that, and so is Senator Kingsmill Moore, but <Col N="1232" /> there are Senators here who have not been following this debate sufficiently closely to realise that that was, in fact, the position under this charter of protection, about which we have heard so much, which was passed by a foreign Parliament in 1918&mdash;if that is in order.  In this particular connection, sub-section 1 of Section 46, of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a childbirth in which any emergency specified in rules made under this Act occurs, she shall call in to her assistance, in accordance with such rules, a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far, I think we are fairly well in step with the Act of 1918.  There is no restriction in that section whatever on the midwife in calling in a registered medical practitioner.  Before we come to sub-section (8) I would like to draw the attention of the House to sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a registered medical practitioner has, in response to a call made by a midwife under this section, attended in any emergency, the practitioner may report the nature of the emergency to the local supervising authority for the district in which he attended and thereupon such local supervising authority shall pay to the practitioner the appropriate fee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Senators to note that where a practitioner is called in, the local supervising authority shall pay the appropriate fee.  Then, we come to the sub-section which Senator Rowlette asked us to delete.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in sub-section (1) of this section or any rules made for the purpose of that sub-section shall be construed....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask the close attention of the House to the phrasing of this sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...as preventing the Minister from requiring a midwife of a dispensary district when calling in to her assistance, under this section, a registered medical practitioner, to call in the medical officer of such district if he is available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> Nothing in the subsection shall be construed as depriving the Minister of the power that he has under the Public Assistance Act of 1939.  Is that a reasonable provision, yet is it suggested to the House that we should make this innocuous-looking but most radical amendment of the Public Assistance Act of 1939?  In order that the House may realise where the amendment would lead us, I shall have to ask its indulgence to draw attention to the regulations which have been made under that Act before they deprive the Minister of the power of making such regulations.  Before passing from sub-section (1) of Section 46, I will direct the attention of the House to the phrasing of it, as it is important.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at child-birth in which any emergency....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan staggered very near to understanding this.  &ldquo;Any emergency&rdquo;, mark you&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;specified in rules made under this Act occurs, she shall call in to her assistance in accordance with such rules a registered medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senators do not appear to appreciate the wide scope of the type of emergency specified in the rules&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1234" />&ldquo;In all cases of illness of the patient or child or of any abnormality occurring during pregnancy, labour, or lying-in, a midwife must forthwith call in a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is much wider in scope than many members of the House realise.  It is not only the type of emergency which Senator Kingsmill Moore referred to&mdash;a sudden emergency like a hæmorrhage or something of that kind where little warning might be given&mdash;but in all cases of illness of the patient or child, or in any abnormality occurring during pregnancy, the midwife is under an obligation to call in a medical practitioner.

      <P>I submit to the House that the deletion of sub-section (8) would drive a coach-and-four through our whole scheme of medical attendance of women in childbirth under the Public Assistance Act, and I shall have to refer the House to the regulations made under that Act. Regulation No. 10 (1) sets out:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A visiting medical assistance ticket issued in the form No. 2 in the schedule to this Order, in a case of midwifery shall be deemed to cast on the medical officer of a dispensary district receiving it a full and undivided responsibility for the care of the case...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senators will note that it is a statutory obligation:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...notwithstanding the fact that a midwife is appointed for the service of the district, and the fact that <Col N="1235" /> the services of the midwife are available shall not be deemed to relieve the medical officer from responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The medical officer himself is responsible, and the patient has the choice of calling the medical officer in the first instance without summoning the midwife. If he is called, he is under statutory obligation to go.  Sub-section (3) of Section 10 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following provisions shall apply in all cases in which medical assistance is required by medical assistance ticket for women in labour:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the ticket should ordinarily be addressed to the midwife of the dispensary district;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the ticket, if in the form No. 2 in the Schedule to this Order, shall be presented to the medical officer of the dispensary district, who shall register it and ascertain by visiting the patient that the case is one of natural labour;</P>
    <P>(iii)  if it should appear on such visit that the case is likely to be attended with any difficulty or danger, the medical officer of the dispensary district shall take charge of the case himself, and may also requisition the services of the midwife of the dispensary district; but if the medical officer is satisfied that the case is one of normal labour, he may place the midwife in attendance directing her that should anything abnormal or dangerous arise, she shall immediately call for his assistance;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>And again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(v) if, in any case attended upon a ticket whether in the form No. 2, or the form No. 3 in the Schedule to this Order, the midwife of the dispensary district finds it necessary to call for the assistance of the medical officer of the dispensary district, and shall intimate in writing the same to him, the medical officer shall immediately take charge of the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And now, as to some of the duties <Col N="1236" /> prescribed for the medical officer of a dispensary district in relation to attendance on women in childbirth:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(9)  To inspect at the end of each quarter of the year, the register of cases attended by the midwife of the dispensary district and to see that the same is properly entered up by her and to authenticate the same by his initials with the initial of the date of inspection.</P>
    <P>(18)  To report to the public assistance authority or to the Minister any neglect or failure on the part of the...midwife or the dispensary nurse to discharge punctually and properly the duties appertaining to their offices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Among the duties prescribed for the midwife of the dispensary district under the Public Assistance Code are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) To summon in writing the medical officer of the district in any case of midwifery upon which she is in attendance in which his assistance becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>(5) On the termination of any midwifery cases in which the assistance of the medical officer of the district has not been called for, to report the result to the medical officer of the district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are more of these regulations to complete the scheme of organisation under the Public Assistance Act to provide for women in childbirth.  The amendment before the House proposes that the Minister's power to make these regulations be withdrawn and that that radical change in the whole Public Assistance Code should be brought about in this way.  I submit to the House that, whatever may be said as to the merits of the case that might be made for the amendment of the Public Assistance Code, such a radical change cannot be brought about by this innocent-looking amendment in the name of Senator Rowlette.</P>
    <P>I should also mention for the guidance of the House and in the hope that the members of the House, notwithstanding what has been said to them by various speakers, will appreciate it, <Col N="1237" /> that so far from this Bill being a retrograde step it is an advance.  It is an advance in this way.  As I have shown the House already, under Section 22 of the Act of 1918, if a practitioner other than a dispensary medical officer were called in in a poor law case, no fee could be paid but, under this Bill, when it becomes law, if it should become law in its present form, if a practitioner other than the medical officer is called in, when the medical officer of the district is not available, the local authority shall pay him a fee.  The medical profession is a philanthropic body of men but at the same time I think in this age, it is too much to expect the type of service we were asked to believe we would get under an Act that did not provide for any payment for the service.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter closely related to this to which I should like to draw Senators' attention because I want to satisfy the House that, in so far as the poor are concerned, we are making absolute and complete provision for proper attendance on poor women in childbirth, a more complete provision for the poor woman in childbirth than is being made for any other woman in childbirth, for this reason, that if she desires to have a doctor in the first instance, instead of a nurse, the doctor must attend and she can have both the nurse and the doctor. It does not finish there.  Article 14 of the Regulations for the Government of Dispensary Districts sets out.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever, in the course of his attendance upon dispensary patients a case arises which, in the opinion of the medical officer of a dispensary district, necessitates his obtaining the assistance of another medical practitioner, the medical officer may, on his own authority, summon the assistance of such other medical practitioner and shall thereupon report fully in writing the circumstances to the public assistance authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not only can she have the services of the dispensary doctor but if he finds himself in any difficulty, she can have the services of any doctor he thinks fit to summon as consultant.  Senator <Col N="1238" /> Rowlette must have known that, and I feel he has not been fair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Mention has been made by more than one Senator &mdash;by Senator Kingsmill Moore and by Senator O'Sullivan in particular&mdash;that they have consulted various people outside this House who should be competent to judge on this matter.  I do not suggest that in that particular matter they are attempting to mislead the House, but I do want to say that I have consulted the Central Midwives Board and that this Bill, which has been described by many good judges as one of the best measures of its kind in existence in Europe to-day, is the result of these joint discussions.</P>

      <P>Section 47 as it was introduced in the Dáil read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a childbirth in which any emergency specified in rules made under this Act occurs, she shall call in to her assistance in accordance with such rules a registered medical practitioner and such practitioner shall, if the midwife is attending the patient in the course of her duties as a midwife of a dispensary district, be the medical officer of such district, if available.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was statutory obligation in the original draft to call in the medical officer of the dispensary district.  There is nothing in the Bill before the House putting statutory obligation upon the midwife to call in the dispensary doctor.  Even Senator Kingsmill Moore will agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>But as I have shown to the House the Minister has certain power under the Public Assistance Act.

      <P>May a person who is not in all this acrimony ask the Parliamentary Secretary, what is the difference between what is actually in the Bill and what is in the draft which was not acceptable to certain people? Under the draft the midwife was compelled to call in the dispensary doctor if he was available, and under this Act is there any difference?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a childbirth in which any emergency specified in rules made under this Act occurs, she shall call in to her assistance in accordance with such <Col N="1242" /> rules a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point at issue, and to which the Central Midwives Board objected, was the putting on them of a statutory obligation to take certain disciplinary action, if the midwife failed to carry out her duties under the Public Assistance Act, they said, and properly said: &ldquo;That is not a matter for us. We are concerned with the discipline and control of midwives in general, and you must find some other way of making her obey your rule under the Public Assistance Code.&rdquo;  It seemed reasonable and I said: &ldquo;All right, you do not seek to deprive us of any statutory powers.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;No, but do not put a statutory obligation on us to do something which is not our job to do.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with that.  Clearly we cannot define &ldquo;availability&rdquo;.  In the first place, may I again point out that this was the law and is the law to-day?  There was no power to pay any other doctor who was called in in the past.  Under this Bill he can be paid if it was not possible to get the dispensary doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The degree of the emergency will have to be determined by the midwife on the spot.  That is the first test that has to be applied.  The second test will be a matter for the local authority.  She will have to report that there was such and such an emergency, that it was acute and immediate, and that while the dispensary doctor may have been available he was ten miles away, and that there was another doctor only a mile away. In the circumstances, the dispensary doctor was not available for meeting the particular emergency and no local <Col N="1243" /> authority would hold that he was.  That is my opinion with regard to interpreting &ldquo;availability&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Parliamentary Secretary's efforts to interpret the word &ldquo;availability&rdquo; are very important since he is voicing a Departmental view.  These things do not change when the view is taken Departmentally. They do not alter with the complexion of a political Government. I was not here for the Second Reading debate, but I read the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, and I hope I am not going to get into a row myself.</P>

      <P>When I read the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks I came to the conclusion that he had no case at all.  He began with a good case to-day, but he trampled it in the mud and went back to the Black-and-Tans and all sorts of things.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a fair case for certain points.  One point was that there was no provision for the payment of doctor on a red ticket case other than the dispensary doctor.  That is a definite improvement. It seems to me quite honestly that the dispensary doctor could be called in instead of the midwife. It would seem that the dispensary doctor must be called in if he is available.  He must be called in before any other doctor can be summoned in case of an emergency and the midwife would know that she will be fairly treated if she does summon another doctor, not being the dispensary doctor.  The Parliamentary Secretary appears to me, in his last definition of &ldquo;availability&rdquo;, to have gone a good way to removing some of the objections to this sub-section.  That is to say, in the case of a sudden, unforeseen emergency, the nearest doctor can be called in.  So far as I understood, that is what the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary amounted to.  If that be the case, it might be <Col N="1244" /> possible to put words into this section which would indicate that.</P>
      <P>I know that it is difficult to put everything one wants into legislation and that a good deal depends on the way legislation is worked.  If this section were worked by the Department in such a way that midwives would be always afraid to move away from the dispensary doctor and call in another doctor, we should, certainly, be doing grave injury to people at a very serious moment of their lives. While we might save a few shillings, it would be a very short-sighted policy and would cost us more in the end.  It could not by any means be described as an economy.  It seems to me that the case made was a good case.  I feel that if the Parliamentary Secretary argued with the Midwives Board in the way he argued with the Seanad, and if they agreed with him, the agreement is not worth much.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;having kept in touch with this matter from the angle of the Midwives Board and that of the gynaecological specialists&mdash;that the chief objection of the Midwives Board to the section, as introduced, was that the responsibility was cast upon them of acting in a disciplinary manner. Acting as a Midwives Board, but not as gynaecologists or doctors, they said: &ldquo;You cannot expect us to do this.&rdquo; The Parliamentary Secretary, in response, if my recollection is correct, to representations from Dr. Corbet, said: &ldquo;I sympathise with that and I will yield to you and alter the section by entrusting the authority for taking disciplinary action over the midwife concerned when she has called somebody else.&rdquo;  The Midwives Board did not at any time, nor did the past chairman or the present chairman, agree that, from the medical point of view or the point of view of the health of the people, this was a desirable section. They merely acquiesced in so far as responsibility for enforcing the section which they did not like was taken from them and put on somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> The other point I want to make is this: The Parliamentary Secretary says that, in many respects, this Bill is an advance on the 1918 Act.  It is an advance in so far as it makes provision for the payment of the outside doctor who is called in, though I think that, in practice, fees used to be paid to the outside doctors in such circumstances. That was not provided for in the Act, but I think that it was the practice. I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to ride away on the plea that, because he has made the Bill better in one respect, he is entitled to make it worse in another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That which I have been speaking about.  In one respect, the Parliamentary Secretary has cleared the air in that he has shown that the term &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; is used in a sense other than the popular sense.  I venture to agree with him that there are a number of cases which would come within the definition of emergency in his rules in which there would be ample time to call in the dispensary doctor and for the dispensary doctor to call in more skilled assistance if he cared to do so. That term, &ldquo;emergency,&rdquo; as defined in the rules, covers things that are not ordinarily regarded as emergencies. It does not alter my objection to it in the class of cases which the ordinary person would call &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; cases and which are admitted to be not unusual by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It covers the case of a woman who is bleeding or in fits and who may die within a matter of minutes or hours if she cannot get prompt attention. If the Parliamentary Secretary does not see his way to withdraw this section as a whole, I should, at least, expect that he would introduce on Report Stage an amendment which would make quite clear that the nurse is not to be hampered by any rules or regulations or any fear of official reprisals if, when she thinks a woman should get attention as quickly as possible, she calls in the nearest <Col N="1246" /> doctor, whether he be a dispensary doctor or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has justified this Bill as an improvement on the 1918 Act on the ground that, under it, the doctor who is called in will get paid.  I am certain that the woman and child do not care whether the doctor is paid or not.  The fact that the doctor will be paid does not make the least impression on me. If the definition which the Parliamentary Secretary gave of &ldquo;availability&rdquo; could be incorporated in the rules governing the application of the Act, it would be acceptable to me, at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes agreed with me, for once, that the whole difficulty arises from the interpretation of &ldquo;availability&rdquo;.  I agree with him that the meaning of that word should be amplified.  We have spoken of that sufficiently and I do not want to dilate further on it.  I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that these rules govern a great many conditions antecedent to the actual childbirth. The first line of the section says: &ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a childbirth...&rdquo;  From the explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary, these rules govern pre-natal conditions as well.  I am always afraid of the lawyers and of the interpretation they will put on Acts of the Oireachtas. There is no use in pointing out what the intention of the Oireachtas was because the lawyer will say: &ldquo;These are the words in the Act.&rdquo;  Therefore, I think that the use of the word &ldquo;childbirth&rdquo; is too restricted.  Childbirth is a definite occurrence and the rules relate, in addition, to conditions which are antecedent to childbirth.  I can imagine Senator Kingsmill Moore going to court and pointing out that these matters are not actually relevant to &ldquo;childbirth&rdquo;, as set out in the section. I have experience of these points <Col N="1247" /> in court.  From the rules which the Parliamentary Secretary has read out, I do not think that the word used in the first sub-section is of sufficiently wide scope.  As to these differences of opinion between doctors, it turns out that the doctors are not doing too badly under this Bill.  It provides that some doctors are to be remunerated for what they formerly did voluntarily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary explain the position regarding the rules at present?  He has rules which apparently are going to be accepted and also rules under this Act.

      <P>There still seems to be confusion about this.  Under the rules made by the Central Midwives Board there is no restriction on a midwife in the calling in of a doctor to her assistance. The restriction is under regulations made by the Minister under the Public Assistance Act.  That has nothing to do with the Bill before the House to-day.

I want to deal with this question of the Minister requiring the midwife of a dispensary district to do certain things. How is the Minister going to do that? Is it going to be provided in future rules, and is it going to be applied universally to midwives or to midwives of a particular dispensary district?

      <P>I should like to have one point cleared up.  We have had a great deal of talk about the Public Assistance Act on this Bill and while I listened with very great care to the Parliamentary Secretary in his defence of his Bill, and in particular of this section I can find nothing material in what he had to say on the point.  I found a great deal of irrelevancies but I did find one thing which appeared to weigh strongly in his mind and that was this: that if a certain amendment was carried to this Bill by the wisdom or folly of this House, it would interfere with the working of the Public Assistance Act. I would like to be clear on this point, <Col N="1250" /> and perhaps someone could tell me whether the wisdom or the folly of this House is to be restrained by the possibility of the provisions that would be carried being different from those of a previous Act.  I do not know what is the relationship between one Act which seems to cut across the line of another Act&mdash;what the relationship of a previous Act to this Act may be in actual law when both measures are passed.  But the Parliamentary Secretary has stressed how we might drive a coach and four through part of his Public Assistance Act if we were to pass legislation which it might be within the wisdom or folly of the Oireachtas to pass.  I have not heard any explanation as to relationship between two Acts passed with an interval of some years between them, or how it might be settled by the courts.</P>
      <P>The other point relevant to the clause that I wish to refer to now is to express my real disappointment at the Parliamentary Secretary as a tactician and a debater.  He said that he would point out to the House several misleading statements which he said I had made to the House.  He did not quote one.  I listened with the utmost attention and if he had been able to convince me that I had made a misleading statement, one that was intentionally misleading or a misstatement in fact, I would have admitted that and apologised for it, but he did not refer to one.  He referred to various questions on which he was stopped on the rules of order by the Chair.  Apart from one issue, the relationship of the Act which seems to be the apple of his eye and which I agree is a good Act&mdash; the Public Assistance Act&mdash;he did not say one thing that would make one think the section should remain as it is.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Section 46 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 47.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) (c), line 50, after the word &ldquo;attendance&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and any charge that may be made for attendance on such course of instruction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not as far-reaching in its importance as the amendment which the Seanad, in its wisdom, has just defeated, but I think it certainly answers the request of the Parliamentary Secretary that we should try to improve this Bill as much as we could.  There are good points in the Bill. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary had a right to congratulate himself a fortnight ago, but I do not think he has any right to congratulate himself now, in view of his determined&mdash; I will not say obstinate, because I do not want to say anything that will hurt him&mdash;manner of sticking to the letter of the law as he wants to have it.</P>
      <P>The amendment before us refers to the courses of instruction which it is intended to make obligatory on certified midwives under Section 47 of the Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board may, by rules made under this Act, require midwives to attend from time to time such courses of instruction as may be approved of by the board or provided or arranged by them&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While the board may do so-and-so, it would appear that it is certainly intended in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind, and probably in the minds of all of us, that we should make the making of those rules obligatory, and that midwives should be compelled to attend courses of instruction from time to time.  Then, there are certain sub-sections which almost take the place of rules in the matter of attendance. Midwives shall not be required to attend courses of instruction except in accordance with the arrangements made by the local authority in pursuance of sub-section (3) of the section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A local authority by whom a midwife is employed shall, in accordance with such directions as the Minister may give from time to time</P>
      <P>(a)  grant leave of absence to the midwife to attend any course of instruction to which rules for the purposes of this section relate, and</P>
      <P>(b)  pay a substitute for the midwife during the attendance and,</P>
      <P>(c)  pay to the midwife travelling expenses in respect of the attendance (including subsistence allowance during the period of the attendance) in accordance with the relevant regulations...in like manner as if the attendance was part of the official duties of the midwife.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point about the amendment is that it refers to the question of the expenses which may be legally allowable under this Act to a midwife for her attendance at a course of instruction. She is entitled to leave of absence from her local authority, who may also pay a substitute for her during her attendance and pay travelling expenses, including subsistence <Col N="1253" /> allowance.  I would like to draw attention to the question of the payment of fees for courses of attendance. Where courses of attendance or, as they are sometimes called, post-graduate courses, are arranged for nurses, there is usually a fee fixed with the full knowledge of the scanty resources which nurses have, but a fee which is necessary to be paid.  Under this Bill, apparently, a midwife is not entitled to draw a fee of £10 10s. from the local authority to pay for her course of instruction.</P>
    <P>She is entitled to travelling expenses and to the cost of her <i>locum tenens</i> in her district, and under the instructions given by the Department of Local Government, she is entitled also to get reasonable expenses.  It is well to quote the circular of the Department issued on the 8th June last year about post-graduate courses for midwives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to call attention to the Department's previous circular letter pointing out that midwives in the employment of local authorities should be encouraged to attend such courses and to state that the Minister is prepared to sanction the payment of reasonable expenses to midwives of dispensary districts for travelling and subsistence, in addition to the remuneration of substitutes where it may be necessary to employ them during their absence. Subsistence expenses in excess of £2 10s., in fact, will be considered excessive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is some ambiguity, which I daresay is not intended.  Subsistence expenses up to £2 10s. are allowed, but the circular does not say whether the course is for a week, a fortnight or a month.  Apparently, the limit of £2 10s. is fixed, no matter how long the course may last.  Reasonable expenses are left to the discretion of the Department.  According to a circular quoted in the Dáil, the Department expresses the opinion that expenses would not be considered reasonable above a certain figure&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has it at his finger tip&mdash;beyond £2 10s.  The point is this: that while the Bill does make provision for payment to nurses or <Col N="1254" /> midwives of certain of their expenses it leaves a gap, a hiatus.</P>
    <P>In his speech the other day, if I am not mistaken, the scale of £65 to £95 was quoted as the remuneration of dispensary midwives.  I suggest to the Seanad that, where the midwife is compelled as part of her duty to attend a course of instruction, it is only right that the local authority in whose service she is should pay whatever out-of-pocket expenses she is obliged to incur.  I mentioned this point in the Second Reading debate, but it did not receive any sympathy from the Parliamentary Secretary.  In fact he seemed to suggest that, if she was not getting too much under the terms set out in the Bill, she was getting more than she could reasonably expect.  I hope I am not misrepresenting him in that, but I think several members of the Seanad, on Second Reading, supported me in the opinion that, where these very ill-paid, hard-worked women were compelled to leave their homes and their private practice, they should at least be paid their out-of-pocket expenses. While the other items of expense legalised by the Bill seem to be, as far as I could judge, fair enough, it seems entirely unjust and harsh to insist on these women taking a holiday from home that they do not wish to take, leaving their private practice and still continuing to pay out of their own pockets for the instruction they will get at whatever school or maternity hospital they will attend.  I hope members will have sympathy with that point of view and, while recognising the point strongly urged by several members of the Dáil that we should not put further unnecessary expense upon them, I think it will be agreed that it is but natural justice that the employer should pay the expenses incurred in the efforts of these women to improve their capacity and competence.</P>

      <P>As Senator Rowlette has pointed out to the House, the provision in this section is a new provision. Under the section a midwife may be placed under a statutory obligation to take a post-graduate course.  As he has also pointed out, <Col N="1255" /> and as has been previously mentioned in the House, reasonable provision is being made to ensure that she will not incur any heavy financial loss.  She will be given leave of absence, her substitute will be paid, her salary will be continued, her travelling expenses will be paid and she will be entitled to a maintenance allowance not in excess of £2 10s. per week.  I understood from Senator Rowlette that, as the words &ldquo;per week&rdquo; were not included&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a week is mentioned in the circular to local authorities&mdash;&ldquo;not in excess of £2 10s. 0d. per week&rdquo;.  The expenses likely to be incurred in providing these courses of post-graduate instruction, will be, as has already been pointed out by Senator Rowlette, on the small side. It would not impose a serious financial hardship on the midwife if she were asked to bear the expenses.  In fact, she will not.  Under the terms of the Bill the board have no statutory power to impose that financial obligation on the nurse who is compelled to take a post-graduate course.  If expense is incurred in providing or arranging for the post-graduate course, the board will have to bear such expense.  It is true that the post-graduate courses that have been conducted in the past &mdash;and this may possibly have misled Senator Rowlette&mdash;have been arranged by nursing organisations because the Central Midwives Board had no statutory authority to arrange such courses and these nursing organisations, in order to cover their immediate expenses, imposed a fee of, I think, 5/- per nurse.  Now that the board is given statutory power to arrange these courses, the board will have to bear the cost and no financial obligation will be imposed on the nurses attending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has had an unusual history.  There was a debate on its First Reading which I hope will not be treated as a precedent and which I hope will not occur again. There was a very inconclusive debate, highly controversial, on its Second Reading which is now being continued, possibly coming to an end.  Before I come to deal with the Bill on its merits I want to discuss this general background of delegated legislation.  It is a growth, I think an unhealthy growth, which has manifested itself during the last dozen years or so in more countries than one.  In England it attracted the severe condemnation of many people, including the late Lord Chief Justice, Lord Hewart, who exposed its evils in his book <i>The New Despotism.</i>  It has become a leading question in England within the last month or so because of certain proposals by the British Home Secretary, Mr. Herbert Morrison, that this delegated legislation which was made as a war-time emergency measure should be continued well into the post-war period and that Parliament's duty should be restricted merely to a general outline of legislation.  Noticeably in England that has attracted the denunciation of members of all Parties, members of Mr. Morrison's own Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party.  I think it <Col N="1258" /> is unlikely to make any great headway there because it is a deprivation of the essential rights of Parliament.  Here is a passage written by Sir Lynden Macassey, the doyen of the Parliamentary Bar:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Government Bills are forced through Parliament under the pressure of the Government Whips; there is little time for the discussion of their provisions either in the House or in Committee.  Legislation is passed in the most general terms and left to some Government Department to apply as it thinks fit under machinery or rules to be made by it; the Cabinet is, therefore, in a position, through its member at the head of a Government Department, to embark on a particular policy which has never in any detail been discussed in Parliament or communicated to the public.  If the action of the Department is challenged in the House, the Government can say, as has been done, that the action of the Department is fully within the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The same thing has happened here before the war began.  Indeed, the increase in the number of Statutory Orders is quite remarkable.  In 1931, which was the last year of Mr. Cosgrave's Administration, the number of such Orders was 89.</P>
      <P>In 1935 the number had grown to 684. That is an astonishing increase in this delegated legislation, which is not made by us but in Civil Service offices. Hitherto there has been the negative power of annulment.  The Orders to which I am referring, the pre-war Orders, were laid on the Table of the House and a motion for annulment could be tabled within 21 days.  Here is another quotation from the two authors of <i>A Register of Administrative Law in Saorstát Eireann</i>, one of whom is now a judge:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas, accepting the view that its laws should in the main be statements of principle, has shown a notable tendency to delegate the detailed elaboration and the practical application of its enactments. Legislation over a very wide area of <Col N="1259" /> civic activities has accordingly been reinforced by administrative directions of the most varied kind and an extensive body of subsidiary law has grown up in the 12 years under review, far greater in volume than the body of law directly enacted by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the Oireachtas never accepted the view that its law should be in the main statements of principle.  What has happened is that this insidious development has come upon us almost unawares.  Before coming to the Bill I want to state some first principles which seem to be important.  There was much talk of a somewhat vague kind in the debate, so far, of the three main parts of one machine&mdash;Parliament, the Government and the Civil Service.  These are three parts of the democratic machine with differentiated functions.  Take, firstly, the Government. The Government decides policy. Within the terms of its mandate, it brings proposals for legislation before Parliament.  That legislation is prepared by the Civil Service, which has nothing to do with policy.  It is the function of Parliament to scrutinise these proposals for legislation with a critical eye and to amend them in so far as they seem to need amendment. If one of the three parts of the great democratic machine fails to function adequately or if one of those parts attempts to discharge the functions proper to another part of the machine, the result is a breakdown in the democratic system.  I suggest that that is exactly what is happening here.</P>
    <P>I have said before, and I say again, that what is growing up in this country is a highly centralised government of a totalitarian kind.  Both in regard to local authorities and in regard to Parliament, power is more and more being arrogated by the Government of the day, plus the bureaucracy.  That, I think, is highly dangerous and it is our duty to draw attention to that danger before it wrecks the machine.</P>
    <P>The only other quotation which I propose to make is a short one.  The wording of it is, I think, more important <Col N="1260" /> than anything I myself am likely to say this evening.  The writer is Lord Welby who, for many years, was head of the Civil Service in London and, at that time, completely silent, as civil servants should be. After his retirement, he wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a great mistake to assume that the strength of a government is increased by adding to its powers because additional powers always impose additional duties.  There are tasks which only a central government can perform.  To enable it to discharge those tasks, it is wise to devolve on local authorities all the functions you can&mdash;not only those that local authorities can perform as well but even those that they cannot perform quite so well but somehow or other.  The <i>onus probandi</i> should always rest with the centraliser.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say on the Second Reading of this Bill on which I am speaking that the <i>onus probandi</i> rests on the centraliser. But the <i>onus probandi</i> has been thrown back on us by the Government. I say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The onus of proof rests with you, as you are the people who are depriving Parliament of its proper legislative functions. There are instances of that, I am sorry to say.  There are instances of Parliament being regarded by the Government in, shall I say, a somewhat austere manner, a manner which suggests that they do not wish to share with us the function of legislation. We had an example of that some time ago over the Slaughter of Animals Order.  A case was made here but it was not listened to.  The Minister for Local Government came in here, delivered a stentorian tirade and immediately left the House. There was no spirit of give or take, no deference to the views of the House in any respect whatsoever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must admit that, to his knowledge, the Minister for Local Government was engaged in the other House and had to leave immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Houses have their rights.  We had this question out a long time ago before the Senator <Col N="1261" /> came here.  If a Minister has duties in one House, he can delegate his duties in the other House to somebody else.  This House has its rights as a legislative chamber and should preserve its dignity as such.  More recently than that&mdash;only a short time ago&mdash;we had instances of the same thing.  On the First Reading of this Bill the Head of the Government came in and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I thought it was only right to prevent a waste of time, so to speak, of myself or whatever Minister might be concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Head of the Government is always courteous and that was not meant in any discourteous way, but it does disclose the subconscious attitude of the Government to Parliament.  It never can be considered a waste of a Minister's time to come to a House and speak on a Bill to which that House has seen fit to give a First Reading. The trouble is that, after 12 years of power, this Government, like all Governments, has become somewhat despotic and overweening.  These are not my words.  There were used by a great philosopher, John Stuart Mill. He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All Governments become in time despotic and overweening if they continue long enough in power.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say that Parliament itself has become supine and negligent.  I have criticised the Government; I am now criticising ourselves.  Neither in the Dáil nor here is there a sturdy, back-bench element which is prepared to stand up to the Government on points even of detail when it is convinced that the Government is wrong.  A sturdy, back-bench element is one of the preexistent conditions of a flourishing democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I come to the third element in the machine&mdash;the Civil Service.  There is an old saying in the Civil Service that &ldquo;dog does not eat dog.&rdquo;  I was a civil servant long enough to know the extraordinarily valuable work the Civil Service does in its proper sphere, but civil servants have a special point of view.  Every professional man has a special point of view in life.  At a <Col N="1262" /> time when I was a young civil servant, one of my jobs was to compile data that could be embodied in answers to Parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>I remember the indignation I felt on being taken off my particular work in order to compile this useless stuff as I then thought it to be.  I used to curse under my breath the Members of Parliament who were asking these questions and wasting my time.  Of course, circumstances alter cases and that is not my point of view now.</P>
    <P>When I was here a short time as an official of this House, a civil servant whom I know very well&mdash;he is still with us&mdash;was kept waiting a long time for his Bill to come on and he said to me rather petulantly: &ldquo;I wish the Dáil and Seanad never met.&rdquo;  That again is a point of view, but what I want to put forward now is that the Civil Service itself is changing in an important respect.  I have noticed for the last five or six years or more that leading civil servants are concerning themselves with policy.  That is a very regrettable and a very dangerous tendency.  The most recent instance I noticed of it concerns one of our most able civil servants, one of the most genial of men, an indispensable man in his own sphere, and a friend of mine, who at a public dinner&mdash;he undoubtedly had the Minister's approval for this&mdash;announced Government policy, post-war policy on the question of shipping.  That, I think, is an example of a tendency which I suggest is unwise, because one can easily see that, if another Government should come in with a different policy in regard to post-war shipping, the civil servant, having disclosed his own views, will find the circumstances rather difficult.  Therefore, it is a matter for consideration that we should try here not only to discharge our own functions in this machine, but to see that both the Government and the Civil Service discharge theirs.</P>
    <P>With that rather long introduction I come to the Bill itself.  I have no responsibility for the Bill, although I am supporting it.  I did not see it before it was circulated nor was I spoken to about it.  I am not out to make a case for the Bill that does not exist, not out to make a useless case <Col N="1263" /> for the Bill, nor an irrelevant case, though I do suggest that everybody who has spoken against this Bill so far has made an irrelevant case against the Bill.  They have been making a case not against this Bill but against some hypothetical Bill which they have preconceived.</P>

      <P>I make a distinction between Orders <i>in posse</i> and Orders <i>in esse.</i>  I am sorry for using these Latin terms, but I cannot avoid it.  Senator Kingsmill Moore used the simile of the cow and calf.  Somehow, that does not commend itself to me, and I think Senator O'Donovan pointed out that it reminds one of the slaughter of animals.  An Order made by the Government is an Order, <i>in posse.</i> That is laid on the Table.  Pursuant to that the Orders <i>in esse</i> are made by a Minister or by some official.  I think I am right in that.  This Bill concerns only Orders amending the Statute Law.  I forgot to say&mdash;and I should have said it&mdash;that I am treating the Bill as if it incorporated in Committee the amendments which the proposer of the Bill said he was willing to move.  I think I am entitled to do that as they will be duly incorporated if the Bill goes to Committee Stage.  The Bill concerns only the Orders amending the Statute Law; only the Orders <i>in esse</i>&mdash;that is when the thing is actually done.  There is a very good reason why Orders <i>in posse</i>, being merely potential, should not be subjected by us to motions for annulment because we cannot tell until the actual Order <i>in esse</i> is made precisely what is going to be done; therefore, I think that these Orders <i>in esse</i> should come within the ambit of the Bill as it is here proposed that it shall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not apply to any but published Orders, and therefore any suggestion that a breach of confidence would be committed by requiring the tabling of such Orders is incorrect. Another point is that the mover has accepted the proposal that there shall be a Ministerial veto in tabling a motion for annulment in a case where <Col N="1264" /> the public safety would be infringed in any way.  Lastly, nothing can be done at all unless seven members of either House sign a requisition.  Senator Quirke suggested that any seven people&mdash;foolish people in this House&mdash; could be got to do that to embarrass the Government.  I am sorry the Senator is not here, and I will say no more about that except that it is palpably incorrect.  If the Bill is passed with these amendments which I have mentioned, what would be the result? Certainly there would be no annulment of one of these Orders, because the Government which makes the Order has a majority in both Houses.  For myself, I think that even if the Government had not got that majority there would be no danger whatever.</P>
    <P>During the 14 years when the old Seanad was in existence only five motions to annual a Ministerial Order were tabled, three by Senator Sir John Keane, and two by Senator Thomas Johnson.  Senator Sir John Keane withdrew his after constructive, interesting and educative discussions.  Senator Johnson pressed his to a division and only the Labour Party voted with them. Therefore there is no real possibility that the Government would be incommoded in this House by having one of these Statutory Rules or Orders annulled here.  What would happen is that there would be discussion.  Parliament by its very name implies a place for discussion.  If seven people think that an amendment of the existing statutory law is of such moment that it should be discussed in this House, then I say it ought to be discussed here.  A free discussion will help to educate us, myself included, and by its publication in the Press it will help to educate public opinion.  It will be achieving something.  Whether one feels in favour of an Order or against it, it is at any rate a matter for discussion, and that is the case for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the part of my speech delivered before the adjournment I had briefly reviewed the growth of emergency legislation, I had examined <Col N="1265" /> the interaction of the three parts of the Governmental machine, and then I stated my reasons for supporting the Second Reading of this Bill.  I am now coming to the last part, and that is to examine the criticisms made on the First and Second Stage of the principle of the Bill.  I have carefully read every word of these debates, but my task is not a difficult one because, as I hinted before, very little was said that was directed to this Bill at all. A great deal was said which was directed to some Bill envisaged by the speakers, but it did not happen to be this Bill.  It is not surprising, therefore, that most of the comment and criticism offered was inept and irrelevant&mdash;with one exception, and that was the speech made by the Head of the Government in person.  Even there, I had the impression that his criticism was not really directed to the provisions of this measure.</P>
      <P>Now, running through what he said on Second Reading, there was a curious parallelism between his sentiments now on this Bill and his sentiments on his Bill to abolish the Seanad.  To a person like myself, who is reasonably familiar with his speeches that were made at that time, the parallel was indeed astonishing.  He said, formerly, speaking of Second Chambers, and propounding the famous dilemma of the Abbé Sieyes:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is either of the same complexion as the Lower House, in which case it is not an effective check, or it is opposed to the majority in the Lower House, in which case it is mischievous.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He now says of this Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As it stood, and as it stands, it seems to me to be a useless Bill&mdash; really useless.  If it is going to be operated in one way, it will be harmful. If it is not going to be operated in that way, it is practically unnecessary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to that is that there can be no possible harm in the public discussion of Orders made with the object of amending the statutory law of this country, enacted both in the Dáil and here.  Speaking on a former <Col N="1266" /> occasion of Second Chambers, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is for those who say that hobble skirts, which restrict natural movement, should be worn, to show why they should be worn; in other words, to show why these restrictions, and this unnecessary complication in the legislative machinery should be there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, of this Bill he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It does tend to make the working inefficient if you put on shackles which hinder the necessary action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there is no shackle whatever being put on necessary action by this Bill.  All that this Bill does&mdash;and I must reiterate it&mdash;is to permit discussion on statutory Orders, <i>ex hypothess</i>, on a matter of considerable importance. For my third and last parallel, I would point out that the Taoiseach, speaking about the Seanad, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We hear talk of a dictatorship&mdash; one-man rule and so on&mdash;as if everybody in this Assembly of 153 individuals had not a voice, and as if everybody here was inanimate and took no part in upholding the views he believed in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of this Bill, he now says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dáil can hold the Government to account, and, if they do something which the majority of the directly elected representatives of the people believe is wrong, they can be dismissed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, undoubtedly, true but, in the existing circumstances of the last ten years, can you honestly say that it is true in practice?  Can you honestly say that, at any time between two general elections, there is a sufficiently strong, independent back bench and back-boned group in the Dáil capable of saying freely what they think and turning the Government out and standing again at an election as Independent Fianna Fáil candidates? You know that that does not happen, but it does happen in thoroughly democratic countries.</P>
    <P>The Head of the Government said further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I got all the Departments to give me a report on the position, as they saw it, and all the reports were <Col N="1267" /> unanimous in the view that it was impracticable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, he said that on the First Stage of this Bill, before, presumably, he saw the Bill.  Before I could accept the view of the Civil Service that this Bill is impracticable I would have to know the terms of reference to the Departments.  The terms of reference could not have had this Bill in mind because it had not been printed and circulated.  Therefore, I say, that when he tells us that the Civil Service unanimously agreed that it was impracticable, it has no application to this Bill and it need not detain us for a moment.  Lastly, he asserted that this sort of change would make it impossible for the Government to act quickly, when it was necessary, in view of the war, for the Government to act quickly.  That is incorrect.</P>
    <P>When a statutory rule <i>in esse</i> is made, it is law from the time it is signed and promulgated.  Nothing can prevent it from continuing to be law except the subsequent purely theoretical annulment, either here or in the Dáil, suggested by this Bill. Therefore, the rapidity or otherwise of Government action is completely unaffected by it.</P>
    <P>I said in the beginning that I was not out to make a case for this Bill where a case did not exist.  I freely grant that there are two other ways by which the objects envisaged by the mover of this Bill could be achieved. One, would be a special motion condemning a particular Order it was desired to condemn and the other, the still more drastic motion of censure of the Government.  Those would do but they are not the right and decorous way of doing what it is desired to do.  To my mind, this is the best way.  The Labour Party is not here in any strength, but I was glad to notice that members of the Party, on the First Stage, spoke strongly about preserving essential democratic liberties and doing things in a Parliamentary way.</P>
    <P>I would ask one question of the Government, but there is no one here to answer it.  If this Bill is withdrawn or rejected, how long is it proposed <Col N="1268" /> to continue the Act of 1939? Is there a firm intention to give back to Parliament the liberties it surrendered in the war period as soon as the war ends, because one's experience is that the tendency is for restrictions to continue?  That would be detrimental to the interests of the country if it happened.</P>
    <P>I have a proposal to make, although it is not mine.  It originated years ago with one of the best parliamentarians we ever had in the Dáil or here, Senator Thomas Johnson. Senator Johnson always wished to have a joint committee of both Houses, or an all-Party committee of one House, whose duty it would be to scrutinise the Orders which form the whole <i>corpus</i> of delegated legislation and, acting as an all-Party group, take appropriate action in bringing them before the notice of the House for discussion.  I say that if we cannot get a joint committee, an all-Party committee, possibly the Fine Gael Party, with Labour and Independents, if Fianna Fáil does not feel able to join, should form a small voluntary group to scrutinise these Orders, and where necessary bring them before the notice of the House in due time for discussion and public enlightenment.</P>

      <P>I want to disassociate myself completely from one statement made by the last speaker.  He complained rather bitterly, so bitterly in fact that Senator Hawkins was moved to interject that the Minister for Local Government had not on the occasion of the real cow-and-calf debate sent his representative here to represent him in this House.  I only just want to say that, judging by the proceedings to-day, I think the Minister is not to be reprimanded for that neglect but highly commended.  However, to get on to the present Bill, we heard a great deal of comment about a Bill that is not before the House.  We have heard very little comment from the opposite benches on the Bill before the House.  Senator Quirke led off the opposition to the Bill and, as far as I could make out, the sum total of his objection was that there were seven fools in the House.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Senator wished us to take him seriously but if he did I would remind him of the old saying that &ldquo;it takes one fool to know another.&rdquo; Senator O'Donnell followed Senator Quirke and I had the greatest difficulty when I was listening to him in understanding what his line of argument was.  I must say, speaking now after having read his argument as well as having listened to it, I find myself in still more haze.  I am not quite clear why he is opposing the Bill except it is that the Senator who introduced it was prepared to accept the point of view of the principal Senator who opposed it that there should be a provision about privacy.  All that is merely by the way.  What I really wanted to say&mdash;and I speak so that my protest may go on the records of the House&mdash;is that we seem to approach every proposition that comes before us these days in the light that the Government can do no wrong.  Any person, any Government, any body of officials, any person in any walk of life, can always make mistakes and it is up to us here to ensure that there will be such a scheme of machinery that when a mistake is made, that mistake can be remedied with the least possible harm to anybody.</P>
      <P>I am talking of pure bona fide slips, bona fide mistakes that might happen at any time.  If an Order of the type discussed here, an Order amending the statute law, is made on a mistaken view, at the present time it can only be upset by what amounts to a vote of censure on the Government.  If this Bill is passed, that mistake can be rectified in a far more dignified way, without challenging the general support of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself sometimes rather wondering whether the type of speech that I have heard from the other side in the past few months is not really meant to cover up the fact that there is no argument behind it.  I wonder do all those people who say on all and every possible occasion that you must not disturb the Government really mean it or are they using it to cover <Col N="1270" /> up the fact that they have got no argument because loud speaking&mdash;and I am one of the worst offenders in that respect myself&mdash;and positive assertion do not make up for lack of argument? I am afraid that in some of our recent debates we have tried to pretend that it does.  There can be no argument against one principle and that is that, the more democratic powers are kept in the Oireachtas, the better it will be for the future of this country. There is no argument either against the principle that, in time of emergency, these democratic powers must sufficiently&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;sufficiently&rdquo;&mdash;be handed over to the Executive to ensure that it is able to act in a time of crisis.  If there was anything in the Bill which, for a moment, prevented the Executive from acting in a time of crisis I would not be speaking in its favour, and I venture to suggest that the Bill would not have been introduced, but there is not. It purely suggests a method of trying to right a mistake, if ever a mistaken Order should be made.</P>
    <P>I just want to make one final comment. An Taoiseach, when he was speaking, referred to the Slaughter of Animals Order and he said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As to the case that was brought up, by some extraordinary accident that one was not presented.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that was not the case made by the Minister on that occasion. The case made by him was that he need not present it.  I would suggest that if the general policy is as stated by An Taoiseach&mdash;and I feel sure it is &mdash;it would have been wiser for the Minister to have adopted a different line of defence on that occasion.</P>

      <P>The Senator who has just resumed his seat made an accusation which demands a reply and I rise to make that reply.  Senator Sweetman alleges that Senators who have spoken against this Bill are actuated by a desire to place the Government above, beyond and supreme to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is an unfair, an unreal and an untrue statement.  I am quite sure that each Senator who has spoken in opposition to the Bill is conscious of the meaning of Article 15 of the Constitution where <Col N="1271" /> in it is laid down that the sole authority to make laws for the people of this country is vested in both Houses of the Oireachtas and that no other legislative authority in this land has a right to make laws for the people of this country.</P>

      <P>The authority therefore to make laws is vested in both Houses of the Oireachtas and not in the Government.  There is no intention on the part of those who have spoken against this Bill to place the Government above and beyond either House of the Oireachtas.  This Bill, I believe, is an honest attempt to give effect to Article 15 of the Constitution, notwithstanding the passage into law of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.  In that Act both Houses of the Oireachtas clothed the Government with authority to legislate by Order and whatever causes operated to make the Oireachtas do that are with us to-day in a more aggravated form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because we realise that these causes are with us and that the liberty and authority with which we clothed the Government, are more necessary now than then, that we are opposed to doing anything that would hamper the speed of the Government in taking action to deal with an emergency.  It is quite a simple thing to say that this Bill only requires the tabling of Orders as published. Senator O'Sullivan said that there can be no disclosure of confidences because they are published Orders.  On the face of it that appears to be correct but when you come to examine it what do you find? The Minister may make an Order on evidence of a confidential character. If he is challenged here in the House he is not in a position to disclose that information, but it would be necessary to do so in order to justify himself <Col N="1272" /> before the House.  A certain section of the House would immediately blame him because he made the Order and was not in a position to disclose the information.  Whilst I do say these things in opposition to the Bill I am in agreement with those who say that legislation by Order is reaching dangerous proportions.</P>
    <P>But it has not arisen since the emergency. It is a much older growth. Examining the records in our House here a short time ago I found that in the year preceding the outbreak of the war, 1939, we passed through both Houses 38 public Statutes.  In 27 of these we had enabling provisions, regulations or Orders.  In addition we have passed eight amending Acts and in the eight amending Acts we had enabling provisions, regulations and Orders.  So in normal times approximately 40 per cent. of our legislation had within it enabling provisions, regulations and Orders.  That, of course, is a position that, I am prepared to concede, demands close watching in the post-war period when the emergency has gone by.  I say it should receive the closest attention at the hands of both Houses of the Oireachtas because it tends to create a despotism and at least it places a weapon in the hands of those who would assert that our democracy or democratic form of government has become a bureaucracy.  I think we can agree upon that.  Senator Hayes when this Bill was before the House indicated what I thought was a very reasonable answer to the signatories of this measure, when he said that there was nothing that can be done within this Bill that cannot be at present accomplished through the form of a motion brought before the House.  This Bill requires the signatures of seven persons.  A motion requires the signature of one.  I say to the signatories that the motion will secure the same information.  It is open to any Senator if he considers an Order requires examination to table a motion and have it examined.  In view of that, I suggest in all sincerity to the Senators whose names are attached to the Bill that having obtained this expression of opinion from the House, and with the knowledge <Col N="1273" /> that the same goal can be reached through a motion, they should withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I find replying on this Bill a very difficult task.  I have no difficulty in replying to the occasional arguments against it which were addressed to the substance of the Bill.  I do find myself in an almost insuperable difficulty in replying to at least four-fifths of the speeches against the Bill, because these four-fifths were speeches against a purely imaginary Bill with imaginary clauses which were not before the House and were not in the brain of anybody except those people who, failing to find arguments against the actual Bill, set out to imagine a Bill which they could oppose.  We have had a long litany of the evils of things which the Bill does not do does not purport to do, and could not possibly do.  Sometimes the objectors credited the Bill with powers which I would regard as almost miraculous. Senator Quirke referred to the Bill as a bridle with which to hamstring the Government.  I do not know anything much about horses, and I understand that Senator Quirke knows a great deal, but it must be a very remarkable bridle which is capable of hamstringing a horse.  Even An Taoiseach used the highly coloured word &ldquo;shackle&rdquo;; and those who did not seek refuge in metaphor whether for expressing, or concealing their thoughts used phrases such as &ldquo;take power away from the Government,&rdquo; and &ldquo;interfere with the necessary freedom of the Government.&rdquo;  Now what am I to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been circulated and everybody has at least had an opportunity of reading it, although I am not suggesting that everybody has read it.  I endeavoured to explain it on the First Reading, and I endeavoured again on the Second Reading to explain it, but apparently neither the Bill itself nor my explanation of what it can do has been sufficient.  I am afraid I have to resort to the only expedient left to me in a nightmare situation, and like the bellman in &ldquo;The Hunting of the Snark,&rdquo; I suggest <Col N="1274" /> that &ldquo;if I say it three times it is true.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to say this for the third time &mdash;that this Bill will not prevent the making of any single Order which the Government or a Minister can make at the present moment, that it will not delay the making of a single Order which the Government or a Minister can make at the present moment, and that it will not invalidate anything that has been done under any Order which the Government or a Minister can make at the present moment. The sum total of the effect of this Bill is that if a Minister acting under a delegated power, makes an Order carelessly or hastily or under a wrong impression there would be provided a constitutional method&mdash;I emphasise that phrase&mdash;whereby the Order could be subjected to helpful criticism by either House.</P>
    <P>Senators have attempted to make much the same argument as that to which I have already referred by a liberal use of words such as &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; and &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo;.  Those words with their temporary hypnotic influence have done nothing more than lull the intellect of the House asleep.  Everybody knows, and everybody in this House, I imagine, accepts, that an Executive must often act on its own responsibility.  I go further than that and say that an Executive must often act illegally. There are occasions when those who are governing must act on their own judgment and responsibility and say: &ldquo;We must do such and such a thing even though, for the time being, it is admittedly illegal.&rdquo;  That has always been so under every system of government of which I know. Whether you have regard to the old Roman method of appointing dictators or the other method by which the laws of the land are sometimes temporarily suspended, that is a necessary provision whatever kind of Government you have.</P>
    <P>The way in which that difficulty was met in the past was this: If an Executive Government thought a thing had to be done, they did it and then came to both Houses of their Legislature and said: &ldquo;We have done a thing <Col N="1275" /> which was illegal; we did it because it was necessary; we take responsibility for it and are prepared to show you that it was wise; now, we ask you to pass a Bill of Indemnity.&rdquo;  So far as I know, in such circumstances, an Act of Indemnity was always passed. When the present emergency arose, the Government introduced an Emergency Powers Bill which substituted for that an infinitely better provision. They provided, as it were beforehand, an indemnity for anything they did under an Order which they thought it necessary to make so as to deal with the circumstances with which they were confronted.  They took these powers to make Orders at once.</P>
    <P>They took these powers of suspending the law so as to avoid actually breaking the law.  I have nothing but admiration for the clause which you will find in the Emergency Powers Act which provided that the Government might, by Order, do these things, and that any act which was done under such Orders should not be impeachable. But the Government themselves saw the difficulty and, in regard to Orders made with the full responsibility of the Government, considered, presumably, by every member of the Government and signed on behalf of the Government, it was provided that they were to be liable to be brought before either House and annulled if either House disapproved of them. That is not my provision.  The provision you will find in the Bill before you does not emanate from my brain. It is the provision which the Government themselves applied to every Emergency Powers Order they made, and all the arguments put forward to-day as to the undesirability of discussion of the reasons for such Orders, as to the possibility of delay and such matters would apply with double force to the original Emergency Powers Act made by the Government which they themselves wittingly and, I think, rightly subjected to scrutiny by both Houses and to possible annulment.</P>
    <P>Why, then, is it necessary to have this Bill?  Certain Senators said that I was attempting to question the wisdom of those who passed the Emergency <Col N="1276" /> Powers Act.  I am doing nothing of the sort.  I am seeking to give effect to it, because anybody who reads that Act will see that the sub-section giving power to delegate matters to Ministers, who do not have to table their Orders, was perfectly clearly meant for purely executive and administrative matters.  It was meant for the kind of things referred to by Senator Quirke&mdash;petrol licences, fuel licences. Orders dealing with wages in respect of one firm and so on.</P>
    <P>All matters like that were to be delegated to Ministers and, because they were purely minor administrative and executive matters, no provision was made for tabling them.  That provision has, in fact, been used in a way which was never contemplated by the people who passed the Emergency Powers Act.  If Senators turn to the debate on that measure, they will find that what I say is correct.  It is being used because it is convenient to delegate larger powers to Ministers, powers to make Orders suspending or amending the statutes of the land.  I am not seeking in any way to question the wisdom of those who passed the Emergency Powers Act.  I am seeking, by this Bill, to give effect to their intention and to prevent a clause, meant merely to deal with minor matters of business, from being used in a way which was not intended.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is before you seeks to restore the position which was meant to be created by the Emergency Powers Act.  It seeks to avoid what has admittedly, I think, been a perversion of the original intention.  But it did appear, in the course of the First Reading debate, that there were certain people who, either really or ostensibly, had certain apprehensions as to the way in which the Bill before you might be abused.  It is perfectly true that the word &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; which you will find in the Bill before you, is given a very wide meaning by the definition section in the Emergency Powers Act and that, technically, it would include licences and matters of that kind. I need hardly say that those were not in my mind and could not, I think, be in the mind of the hypothetical seven Senators who have to sign the request.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> In case anybody should feel that it might be abused I at once offered to make an amendment whereby any Order which had not been published, any Order which was thought to be of a confidential nature, or any Order which might reveal anything to do with the private matters of a firm, could be protected from the provisions for tabling and discussion on a certificate of a Minister that it either would be against the safety of the State to discuss it or that it would reveal the private affairs of an individual firm.  I do not think these restrictions are necessary.  I hardly think that the objections which rendered it desirable to offer to make these provisions were anything more than frivolous or in some cases, slightly factious.  I offered to make them and I must say I was somewhat surprised when I had done so to find Senator O'Donnell rebuking me for having offered to do so.  I freely offered them because they did not in the least bit interfere with the object of the Bill as I intended it.  I offered on the First Reading, and I offer again now to accept an amendment whereby the operation of this Bill will be confined to instruments which purport, on their face, to alter the statute law of the land, because it was in order to have some control over such instruments that the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I understand that, even with that provision, the Bill will not be acceptable, but I do want to make it quite clear if Senators are rejecting this Bill that what they are rejecting is merely an effort to allow this House to discuss the suspension or amendment of legislation which it has itself passed. If the House wishes to abrogate their powers, if it wishes, having spent time and trouble in the various stages of an Act, to allow that Act to be swept out of existence by the Order of a single Minister and not to have even the opportunity of making helpful criticism&mdash;then it is a matter for the House.  I, at least, have put it clearly before them.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell accused me of crying &ldquo;bogey-bogey.&rdquo;  He said that my suggestion that the Minister for Justice might suspend the laws of the <Col N="1278" /> land and subject ordinary citizens to military courts, was fantastic.  Senator Campbell had not read his Acts.  In the 1939 Emergency Powers Act the power to do that was expressly excluded from the scope of the Act.  But one year afterwards, in the 1940 Emergency Powers Act, the Government expressly took power to do it and, quite frankly, I can conceive a time when there might be occasions in this country&mdash;occasions within the next year, perhaps&mdash;when it would be a proper and desirable thing to do.  But if it be a proper and desirable thing to do, this measure would not prevent it being done in any respect, would not render the Minister liable to impeachment for anything done under that Act, and surely it is a remarkable thing to say that this House wishes to preclude itself from the possibility of discussing subsequently this desirability.</P>
    <P>I pass now from the arguments which, as I say, were so unreal that at times I almost felt I was back with Alice in Wonderland, and if I were to cry the magic words: &ldquo;You are nothing but a pack of cards&rdquo; or, perhaps, &ldquo;You are all a pack of votes&rdquo; that the whole thing would dissolve and I would find myself back to the realities of the Bill.  The realities were touched upon by the Taoiseach and, first of all, by that great realist, Senator Hayes.</P>
    <P>There is one argument, an argument which Senator O'Loghlen has repeated, the force of which I have felt very strongly, because it is a real argument. That is the argument that it is unnecessary to pass this Bill, because we can do indirectly what it proposes to give us power to do directly.  Senators will observe that the use of that argument by the Taoiseach completely sweeps away all the other arguments that were used against the Bill, because to use that argument is to admit at the beginning that the power to discuss and control legislation is an absolutely necessary thing, and that the only reason for suggesting that the House should not give a Committee Stage to this Bill is because the absolutely necessary provisions of the Bill can be arrived at in practice by <Col N="1279" /> another way around.  I said in opening the Second Reading that there is, in fact, a hole in our constitutional fabric, that &ldquo;the north wind may undo it with its sleety whistle through it,&rdquo; that it is a gap to be stopped one way or another.  Senator Hayes and the Taoiseach say &ldquo;There is the danger, but you can stop it with a clout&rdquo;.  I say that if that is so why not complete the edifice and stop it with a brick?</P>
    <P>Why should we have the elaborate system of bringing up a special motion which certainly may bear the appearance of a vote of censure if we can provide a proper constitutional method, whereby the matter can be brought before either House by way of helpful criticism and in a way which nobody can suggest is in the form of an attack upon or a censure of the Government?  My objection to the kind of motion suggested by Senator Hayes is this: it is a motion which, on the face of it, can have no effect.  It could have no practical effect in the terms in which it is couched.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it must be something in the nature of an expression of disapproval of the Government.  If you have machinery provided such as this Bill provides, whereby in the ordinary course of things, the members of any House or of any Party who think that an Order may be improved are enabled almost as a matter of routine to bring it before the House and offer their criticism in a channel that is being provided as part of the Constitution, then, at once, such discussion takes its proper place.  It is not given undue importance.  It is not an attack upon the Government.  It is not a special motion, out of the ordinary run of things, a motion which could have no effect.  It is merely putting into effect part of the necessary machinery of Government.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is the answer to the one argument which has pressed very strongly upon me, the argument that this Bill may in some respects be unnecessary because we can do the same thing by a different method.  I ask you to make it a constitutional method. I ask you not to put the members of either House in the position of having to table a special kind of motion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> There have been at least two Orders, in the short time since I have been in the House, that I thought required discussion.  I avoided putting down a special motion &mdash;I waited for the Estimate in the case of one of them&mdash; because I did not wish to give a discussion, in which criticism might be embodied, the appearance of an attack.  If you pass this Bill, you will always enable us to help whatever Government is in power by giving them an opportunity of mending their hands.  At the present moment, you cannot do that, except by way of a special motion.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the arguments.  I believe that this is a good Bill.  I do not believe it requires amendments, although I have offered to make various amendments in order to meet what I think are the rather fanciful suggestions that have been put forward.  I ask you to treat this Bill for what I believe it to be: a perfectly adequate solution of a difficult problem which has been admitted by the Taoiseach.  It enables the Government to act at once.  It enables the Government to make any Orders they like, despite the existing law.  It enables the Government to do all this with complete safety, because they never can be accused in respect of anything done under that Order, of having acted illegally; but it does preserve to this House the power of criticism, of helpful criticism, and, finally, the power of saying, after due consideration, and without in any way interfering with what has been done already, that they think the Order should cease to be valid in its existing form.  I believe that this is a good Bill, and I ask you to vote for it.</P>
