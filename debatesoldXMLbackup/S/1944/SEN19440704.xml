      <P>The Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act of 1924 was passed subject to a limitation on the period of its operation.  At various stages, when the Act expired, it has been renewed since and the most recent renewal was in 1939 when the Act was amended and continued for a further five years.  That period of five years has now ended&mdash;in fact it ended on the 22nd March last&mdash;and it is desired to have the Act continued for another period of five years.  The operations of the Act have been in abeyance for some years past, since the beginning of the emergency in fact, but it is considered desirable, nevertheless, that the power of guaranteeing loans for the purposes stated in the Act should be maintained.  The whole question of the financing of industrial development <Col N="1430" /> in the post-war period will have to be considered separately, but I think it would be undesirable that this Act should be allowed to lapse at this stage, even though it may be unlikely that the facilities afforded by it will be availed of during the emergency. The sole purpose of this Trade Loans (Guarantee) Bill is to continue the operation of the Act over a further period of five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister take this opportunity of explaining to the House exactly why this Act has lapsed during the emergency, and what facilities can be given to industries in this country, through this Bill, that are not given by the ordinary banking institutions of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I should like to know whether the Minister has the figures of the loans guaranteed under this Bill and the amount of guarantees paid up to the moment. I should like to know whether, if manufacturers have availed of the benefits provided by the Act, they have also fulfilled their obligations under the Act, generally speaking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that also applies to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why the Bill has lapsed is because the time provided in the original Act has expired. It expired, as I explained, on the 22nd March last.  I was asked by Senator Crosbie why the Act has been inoperative for some years past.  It has been inoperative for some years because, due to prevailing conditions, people have not made applications for loans under it.  It is not difficult to understand why industrialists, in general, did not avail of the facilities provided by this measure, in preference to facilities that are provided by the ordinary financial institutions of the country&mdash;except on the <Col N="1431" /> assumption that the machinery involved is rather elaborate.  In fact, the people who have applied for guarantees of loans under this measure are those who cannot get these facilities in any other way.  I think it is a fair assumption that if these firms could have got the accommodation in any other way, they would not accept the conditions or the procedure adopted in connection with the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a number of enterprises which, because of their novel character or some other characteristic, cannot get guarantees through the ordinary financial channels without State assistance, and the purpose of this Bill is to give such firms State assistance.  Of course, elaborate machinery is provided to deal with such cases, which makes the business of getting a trade loan guarantee a very slow one.  First of all, the application has to be considered by an advisory committee which was set up under the original Act.  Then, when that advisory committee makes its report, the report has to be considered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, subsequently, by the Minister for Finance.  If, after those various stages have been gone through, it is decided that a guarantee should be given, further formalities have to be complied with.  So elaborate is the procedure, in fact, that most firms prefer to avail of other methods, if they can, of securing accommodation, than those provided for here.  Nevertheless, it is a fact that a number of firms has availed of the facilities provided for here, and the results, on the whole, have not been unsatisfactory.  There were 98 cases in which loans were guaranteed. The number of loans that actually were given was 113&mdash;some of the firms concerned having got more than one loan&mdash;and the total capital involved was £1,160,440.  In 43 of these cases the loans were repaid in full, amounting to £411,271, but there were 24 cases in which it was necessary to appoint receivers&mdash;the companies concerned having ceased to operate&mdash;and in the remaining cases they are carrying <Col N="1432" /> on with the assistance of trade loans and paying the interest when due.  The rate of interest, of course, is a matter to be arranged between the borrower and the lender.  The State's liability is only 2½ per cent., although, of course, the borrower may have to pay more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Have there been any cases in which the State loan has not been repaid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there were 24 such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And these were companies which were not any longer in existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They were cases where the State appointed a receiver to wind up the company and realise its assets with a view to meeting the liability of the company to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to me that the percentage of loss has been rather low.  It has not exceeded 5 per cent., I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Act has been in operation for 20 years, and that failures of companies arose in the earlier years of its operation, which were difficult years, I think would go to show that the percentage of losses was small, and I think that in any event the employment given should be a compensatory feature which is not out of proportion to the amount of money involved.</P>

      <P>Senators no doubt are already familiar with the main features of the 1944 Budget which I introduced in Dáil Éireann on the 3rd May last.  I do not propose, therefore, to trouble them with the complicated details of national revenue and expenditure which I then placed before the other House and which are contained in the various White Papers then presented. In conformity with the Budget the Finance Bill, 1944, contains no new taxes.  It provides, however, for a number of adjustments in regard to income-tax and corporation profits tax and for one or two minor matters which I shall explain in the course of its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>When I addressed the Seanad on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, 1943, I pointed that the revenue estimates for 1943-44 were framed on the assumption that no major disturbance would arise affecting our economy and I am glad to say that this assumption was justified.  Although we have had to contend with many difficulties arising in particular from the curtailment of vital supplies, we have been able through imports from abroad and intensified development of native resources to continue to provide industry and agriculture with a fair measure of essential materials and equipment.  As a result economic activity in 1943-44 continued to be fairly satisfactory and I am glad to be able to report a continuance during the year of that welcome buoyancy in the revenues to which I referred here last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yield of revenue at £43,780,000 was, indeed, remarkably heavy, being <Col N="1435" /> £2,198,000 in excess of the estimate and £4,052,000 in excess of the previous year, despite the fact that the 1943 Budget effected only minor alterations in taxation.  Receipts from property and income-tax, including surtax, increased by nearly £1,500,000, and from corporation profits tax by over £1,000,000.  The return for customs and excise was also beyond expectations. Tobacco, which contributed about four-fifths of the total customs revenue, yielded £9,081,000, being an increase of £1,112,000 on the previous year, whilst on the excise side, beer and spirits yielded £6,299,000, an increase of £1,112,000, on the previous year, whilst on the excise side, beer and spirits £1,000,000.  As expenditure at £45,009,000 was £1,160,000 less than anticipated, the close of the financial year revealed an actual deficit of £529,000 as compared with an estimated deficit of £3,555,000.</P>
    <P>As regards the current year, our estimate of tax revenue on the basis of existing taxation is £39,050,000, an increase of £1,882,000 over the actual receipts for 1943-44.  Customs revenue at £11,605,000 is expected to show an increase of £217,000, excise revenue at £8,780,000, an increase of over £750,000 and inland revenue at £18,215,000 (£11,510,000 from income-tax) an improvement of £982,000 on the previous year.  As non-tax revenue is estimated at £6,585,000, the total receipts of tax and non-tax revenue are estimated at £45,635,000.  The position, therefore, is that, emboldened by the unexpectedly heavy yields in 1943-44, we are budgeting for £4,053,000 in excess of last year's estimate.</P>
    <P>I must, however, emphasise once again that this somewhat optimistic estimate is dependent on a variety of circumstances over few of which we can exercise effective control.  It has been framed in anticipation of the economic fabric of the country remaining undisturbed. There can, of course, be no certainty as to this.  In these days of diminishing supplies, the estimated increases in yields from customs and excise, for example, cannot be regarded as anything but conjectural. Indeed, difficulties have already been experienced in obtaining sufficient supplies of tobacco leaf, while the curtailment <Col N="1436" /> of racing fixtures and entertainments owing to transport and lighting restrictions may seriously affect the yield of revenue under these heads. Further, in estimating for an increased yield from income-tax, we have assumed that there will be an increase in commercial profits generally but this assumption may be seriously upset if the present acute trading difficulties become accentuated or prolonged.</P>
    <P>As regards expenditure, the original estimated cost of the Supply Services was £44,983,000.  As I pointed out on Budget day in the Dáil, to this must be added provision for Supplementary Estimates of £180,000 for the Department of Supplies in respect of wheat subsidy; £34,000 for the Department of Local Government in respect of the provision of cheap footwear, and £33,000 for the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of mineral development, making a total of £45,230,000.  Since then, however, four Supplementary Estimates for sums totalling £347,810 have been presented to the Dáil to cover additional estimated expenditure of £342,000 by the Department of Supplies in respect of fuel subsidy (£200,000) and the building of additional turf camps (£142,000), £3,000 for reformatory and industrial schools, £2,800 for the Department of External Affairs, and a token Vote for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.  Further, the Government has recently authorised millers to dispose of mill offals, resulting from the production of the lower extraction flour, at a price below the £15 per ton previously fixed in May of this year.  In January last it was estimated that approximately £2,000,000 would be required to subsidise flour during 1944/45.  The estimated annual loss to the industry arising from the sale of offals at reduced prices is £510,000, which could be met either by an increase in the price of flour of approximately 5/- per sack, which would mean an increase of 1d. in the price of the 4lb. loaf, or by an increase in the flour subsidy.  The Government, having regard to the reactions which a rise in the price of flour would have on the cost-of-living index figures, has decided on the latter course, and I <Col N="1437" /> have agreed to the introduction by the Department of Supplies at a later date of a Supplementary Estimate in respect of flour subsidy.  Accordingly, to the estimated total figure of £45,230,000 for Supply Services, referred to above, must now be added sums of £347,810 and £510,000 to make a revised total estimate of approximately £46,087,800.</P>
    <P>Following precedent, certain specific outlays of a capital nature amounting to £1,069,000 have been earmarked to be defrayed from borrowing, thereby reducing the total amount in respect of Supply Services to be met out of revenue to £45,018,800, to which is to be added £4,994,000 for Central Fund Services, making a total of £50,012,800. The total estimated revenue at £45,635,000 is £4,377,800 less than this estimated expenditure figure.  I do not consider it feasible, however, to bridge this gap by additional taxation.  Existing imposts are heavy and, as our economic difficulties become more acute, it will take the combined efforts of all sections of the community to avoid economic dislocation on a large scale.  I have no doubt that Senators will agree with me that increased taxation is not the type of lubricant desired for such a situation.  I propose, therefore, to meet the uncovered deficit by borrowing.</P>
    <P>The amount of our estimated expenditure is unprecedented, but I would say that nearly one-third of it refers to services which we would not have to finance in normal times.  With the passing of the emergency, we can look forward to radical reductions in charges such as those arising from the special provisions to meet the increase in the cost of living, estimated at nearly £8,000,000 for the current year, and from the expansion in the Army, the cost of which is now over £8,600,000.  On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that our plans for the post-war period must involve the Exchequer in increased expenditure. Plans for housing, the provision of school accommodation, afforestation, arterial drainage and tourist development, are under consideration.  It is estimated that the electrification of the rural areas will involve considerable expenditure.  The proposed reorganisation <Col N="1438" /> of transport, with the details of which Senators no doubt are already familiar, will involve the Exchequer in contingent liabilities of substantial amounts.  Plans have also been made for building and reconstruction projects of many kinds, especially in relation to hospitals and public health services.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our limited resources, execution of the foregoing programme must, of course, be based on certain assumptions, namely, that the cost of the Defence Services will be greatly reduced after the war and that emergency services of the kind to which I have already referred will practically disappear.  The twin burdens of emergency services and post-war development would be unsupportable. Whether our plans for the future come to fruition depends also to a great extent on the success of our efforts now in maintaining intact the credit of the country and stimulating employment in agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>In the monetary sphere, it is inevitable having regard to our position, that the pressure of inflationary forces should become steadily more acute as the emergency is prolonged.  The Government has tried to control by every means at its disposal the upward movement of prices, which is the active factor in inflation, and, by maintaining checks on profits and remuneration and by the encouragement of savings, to restrict purchasing power.  I regret to say, however, that despite our efforts, we have not been wholly successful in restricting these inflationary forces.  Indeed, the rise in prices of commodities produced here has now reached such dimensions that any further continuance must be strenuously opposed.  We must endeavour to preserve our price and wage structure from becoming so deranged as to endanger our eventual resumption of international trade on a favourable basis.  In its further efforts to check unhealthy expansion the Government must have the full co-operation of all citizens.</P>
    <P>The financial position which I have just outlined contains many sources of danger.  We are increasing expenditure <Col N="1439" /> without any serious increase in taxation, and our estimates of revenue are, in present circumstances, based on somewhat optimistic grounds.  In recent years, however, we have been blessed with revenue yields far in excess of anticipation which have helped to reduce borrowings much below anticipated levels.  Even if our hopes in this respect do not materialise in the current year, I think that our financial structure should be capable of bearing the strain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This occasion is the swan song of the present Seanad and possibly for some of us our own personal swan song, and one wonders whether it is worth while at this stage playing any notes at all.  However, some things the Minister has said struck a responsive note in me.  He said that we must keep our price and wage structure right during this war so as to be able to resume trade after the war.  It would be no harm if we remembered that this is what the Minister himself called a £50,000,000 Budget.  It is a £50,000,000 Budget for a very small State and it is coming to be regarded as a normal thing.  It is coupled, as the Minister pointed out, with a very buoyant revenue, a revenue which is buoyant perhaps for causes which may be transient.  It is coupled also with a very substantial increase in note and money circulation of our own&mdash;we have no figures, I think, for the increased circulation of English notes and money which most traders will tell you is also very substantial&mdash;and, as the Minister pointed out in the concluding part of his speech, with an enormous rise in the cost of living, even in the case of home-produced food and goods.  One of the things which it is impossible for the ordinary consumer to understand is the amazing difference between the price one pays for, say, a single carrot in Dublin and the price which the primary producer gets for growing it. There is something substantially wrong in a position which makes the cost of our home-produced food so enormous as it is, not only in Dublin but also in comparatively small country towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as these things I have mentioned, <Col N="1440" /> we have, so far as our future is concerned, a very low marriage rate and a late marriage rate; that is to say, our people marry at the latest age of any European people, according to the latest figures available.  In addition, as the Minister for Education indicated recently and as we ourselves know, the Department of Education has had to make special arrangements for rural schools where the average is declining and teachers are being dismissed because of falling averages. We have had to close down our training colleges for teachers because we do not require any more, as there are no more children available, and while we are closing down small rural schools in the healthiest possible surroundings, we are apparently proud to be building in Dublin enormous schools&mdash;a very doubtful experiment, which is perhaps not quite relevant to this debate.</P>
    <P>We have as well as a continuing emigration, an emigration at the moment of turf workers and agricultural workers, who, so far as I can gather from cases which have come under my observation, are being sent out of the country.  In spite of having continuing emigration and a large Army, we also have substantial continuing unemployment. Coupled with all that, we have a £50,000,000 Budget and for the future we have apparently not a plan for using every possible scientific and other method to increase our agricultural production, but grandiose schemes for magnificent roads where traffic grows less and for tourist development, for the development of resorts for foreigners and city people, while the natives themselves are every day becoming fewer. It seems to me that we must, as the Minister said, face up with some good will to our own problems and face up to them in a more realistic way than is indicated by these recent statements of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with only one matter to-day.  There has been an enormous increase in prices, an enormous increase in the cost of living. For certain people, there have been increases in their income.  There have been higher profits for certain types of manufacturers and certain classes of merchants.  This particular Finance <Col N="1441" /> Bill takes very elaborate and very drastic measures to catch excess profits that are being made by some people, and which, with all their ingenuity, the Revenue Commissioners have apparently so far failed to attract unto themselves.  In that situation, we have provisions in this Bill designed to catch new profits that are being made, and we do not need to be very observant to know that there are some people making very great profits.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of inflation.  Some part of that, perhaps, is outside the Government's power, but what steps have been taken to stop it?  The only step we had here was a very ill-thought out provision that clamped down wages, and made some attempt to clamp down profits and directors' fees. That ill-thought out measure was altered after debate in this House.  The Government had to take account of the fact that, when prices are going up, wages cannot be clamped down, and they had to make further arrangements which give certain bonuses to workers. But it is interesting that the Government, with an increased revenue itself, with which the Minister is naturally pleased, has been peculiarly harsh in its treatment of its own servants.  With regard to civil servants, they have clamped down their bonus at an arbitrary figure.  Having done that, they had to retreat to some extent and give emergency bonuses to civil servants who had a gross salary of less than £500 a year.  The civil servant with over £500 a year finds himself in the position that his cost of living bonus is arbitrarily fixed at a figure much lower than the actual figure, and that as well as that he can get no increase at all for the emergency.  One wonders how the figure of £500 was arrived at, what the equity of it is, and what the result has been for those people.  The civil servant, of course, tends to be unpopular because of the general view that he is very well off, but this particular measure of the Minister affects people who have no redress at all; it sets a headline to other large institutions such as banks, and enables the Minister to refuse any request for increases from teachers, primary and secondary.  One wonders why one particular class in the community is <Col N="1442" /> selected to do all the fighting against inflation.  I agree that we should all fight against inflation, but why should one particular class of the community be called upon to bear the brunt of the battle?</P>
    <P>In this country the number of people who are not self-supporting is increasing steadily.  I do not want to go into it now, but I could give instances where people have put it to me that they would be foolish to go on supporting themselves because if they were not self-supporting they would be better off.  This fight against inflation which is being waged by the Minister by the process of preventing certain types of civil servants from getting any increase at all is very hard, and is hardest upon people who have always been proud to be self-supporting.  That particular class of the community pay full rent for their houses&mdash;they do not live in subsidised houses; they come in for increased rates; those of them who own their houses, and there is a fair number of them in that position, have come in for a special increase in the income-tax on the valuation through a provision also made by the Minister for Finance. Those people have no sickness benefits; they have no dental benefits and no optical benefits.  They pay for their children's education, at least in part, and those of them who have the misfortune to have daughters instead of sons and cannot send them to Christian Brothers' schools have to pay substantial fees for education.  In their circumstances, it seems to me to be quite inequitable that they should be called upon to live on their pre-war incomes in a situation which differs radically from pre-war circumstances, where the price of everything has soared&mdash;the price of every kind of food, even subsidised food, the price of clothes, the price of boots, and&mdash;not by any means the smallest item&mdash;the price of books, particularly school books.  Their standard of living has been reduced, and their possessions&mdash; not very luxurious ones&mdash;are going in many cases, while they can see around them a number of people who, under the Government's policy, have got rich comparatively rapidly.  That state of affairs is not one which leads to calm, or which is good for the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> It may very well be argued that there should be an all-round level of income, the same standard for everybody. That has been tried in other places, notably in Russia, and, by the process of trial and error, found to be a failure.  I never heard anybody advocating it here.  What we have been witnessing is a determined attempt on the part of the Minister to keep wages down, an attempt which failed, or, at any rate, partially failed. It has been successful with only one class, the class of people who have to do their work, who have to endeavour to live, who have to endeavour to keep a certain front, so to speak, to the world, and have no redress at all from the point of view of their incomes.  We have an enormous number of civil servants on small incomes, and a certain number of others on incomes of over £500 a year, in posts which are becoming less and less attractive for the best people.  It may very well be that we will all have to accept lower standards. If we have to, all we can say is: &ldquo;Welcome be the will of God.&rdquo;  We may have to adopt certain drastic methods to save the whole country, but in the process of saving the whole country there should be some kind of equitable arrangement as between different classes of the community; the burdens should be properly distributed. What I say here can be extended to teachers, notably to secondary teachers, with whom I am better acquainted than any others.  They have always been badly paid, and are now peculiarly badly-off, because they have no scheme of any kind by which they can increase their incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to face up to this situation.  I am not speaking politically, but some attempt will have to be made to adjust certain types of incomes to the change in the cost of living.  That applies to all kinds of teachers, primary, secondary and university. I do not know of anybody in a more lamentable position than the man of 26 years of age who, having done a distinguished course, gets a job at £300 a year and has the temerity to get married.  If he has the further extravagant rashness to become a <Col N="1444" /> father, the situation is lamentable in the extreme.  If he could get a corporation house he might be better off, but the circumstances are such that he cannot do so.  We have to recognise certain distinctions and differences. Another section who are very badly off are soldiers' widows, and soldiers with disablement and other pensions.  The Minister will have to take account of those problems, and will have to get assistance to solve them if anybody can give him assistance, but most emphatically they will have to be solved.  There has been entire failure to control the cost of living, and it is pressing very heavily upon those people.  I am not saying for a moment that it is not pressing upon others, but others have got some relief and have machinery&mdash; which may be successful&mdash;for pressing their claims.</P>
    <P>Let me take another example; the amounts payable in workmen's compensation are lamentably small in present circumstances.  A figure which was not too bad at all before the present war is now very bad indeed when the father of a family is disabled by an accident which takes place during the course of his work.  With a buoyant revenue, with an enormous Budget, and with a rising expenditure on an enormous scale, and a high cost of living, we will have to face up to what we can do about these people.  It is not sufficient merely to say that you cannot do anything because of the danger of inflation.  The danger of inflation is there, but, if some sacrifices have to be made to meet that danger, then some attempt will have to be made to put the sacrifices equitably upon the shoulders of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there are some matters in this Bill that I would like to deal with in Committee, not that I am either a financier or an industrialist, but I am interested in certain principles of government.  Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill appear to me to contain very interesting provisions.  The Revenue Commissioners are, apparently, endeavouring to catch certain people, and in order to catch certain people, they do not state any principle in the Bill.  They merely give themselves <Col N="1445" /> enormous powers and then give the Revenue Commissioners a discretion so that they need not exercise the powers.  That is an old familiar method.  I am not for a moment accusing the Revenue Commissioners of misfeasance of any kind.  They are people who do their jobs fearlessly. They have a very difficult job and they do it fearlessly, but they are being given in Section 14 of the Bill an extraordinary set of powers.  However, we can deal with that matter on the Committee Stage.  On the Civil Service point, which is hurting a great many people outside the Civil Service because the Civil Service analogy has been quoted against many employers, I wonder why the Minister fixed £500 gross: why he did not go higher or lower, for that matter.  I think there can be no defence in equity or justice for keeping the figure as low as that, and I think that if the Minister were to give the matter his attention he would be able to improve that situation.</P>

      <P>I want to say that while I appreciate and recognise the Senator's advocacy of civil servants&mdash;he told the Minister that he had succeeded in keeping down wages in their case only&mdash;at the same time, I think that he was very far from the truth in saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that the Minister had succeeded in keeping down wages to some extent, but that he had been compelled, owing to my advocacy here and that of other people, to yield on the question of certain types of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Senator to say that his efforts had been very successful in the case of civil servants only.  I want to point out to the Minister and to the House that there is a very large number of people suffering very great hardships&mdash;public employees generally, for example&mdash;owing to the fact that they come under the regulations referred to.  The number of such <Col N="1446" /> people is very great, and includes a very large number of heads of families. They have been harshly dealt with under the regulations governing wages. Take the case of asylum attendants, their wages have been clamped down.  No doubt, owing to the activities of their trade unions, the hardships which they would otherwise suffer have been mitigated to some extent by the payment of bonuses.  The trade unions have taken full advantage of these bonuses.  While I say that, I do not think there is any trade union or trade unionist to-day who would admit that the bonuses which are being paid to workers are, in any way, commensurate with the enormous increase there has been in the cost of living. Those workers are suffering very great hardships.</P>
      <P>I believe that the working classes in this country are becoming somewhat too quiescent.  There is very little turmoil or trouble.  Whether it is that their patriotism makes them recognise that there is a war on and that they have to suffer their share of the hardships of the time I do not know, but certainly since the beginning of the emergency the working classes have been very patient and tolerant of the conditions under which they have been living.  Now, you can force that a bit too far.  I suggest that more attention ought to be given to this question of the cost of living.  Published statements show that there is considerable black market activity in the country to-day.  We all know that people with money can procure commodities which are in short supply.  They are able to get them in much the same way as they were before the war.  I have heard of people paying as much as 1/11 an ounce for tea.  That may seem extraordinary. We all know, however, that people who are fond of a cup of tea, particularly old people, will, if they can raise the money at all, pay almost any price for tea.  That is a matter which I suggest to the Minister should engage his serious attention. Steps should be taken to prevent a continuance of that kind of thing.  What applies in the case of tea applies, to a somewhat lesser extent, to many other commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature of our economic position <Col N="1447" /> to-day is that old age pensioners, and people receiving pensions from industrial employment, are not allowed to receive the full amount of their pensions.  This is a matter that is crying out for a remedy.  It is an urgent and a serious matter because of the fact that so many people are enduring hardships as a result of the attitude adopted by the Government on this point.  Their attitude tends to discourage thrift amongst working-class people.  Those who would be inclined to put something by for their old age will be discouraged to do so by a policy of this kind.  What is the good of utilising the screen in the cinemas to encourage saving and thrift amongst people when they know that if they save a little money advantage will be taken of that afterwards to reduce the amount of the pensions to which they are duly entitled?  I suggest that the Minister should take the earliest opportunity, if not to remove the means test altogether, at least to relax it to some extent in so far as it applies to these pensioners.  Its operation at the present time is inflicting a great injustice on a number of deserving people.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the Government have in contemplation great schemes for the post-war period. I suggest to him that more attention ought to be given to National Health Insurance and to other aspects of our national health schemes.  There you have the machinery, the organised society, and trade unions with ample funds all anxious to interest themselves to a far greater extent than they are being permitted to do in the national health of the country.  The economy underlying our schemes of hospitalisation should be seriously reorganised. At present it is entirely antiquated and out-of-date.  We ought to have a nationalised hospital system. It is the kind of scheme that should come into our post-war planning.  As I may not be here at a later date to press a scheme of that sort on the attention of the Minister, I am availing of this opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made great play&mdash;I think he was rather in favour of them, though&mdash;with the powers which are <Col N="1448" /> being given to the Revenue Commissioners to catch those people who are making enormous profits, and bring them within the net of the revenue authorities.  I welcome that more than any other provision in the Bill for this reason: that, if those people know they are going to be caught in this drag net, they may respond more generously to the appeal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to keep their staffs in employment while the emergency lasts. Undoubtedly, there is a tendency amongst industrialists to get rid of what they call superfluous people.  If they have to pay over in supertax the amount they save in that way, I think they will decide to keep on their employees. The Minister's appeal has had a fair response, though there are some people getting away with it and making profits without giving employment. If this drag net is tight enough, it will ensure that many people who would be thrown out of employment will be kept on, as the employers would prefer to do that than to hand the money over to the Government in supertax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes used a rather significant phrase in the course of his speech, when he said that, in the future, we may all be called upon to reduce our standard of living.  We may have to face such a situation, but that will depend on our capacity to organise and develop our resources. In the Minister's statement to-day, we have the outline of Government policy. He has said that the Government is trying, by every means at its disposal, to control the tendency towards inflation. All who think about that difficulty&mdash;which will not pass with the passing of the emergency&mdash;must go a little deeper than the Minister went in his statement here or in the Dáil.  We must study the causes which are creating this inflationary position.  I have adverted to this here on a previous occasion and I am going back to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister to sail off on the plea that he is not a farmer and does not understand very much about agriculture, but that he is awfully kind to the farmers.  There are certain points about our agricultural position to which <Col N="1449" /> the Minister must give more attention. I put it that he was not on sound ground, in the case he made in the other House, though I do not wish to take him through all the figures he gave as to the various ways in which, as Minister for Finance, he is assisting agriculture.  I wish to deal with just one or two points.  I have in my hand a copy of the latest paper by Mr. Michael Murphy, Lecturer in Dairy Accountancy at University College, Cork, read some time in May before the Statistical Society.  Some Senators will remember the very valuable work already done by Mr. Murphy in surveying certain districts with regard to output of farm produce, the way in which farmers are employed and the net cash results of their labour.  Those papers by him are already available. Mr. Murphy has continued the survey and has made a comparison between the 1942-43 position and the 1938-39 position.  One paragraph of the comparison is indicative of the general trend throughout the country; and it is here, in my view, to a greater extent than in any other field, that we must concentrate our efforts, if we are not to have a lowering of our standard of living and if we are to overcome the inflationary tendencies we see developing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy examined 55 farms.  The number was larger on previous occasions but, for various reasons, he came down to 55 on this occasion. Those farms are on the North-Cork-Limerick border, comprising some of the best and most fertile land in the country.  In the comparison, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The gross output declined in volume by 11 per cent. between the two years in question.  This was the compound of a decrease of 19 per cent in the case of live stock and live stock products and an increase of 111 per cent. in the case of crops and turf.  The comparable figures for the country as a whole, calculated from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, December, 1943, were a decrease in the volume of gross output of 8 per cent., a decrease in the volume of the output of live stock and live-stock products of 16 per cent. and an increase in the <Col N="1450" /> volume of crops and turf of 26 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would Senators contemplate those figures, dealing with that splendid land in 1938-39 and 1942-43, showing a gross decline in the volume of products of 11 per cent., while over the country as a whole the same downward trend has been in evidence?  We cannot safely set out on the spending plan which the Minister has enunciated on the basis of a volume of production which declines year after year.</P>
    <P>I have stressed this on a previous occasion and do so again, because here surely is the real touchstone as to the success of Government policy.  The Minister and his colleagues should examine this statement and should realise that, of all the countries from which information is available to-day&mdash; from this back westward&mdash;in no country has there been such a decline in agricultural production in the last four or five years as we have experienced here. There has been a phenomenal increase in England and in North America&mdash; including Canada and the United States.  I do not know so much about South America, but we all know that there are colossal quantities of foodstuffs available there for export.  The decline in our agricultural production is really staggering, when we take into account that with agricultural production to-day is lumped turf production.</P>
    <P>How is it possible to avoid an inflationary position and keep down prices, when on the one hand we have such a decrease in the volume of goods available, and, on the other hand, we have a very considerable increase in the volume of money in circulation? I am not inclined here to join issue with the Minister on the lack of success of Government policy in keeping agricultural production up to the high level at which we would desire to see it, but it is important that this factor be taken into account as a basis on which we must build for the future. If during this war we cannot do better than let our production decline, we may manage to keep out of the war, but what we save from the wreckage will be very little indeed.  During the war, we may learn many lessons that <Col N="1451" /> will be useful, but it is important to remember that the net result of our effort during the war period so far has meant that, in spite of the increased area put under the plough, the total amount of food produced has fallen year after year.  That clearly indicates that Government policy in that respect has not been successful.</P>
    <P>I concede that many factors go to produce the present situation.  There is the declining fertility of our fields. That is evident.  There is also lack of power, lack of machinery and lack of capital equipment of every kind.  These should have been available for farmers. They ought to have been provided in the past.  There are Senators present who will, at least, admit that for years before the war I pleaded with Ministers on behalf of producers, by pointing out that they were not equipped for their work.  They are much less equipped to do so to-day.  Mr. Murphy and other statisticians have pointed that out.  If I may put it this way, I suggest that the Minister has a faulty point of view about what the Government is doing for agriculture.  I think he used the phrase that agriculture was being spoon-fed.  At least, he was reported in the Press to have made that statement. The Minister gave figures indicating that well over £8,000,000 was provided by the Exchequer for the benefit of agriculture.  Agricultural subsidies are, perhaps, provided from the Price Stabilisation Fund.  On the Second Stage of the Finance Bill in the Dáil he gave figures which showed that the amount provided for the assistance of agriculture from the Price Stabilisation Fund amounted to £1,095,000 and grants for the relief of rates to £1,870,000.  In another part of his statement he gave the proportion which goes to farmers by way of subsidies amounting to about £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>What actually is the object of the Price Stabilisation Fund?  Was the Minister not referring mainly to what was done for dairying?  I suggest that anything paid out of the fund is a subsidy to consumers of butter rather than to producers.  The Minister may say that we cannot have it both ways, but when any Minister for Finance tells <Col N="1452" /> farmers a story about what was done for farmers they cannot accept it.  The truth is that dairying costs to-day, even with the extra grants, are such that the producers are not getting enough to keep them in production. That is a fact.  That is why butter is scarce and it is why the quantity of butter available this year will not be any greater than it was last year, although the price has been increased. I think that the Minister's point of view is faulty on agriculture.  As to rates, as far as I recollect the amount given for the relief of rates is not as large as when the Government came into office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the origin of the relief of rates?  As the Minister knows, landlords in the old days paid one portion and the tenants the other, and when the landlords were cleared out, the State took their place.  Why should the State not pay a proportion of the rates?  That is supposed to be a relief for farmers, but did not the State take over the responsibility of the landlords?  Take the amount that was given by way of subsidy on milling and wheat production. The fact about wheat-growing is that there are farmers who will not continue in wheat production on their land, even with the price that it fetches to-day.  There was a recent case of a farmer in Kildare who had to plough up 300 acres and sow another crop.  The truth is that by giving these grants the Exchequer assists producers to get goods which they could not get unless that money were forthcoming. I remember Senator Sir John Keane 20 years ago suggesting that we ought to have some sort of costings organisation to indicate to the Exchequer and to farmers what costings represented in the productive effort.  We have nothing like that now. We had some sort of organisation dealing with costings some years ago but it ceased to exist.  When the Minister claims that assistance is being given to agriculture, we deny it.  Farmers who have to milk cows say that the assistance given is given mainly to producers and despite that fact, the volume of <Col N="1453" /> our agricultural production has declined. That is the very grave situation we have to face.</P>
      <P>I am not going to deal at length with the agricultural problem now.  I realise that the Minister is under a certain handicap when dealing with it but the situation is not comforting.  I feel that the Minister and his colleagues have not really faced up to the magnitude of the problem which has to be faced if agriculture is to be put on a proper basis.  In his statement, the Minister referred to post-war organisation and plans.  What are the post-war plans for agriculture?  Farmers are concerned about these plans.  They know what other nations are doing and what the world outlook is about agriculture but they do not know what the outlook is here.  No lead is being given by the Government.  We do not know what the post-war policy is to be.  We are supposed to have a group of experts considering the position.  I do not know when we are to get plans from them.  Some of us do not feel comfortable about the outlook for the future mainly because we are going to have machinery that is run down and will not be as strong as it might be if some of us had been listened to in the past.  I do not know that any words of mine weigh with the Minister, but apart from what any of his colleagues may desire to do, everything they may say will be mere idle words unless we can strengthen the whole structure of our agriculture.  When the Minister for Local Government talks of planning a great system of new roads I recall what Senator Hayes said about our declining population, and suggest that we should develop our agriculture before we build roads, as we might be building roads that would have nothing to carry.  That is the real situation which has to be met.  I do not think that 3 per cent. of our farms are equipped. with 3 per cent. of what is necessary to make them efficient.  That may be a very extraordinary statement but it is my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, on many occasions, referred to this problem of credit for farmers. In his speech, the Minister referred to the obvious prosperity of farmers, judged by their banking accounts.  If <Col N="1454" /> that be the test, then the same must be true of industry.  Perhaps Senator O'Donnell will tell us of the prosperity of industry.  I know farmers who have sold everything they had and put the proceeds in the bank.  I suppose that is a test of the prosperity of those people &mdash;farmers without farms.  We are cashing the fertility of the soil and wearing out our machines and some of us are not wearing too well at the job ourselves.  All the money that is earned in that way is put into the banks for Senator Sir John Keane and others to hold.  When we come to the question of re-equipping those farms, we come to a problem which has not been tackled here so far.  I do not know what the Minister's views are on the subject of credit for agriculture in the future.  We shall have to revolutionise our ideas on that subject if there is to be any reconstruction of agriculture.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has been functioning since 1928.  When I was a member of the first board, the rate of interest charged to the first borrower was 6 per cent.  At their first meeting, the members of the board decided to go to the then Minister for Finance and tell him that they did not think that the financing of the corporation enabled them to do the job of work which had been given them to do.  That was in 1928.  The lending rate was then 6 per cent.  We marched over to the Minister for Finance in a body.  I do not know what enthusiasm the present Minister for Finance would display if the members of the board were to march in upon him, but we were not received with any enthusiasm and we were not encouraged to come back on that mission.  The lending rate to-day is 4½ per cent.</P>

      <P>The British can fight a war on less than 2 per cent., and, if there is one activity for which cheap money is required, it is agriculture. Senator Hayes and other Senators will talk about the cost of living.  I suppose the Minister will have had the same sort of experience that Senator <Col N="1455" /> Hayes has had.  How many of those people ever think of the influence of dear money on productive effort in agriculture?  If we are to have a reorganised agricultural industry, we shall not be able to meet competition on money lent at 4 per cent. or even at 3 per cent.  I should like to have from the Minister a definite indication that there is a changed point of view on the part of people who have it within their power to ensure that money, one of the commodities necessary for production in agriculture, will not demand any more for its services than the payment given for the use of other commodities. Production in agriculture has declined. Why?  Because we have had to change our type of production.  We have changed to a type of production for which a good deal of our land was not suited and for which we had not the kind of machine, in the form of organisation, mechanical and otherwise, suited for the job.  In addition, our production has fallen from a cause which should never have been permitted. We permitted our young men and women to leave the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want production from the land, you will not get it with the aid of machines alone, or even with machines and fertility.  You want the man-power to join these things together.  During the war, we permitted thousands of the sturdiest men any country could possess to leave. Even if we had to pay them to do nothing else than kick their heels about, we should have kept them in the country.  I refer to this matter because I see from a statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his own Vote that there is some intention of taking the lid off the pot again.  If that be done, it will be the end of all things.  At the same time, I compliment the Minister on giving evidence of thought in his effort to enable farmers to draw upon labour for the coming harvest.  While he may do that with one hand, I see, on the other hand, young men leaving the towns to which they have just cycled in from the country and going to jobs in another country.  In the towns, they secured building or other jobs for a <Col N="1456" /> few months and then got permits to leave.  Thousands of those fellows have gone.  If that policy is again to be operative, let us not have members of the Government again deploring the decline in agricultural production or the existence of inflationary tendencies. What can they expect if they let the boys away who could produce goods at home&mdash;if they allow them to go across and pick up money in England which they can send back into the pool here, where there is a fair amount of currency in circulation, to purchase goods which are falling in quantity day after day?</P>
    <P>Passing to another aspect of production, in the churches of the diocese to which I belong, we had read recently an appeal from the Taoiseach regarding turf production.  It is a bit late for that now.  If the appeal were to be effective, it should have been made a couple of months earlier.  Senator Hawkins will bear me out in that. How many thousands of potential turf-cutters did the Minister and his colleagues allow to leave the country? How many thousands of them have got permits to leave?  I have not got the figures but they should be available to the Minister.  I cannot understand the mentality which deplores the shortage of fuel without having regard to the number of potential turf-cutters who were permitted to leave the country.  We cannot have it both ways and Government policy in that respect is inexplicable.  Practically the same position has obtained with regard to the production of coal.  The problem of our coal resources has not been tackled at all.  Let me come back to our turf policy.  Our fuel supplies are short but, in my opinion, the whole fuel-production problem was mishandled. I should like to have the opinion of other Senators on this subject because some of them who, like myself, have been on bogs can express an intelligent opinion upon it.</P>
    <P>When we saw, early in the emergency, the sort of position that we were to be confronted with, we should have asked ourselves: &ldquo;What have we got to exploit?&rdquo;  and we should have kept all the necessary equipment to exploit these resources.  So far as the bogs are <Col N="1457" /> concerned, you had not the machinery to do the job, but you had the human labour, and that was the most valuable thing.  With that human labour, if you handled it properly, you could have astonished yourselves and the nation with what might have been done.  Not alone did you permit that labour to go away, but you were not prepared to pay them enough to keep them at home.  You did not even go the right way about establishing a system of payment that was fair to the producer and the consumer.  You have, in your turf production and sales policy, been making orders to sell turf by weight. I have seen turf being burned in the city and I know that in the country districts we would hardly take that type of turf out of the bogs.  That turf has been sold by weight, and some things not very charitable are being said about some of the people here who handle the turf&mdash;things are being said about how they manage to add to the weight.  I have no experience of that aspect of the matter, and I am not going to speak on it.  It is not yet too late to remedy the position.  You have got some of the poorest material that could have been taken out of the bogs. You fixed the price by weight.  There were days when you did the same thing with certain agricultural commodities, and then you thought of grading.  If the Minister and his colleagues would give some thought to the possibility of grading turf in the country and arrange that only certain grades will be permitted to come on the long journey to the city, the situation could undoubtedly be improved.</P>

      <P>I will refer, then, to that particular aspect when the Appropriation Bill is under discussion.  I will conclude by saying that the Government policy in relation to the whole position of inflation and prices could have been better planned.  In respect of turf, the Minister could have decided to take that commodity in from the bogs and have it graded.  Then he <Col N="1458" /> would have the very best type of turf available for consumers, who would pay for it according to its grade, and you would not have it sold by weight, having possibly a moisture content of 70 per cent.  In that way it would be more acceptable to the people and they would not have the attitude about the hogs that they have got, and that we will find it difficult to live down when the emergency is over.</P>
      <P>I feel that the Government policy with regard to agriculture is not at all satisfactory.  We may content ourselves that we are getting through the emergency in a satisfactory way.  We are, and I do not think it will be questioned that the farmers' efforts, under very great difficulties, have carried the country through the emergency tolerably well.  But the situation confronting the farmers, the Government, and indeed all the citizens of the country, arising out of what we have had to go through during the emergency, is likely to be so difficult that a fresh approach will have to be made by the Minister towards the organisation of agriculture.  I trust I shall have an opportunity on the Appropriation Bill of addressing myself to other aspects of this matter.</P>

      <P>It was inevitable that some Senators would indicate that we are here to-day singing our swan-song.  There are some of us who may not reappear in the Seanad Chamber.  I do not think any one of us here would ever claim that either Senator Hayes or Senator Foran is capable of emulating the great Pavlova in her rendering of the dying swan. I am not a great ornithologist, but I would suggest that the duet of Senator Foran and Senator Hayes would be more on the lines of the rook and the jackdaw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Part II of the Finance Bill, I might say, speaking on behalf of the industrialists of this country generally, and on behalf of the Federation of Irish Industries specifically, that in so far as evasion of the taxation laws has taken place legally by certain firms in this country, we are in entire sympathy with the Minister in his efforts to stop the repetition of such evasions.  Industrialists are <Col N="1459" /> neither sheep nor goats; they are a very ordinary body of men having, I presume, the same virtues and all the vices of members of this Assembly.  At any rate, they are no better and no worse, and I do not think that all the diatribes and suggestions and innuendoes that they have been living on the fat of the land, or that they are the robbers in the barn-yard, are entirely true.  This atmosphere of moral rectitude is all very well, but people in my station of life, industrialists, manufacturers and producers of various types of goods, do not claim to be any better or any worse than other people. We certainly know from our experience that we are no worse.</P>
    <P>I do think it is essential that when a prominent trade union official, such as Senator Foran, makes the statement that there has been a tendency amongst industrialists, as a result of the accumulation of large profits within the past few years, to put workers out of employment, for me, on behalf of industrialists, manufacturers and producers generally, to deny that as emphatically as I can, and I challenge the Senator to prove even one occasion where his statement could be borne out, where his allegation could be upheld.  I am sure the Minister will agree that in so far as the Government have appealed to industrialists to retain their staffs, they have in a general sense retained them.  I suggest that so far as it was possible to do it we have done it.  I am surprised that a man like the Senator, when singing his swan-song, should sing notes so completely out of tune.  I think these statements about people who are doing their best to build up an industrial atmosphere in this country have been exaggerated, amplified and enlarged out of all proportion, and where people vilify others by innuendo and unsustained statements, it is time to call a halt.  If Senator Foran can prove to me that the statement he made&mdash;that, as a result of people getting away with large profits in the industrial sphere, they have tried to get rid of their workers&mdash;has a foundation, I will go down on my knees and kiss his ring.  I presume if he loses <Col N="1460" /> his vocation here he will find another one&mdash;that explains my last sentence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Finance Bill, I am not quite like Senator Hayes.  I am afraid I have been studying queer ways of finance too long to be amazed that a small country like this should have a £50,000,000 Budget.  If anything is proved by that, it is the extraordinary elasticity of the present monetary system.  I doubt if even my friend Senator Sir John Keane, with his more intimate knowledge of the workings of finance, can assure me that the cost of £50,000,000 is an exaggerated one because of that elasticity in the monetary system.  My only trouble regarding it, as far as my limited conception can envisage it at all, is that this country, whose total production in the industrial sphere is about £66,000,000 net, and in the agricultural sphere about £76,000,000 net, in other words, having a total production in money value of £142,000,000, is paying its managers £50,000,000 for managing the enterprise.  I know that that is not an entirely fair statement.  I know, of course, that a certain proportion of that £50,000,000 goes to social services of one kind or another, and that another proportion goes to certain productive enterprises.  It is not entirely a wasted investment, if I may put it that way; it is not entirely a consumed item.  That £50,000,000, in various phases of it, does reproduce something.</P>
    <P>In discussing a Finance Bill of this sort, as I have said on a former occasion, I assume that the Minister, for the time being, is my wife, and that I am discussing the cost of the house with him, and when I see that the cost of my house is £50,000,000, and that the producible goods which we have manufactured out of our garden is £142,000,000, and that he is the person who controls the way in which money can be issued to finance these producible goods, even as my wife, I find it very difficult to say that he is spending too much, because, so far as my knowledge of finance goes and my appreciation of the extraordinarily queer quality of it, as evidenced in latter-day financial manipulations, particularly as evidenced by Mr. <Col N="1461" /> Morganthau and others, and through the agency of war services, I cannot lay it down emphatically that £50,000,000 is a high cost to run this country.  But I would say, as an ordinary business man who runs a business, that I think a business which costs me a third to run, a third which is mainly non-productive, is costing a bit too much.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, with greater political acumen than I have, will, at a later stage, naturally enough, come back on me when I raise my feeble voice on behalf of, say, culture, or art, and say that on the one hand I am claiming that it is costing too much to run the house and on the other hand that I am asking for something which is going to increase the cost again.  I do not want to fall into that trap which, obviously, Senator Hayes fell into when on the one hand he began to deplore&mdash;I suppose as a politician&mdash;the fact that this country is costing £50,000,000 to run and then, like Oliver Puff on a famous occasion, spoke with a second voice and claimed higher bonuses and higher payments. I am not disputing the principle, but I am marvelling at the ability of a man who has such a schizophrenetic mind, who can on the one hand deplore the spending of £50,000,000 and, on the other hand, ask the Minister for more. I have had one taste of the Minister's method in that capacity, and I am not going to fall too easily for it to-day. He will forgive me if I say I have learned something about his ability during my short period here.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and it has been repeated, that certain sections of the community have made very great profits during the past few years.  Listening to Senators who are not aware of the ramifications of the laws in reference to industry one would think that all one had got to do was to put in a machine, employ a few girls at 5/- a week and to produce thousands of pounds as a result.  I think that the majority of Senators who have spoken are not aware of the fact that, first of all, through the Ministry of Supplies, there is in force a number of Orders which very strictly control prices and that, also through the same Ministry, there is in operation a very severe <Col N="1462" /> control of profits.  After enduring the lesser purgatory of price control and profit control, industrialists come to the greater purgatory of the Revenue Department who, after squeezing 7/6 out of you in the first instance, put you through the super-mangle and squeeze corporation profits tax out of you and, if there is still some life left in you, they squeeze excess corporation profits tax out of you.  I can assure Senators who assume that great profits and huge moneys are being made by people in this country in trade that, generally speaking, it is not true.  My friend, Senator Sweetman, who knows more of wealthy people than I do, may doubt my statement, but I would challenge him to fill this room with people who own their own businesses who are making great fortunes.  When I say great fortunes I presume something from £5,000 to £7,000 is meant.  I do not believe he could fill even the seats in this room with the number of such people.  All this talk of wealth and profits is greatly exaggerated.  If some of the Senators who believe in this talk were to start in business for themselves, by the time the Minister for Industry and Commerce had dealt with them by his policy of prices and profits control and the Minister for Finance had put them through the super-mangle in the Revenue Department, they would not speak in the strain in which they spoke to-day.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter in his general attitude towards money&mdash; the Chair will forgive my mentioning this, because it does arise out of the cost of running the country&mdash;and I repeat what he has said in a different way.  Just as it is essential for agriculture to have cheap money it is essential for us industrialists to have it.  I know, of course, that under the present peculiar money system we have adopted and nurtured here and which we have not yet discovered to be as pliable as some people believe it to be, it will be very difficult to get the Minister for Finance to change his attitude as to what money should cost. I know that in so far as he is personally concerned he would be only too glad to see it costing less because I know the general attitude of the Government <Col N="1463" /> is to see that as far as possible production should be helped and that no hindrance should be put in its way by any financial control of any sort.  In fairness to the Minister, I think he has repeatedly said in the other House that financial strangleholds of any sort have not been put upon him in any direction and that he will not allow it, but whether he says that or not, I think there is a certain grain of truth in Senator Baxter's statement that, in so far as the cost of money is concerned, there has been a stranglehold operating.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked a pertinent question, why so many young men are leaving the country.  I would say that young men are leaving the country simply because they were not getting a living wage on the land.  I do not think young men left this country for love of leaving this country.  I think young men left this country because they were not getting an economic living in this country.  Who is to blame for that, I am not going to say.  The farmer is controlled by the prices he can get for his goods in the open market, and I am not going to pillory the farmer for not paying more than he was able to pay.  It is a pity that such a thing happened, and it is a problem which should be solved, but I think that if Senator Baxter would also ask himself the question, he would find that it was not because the Government wanted them to leave this country or because they themselves wanted to leave this country; it was just because they could not get a living in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer particularly to Part 2 of the Finance Bill.  I suppose the Minister is aware that that is the section which interests me most in a sense and, because I know the majority of the members here are also interested in corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax, I would ask them to bear with me for a minute.  I would like to reiterate, on behalf of the Federation of Irish Industrialists more particularly&mdash;the Minister will understand the reason why&mdash;our complete lack of sympathy with any firm in this country who tried to evade payment of excess corporation <Col N="1464" /> profits tax or corporation profits tax, or in any way tried to evade taxation these past few years.  It is quite obvious that an attempt has been made and successfully made to carry out evasion.  I do not think that there was any other reason whatsoever for the Minister introducing this provision except that such evasion had been attempted and accomplished.  I should like to assure him on behalf of the majority of industrialists in this country that we have no sympathy whatever with any firm which carried out such evasion, even though they were legally allowed to do so.  That is one of the points I want to stress, that while they may have done something morally wrong&mdash;and I have no doubt they did something morally wrong&mdash; they did not do anything legally wrong. They were just, as the Minister will probably agree, good businessmen.  I put &ldquo;good&rdquo; in that sense in inverted commas, because it is not the sort of thing I would do myself, or that the majority of decent industrialists in this country would do.  But we have no hostility towards this new provision. At the same time, we feel that there are some minor points which will cause undue hardship and which will prove to be unfair in the working.  I do not want to bring this matter up in the form of a recommendation, but I should like to make an appeal to the Minister who, although a Minister for Finance, is, I know, a very human being.  For example, a case may happen, under Section 2, of a firm of, say, two or three men who, ten years ago, started business and found they were under-capitalised and had to go to the bank for an overdraft to carry on the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will allow me to continue, I think he will get the point.  I was pointing out that this firm started, say, ten years ago and had to go to the bank to get an overdraft to carry on the business. During those years, they never voted or paid themselves directors' fees. Strange to say, that could not possibly happen in any other avocation outside industry, but it does happen and has happened in industry.  It has happened that men, starting business in a small way, have ploughed back into the business the profits.  They may have other means of living; they may have other sources of income.  But, in so far as that particular business was concerned, they did not draw out any directors' fees or pass any amount for directors' fees.  Now they arrive at a stage when, under the Bill, they are limited to 3 per cent. of their capital. I know that the Minister will come back on me and say that they have got a minimum of £2,500.  But I am taking the case of a company of £5,000 for the purpose of illustration.  It has a minimum of £2,500 and now can get £150 more.  But for ten years they have not drawn out any directors' fees because the money was not there and they were only in a position to pay back the bank.  Now, when they say: &ldquo;We will take our directors' fees&rdquo;, under this Bill you are treating these men unfairly.  I say that it is an act of omission rather than anything else, and, if such a case comes before the Minister, I hope he will give it his attention and consideration and see that justice is done.  That is one instance where an act of omission is causing injustice.  Probably the Minister will have a reply to that.  He is very able, much more able than I am, because I am only an amateur in discussing this matter of corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which was raised in the Dáil by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Costello was this matter of fixing the date, December 31st, 1943, as the final date for the accounting <Col N="1466" /> period.  The case has been put before the Dáil very well already by these two Deputies but, just because some Senators may get a shock when they hear what is going to happen, I will tell them what this will mean, so far as I understand it.  It means that, if any firm were unfortunate enough to own a business whose accounting period ended on the 1st January, 1944, they would have to pay corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax at a new rate laid down by the Minister in this Bill. But, if they were fortunate enough to have a business whose accounting period ends on the 31st December, 1943, they would pay on the old and lesser basis.  Our point about that is that it will cause tremendous hardship and is unfair.  The argument which I put forward is the argument which has been put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Costello and other Deputies and that is, that the Minister would not be creating a new principle in accepting our plea for apportionment. He has accepted it in regard to previous Bills.  A firm may have had 11 months' trading, because most traders finish their trading year on January 31st, and be tax liable for the previous 12 months on the new basis of computation, and yet as I have said if it was fortunate enough to complete its year the previous December 31st it would receive far more favourable terms from the revenue authorities.  A majority of small firms will be caught under this Bill.  Even though they have already made their arrangements and probably paid their directors' fees and dividends, they have now to go back on that, because the Minister has not been prepared, apparently, up to now to discuss this question of apportionment.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a very severe hardship.  People like myself and industrialists, manufacturers and traders generally all agree with the spirit behind the Bill, but they feel rather upset by the fact that over a small matter of this sort&mdash;it is a relatively small matter&mdash;the Minister cannot meet them.  I think it is not an impossible thing to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil it would take a whole series of amendments to <Col N="1467" /> deal with this question of apportionment. I suggest to the Minister that it is merely a matter for the auditors of any company to make out the apportionment, and surely the Revenue Commissioners, with their expert and up-to-date and courteous staff&mdash;I wish to pay them that tribute&mdash;will be able to check up on the auditors who prepared such an apportionment and approve of it.  I do not see anything impossible in it.  I appeal to the Minister to give kindly consideration to the suggestion which has been made to him in good faith, because I know that he is a man who will not willingly cause an injustice.  In this case I think he is causing an injustice, and I hope that, before the Bill goes back to the Dáil, he will discover some method to see that this matter of apportionment is properly dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>The 31st January seems an extraordinary date for accounts to finish.  I do not think it will affect many firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Senator understands the point.  If your accounting period finishes on 31st December, 1943, your corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax are based on the old rate.  But, if your accounting period, by any chance, happens to finish on any date subsequent to that, between then and the passing of this Bill, you are subject to all sorts of new additions imposed by this Bill.  I am, of course, by no means a financial expert or an income-tax expert, but I realise that it can cause a very grave hardship on companies who have already made arrangements for the distribution of their profits and the payment of directors' fees.  Apart from that, the principle is unjust.  I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to accept the principle of apportionment which he accepted in connection with previous Bills of this nature.  I cannot see why, on this occasion, it should not be accepted or why it would need the series of amendments which the Minister suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  In the interpretation of <Col N="1468" /> remuneration, so far as directors are concerned, in the Bill, one of the matters mentioned as being included is commission.  I am raising this point because of the peculiar position which arises in regard to a number of firms which I am aware of and which neither the Minister nor the Revenue Commissioners would probably have been aware of in the ordinary way.  Quite a number of industrial firms, having a number of directors, usually have one of the directors as a selling agent.  It very often happens that the man who is the selling agent is also a director of the firm.  As a matter of fact, it happens more often in this country than in any other country in the world that I know of, for the simple reason that when this Government set out on its industrial policy, the starting of many industries was very largely due to the enterprise of the selling agents of companies abroad, and, naturally, when these firms or Irish-controlled firms of a similar nature started operations here, the selling agent, who had made it possible for them to be established here, became a director of the firm concerned, while still retaining his position as a selling agent.  In many cases, these men continued to get their commission as selling agents, and also their fees as a director of the company concerned. It would appear now&mdash;and I presume that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that in the case of any man, such as I have described, who started a firm in this country in 1938 and who held the joint positions of selling agent and director, there will be a differentiation made against him as between the money he is being paid as selling agent and the fees he gets as a director, because, presumably, there is no affinity between the two, and he will not be allowed a greater sum than that paid to him in the early years of the company's existence. It appears to me that the moneys he receives as a selling agent are described in the Bill as a &ldquo;commission&rdquo;, whereas the moneys he receives as a director of a firm are described as &ldquo;fees.&rdquo;  Such cases, undoubtedly, exist, and again I feel that something unfair is happening there, because if the firm concerned had not appointed <Col N="1469" /> that particular individual as a selling agent and paid him his commission, they would have had to appoint somebody else.  They were not doing anything irregular or wrong in appointing as a director the man who was responsible for having the firm established in this country.  I feel quite sure that the Minister is not aware of the circumstances involved here, and, again, as I say, I am quite prepared to rely on his sense of justice in this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes and other Senators have said that wages have not gone up. That is not true.  Various wages boards and tribunals have been set up to examine into the whole question of wages, generally, and I am quite sure that my more liberal friends on the Labour Benches will agree that industrialists in this country, generally, have been very fair so far as this question of wages is concerned.  I think that anybody who has examined the position will agree that the general attitude of industrialists in this country on the matter of wages has been very good. I think that we have&mdash;and I thank God for it&mdash;treated our workers as Christians and human beings, and have tried to do our best for them; but the extraordinary thing is that, while the Minister and his colleagues pass numerous emergency Orders to secure increased wages for the workers, when it comes to increasing the fees&mdash;or, in other words, the wages, of the directors of companies&mdash;they say: &ldquo;Ha, ha!  We will not increase those fees.&rdquo;  They seem to think that because a man lives in a certain stratum of society or life he can still exist, in 1944, on the fees or emoluments that he received in 1939.  In effect, the Minister, in this Bill, is saying that while we agree that certain classes of workers should be entitled to an increase in wages, he does not think that the directors of firms are entitled to any increase in their fees or emoluments. Now, it is a fact that the greater number of firms in this country are small firms.  I should say that, probably, most of them are what one might describe as family concerns; and probably the man who runs that concern works as hard as any man working on, let us say, the docks, or in any other kind of labouring work, and I <Col N="1470" /> think that such a man is just as much entitled to a living wage as any of the people with whom Senator Foran is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether that limitation applies to private companies only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I understood that the limitation of fees applies to all companies, but of course I am talking about family controlled companies. However, that was the only point I wanted to raise in this connection: that the cost of living has gone up just as much on directors of companies as on everybody else, and that if you try to restrict these directors of companies now to the fees that they were receiving before the war, it will only mean that you will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.</P>
      <P>Again, in Section 14 (10), it says that the expression &ldquo;pre-appointed day company&rdquo; means a company incorporated before the 7th day of May, 1941. I was going to suggest that the Minister might accept the date that was fixed in a previous Bill, when this tax was originally introduced, which date, I think, was the 31st August, 1939, because many of these companies had not got any standard at all at that period.  I realise, of course, the difficulty, when a Bill is actually drafted and worked out, of making changes of that kind, but I do not see any reason why the Minister should be, as he seems to be, immovable on this matter, and I suggest that, if he were to adopt my suggestion, it would make a great difference to many manufacturers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I might point out that it would appear to be the view of the Revenue Department to take the maximum amount of money from those who get the maximum amount of money from others.  That is a perfectly understandable point of view, but I do not know whether, in the long run, it is the wisest policy to be taking money away from people who would, probably, apply that money in productive enterprise.  I should say that, if the greater proportion of the moneys you are going to take from these companies, through corporation profits tax or excess corporation <Col N="1471" /> profits tax, were to be left with manufacturers or industrialists in this country, who are prepared to use that money in increased productive enterprise, there would be a far greater yield to the State as a result of the increased production of goods than could be given by any Government in taking these taxes directly from the firms concerned and using them themselves for similar productive purposes.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that, in imposing these taxes on the firms or companies concerned, you are taking too much away from the common pool that is available to the people who are capable of producing goods, and it must be remembered that the people in this country who, in the main, are taxpayers, are the people who are producing goods. You are now, however, going to hand over to the drones, roughly, £50,000,000 worth of those goods, expressed in money values.  I think that if you were to follow the policy of France, and leave the greater proportion of that money amongst the people who are the real producers, you would be able to place our country on a sounder national foundation.  I am only suggesting that because, under different circumstances, and on a different occasion, I think it should be possible to be critical of the whole financial basis upon which the government of this country is run.</P>
    <P>Recognising the fact, however, that we are going through an emergency period and that in this emergency the Minister is asking those who are in a position to bear the heavy burdens inseparable from it to pay up and that he is also doing his best to get after those who are trying to evade the payment of taxes, I am entirely with the Minister but on another occasion I hope it will be possible for him to devise some system whereby he can leave to those who are producing in this country a larger proportion of the money and the wealth which they create so that it can be utilised in still further production.  In that way I think we can refute the very unfair allegation that employers have been trying to limit employment by holding on to large profits.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Senator <Col N="1472" /> a question?  The Senator advocates an increase in the fees allowed to directors. Is he aware that a number of these people are directors of several companies, and does he advocate that their fees should be increased in the case of all these companies?</P>

I have no sympathy nor has any other industrialist, whom I know, with people who try to evade the payment of either corporation profits tax or excess profits tax through the formation of subsidiary companies from which they draw directors' fees, even though they were legally entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on this Bill, and most of what I had intended to say has already been covered by Senator Baxter.  There are a few suggestions which I have to make to the Minister, but they will be perhaps more relevant to the Appropriation Bill when it comes up for discussion. The amount of money for which the Minister is looking does not frighten me one bit, and I speak as a taxpayer.  If we consider the value of £50,000,000 in comparison with the value of a similar amount four or five years ago, I think we will agree that the present Bill does not represent £50,000,000 as we understood it some time ago.  Although it looks an enormous amount for a country like this, when we consider the billions of money which other countries are spending at the present time, I think it is not beyond the capacity of this country to meet that Bill.  If the bulk of that £50,000,000 is spent in providing work, in the relief of unemployment and in the improvement of our social services, it will be well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer principally to some statements made by the Minister when he was discussing this Bill in the Dáil. He spoke of the prosperity of farmers. I will admit that farmers are now better off than they were prior to 1939 but to describe their position as being in any way prosperous is not to state a fact.  The Minister said that the farmers, of all classes, have got off lightly in the matter of taxation and <Col N="1473" /> that with the remission of half their annuities, the farmers should now have no cause to complain.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the farmers pay income-tax on their income just the same as every other citizen in the State.  With regard to the halving of the land annuities I should like to say&mdash;and I do not want to refer to the economic war&mdash;that the farmers in Eire lost more in one year of the economic war than the full capitalised value of the total of half the annuities which were remitted.  I am prepared to prove that before any tribunal that can be set up.  I am afraid the Minister's statement as to the prosperity of the farmers was influenced to some extent by statements which manufacturers have made time and again at their general meetings, and if the Minister takes notice of what I might term &ldquo;dubhairt-bean-liom-go-ndubhairt-bean-lei&rdquo; statements, he would be very unwise.  At a meeting of one of these industrial companies, a director made a statement which got very wide publicity, that he heard from someone that some farmer made £10,000 profit last year and was assessed only on £300.  I want to say that there could be no possible truth in that silly statement unless the farmer found a gold mine or a coal mine on his land.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of my friend, Senator O'Donnell&mdash;I am sorry he is not here now&mdash;and some of his colleagues who are industrialists and who do not understand much about farmers' income-tax, I should like to point out that a farmer can choose to be assessed for income-tax either under Schedules A and B or under Schedule D.  Most farmers choose not to be assessed under Schedule D because the preparation of farmers' accounts is a very complicated business, and if a farmer goes before the income-tax authorities, they will want to know how many eggs the farmer had for his own breakfast or how many were consumed in the household.  They will also want to know how many pints of milk were consumed in the household and the total value and quantity of every other commodity produced on the land. Even if the farmer has a pony which he uses to drive his family to Mass on <Col N="1474" /> Sunday, he will have to add the value of the feeding of that pony to his profits.</P>
    <P>The majority of farmers, therefore, choose to be assessed under Schedules A and B, because they are not very proficient in making up these accounts, and it is so difficult to convince the income-tax authorities, although I have nothing to say against the income-tax authorities.  I do not think that many farmers have anything to say against them, because if you play straight with them I think they are one of the straightest Departments in the whole State.  For the benefit of industrialists I want to point out that we have to pay income-tax under Schedules A and B.  Under Schedule A, the tax is based on the poor law valuation of the land, less some statutory deductions, and, under Schedule B, on the old annuity, less statutory deductions.  These two added together represent the farmer's income for the purpose of income-tax. He is charged and pays on that, but to be assessed on a sum of only £300, a farmer would require to have only 120 Irish acres of land, so that it was silly and ridiculous to say, as was said at a meeting of industrialists and manufacturers, that a farmer with 120 acres of land and a house could make £10,000 profit while getting off with an assessment of £300.  I do not think that requires any further comment by me.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the increased deposits in the banks and the decreased requests for accommodation by the banks since the start of this war.  He put the position in this respect forward as another sign of the prosperity of the farming community, but I should like to tell the Minister that there is possibly another explanation. I am sure that Senators who read the papers will agree with me when I say that, within living memory, at all events, more land was never sold on the market than has been sold since the start of this war.  Anybody looking at the papers every year for the past five years will have seen advertisements of farms all over the country, and that, I feel, is the cause of the increase in the deposits.  The people who bought this land&mdash;industrialists <Col N="1475" /> and that class of persons&mdash;were people with plenty of money who wanted no accommodation from the banks, which brought about the position with regard to the decreased demand for money.</P>
    <P>I look on the sale of all these farms as very serious, and I ask the Minister to consider why all these farms were put on the market and sold if farming is such a prosperous industry as he claims, and as industrialists claim, it has been in the past five years.  It is a very serious state of affairs that these farmers, whose homes and lands were the property of their families for generations, should have sold out to people who have no farming instincts and who know very little about farming. The clearing out of such farmers will not promote the prosperity of the country, and I suggest it is a matter into which the Minister and the Government should look very carefully with a view to ascertaining the reason for it.  In my opinion, much of the explanation can be provided in one word&mdash;banks.  To my own knowledge banks have persuaded farmers who owed them money to sell out their land, on the plea that prices were good and they would have an opportunity of clearing off their debts and having something for themselves.  It is, as I say, a matter which the Government should look into.</P>
    <P>We cannot blame the banks to any great extent for this action because they feel that, if the Land Commission take these lands, there will be very little for them to get from either the farmer or the Land Commission.  It was my intention to introduce a Land Bill here which would rectify the position, were it not for the general election taking place.  That Bill was prepared at my request by Senator Sweetman and Senator Monahan, but, as the Seanad is now about to be dissolved, I decided there was no use in introducing it.  I appeal to the Minister, however, to give that Bill, which is a very moderate Bill&mdash;if I am not here to move it, it will be moved by Senator Sweetman or some other Senators&mdash;his favourable consideration and to use his influence with the Government to get it <Col N="1476" /> accepted.  This Bill is one designed to give back security of tenure to the farmers and it is one without which we shall not have contentment or prosperity amongst the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan asked why certain people with large holdings of land have recently disposed of them, and he gave the disposing of these lands as one of the reasons for the decrease in the demands by the farming community for money from the banks.  What is the true reason for these people disposing of their land? The reason is&mdash;and if you ask them, they will tell you&mdash;that they were not farmers in the proper sense of the word.  I think we should have some segregation of the people on the land, so that one type of people would be classified as land owners, as they really are, and another type, the people who will till the land and make proper use of it, as farmers.</P>
      <P>If you examine the position, you will find that it is these land owners, these people who, by reason of the system adopted in the past, were not in a position to comply with the regulations in respect of supplying the country with food, who disposed of their land. There were large landowners who had not got a horse, a plough or any implement. Senator Baxter to-day said the Government should have made machinery available for these people. These are the people who knew absolutely nothing about farming and whose farm work consisted of the raising of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan also gave us the information that, but for the unfortunate incident of a general election, it was his intention to introduce a Land Bill, and, without seeing any of its sections, I think I could safely say that its purpose is to curtail the activities of the Land Commission in acquiring large holdings of land for division amongst our people.  Senator Baxter and other Senators on that side plead with us to stop the flight from the land, and I put it to the House, to the Minister and to the Government that there is no other solution of our problem with regard to the flight from the land than the division of land and the <Col N="1477" /> placing on it of people who are capable and willing to work it.  That, to my mind, is the only solution.  I do not know what the composition of the next Seanad will be, but if Senator Counihan does introduce this Bill which he has mentioned, I hope it will meet with the reception with which it would meet if it were introduced at the present time.  As I see it, our salvation in this country is to divide up the land, and I believe that, if obstacles had not been placed in the way of intensification of land division, we would be in a much more secure position to-day.  We would have more food for our people and more people on the land.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter wanted to know what is our post-war agricultural policy.  I think I could gather from his statements that his solution would be a return to the conditions which existed before Fianna Fáil came into office&mdash; that we should once more become a land producing only live stock for export.  I say again that the salvation of the country lies in an intensification of the policy adopted for the last few years.  The Senator also went into the question of fuel supply, and I think the Chairman suggested that that matter should be left over until we come to the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>On various occasions during discussions on the Finance Bill here we had protests against the sum asked for.  At one time it was £45,000,000 or £46,000,000, and now it has almost reached £50,000,000; but we had very little protest to-day, except of course that some people wanted more.  I am glad to see that there is in this huge sum a contribution towards our social services, much of which will go to help the needy.  I have one suggestion to make to the Minister and the Government, and it is that, where an extra allowance of 2/6 is to be paid to old age pensioners, widows, people in receipt of national health insurance, and so on, throughout the rural areas, that allowance should be passed on as early as possible.  No apathy on the part of local councils should hold up the passing on of this benefit.  I know cases where delays have occurred, and I would ask the Government to take steps to prevent those delays in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> I welcome the provision made for the supply of boots to the children of needy people.  I hope this provision will be extended, because it would tend to increase our school attendance during the winter months when it is difficult for parents to provide boots for their children.  Another point to which I should like to refer is that, while many people have been for a long time crying out for some such measure as the Government has recently introduced, a standstill Order in relation to prices, there is great danger that some of our people, and particularly some of our manufacturers, may not be as anxious to keep up production on account of their profits being curtailed, and I think the Government should pay attention to that matter, particularly in relation to essential commodities. As I said at the outset, I congratulate the Minister on having made the many provisions which he has made to help the needy over these difficult times.</P>

      <P>A large portion of the Finance Bill is occupied with an attempt or attempts to prevent the evasion of corporation profits tax. As the rate and varieties of taxation increased of course we had the usual stimulus to the ingenuity of the taxpayer to find legitimate means of avoiding payment, and the revenue or Finance dog felt that he had been cheated of his legitimate bite off the bone and went away growling disconsolately. Nobody can blame him for that.  Nobody can blame a hungry dog for attempting to remedy the situation which has produced his hunger or for coming back in a bad temper.  But I think that the revenue dog, when he came back in a perfectly legitimate bad temper in order to ensure his perfectly legitimate share of the joint, perhaps overlooked certain effects which his well-meant demands to secure his meal may produce.  It is only for the purpose of calling attention, <Col N="1479" /> in a completely non-contentious way, to some of those possible effects that I am speaking on this Second Reading, because I do not wish to introduce amendments on the Committee Stage unless what I am going to say finds some little responsive echo in the heart of the Minister for Finance or in the even flintier hearts of the gentlemen who advise him.  A number of the sections with which I am going to deal may, in certain respects, work out fairly, but in other respects their operation is going to be difficult.</P>
      <P>The first section to which I will call attention is Section 13.  That is introduced to cope with a familiar and easy method of tax evasion.  By earlier legislation there was a limit put upon the amount of profits which could be made by a company without rendering it liable to excess corporation profits tax, but by the simple process of creating a large number of directors&mdash;your sons, your daughters, and possibly your domestic servants&mdash;you were able to reduce the amount shown as general profits, and at the same time divert the stream of wealth into channels from which it might trickle back to yourself.  I think this section is commendably aimed at preventing too much of the profits of the company being directed to the directors, without being shown in the balance sheet as immediate profits.  But there are two cases in which I think the Revenue Commissioners should have power to modify the effects of this section. First of all, as has been pointed out already by Senator O'Donnell, there are cases where companies were not flourishing at first and the directors, who were self-sacrificing, gave to themselves little or no fees, in order to put the company on its feet and to provide a reserve fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in those cases the companies may now be flourishing, but by the very effect of their economic working a lower standard of profits may have been set, and they will not be able to get what are the reasonable rewards which they should get now, having sacrificed matters in a lean period. Secondly, there is a class of company, the success of which depends, almost <Col N="1480" /> entirely, upon the hard work, the initiative and the judgment of the directors.  It corresponds much more to the old idea of the partnership and the directors are people who are, by their persons and personalities, earning all the money.  It seems to me that, in that case also, the Revenue Commissioners should be empowered to recognise the fact that the directors deserve more payment because, it is not either the fixed or circulating capital that is making the profits, but it is, if I may use the phrase, the genius and initiative of the directors. In a case like that, I suggest that there should be a discretion given to the Revenue Commissioners to relax the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>I pass on to Section 14.  I have had the privilege of approximately a 15 seconds' conversation with the Minister's advisers in which I indicated a point which seemed to be a difficult one under this section.  I do not think that there was quite time enough to reassure me that the point was not as difficult as I thought.  This section is aimed at quite a different type of evasion.  This is aimed at a company which, if all its profits were to be taxed as belonging to one company, would find itself heavily taxed in regard to corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax, but, by the simple expedient of making a kind of commercial trinity: of dividing itself into three companies, with one direction, it was enabled to secure benefits of the underriding minimum of £2,500 profits provided by earlier legislation.  This section is directed at preventing companies dividing themselves up into two or more persons, legal persons, that is, and so getting the benefit of a number of minimums which could not be touched, but which, when added together, would come to a very considerable amount.  I think that is a short and untechnical description of the effect of the section.  Now, in the effort to do that&mdash;a very difficult thing&mdash;and by a very complicated piece of drafting, I think that the draftsman and the Minister have put themselves in this position, that they will find it very difficult to operate the section.  The object of the section was to provide that, if these subsidiary <Col N="1481" /> companies had been formed, what we may call the parent company was to be assessed for tax as if it and the subsidiary companies were all one.  It was, of course, necessary to provide for cases where subsidiary companies were really owned by nominees of the parent company, but if we look at Section 14, paragraph (b) of sub-section (9), we find this over-riding statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  any shares of a company held by the nominees or the shareholders of another company shall be deemed to be held by that other company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say that I have no objection to nominees, but I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he will find it easier to work the section if he deletes the words &ldquo;or the shareholders&rdquo;, because I do suggest that this sub-section will prove almost unworkable, even with the proviso, to which I shall refer in a minute, whereby the Minister hopes to make it workable.  Suppose you have shares in a small company held between three or four people, and that those people who between them hold 50 per cent. of the shares, with a controlling interest, also have shares in Guinness.  Now, that is not a very unusual hypothesis.  The effect of this sub-section, in a case such as that, when read in conjunction with paragraph (a), would be that Messrs. Guinness would be deemed to own the small company, and would be assessed in respect of the small company as if it were part of Guinness's because the people who had the controlling interest in the small company happened to be shareholders in Guinness's.  If the people who had a controlling interest in the small company also happened to be shareholders in the Bank of Ireland, the Bank of Ireland could also be assessed under the earlier provisions of the section as owning the small company. Any company in Ireland, in which the people owning a controlling interest in a small company happened to have shares, would, by the effect of this section, be assessed by the Revenue Commissioners as if it owned the small company.  How the Revenue Commissioners would select whether it was the Bank of Ireland, <Col N="1482" /> whether it was Messrs.  Guinness or one of half a dozen other companies that I could mention was to be assessable, I do not know, but looking at it purely from the point of view of a draftsman and a lawyer, it does seem to me that, automatically, whenever you find a controlling interest in a small company in the hands of people who are shareholders in any other large company, the effect of this section is that the large company is the owner of a small company, the two businesses are regarded as if they were amalgamated, the profits are regarded as if they were one common pool, and the large company is treated as being liable for the tax payable by the small company.</P>
    <P>Now, when I first had my attention called to this, the answer which occurred to me was one which necessitated going back to an earlier section.  These various results to which I have referred depend upon sub-section (5) which provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a post-appointed day company, is deemed by this section to be a subsidiary of a pre-appointed day company, then, unless the Revenue Commissioners otherwise direct, the following provisions shall, for the purpose of a charge to corporation profits tax, apply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That could, undoubtedly, be utilised in the case which I have mentioned&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners could make a special direction that the otherwise automatic provisions of the section should not apply.  But the case which I have envisaged is one which must be comparatively common, and if the section is left as it is, I think, it will mean that wherever you have a small, recently-formed company, the Revenue Commissioners will be put into the position of making elaborate investigations, and directing that half a dozen other companies, in which the owners of the small company happen to have shares, are not to be affected in this manner.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that if the words &ldquo;or the shareholders&rdquo; are deleted, or if an amendment is put in to the effect that the Revenue Commissioners shall direct that the provisions of sub-section (5) are to apply, the whole section will <Col N="1483" /> be a good deal simpler for the Minister to work, and will avoid the difficult position which I envisage arising automatically. I pass from that, and merely say that if I can be of the slightest assistance to anyone in connection with the matter I shall be happy to give it. But I do think that it will be very difficult to work the section as it is.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is the &ldquo;drag-net&rdquo; and it enables the Revenue Commissioners, wherever they are of opinion that the main purpose for which any transaction or transactions was or were effected was the avoidance or reduction of liability to corporation profits tax, to direct that any adjustments which may seem to them good should be made in order to prevent that result.  That provision is one which is taken substantially, though not quite word for word, from the British Finance Act, 1941, Section 35.  There it was applied to excess profits tax: here it is applied to corporation profits tax; but, with that exception, it is taken from the British Act.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some objections to it in the British Act: there is always the objection to allowing a person to be convicted of what is practically fraudulent, on an opinion which need not necessarily be based on any evidence, but which may be the outcome of pure conjecture.  Although there is, very properly, an appeal provided to the Special Commissioners&mdash; with, as I read it, appropriate further appeals to the courts&mdash;there is an objection to the Revenue Commissioners being able, on mere conjecture, to brand an operation as one to which this section applies and to throw the onus of discharging an imputation of fraud on the owners or managers of a company.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for a moment that general and, possibly, rather theoretical objection, I would like to point out that whereas it may have been necessary in England to make some provision like that, where they had no similar provision already in existence, it is unnecessary to do so in Ireland.  In Ireland we had, and have at the present time, the provisions of the <Col N="1484" /> Finance Act of 1920, Section 55&mdash;an Act which has been repealed in England. These provisions existed before this section was drafted in Ireland, and are summarised at the side of that Section 55 as &ldquo;Returns for the purpose of Part V and penalty for fictitious transactions&rdquo;.  The section provides that a company shall not, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of corporation profits tax, enter into or carry out any fictitious or artificial transaction, and provides that, if any company acts in contravention of this provision, the company and, in the case of a foreign company, the agent, manager, factor, or other representative of the company, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in the section with the same end in view.  I do not wish to read them at length to the House.  I suggest that, when Section 15 of the present Bill was being drafted, it may have been overlooked that there were in existence in Ireland stringent provisions which had no equivalent in England, and that we adopted the English section, forgetting that we had kept alive a section which had been repealed in England.  If it should be the view of the Minister for Finance that the present section is better than the earlier section in the Act of 1920, I suggest that the earlier Section 55 be repealed, in order to prevent overlapping or confusion by the existence of both sections.</P>
    <P>These are the only matters to which, in complete humility, I would call the Minister's attention.  No doubt, many of them have been observed and I am sure there are answers to them, but I am far from satisfied, with regard to Section 14, that the form of the draftsmanship will not cause a great deal of office trouble which could be avoided.</P>

      <P>The Seanad is aware that the Emergency Powers Act lapses automatically on September 2nd, and that it is necessary to have continuing legislation in order to preserve these powers for the Executive.  The purpose of the present Bill is simply to continue the powers for a further period of a year, until September 2nd, 1945.  There are also, of course, the usual sections in the Bill, that there can be an earlier period, if Parliament or the Government so determines, when the powers can be withdrawn.

      <P>I do not intend to make any exposition on this Bill now.  I only wish to guard myself against the suggestion that by remaining silent I might necessarily be taken as approving of it.  I recognise that at the passing of the original Act there was a good case to be made for powers almost as stringent as those enacted, and I also recognise that there is a good and valid case to be made for continuing many of the powers, especially in regard to the Department of Supplies, with facilities for dealing with matters swiftly instead of by what, I suppose, is a rather complicated process of legislation. These are facilities which I can conceive it to be still absolutely necessary that the Minister for Supplies should have.  But I think the time has come when the original Emergency Powers Act should be revised and a good deal of its stringency modified, and that we should have a new Act more suited to present conditions, which, this House will appreciate, are not the conditions which prevailed when we all expected that, at any moment, we might be flung into the dangers of war.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to reply to the statement of Senator Kingsmill Moore.  I think it would be a great mistake to imagine that everything is just as <Col N="1486" /> normal as was suggested by the Senator.  It is far from it.  If these powers were withdrawn for a short time we would begin to find out that it is not the Department of Supplies alone that is concerned but every other Department as well.  As a matter of fact, looking to the future, I think we are going to face, from certain points of view, probably what is the most critical period.  It would be the greatest mistake to imagine that we have come out of the wood.  That would be a great mistake.  All our actions should be taken, and all preparations should be made on the basis that we have a very severe period still to pass through.  If we were called upon to do so I think we could make just as good a case for the continuance of these powers as was made when the first Bill was passed. There is a change in the weight in certain directions, but the difficulties, taking them all in all, and the position are just as serious, and will continue to be so until this war is definitely ended, and perhaps will continue for a further period&mdash;perhaps more so.  Therefore, I think it would be a great mistake not to ask for these powers.  That is the reason I am asking for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I proceed to deal with our general financial position, I should like to refer to a matter which I brought up on two previous occasions and with which the House may be familiar.  I refer to the raising of revenue by the licensing of betting-shops.  I think that these betting-shops are a grave, social evil. One has only to be near them, if only by accident, as I have sometimes been, and see the type of people that frequents <Col N="1487" /> them in order to realise this. They are a temptation to men on a low income basis to hazard money which should be spent on their homes. They are a temptation to workmen who, on their rounds, may drop into them in their employers' time.  They are a real, social evil in which the State should have neither lot nor part. When I brought up this matter before, the Minister, in his charming and disarming way, said: &ldquo;You cannot have one law for the rich and another law for the poor; every man must be permitted to have a flutter if he likes.&rdquo;  That may be theoretically right but you have to relate it to fact and circumstance.  It is one thing for a man who is well off to risk a small portion of his surplus income in credit betting or betting on the course.  It is quite another thing to have this constant temptation round the corner, with all the evils with which it is associated.  I do think that the Government is undertaking a great responsibility in remaining a party to what I would go so far as to describe as a vicious type of traffic.  I hope that the Government will see fit to reconsider its attitude towards these places.</P>
      <P>With regard to our finances generally, the Minister has taken&mdash;perhaps rightly&mdash;considerable credit for their buoyant state.  He said that we have been fortunate in that, for a second or third time, we have been able to present a Budget which imposes no fresh taxation.  I do not agree with that.  I hope to show the House that there is implicit in this Budget a very serious measure of hidden taxation.  I refer to the increased revenue which has come from income-tax and corporation profits tax.  Taxes from these sources are in a totally different category from revenue from customs.  Revenue from customs is on a quantitative basis and represents tax on an increased quantity of goods.  The other is revenue from increased profits from either manufacture or distribution&mdash;I do not know which and, for my purpose, it does not matter which.  There has been no substantially increased quantity of goods for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know of the scarcity which <Col N="1488" /> exists and it is, therefore, not necessary to show that there is no increase in the quantity of goods being sold. That increased hidden taxation falls largely on the very poor.  Take an increase of £1,000,000 in income-tax which, for the purpose of my argument, I must assume comes mainly from increased profits from manufacture or distribution.  I do not think that there has been any substantial increase in dividends.  Dividends have been fixed.  No increase has been allowed and there has been no substantial increase in foreign dividends. £1,000,000 in taxation represents about £2,500,000 profits.  That is a matter of simple arithmetic.  My argument is borne out further by the fact that the increase in income-tax is also reflected in corporation profits tax.  There has been an increase in both those categories of taxation.  If the increase had not affected corporation profits tax, it might be argued that it was not due to industrial profits but to profits on private investments.  Inasmuch as this increase is reflected both in income-tax and corporation profits tax, I claim to be justified in the argument that it is derived from increased profits on the sale of goods that are scarce. I claim further that that has been a hidden tax mainly on the very poor. In so far as it has represented an increase in prices and profits on a limited quantity of goods, it has been a distinctly inflationary element in our national finances.</P>
    <P>There is this also to be borne in mind.  When you say: &ldquo;Surely, with so much taken by the State in the way of taxation on increased profits, there is no inducement for any trader unduly to put up prices,&rdquo; I could argue this way: &ldquo;The less you leave him, the more he wants to get what he considers he should have.  If you allowed him all his profits, he would be satisfied with a comparatively small increased profit; if you take half of it, he might say, &lsquo;In order to get what I want, I must charge twice as much&rsquo;; if you take three quarters, as you roughly do, he will say, &lsquo;I must have so much more&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I think there has been a distinct tendency&mdash;I use the words advisedly&mdash;to profiteer out of the prevailing scarcity.  I think that is <Col N="1489" /> reflected in the increased revenue from corporation profits tax and from income-tax, which represents a hidden tax.</P>
    <P>I pass to the question which is bound up in our general financial position, and that is the question of the cost of living.  Senator Hayes dwelt upon the plight of certain people, the small salaried classes and those having fixed incomes in the ranges up to £700 or £800 a year.  I think they deserve the very greatest sympathy, in view of the increased cost of living. But when Senator Hayes suggests that the Minister should consider increasing the incomes of those people to meet the increased cost of living I say &ldquo;No, that is the wrong end at which to begin.&rdquo;  The Minister should aim at reducing the cost of living, and it is in respect of our rapidly rising cost of living that I feel the Government are most to blame in their financial policy.</P>
    <P>When we come to examine the figures, what do we find?  We find that since 1914 the cost of living in Éire has risen from 100 to 296&mdash;that is our present figure&mdash;whereas the corresponding figure for the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland is 199.  That means that we are now standing, roughly, within three points of being 100 points higher than the corresponding figure in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Nobody can say that we are a richer country.  We have not got the benefit of higher wages, and I feel in agreement with Senator Foran that labourers in this country have been extremely restrained in their attitude towards that position, and the small amount of industrial unrest we have had in the last two or three years has been extraordinary.  I feel that the cost of living must be pressing very hard on the working classes and on the small fixed-income classes as well, and any bonuses that have been given to meet this increased cost have been in no way commensurate with the rise in the cost itself.</P>
    <P>This question of the increased cost of living was dealt with at some length in the Dáil on the Vote on Account in March last and, according to the report of the debates there, I <Col N="1490" /> observed that the Minister gave certain figures which, he said, came from the bulletin of statistics issued by the League of Nations.  I have been unable to reconcile these figures, which are correctly taken from the bulletin, with the actual figures given in the publication of the Currency Commission, which are the official figures for this country.  The Minister gave the figure for the cost of living as 157 in November, 1943; that is, 57 points over the pre-war figure.  The statistics issued by the Currency Commission show that the figure is 218.  I cannot reconcile these figures, and perhaps the Minister will give us some explanation.</P>
    <P>Generally, I feel that the cost of living is a burden on large masses of our citizens and I feel constrained to quote from an article written in the <i>Irish Times,</i> last December, by Professor Busteed.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The plain truth is that for those with money life is far better in Eire than in Great Britain, while for those with lower incomes living is more secure and so much cheaper in Great Britain than in Eire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that represents the facts.  The Minister should tell the House why no serious attempt has been made to stabilise the cost of living.  We know, of course, those figures in England are the result of subsidies.  In Australia the cost of living is even lower than in Great Britain, and the position in Canada is somewhat similar.  If it has been possible in those three countries&mdash; Canada, Australia and Great Britain&mdash; to stabilise the cost of living, why has it not been done here?  Have the Government ever seriously addressed themselves to this matter?  I cannot help feeling they have not tried.  It is felt that the Government could stem this inflation merely by stabilising the cost of living by a standstill Order, but it never has attempted seriously to do so. I cannot see why, if it has been done in Canada and Australia, it could not have been done here.  I would far rather see the £2,500,000 of increased profits used in the form of subsidies to reduce the cost of living than to be taken into the general taxation.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter dealt with agricultural <Col N="1491" /> production and he made what sounded to me an astonishing statement. He did not give any very convincing data for it.  He said that gross production in agriculture has diminished in the last year.  That surprises me.  He quoted from certain research work on some dairy farms in West Cork, but that did not justify me in drawing the conclusion&mdash;I may not have heard him correctly&mdash;that the gross production of agriculture had diminished.  I would agree with him if he meant to convey that the yield per acre had diminished.  I think it has, owing to lack of fertilisers; but surely the gross production has not diminished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at it. I accept the Senator's statement. Senator Counihan dealt with the question of taxation of the farmer.  I think we have to be honest in this matter. We cannot deny that the farmer is very favourably situated in respect of taxation.  It would be quite possible &mdash;I do not say a case in point exists&mdash; but it would be quite possible for a farmer to make several thousands and to be taxed on, say, the same number of hundreds, because the farmer is taxed solely on the basis of Schedule A and Schedule B valuation: I do not say <Col N="1492" /> that as a policy it may not be right.  I think farmers, who are primary producers, deserve very special consideration, but I cannot agree with Senator Counihan when he says that farmers pay full tax on their profits.  They do not.  They pay a tax on an arbitrary basis which frequently represents far less than their profits.  I cannot agree with Senator Counihan that they do not come under Schedule D on account of the difficulty of making out the returns. Obviously, to come under Schedule D now would be to pay on profits which are probably much higher than the basis of tax.  They do not come under Schedule D on that account, but they are always in a position when they lose to supply the information that would bring them under Schedule D.  All these troublesome forms the Senator referred to are very readily made out when it comes to providing a loss, but they are much more difficult, perhaps, to make out when it comes to revealing a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be giving the show away, but I know all about it. While I am very grateful for being able to pay taxation on a lower basis than what I actually earn&mdash;only temporarily, of course, since the emergency&mdash;I think we ought to recognise the fact that the farmer is in a very fortunate position with regard to his taxation and compares very favourably, naturally, with the farmers across the water who are now taxed under Schedule D.  I think a matter of great importance, now that we get an opportunity of reviewing our financial position on broad lines, is the future.  I must say I am concerned that in a democratic country we are given no guide whatever as to what is in the mind of the Government with regard to our post-war policy.  I suppose some Senators will smile when I say that I am not wedded automatically to British methods; I am not necessarily following them whether they are right or wrong; but I do say in the case of post-war plans and developments a very admirable method has been adopted, as suited to a democratic <Col N="1493" /> country.  In England they have given Parliament in advance a number of White Papers to get people thinking. There is a White Paper on medical services.  Senator Foran referred to our hospital system.  I agree with him.  I think our hospital system requires to be recast and, if it is going to be recast, I think we should have some indication of the nature of the proposals which the Government think would be suitable&mdash; not necessarily to be applied literally, but to be the basis of thought, discussion, and subsequent legislation.  I think we should have the same with regard to education.  On this subject, the White Paper issued in England was most interesting.  I think many Senators read it although it did not immediately concern this country.  I certainly read it.  We should have the same with regard to post-war employment.</P>
      <P>I was interested to see that although the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not given us any indication, except in very general terms, with regard to the Government's intentions, he did recommend us all to study the British White Paper on future employment. I think it would be rather more suitable if we had a White Paper of our own dealing with that problem as suited to our own case.  The only way, in my opinion, in a democracy is to give in advance, in good time, an outline of the problem to be considered, so that there can be a certain amount of preliminary discussion and understanding before the matter is discussed in Parliament.  As it is now, one knows nothing whatever about what is going to happen until one gets a printed Bill, to which the Government is, necessarily, more or less committed.  It is easy to say that these Bills can be amended, but in practice we know how difficult it is, once a Government Bill is printed, to get amendments; whereas if there could be a previous Paper, and probably a resolution or a debate on the subject, the Government might see fit to embody in the Bill suggestions obtained in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave this section of the subject, I should like to emphasise that when the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1494" /> Commerce recommended a study of the British White Paper, and did in general terms outline what our post-war schemes are going to be, there was not one single mention of the consumer.  I do feel that, all through, the consumer, largely because he is unorganised, is the last person to whom anybody gives serious consideration.  You see that everywhere.  In all trade associations and combines, the consumer is the person who is least considered, largely, of course, because he is not politically organised.  It is very difficult to organise consumers and to make them a force in political life.</P>
    <P>I feel that we should have a serious stocktaking for the future, and I am concerned as to the proposals, general and rather vague as they are, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has forecast.  I have deliberately abstained from dwelling on and criticising, as I have from time to time, our industrial policy, but I am really rather heartened now to find that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is getting somewhat anxious about our industrial policy, and that matters which years ago were on the threshold of that policy, and were pointed out to him as dangerous, have now apparently taken possession of his mind and have been expressed by him in statements.  For instance, speaking in the Dáil on the 12th June&mdash;Dáil Debates, vol. 94, col. 434&mdash;he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are obvious dangers of inefficiency in such circumstances as exist in this country, where there is only a limited home market and, consequently, conditions in which efficient production in many industrial spheres can only be undertaken by single firms or a limited number of firms.  The absence of effective internal competition, and the curtailment of external competition by means of tariffs and other such restrictions, tend to promote inefficiency unless there are in the possession of the Government powers to insist that technical developments that have taken place in other countries are adopted here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is where I feel puzzled.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1495" /> indicates that, if he has powers, he is in a position to bring about efficiency in industry.  I do not think he will ever do that.  I feel that the powers of those in charge of industry are so strong that it would never be possible, without undue and harassing restriction, which would make the cure worse than the disease, ever to insist upon efficiency by outside legislation.</P>
    <P>I am seriously alarmed at the extended range of industries that are considered suitable to a high tariff policy.  Although I am at heart and have never ceased to be a free trader, I admit that you have to move with the times, that you have to modify your doctrine to suit the times.  I would not for one moment suggest that we should go back to unrestricted free trade at present although, if it were possible to make an experiment, I should like, say, to erect a tariff barrier from which the County Cork would be excluded and then let the rest of Ireland gnash their teeth with envy at the prosperity of the County Cork, if allowed to have free trade.  That, of course, is a purely academic consideration. But there are certain industries suitable to a tariff policy within limits, industries which largely draw their raw material from the country. There are other industries which are largely based upon our primary products that should not require a tariff at all; with efficiency, they should be able to stand on their own feet.  But, when I come to the other extreme and see certain industries, which have neither their fuel nor their raw material produced in the country, given a high tariff, I really am deeply anxious about the future.</P>
    <P>Take the case of steel.  I may be wrong, but I do not see how we can ever hope to produce steel, which is the normal raw material of the building and a number of other industries, at anything approaching the price at which it can be produced on the Continent or in Great Britain.  I am afraid we shall see the time come, if this policy with regard to steel be continued, when we may have to pay for our steel as much as £10 or £15 per ton more than we would have to pay if we <Col N="1496" /> got the steel from Belgium.  The Minister may say that Parliament accepted the principle of higher prices in the interests of our industrial policy.  Let us examine that for one moment.  I do not think anybody can claim that there is any virtue in being industrial simply to be able to say you are industrial. The only virtue industry can claim is in giving benefit to the masses of the citizens or promoting a large measure of employment.  Can these tests be complied with?  We know that the price level, which was running a few points over the English price level in 1922, has got gradually further and further away from it.  Before the war broke out, I think it was 20 points over the English level, having been, in 1922, only 14 points.  Therefore, the tariff policy cannot have been justified by any benefit in price which it gave to the consumer.</P>
    <P>But, it will be said, look at the employment given.  I have been at pains to take out the figures for employment. What is the increase in employment in our manufacturing industries?  You cannot take building as an example, it is not in any way affected by tariffs, except adversely.  Neither can you take transport.  Merely in transportable goods, the employment has risen here by 50 per cent., that is from 64,000 in 1929, to 101,000 in 1940.  That means that it has risen by 37,000 over the very extended period of our industrialisation. That would only amount to about 2 per cent. of the total population. Is the game worth the candle? Has an increase in employment of 37,000 been justified in the increased cost to the general consumer?  I doubt it.  It does not do to say that it is a great thing to be in industry.  Certainly, it is very nice to be in industry, but it has to be justified by the benefits that it can give.</P>
    <P>I am frankly alarmed at the position. I have always been a conservative and a capitalist, for this reason, that capital, if properly worked, did benefit the consumer in this way.  There was an abundance.  There was an abundance of goods.  Capital is always seeking to make a profit.  But it can only make a profit by giving service, <Col N="1497" /> and the competition amongst capitalists was what benefited the consumer. But, when we get a small number of capitalists entrenched behind high tariffs, those conditions do not apply, and we are up against all the real dangers of entrenched capital, with a tendency to have regard to profits which are readily obtained in preference to the consumers' interests. I do not feel, as a capitalist, that the proper protection afforded by capital applies in this country at all.  At present, when looking at it, I feel that I really would prefer to see a move further towards socialism.  I do not say that it persuades me to be a socialist, because I do not understand what socialism is.  But I do understand what capitalism is, and I think it is not working as it should work in this country.  I think we will have to have more and more restriction, which no one likes, until the wheel comes full circle and we return once again to something like free trade and free enterprise.  That is my present anxiety.  In this economic isolation on which we have embarked for some years and from which I can see no appreciable benefit, and which the Minister is going to intensify further, I feel rather gloomy about the future of our industrial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point about which I should like to inquire in connection with Section 4 of this Bill, which concerns the question of the relation between this Bill and the Children's Allowances Act which was passed during the year.  I understand that some adjustment has been made in this Bill as it originally stood which has the effect that income-tax payers are no longer to be made to lose through the operation of the Children's Allowances Act.  I believe that an amendment was made in the Dáil which brings about an equalisation of the two allowances.  The question I wanted to raise was this, and it is one to which I have never been able to get a satisfactory answer. What is the object in compelling those who have been getting an allowance in income-tax for children to apply for the children's allowance if they are to continue to get these remissions? <Col N="1498" /> Whereas, formerly, if a man had more than two children, he got a certain allowance for them in his income-tax, now if he wants to get an allowance for any child above the second, he has to go to the Post Office and get forms, he has to get doctor's certificates and he has to go to the registrar, and, in the end, he gets the allowance he formerly got, or what is practically equivalent to it by way of a dole from the State.  Formerly he was given a remission in his tax; that is to say, he was not asked to pay more than a certain amount of his own money to the State.  Now he is getting back by way of a dole an amount equivalent to what he formerly got by way of remission in taxation.  To me, there is a very important principle involved in all that which may become more obvious when the Children's Allowances Act works itself out.  It is a question of principle &mdash;the principle of the distinction between the remission of taxation and having to accept a dole.  I think it was Senator Hayes who pointed out to-day that, as a result of various measures, larger and larger numbers of our people are becoming State dependents. The Children's Allowances Act purports to make State dependents of people with more than two children; people who, formerly, in respect of their children got a remission of income-tax.  Actually, the effect of the Act is to make such people dependents of the State to the extent of a half-a-crown a week for each child, after the first two children.  It means, in effect, forcing people to go &ldquo;on the dole&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that some Senators will not agree with me.  Some Senators, I suppose, will think that I have two heads on me for putting forward my personal approach to such matters; but I must say that, personally, I object to being made the object of a State dole. I do not want, and I am not in need of, a half-a-crown a week; nor do I want to have to go to the post office, fill up innumerable forms, in order to get that half-a-crown a week.  I certainly am prepared to accept a remission of taxation on the understanding that that remission is in respect of my own money, and that I am not receiving it at the expense of other people.  The only objection I have to <Col N="1499" /> this proposal is on the question of principle. I do object to having an income-tax remission turned into what I can only describe as a beggarly dole, and forcing all of us who do not want that subsidy, or are in no need of it, to accept that dole.</P>

      <P>It may be, but I say that if we should arrive at that condition we shall be a slave State. I do not see why those who, up to now, have been getting a remission of income-tax for their children, should be forced into accepting a dole.  I am referring, of course, to people with certain incomes, and not to those who do not come under the income-tax code; but I do not see why the people to whom I am referring should not be given this remission, as they have been in the past, in respect of the children, instead of being forced into the acceptance of a dole.  I cannot see what objection there should be, and it appears to me that the result of this proposal will be that income-tax payers will now be forced to take this remission, to which they were entitled, in the form of a dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that there may be some administrative difficulties in connection <Col N="1500" /> with the matter, but I do not think there should be any administrative difficulties.  As far as I can see, the only difficulty is to see that people should not be getting relief in both ways; that they should not be getting a remission under the income-tax code and also getting an allowance under the Children's Allowances Act.  It should not be very difficult, in my opinion, to prevent any such thing happening, but the only thing involved here, so far as I am concerned, is the principle of the matter.  As far as I can see, it would seem to be the policy of the State that all of us should be recipients of a dole, and that that is something to be desired.</P>
    <P>It appears to me to be a principle of the State that we shall all be subject to the receipt of a dole.  Now, I regard that as a very dangerous principle. It may be said that there is only a half-a-crown a week per child involved here, but I feel that if we are to give way to this, the principle will go on until we shall all be in receipt of State assistance, which would mean that we would become a slave State, and I do not believe that Senator Foran would like to see us become a slave State, any more than I should like it.</P>

Mar dúirt sé, ag caint dó inniu, go bhfuil timpeall trian den chostas mór seo nach mbeidh call leis nuair a bheas an ócáid phráinne thart.  Tá timpeall chúig milliúin déag sa mbliain á íoc againn de bharr na hócáide práinne&mdash; is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil síocháin agus suaimhneas á gcur ar fáil againn ar an méid sin airgid.  Dá gcuirtí an cheist ar mhuintir na tíre i mbárach faoi, d'amhdóidís go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta agus á déanamh dóibh ag an Rialtas ar an airgead sin.</P>

      <Col N="1501" /> Is fíor don tSeanadóir O hAodha go bhfuil aicmí sa tír seo atá i gcruachás, múinteoirí, lucht tuarastail go generálta, lucht pinsean agus a leithéidí. Tá a lán acu a cheannaigh a dtithe, tá an t-árachas le híoc acu agus costais eile nach féidir dóibh a sheachaint.  Is fíor go bhfuil aicmí ann a bhfuil an bhróg ag luighe go trom orthu.  Ach sin ceist mhór atá le réiteach againn, cén chaoi is féidir linn an mhístáid sin a leigheas go hiomlán.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhór déanta cheana.  Tá suas le £10,000,000 á íoc cheana leis an gcostas maireachtála a choinneáil síos. Cé mhéad eile is féidir dúinn íoc ar an mbealach sin?</P>
    <P>Bhí an Seanadóir O Catháin ag iarraidh comparáid a dhéanamh idir Éire agus Sasana maidir leis an scéal seo.  Níl fhios ag an Seanadóir cén chaoi ar éirigh le Sasana agus le Canada an costas maireachtála a choinneáil síos.  Ba chóir go mbeadh a fhios aige agus ba chóir a fhios a bheith aige cé mhéad a chosnódh an costas maireachtála a isliú in Éirinn go dtí leibhéal Shasana.  Agus rud eile, ba chóir eolas a bheith aige nach mar a chéile an caighdeán maireachtála annseo agus i Sasana.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt, ag an Seanadóir O Fuaráin creidim, do lucht oibre agus chomh foighdeach agus tá siad le linn na hócáide práinne.  Tá mé cinnte nach mian leis an Seanadóir go mbeadh easaontas ann.  Ach ba mhaith liom a rá gurb é foighid na n-oibrithe le blianta ceann de na gnéithe is sásúla i gcóras sóisealta, na tíre seo le blianta anuas.  Is maith liom chomh maith agus tá ag éirí leis na Ceárdbhóird Chomhairlitheacha le difríochta idir oibrithe agus máistrí a réiteach. Chomh fada agus is eolas dom, bíonn na hoibrithe sásta leis na teachtaí a bhíos acu ar na bóird seo agus tá siad sásta go ndéanann na máistrí a ndícheal dóibh chomh maith.  Rinneadh tagairt go minic don ghá atá le pleanáil.  Tá rud amháin a bhfuil mé féin sásta go maith leis agus is é an rud é sin an clár de scéimeanna móra táirgiúla atá beartuithe ag an Rialtas.  Ní gá dhom na scéimeanna sin a lua&mdash;tá a fhios ag Seanadóirí go <Col N="1502" /> maith iad cheana.  Is é an locht a fáightear ar an Rialtas nach nochtann siad mion-eolas i dtaobh na scéimeanna seo láithreach.  Ní fheicim gur féidir sin a dhéanamh; is féidir scéim a nochtú go generálta ach is le himeacht aimsire amháin a beifear i ndon na sonnraí a léiriú.  Agus déanfar sin chomh luath agus is féidir.  Tá sompla de againn cheana.  Atheagrú na mBóthar Iarainn, sin ceann acu agus is é an Bille Iompair atá anois os cóir na Dála an mion-innseacht nó mioneolas ar an scéim sin.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a bhí i gceist go mór é scéal na talmhaíochta.  Bhí caint ar Réabhlóid ina thaobh!  Cén sórt réabhlóide atá i gceist?  Cé dhéanfas an réabhlóid? Is cinnte go bhfuil a gcion déanta ag an Rialtas&mdash;an oiread agus is féidir do rialtas a dhéanamh.  Tá fhios agaibh féin na scéimeanna uile atá ann chun feabhas a chur ar fheilmeacha agus ar fheilméaracht.</P>
    <P>Nach léir gurb é an feilméar féin a chaithfeas an chuid eile a dhéanamh&mdash; nó an chuid is mó de ar aon nós.  Sé ceann de na rudaí is mó atá ag teastáil anois go ndeánfa na talmhaithe beart de réir an teagaisc agus de réir an tsompla atá tugtha ag an Roinn Talmhaídheachta. Ar deireadh thiar, is folas gur ceist oideachais í sin, go dtí go mbí an talmhaí níos oilte ar eolaíocht agus ealadhain a ghnótha, is doiligh bheith ag súil le morán eile feabhais i gcúrsaí táirgeachta sa talmhaíocht.  Ní leor do dhaoine bheith ag casaoid i dtaobh na talmhaíochta&mdash;ba chóir doibh iarracht a dhéanamh roinnt molta réasúnach a chur ós ar gcomhair 'na taobh.</P>
    <P>Ní bhfuair an tAire mórán cabhrach uainn tráthnóna.  Ní bhfuair sé aon chabhair uaimse ach an oiread ach admhaím go bhfuil mé sásta go bhfuil a gcion á dhéanamh go maith ag an Rialtas go mhór-mhór nuair a chuimhnímid ar an saol atá ann.  An t-airgead mór seo atá siad a iarraidh, caithfe siad é ar bhealach a bheas go maith foghainteach don tír.  Má chreideann daoine nach fíor sin, ba chóir go bhféadfaidís féin a theasbáint cá bhfuil an locht agus cén chaoi a bhféadfaí é a chaitheamh níos fearr.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House very long.  The <i>pros</i><Col N="1503" /> and <i>cons</i> of the question have been pretty well debated, but I must confess that as a result of the debate I am in a state of comparative bewilderment, as so many conflicting voices were heard.  We had Senator Keane saying that the farmers are fairly prosperous &mdash;and who should know better?&mdash;but then we had Senator Baxter controverting that specific statement.  I should be very sorry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I remember the Senator's speech, it was a typical and very excellent jeremiad indeed. Both are agreed on one thing: they slate the Government pretty hard and, for my part, I think the speeches of Senators on the opposite side, while excellent in tenor and exceptionally correct in manner, were vitiated to a very great extent by a latent hostility to the Government.  That may seem a rather hard thing to say, but I must say what is in my mind.  One would really imagine that the present Government, who have gone to the country on a great many occasions &mdash;on a great many occasions from the point of view of political crises&mdash;had not received in full measure the confidence of the country.  That is the impression one would get from the tenor of the speeches.  They were one long jeremiad and one long paean of diatribe, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes complained of wages having been clamped down.  I could not help thinking of certain measures passed by Senator Hayes's Government, in the days when money was very plentiful, under which they clamped down on certain poor units of the community; but he did not advert to that on this occasion.  I suppose that &ldquo;what in the captain is a choleric word in the private is rank blasphemy.&rdquo;  I should like to know from Senator Sir John Keane if he, as a capitalist, is prepared to forgo the profits of capitalism merely <Col N="1504" /> for the present emergency, or is it out of pity for the marvellous patience of the proletariat.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what ideal actuates him on the present occasion. He has commented very favourably on Senator Foran and his colleagues.  If I were in Senator Foran's shoes, I think I should have to say: <i>Non tali auxilio</i> on this occasion at any rate. One hesitates to use the <i>tu quoque</i> argument, but the temptation is irresistible.  Senator Sir John Keane has inveighed against the miseries of the poor and the evils of capitalism.  I seem to recollect that, in the last two or three years, some of his employees had to threaten to strike in order to obtain the wages which they thought necessary for existence, but perhaps I am mistaken.  Perhaps it is only an illusion of mine.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes spoke of the cost of living in the town and country being rather anomalous.  He spoke of schools, declining marriage rates, tourists and roads.  It is true that we are catering for the tourist, and that we must do so because the industry is a decided asset, but why catering for tourist associations and providing good roads should be incompatible with other things, I do not know.  Both tend to increase the circulation of money, and both call for conditions of employment which are ideal in their way, and I fail to see why fostering the Irish Tourist Association and making good roads should in any way militate against other beneficial schemes.  The two are by no means incompatible.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran spoke of a nationalised hospital scheme.  Nationalisation is an excellent thing, if not carried too far, but, like the farmer's parlous plight, nationalisation seems to be a sort of King Charles's head with the Labour Party.  I do not know whether nationalisation, if carried to its extreme, to its logical conclusion, would be a good thing for this country or not, but I think the salvation of this country depends on a judicious compromise between nationalisation and its opposite extreme.  From that poing of view, I think that nationalisation as a policy would not be tolerated by the people <Col N="1505" /> of this country very long, and never will be.  Even the slight advances towards nationalisation which have been made have sometimes met, if not altogether with a rebuff, with suspicion. With regard to Senator Foran's advocacy on behalf of other sections, I should like to know: Had we or had we not an election, and what did the people say?  Propaganda, innuendo and obloquy all played their part in that election, and the people returned a very decisive verdict.</P>
    <P>One would think from the tone of the speeches of Senators on the opposite benches that the Government had failed the country in some considerable degree, that they had been false to their trust, that they had let down the people on every possible occasion. We have had the usual jeremiads about the farmer.  I do not claim to be a star farmer, but I move amongst the best farmers in Ireland, and these farmers of County Wexford, amongst whom I had the privilege of being reared, declared themselves very emphatically at the last election, when they put the Minister for Agriculture at the head of the poll, and I think their action can scarcely be regarded as indicating a want of confidence in the Government. They are, it is true, only a microcosm of Ireland, but I think that, as a microcosm, they have more than done their bit in the agricultural sphere, and their view was worthy of attention.  But who would think that from the tone of the debate to-day?  It makes me absolutely tired.</P>
    <P>We know the saying &ldquo;Throw dirt and some will stick&rdquo; is supposed to be a lawyer-like phrase.  I do not suggest that is accurate, but it is, in any case, a popular phrase.  In all the speeches made to-day, one would think that the good deeds of the Government, which, after all, has been in existence since 1932 and which must have done something tangible to rivet, if I might use the expression, the populace to it, would have been adverted to, commented on and made much of.  We have talk about the farmers, but we know what the farmers suffered under the previous régime.  It may have been inevitable&mdash;I do not blame that régime for it&mdash;but the fact remains.  Senator <Col N="1506" /> Counihan must know as well as I that nothing paid&mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry or tillage&mdash;in the unfortunate years gone by when we existed under another Government; and to be told at this stage that this Government have not backed up the farmers and not backed up the industrialists is really taxing one's credulity to a degree which is positively incredible.</P>
    <P>We all remember when men had to go hat in hand to the miller and beg him to take their barley off their hands and when men had to go home with 10/- a barrel for barley and 7/- a barrel for oats&mdash;with anything they were offered. This Government removed all that.  No doubt it was done by means of subsidies, but even Senator Sir John Keane has hinted that subsidies are not bad.  He does not like them, but they are not bad at times.  That, in itself, is evidence of a slight conversion. We hear about free trade but everyone knows that we cannot get back to the old vicious free trade circle.  Much as certain sections in the country would like to do so, we know that we cannot possibly do so&mdash;certainly not while the emergency lasts and for a great many years after.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to produce a planned policy.  I think all this &ldquo;planned policy&rdquo; phrase is more or less a platitude given expression to here and there to cover a certain vacuity of thinking.  I think it is good enough to live for the day and to escape the perils of the day, and we should be very thankful to those who, under Providence, have guided us so far.  Planned thinking, planned economy and all such platitudinous phrases have been worked to death. Let us try to make the most of what we have.  Let us work as hard as we can and not for ever be depending on this or any other Government to do the work which we ought to do ourselves. Let us, in God's name, get back to the old policy of self-reliance.</P>
    <P>I am entirely at one with Senator Tierney in what he said about the half-crown and income-tax.  Personally, I think that the half-crown has done a good deal to demoralise some of our people.  Someone reprimanded Senator Tierney when he spoke of <Col N="1507" /> dignity; someone said he was &ldquo;standing on his dignity&rdquo;.  Properly used, I think it is a good foundation.  The old Irish dignity and spirit which we heard so much of are rapidly dying.  It would be a very good thing if we could get back to that dignity.</P>
    <P>I am heartily in agreement with the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am heartily in disagreement with those who say, or who hint and would like it to be thought, that the farmer to-day is not as well off as he was eight or nine years ago.  If he is not, prosperity must be a very fallacious thing.  I go around the country; I keep my eyes open and I see what goes on.  I see money spent like wild-fire.  I say: &ldquo;More power to them.&rdquo;  They could not spend it unless they had earned it. How are they earning it?  Out of the fruits of the earth.  Who made it possible for them to earn that money out of the fruits of the earth but the present Government?  Call them what you like&mdash;the Government which happens to be in power at the present time made it possible for the farmer to live for the first time on his own land.  The economic war has been thrown in our teeth.  What in the name of goodness would Senator Counihan do if there had been no economic war?  He would have nothing to think about&mdash;an unthinkable predicament.  The economic war was necessary in order to assert ourselves.  It was absolutely necessary, and if it cost something in certain ways it at least enabled us to reassert our self-respect.  I wish Senators on the opposite benches would not be forever indulging in jeremiads, but would admit, at least occasionally, inferentially or otherwise, that the Government of the day has done a good thing in keeping the State on its feet in the crisis which has intervened since 1939. We have passed through perilous times and, everything considered, I think we have not done too badly, and that the farmers are more prosperous than they were seven or eight years ago.  Certainly they are not too prosperous now &mdash;I would be the last in the world to claim that&mdash;but it cannot be denied by anybody with a grain of commonsense that they are more prosperous than they were.  Senator Sir John Keane <Col N="1508" /> says they are, and I think, from a certain point of view, there is no man who should better know how the farmers have reacted to the conditions in the last four years.  Senator Baxter, on the other hand, would prefer it to be thought that they are not quite so well off.</P>

      <P>Production may be going down, but it is extraordinary that capital and wages and general conditions and standards of living are going up. If the standard of living is going up, if the farmers and the farmers' sons have more money to spend now than they had seven or eight years ago, it is indicative of a certain prosperity anyhow, and to whom or to what is that prosperity to be attributed except to the fact that agriculture has found its feet, and if agriculture has found its feet who helped them to do it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Who made the world? Well, I will tell you a little story.  If they did not make the world, they certainly made history.  A little boy was asked by the parson in an English vicarage: &ldquo;Who made the world?&rdquo;  He got all flustered, and said: &ldquo;Please, sir, it wasn't me.&rdquo;  When that was told to the local squire he slapped his thigh and said: &ldquo;And I believed the little beggar had done it all the time.&rdquo;  That is my answer to Senator Baxter.  We claim no extravagant achievement for the Government of the day, but certainly the lot of the farmer has been improved in the last seven or eight years.  That, I think, cannot be denied by anyone who keeps his eyes open.  It cannot be denied by anyone who sees in the towns the throngs of customers from agricultural districts daily purchasing goods; it cannot be denied by anyone who sees the cinemas filled, the football fields filled, and the dance halls filled.  Those things are not got on credit.  They are got by solid cash, coin of the realm, &ldquo;rhino&rdquo;&mdash;call it what you like.  They are getting it out of their produce, because it has been <Col N="1509" /> made possible for them to do so by the legislation in the last ten years.  Yet, Opposition Senators tell us that the country, so to speak, is wallowing in poverty, that everything is going down. Jeremiads by the dozen are indulged in by Senators on the opposite benches. Platitudes <i>ad nauseam</i> have been adduced during the last five or six years to prove that the Irish farmer is poorer than he used to be.  Even if he were, if I were on the opposite benches I would not belabour the argument.  It is all very well to use it as a stick to beat the Government.  When it happens to be a rotten stick it is bad enough, but I certainly would not continually demean my own class by indulging in jeremiads to prove that they are poor and miserable.  It is a degrading state of affairs, on all fours with the state of affairs complained of by Senator Tierney when he referred to the system of doles, upon which subject I am in entire agreement with him.</P>

      <P>At least let us get back to our old spirit of self-help and self-reliance which brought the country through many a crisis, instead of always wallowing in the depths of despair.  It is an unthinkable state of affairs that any set of Irishmen should be constantly running down their own country, picturing it as a sort of beggar before the nations, while knowing in their hearts, as we all do, that we occupy an enviable position among the nations.  While we here are debating in a sovereign Assembly, indulging in slaps at our own Government and criticising them from every angle, men are being blasted into eternity on the battlefields of Europe. Yet, we here can find nothing better to do than to make ourselves out a nation of beggars.  We should have risen above that If I have spoken strongly, it is because I feel bitterly coming here year after year and seeing the Irish farmer pictured as a poor distressed man, just as this country was pictured as a poor distressed nation years ago.  We should rise above that complex.  If it cannot be treated pathologically, we should at least endeavour to get back to the old <Col N="1510" /> self-reliant spirit of years ago, instead of looking to the Government for everything.  A man who, years ago, would have mended his own lanes by picking stones off an adjoining field, now says: &ldquo;Is there a grant for it?&rdquo; I will say this: the present Government, by their munificence, have done a certain amount of harm.  The people are looking to them for everything.</P>
      <P>Then, we have people asking for high prices and high wages.  I, for one, believe in high wages, the highest wages possible, if they are not concurrent with high prices.  In all the jeremiads I have heard from the opposite benches I have not heard one constructive suggestion as to what the Government ought to do for the people.  With the civil servants, for instance, or with any other servant who is underpaid, I have every sympathy. A man must be paid adequately, but how is that to be done? When the time comes to impose extra taxation to pay those men, whether they be civil servants, manual labourers or workers in any branch of industry, will our opponents on the opposite benches concur in that taxation? If not, have they any right to complain on the one hand that people are badly paid and on the other hand to grumble about over-taxation.  The two things are contradictory.  There is no sense in that.  This debate concerns giving the Minister power to raise about £47,000,000.  I am sure that, after all this talk on both sides, he will get his £47,000,000.  And all I can say is: Ar aghaidh leis an obair.</P>

      <P>We have all heard of the defect which results from the optical illusion by which people are not able to see the wood for the trees.  I think we all suffer more or less from that defect.  This evening we saw so many trees that we lost sight of the wood.  The wood, to my mind, is the very remarkable fact that, without imposing any additional taxation, the Minister is able to finance the growing cost of the emergency.  He is able to do that without imposing any additional burden on the people.  For that very remarkable result we have, first of all, to thank God for averting from us any of those untoward circumstances which <Col N="1511" /> the Minister had to have in mind when framing last year's Budget, and again which he had to have in mind when introducing this year's Budget.  By the mercy of God we have been spared the horrors of war.  Although we have felt the consequences of this world war, they have been lessened by the forethought of the Government and the consideration they have shown for the poorest of our people.  As I have said, we must, first of all, thank God.  We must also thank the Minister and the Government, as well as the Minister's very clever and thoughtful advisers. They all approached their work in the spirit of doing the best for the people. They had in mind the wants of those who need help most.</P>
      <P>When we examine the Appropriation Bill we find that the biggest sum in the Budget is being appropriated for the maintenance of the Defence Forces. Everyone admits that is necessary.  We also find that big sums are being appropriated for the relief of the poorest of the poor, those on whom the emergency presses hardest.  The old age pensioners are getting relief either in kind by increased voucher provision for butter, milk and bread, or by an increase in their pensions payable in cash.  An additional social service has been provided, whatever our opinions about it may be.  It is at this very apposite moment, when people who are finding it very hard to provide boots and clothes for their children, particularly in the case of large families, that the Minister has thought of their needs, and is making a special grant available for poor people to enable them to provide boots for their children.  All this shows the paternal spirit in which our Government have approached the problem of doing the best for our people.  They have not been able to avert the worst consequences of the war.  That is greatly to be regretted, but it must be said that they have brought thought and a paternal care to bear on present-day problems, thereby making it easier for those on whom the effects of the war press almost to extinction.  That is a thing that we must keep in mind when speaking on the Budget and of the big amount of money that is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> I, like other Senators, see the trees in the wood, but I see the wood, too. There is one tree that the Minister has forgotten, a very deserving class in the community, namely, the old pensioned teachers.  A great many of them retired when the salaries of teachers were not as good as they are to-day. I am not saying that teachers' salaries to-day are good enough.  One of the things which, in my opinion, we must do in our post-war planning is to pay a great deal more attention to education. We will not have a satisfactory educational system unless we have satisfied teachers, and unless we make the teaching profession attractive to the best brains among the young men and women in our country.  The men and women that I speak of retired on very small pensions that certainly need to be supplemented.  My real reason for speaking at this late hour is to ask the Minister, in the kindness of his heart and from a sense of justice, to take into consideration the cases of those retired teachers and give them some redress.</P>

      <P>I would feel tempted to follow Senator Kehoe into some of the arguments he made in the course of his speech but for the fact that he admitted, towards the end of it, that the tendency of the present Government had largely contributed to the feeling amongst the people that it was up to them, on every possible occasion, to drop the policy of self-reliance and get as much as they can in grants or in any other way from the Government. Anybody who has considered the question at all, as well as the recent general election to which reference was made, will realise that one of the schemes to which Senator Kehoe referred was largely responsible for getting a great many votes for the Government in that election, even though the Children's Allowances Bill was not thought of first by Fianna Fáil.  However, we are not dealing with that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Central Fund Bill last year, the Minister for Finance, when dealing with it in this House, gave certain figures in regard to the value of emigrants' remittances.  He mentioned, I think, the figure of <Col N="1513" /> £6,800,000 as the value of emigrants' remittances for the year 1942.  I think he told us on that occasion that there was no comparable figure available for the year 1943.  He went on and related that figure, in reply to a query by Senator Baxter, to a total purchasing power of £229,000,000.  When that figure was challenged by Senator Baxter, the Minister seemed so very certain about it that he offered to make a bet.  I was going to interject something, but I was frankly down-faced by what the Minister offered to do, and did not.</P>
    <P>When I went home, however, I looked up the figures and found that the Minister had been betting on something that was not quite correct.  He related the figure of £6,800,000 to £229,000,000.  I think it is just as well, perhaps, that the correct position should be stated.  The figure, in fact, that the Minister suggested for emigrants' remittances in 1942 was, without any question, very much larger for 1943, even though no accurate estimate was forthcoming for that year.  It would have been more accurate and correct to relate that figure to currency&mdash;bank deposits, Post Office savings bank deposits&mdash;for 1942 and not for 1943, as the Minister did.  I am sure that, quite unintentionally, he did ring the changes in substituting one year, that suited him, for another year when the correct figure, actually, would be somewhat about £204,000,000. But worse than that, the Minister counted in several figures in the total. He counted in the figure of £11,000,000 currency held by the banks, the bank deposits figure of £170,000,000 and the currency figure of £36,000,000.  If Senators go into the matter, they will find that any figure of emigrants' remittances, instead of being related to a figure of £229,000,000 or £230,000,000, possible or potential purchasing power, should more properly be related to a figure of somewhere about £175,000,000 or £178,000,000.  I suggest to the House that for the Minister for Finance, when speaking more or less <i>ex cathedra</i>, to make a mistake, in the comparison that he put before the House, of some £50,000,000 was, to say the least of it, unfortunate.</P>
    <P>In the last eight years the volume <Col N="1514" /> of large currency notes circulated in the State has grown in an alarming degree, even though we have about doubled our currency issue in the last eight years.  I am talking in very rough figures now.  The increase in the ordinary 10/-, £1 and £5 notes is just about 100 per cent., but the £100 and £50 note issue has gone up to five times what it was eight years ago.  I suggest that that particular increase, particularly when it has taken place in the last two years, is indicative of a large scope for black-market transactions. The report of the Central Bank mentions that the increased currency note issue was, to some extent, offset by hoarding.  I suggest&mdash;though my whole tendency is against it&mdash;that the Minister must consider some method of curbing that large increase in notes of high denominations, if he wishes to stamp out black-marketing and tax evasion.  The increase has not arisen in the ordinary way of business.  Bank managers will agree that more people are coming into the banks and asking for large denomination notes and then, a short time afterwards, putting in an envelope for safe keeping in the bank. The presumption must be, in many cases, that that money is not coming through the ordinary channels and is being put away because it is the profits of transactions which someone does not wish to bring out in the light of day.  This increase by five times is likely to cause serious repercussions, so the Minister should consider whether, from that angle, he cannot do something more to stamp out black-marketing than by control of the goods.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that cheap capital is very essential for agriculture, but I am afraid the real trouble is that agriculture is under-capitalised, in the sense of ordinary share capital, from the company angle. The capital invested in our agriculture is bearing a fixed interest and not an interest in proportion to the rate of profit: it is paying a high interest when agriculture is doing well and dropping back, like an ordinary dividend, when agriculture is doing badly.  It is rather more towards some extension of the ordinary share capital of the farmer <Col N="1515" /> that we should plan for the future.  We must increase agricultural production, and we can do that best by making capital available for long-term works which will assist production, such as better machinery and buildings. Regarding buildings, there is a remission of rates straight away when a new house is built for habitation, but the farmer who builds new and modern outbuildings has his valuation increased without any remission or benefit. Those two should be collected in a somewhat better way.</P>
    <P>We must also make more provision for science in agriculture, as no amount of capital can be anything but a palliative unless production is increased substantially.  No matter what Senator Kehoe may say, this present world holocaust, and not the policy of any Government in any country, has been responsible for the increased agriculture in the last four years.  It is to be hoped that, when the war is over, we may be in a position to put agriculture in a sound position, even though we have not been able to take advantage of our geographical position to obtain an improvement in the way of increased production in the last four years.</P>

      <P>All those who pay direct taxation agree, with a sigh of relief that the Minister for Finance has not in any way increased taxation this year.  It is only a very small proportion of the people that is interested in corporation profits tax and surtax.  I belong to, and speak for, the middle class, who simply pay the amount of income-tax for which they are assessed.  Probably the greatest taxpayer of all is the indirect taxpayer. We have heard from the Minister this evening that the enormous sum of £15,000,000 was derived from taxation on tobacco and excisable drinks.  Most Senators here seem to boast that they are not contributors to these particular taxes, but I am proud to say that I contribute in a modest way to the taxes on both of those commodities.</P>

    <P>Items have been mentioned requiring the immediate and serious attention of <Col N="1516" /> whatever Government may be in power after the war.  As usual, agriculture has taken priority of place.  There has also been mention of provision for the reception of tourists, by good roads and other improvements.  The first thing that must be taken up by the Government, when the opportunity occurs, is increased housing in urban areas. Owing to there having been no building during the emergency, the shortage of houses is becoming an extreme problem, especially in urban towns with progressive tendencies.</P>
    <P>Owing to abnormal conditions, and to the fact that Ennis is situated near the airport at Rhynanna and also the wireless station, at which considerable numbers of workers are employed, we are extremely short of houses.  To put it modestly, we are short of about 40 or 50 houses per 1,000 of the population. That position will have to be remedied at the earliest opportunity. I am sure that I am not speaking of the position that exists in one town, but that what I am saying applies to many other towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman referred to the position of farmers, and stated that when they erected buildings they were not allowed a remission of rates on them.  As I understand it, it is only to urban councils that build houses grants or loans are given from Government funds.  A remission of rates is given on houses erected by the owners or occupiers under what is known as the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  In that case these people provide all the capital.  They get a loan which they have to repay, with interest.  They are allowed a graduated remission of rates over a certain period after which they have to pay full rates.  I am not aware that any other section in the community derives any such benefit.</P>
    <P>In connection with the big drive for funds for that very laudable society, the Red Cross Society, I want to make a suggestion to the Minister.  The aim of the society is to raise £500,000. The amount is not very large, considering what is raised by taxation, but anybody with any experience of collecting money in a voluntary way <Col N="1517" /> knows the great difficulty there is in raising even smaller sums.  I believe the Red Cross Society has a quota for each area and county and that for some counties it is £15,000.  I do not think it is possible to raise that amount voluntarily, and my suggestion to the Minister is that the Government might encourage people to give contributions by making them free of income-tax so that subscribers might claim relief for the full amount they give.  Of course, the Government would lose a considerable amount of revenue by that expedient but, as the health and lives of the people are their concern, I think they cannot divorce themselves from that object.  There is a contribution then by direct and indirect taxation, and everybody is contributing something. <Col N="1518" /> That would meet with general approval.</P>
    <P>It is a big task to raise £500,000 voluntarily, and I throw out the suggestion to the Minister for what it is worth.  It might encourage donors to give larger sums.  If £1 or £2 could be given tax free by a donor, the amount subscribed would be increased and the Minister would hardly miss it.  Taking the Finance Bill as a whole, no matter what heavy demands are made, considering the many obligations of the Government during the emergency, taxpayers heave a sigh of relief when they know that the story is not worse.</P>
