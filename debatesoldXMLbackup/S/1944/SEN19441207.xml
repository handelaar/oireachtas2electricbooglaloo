      <P>I have received the following letter from Senator Sir John Keane:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the Chairman:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I ask leave to move on the Adjournment of the House this afternoon a matter of urgent public importance, to wit, the refusal of the Press Censor to allow any publication in the daily Press of this morning of last night's debate on the motion for the Adjournment. (Signed), J. Keane.</P>
      <P>I have read the notice because Senator Sir John Keane has intimated to me that he finds himself unable to be present at the opening of the proceedings to-day and I do not wish to place the Senator under any disadvantage on that account.</P>
      <P>I have considered the matter carefully and I have come to the conclusion that the matter is not one contemplated by Standing Order No. 25&mdash;particularly from the point of view of urgency, the third requirement in that Standing Order.  The Senator's notice appears to be by way of censure of administrative action already taken and, as such, can be dealt with in the ordinary way.  I have, accordingly, to refuse the Senator's request.</P>

      <P>I was dealing last night with three sections about which some doubt had been expressed <Col N="716" /> and I was trying to explain what was aimed at by those sections. I gave the House the number of districts in existence; I gave the House the number for the proper maintenance of which the county councils are at this moment legally responsible, and I gave the number that would, as a result of Section 23, be transferred to them for maintenance in the future, with the proviso that these councils would be protected from any legal action, or would not be obliged legally to maintain those districts in a better state of repair than that in which they had been handed over.</P>
      <P>Section 29 enables us to serve notice upon a local authority where we are satisfied the local authority has not been discharging its obligations.  But, if that power is given to us in Section 29, it is only power which enables us to make those local authorities discharge their legal obligations in so far as the 133 districts for which they are now responsible are concerned, and discharge their responsibility also in relation to the districts that are being transferred to them under Section 23.  In relation to the districts that are being transferred to them under Section 23, we cannot call upon those councils to maintain those districts at a higher state of repair than could the riparian owners, the people whose lands are being drained. Section 37 more or less gives the drainage authority the same sort of protection as is provided for the local authority under Section 23, where, in the case of an application being made by the drainage authority for the transfer of a district for maintenance purposes to our organisation, we are obliged to maintain up to the proper legal standard, and no more.  I cannot see that there is anything in these three sections that is not necessary or that could possibly be abused or used for the purpose of imposing upon the local authorities concerned any hardship whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to Section 57, which deals with districts partially within and partially outside this State.  Although the Drainage Commission felt they were not in a position to deal with this matter, we <Col N="717" /> naturally had to find some solution for the two districts which are affected&mdash; the lower Lough Erne and the Ballymore and Ballyconnell.  We immediately realised the benefits which would accrue to other districts, from the point of view of their future maintenance, inasmuch as those other districts transferred under Section 23 would be maintained in future, not on the basis of a local rate but on the basis of a county rate; and we felt that something must be done in order to confer on the people in those districts, who are at the moment under the jurisdiction of this State, the same benefits as the riparian owners in other districts enjoy.  As a result, Section 57 appears in this measure.</P>
    <P>There are no means by which we could have legislated for the transference of those districts, seeing that we have no jurisdiction in portion of the area affected.  All we have aimed at here, and all we are securing by Section 57, is that the riparian owners in Cavan and Leitrim will have refunded to them whatever drainage rate they may be called upon in the future to pay.  It does not in any case tie our hands as to any future activity, in so far as new works are concerned; but, of course, our hands are tied inasmuch as, after the examination of this matter by experts, we have been informed that it is impossible to tackle either of the drainage problems presented there without the co-operation of the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter may not be aware that, some time ago, this matter was examined by the officials of the two Governments, in so far as the Erne was concerned, and a joint report was, I understand, issued to the public, giving a sort of review of their conclusions. I am not going to go into that report now, but it is in existence and it clearly shows that an effort was made, an engineering examination was conducted into the problems presented by the Erne, and four different proposals were made as to how the Erne problem should be treated.  After those four recommendations, with estimates of the cost of each of the four different works proposed, were presented and made known, the Northern <Col N="718" /> Government presented the report and estimates to the Drainage Advisory Committee which, in turn, rejected all four propositions and estimates.  I am merely going over that ground to show the House that this is a problem which, we are advised, cannot be tackled unless we can secure the cooperative effort of both Governments. I have also given that explanation to show that efforts have been made in the past, unsuccessfully, to find a solution.  What the future will hold in that regard is something which I am not in a position to deal with now.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked here as to what steps were being taken to carry out surveys and what preparations were being made to start operations. Survey work has been going on for some time in the Brosna district and, at the moment, we are engaged in a survey of the district to which Senator McGee referred yesterday, that is, the Glyde and Dee.  I could not forecast when work actually will start.  Some Senators here yesterday evening&mdash; including, I think, Senator O'Dea&mdash; stated that this was work in which machinery and plant were not necessary. That may be so, to a limited extent, but our technical people do not accept that view.  Very heavy plant, plant that is at the moment unprocurable, is necessary for the type of work that we will have to undertake; and until the conditions in the world change, and these machines come on the market again, I cannot see much prospect of making progress with this particular work.  I want to assure the House that we are trying to build up an organisation and a programme&mdash;as I have indicated in the case of those two districts&mdash;by which we will be ready to start off to work as soon as the conditions permit of our doing so.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman referred to Section 28.  As far as I can remember, he regards that section as capable of being used in a rather wide fashion. It can be used, certainly, in that way but, looked upon from our angle, I would never dream of encouraging the application of this section in the wide and generous sort of way to which he referred last evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not guilty of a breach of any confidence when I tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I am assured by the county manager in Kildare that the way I mentioned is the way in which he intends to interpret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to impute any responsibility to the Parliamentary Secretary except this&mdash;that, as it is his Bill, he should provide that such an interpretation cannot be put on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As a matter of fact anything that I might say here could not in any way limit the effects which Section 28, as it is, will have. That section was designed largely because of the position which arose as a result of the difficulties which some county councils had experienced in the past in endeavouring to maintain districts that had been handed over to them, and which they were legally obliged to maintain.  Some of those county councils found it impossible to collect the necessary funds from the riparian owners to do the maintenance work.  In some of these cases there were joint districts so that more than one county council was responsible. There was not the same sort of acceptance of their responsibilities by some of the county councils as there was in the case of the isolated county council to which I have referred.  That county council took up the attitude: &ldquo;We must make some effort to maintain these works; we cannot collect the rate from the riparian owners that would be sufficient to do this job; we will do something, even though from the legal point of view that may be very questionable; we will maintain the works as best we can out of the ordinary rates of the council.&rdquo;  We found that such a thing as that did actually occur in some cases.  Therefore, we were anxious to ensure that a position of that kind would be regularised to the extent that it was possible for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to adjust matters as <Col N="720" /> between the county councils on whose shoulders rested a legal responsibility for the maintenance work in these parts of the drainage district situate in their territories.  Section 28 also gives power to a local authority to wipe out arrears and to recover them to whatever extent they can, to grant such concessions as they may think fit and proper in so far as these arrears are concerned.  I am only now expressing an individual opinion.  I cannot see any local authority going out of its way to interpret this section in the generous fashion that Senator Sweetman imagines by giving to people who have refused to pay&mdash;some of whom could pay&mdash;concessions that other people who have endeavoured to meet their obligations have not enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will accept my assurance that it is going to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sweetman explained that he would meet this situation by wiping out three years' arrears and by making a refund to those who had behaved properly in meeting their obligations.  He said he would do that in order to put all those people on the same plane and so as not to encourage the feeling that the man who refuses to meet his obligations will in the end profit by that refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I only took three years as an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that while I have not any idea of how the county managers for Kildare, Laoighis and Offaly will operate this section, I would be surprised, seeing that there is a legal responsibility on them for the collection of the rates struck in their respective counties of which they are county managers, if they were to go out and say to those people: &ldquo;We are going to wipe out all those arrears.&rdquo;  Although this section can be interpreted and used in that fashion, I would hope that no county manager would act in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope then that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept an amendment from me on the Committee Stage to prevent them from so acting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Sweetman is one of those who has been agitating for a long time for the giving of more powers to the local authorities, and complaining at the same time that power has been taken from local authorities which they enjoyed in the past.  Here is a case in which the local authorities are being given a discretionary power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities are not getting it.  The county manager is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the county manager is the local authority, and the local authority is the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where my argument goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I must regard the council as the council and approach this question on that basis.  I say that complaints have been made because of a tendency in the recent past to take away power from the local authorities. Here is a case where a discretionary power is being given to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made a fair score there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are giving the local authority a discretionary power, a thing which they have been agitating for.  Neither the Senator nor the county councils can have it both ways.  Both Senator Sweetman and Senator Duffy referred to the position of the Barrow.  I do not propose to go into that in any great detail.  Since I went to the Board of Works I have read up the history of the Barrow as best I could. I also listened in the other House to a discussion on this question in which the late Deputy Hugo Flinn took part. The report of that discussion is on the record of the other House.  Although at the time I knew nothing about the <Col N="722" /> history of the Barrow, I must say now that the arguments advanced by the late Deputy Flinn were, in my opinion, entirely convincing.  If the two Senators who have referred to this matter will turn to paragraph 58 of the Drainage Commission Report they will find there a complete refutation of the charges made in the pamphlet to which they referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I referred last evening to the paragraph in the Report of the Drainage Commission dealing with the Barrow.  When the official report of my speech is available he will find, if he reads it over, that I said last evening that the Barrow works were well planned, that they were well carried out and well executed, and that the Report of the Drainage Commission on that point was correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to intervene to say that, in my reference to the Barrow last evening, I commenced by saying that I knew nothing about the conflict between the Department and the local people.  I merely recited a few paragraphs from a statement made, I think, in 1938, and went on to show, I hope, that the difficulty about the Barrow drainage was due to the fact that it was not accompanied by an afforestation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the paragraph from the Report of the Drainage Commission in case any one might think that I was misinterpreting the views expressed by the commission on this question of the Barrow.  This is what the commission had to say about it in paragraph 58:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have heard a number of witnesses in reference to the Barrow and have visited portions of the catchment area and seen some of the principal works.  We are satisfied that the scheme was well designed and well executed, and an examination of the river gauge readings furnishes abundant proof that the scheme has produced very considerable improvement in river conditions. It is generally admitted that floods <Col N="723" /> now run off much more quickly and that the area affected by flooding has been greatly reduced.  Failure to maintain the works properly has resulted in deterioration and contributed to recent flooding.  It was alleged before us that the final award assessments on the lands were grossly excessive.  An analysis of the award, however, shows that, excluding lots with special site values in urban areas, the assessments on the improved lands in the Barrow drainage district vary from 6d. to 10/- per acre.  There are less than a dozen agricultural lots with an assessment exceeding 7/- per acre, and these lots adjoin urban areas. Out of the total assessed area of 43,520 acres, only 4,467 acres, or roughly 10 per cent., are valued at more than 4/- per acre.  The average assessment, however, over the whole district is 2/10 per acre as compared with an average assessment of 4/- per acre in the case of 1925 Act schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I entirely refuse to accept the view that the assessment in the case of the riparian owners on the Barrow was excessive.  I do not know the people concerned as intimately as I know the people of other parts of the country. I know riparian owners whose lands have been assessed under the 1925 Act, as pointed out in that paragraph, at 4/- per acre and they are very pleased to make that payment.  I am puzzled not a little by the behaviour of the riparian owners in the case of the Barrow, where the average charge was not 4/- but 2/10 per acre.  That is all I have to say on the question of the Barrow drainage.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to the enormous expenditure envisaged under this Bill and spoke of the interest charges and their effects.  He went on to say that, after all that expenditure, future generations would, as a result of the silting of rivers, be presented with a similar problem and, perhaps, similar financial responsibility.  Our view is that much of the good effect of the work done by drainage operations under previous Acts has been lost because of the failure of the <Col N="724" /> authorities responsible properly to maintain the works.  Senator Ruane, having made a complaint as to our failure to provide for the initiation of works by local authorities, went on&mdash; I was disappointed with his remarks in this connection&mdash;to say that, after all, the local authorities have experience of these matters, have been handling these problems, know a lot about drainage and could make useful suggestions and give valuable co-operation. While that may be true to an extent, it is also true that local authorities have broken down almost completely in the past in maintaining districts for the maintenance of which they were legally liable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And several other Acts. It is true in respect of districts transferred to them for maintenance under the Local Government Act, 1898.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Act of 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When this commission was in existence, each county council was invited to send representatives to give evidence.  A verbatim report of the evidence is available in my office. I knew my own county and some of the neighbouring counties and I was curious to see what the evidence given on behalf of the county councils before the commission was like.  I was appalled to find that, even in the case of schemes carried out as recently as six or seven years ago, for the maintenance of which the county councils were legally liable, not a penny had been spent, although those schemes had cost the State, the local authorities and the riparian owners, many thousands of pounds.  I should be glad to give local authorities the credit Senator Ruane claimed for them if there was anything on the records to justify their making such a claim or to justify my admitting it.  On this question of the discharge by county councils of their responsibility for the maintenance of districts in their charge, I cannot make any concession. <Col N="725" /> I tried to dispel a misunderstanding in the other House&mdash;a misunderstanding which seems to have trickled in here&mdash;of a statement I made when discussing the measure there.  Two statements are being attributed to me for which I have no responsibility.  One statement has reference to the rate of progress likely to be made under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The other statement is as to the time when the organisation to be set up to implement this measure will have reached its maximum output.  I did not express any opinion on these matters.  I merely repeated the opinion expressed by the Drainage Commission in their report.  They stated that, from the day on which operations commence under this measure, a period of five years will elapse before the organisation is perfected to the point when an annual expenditure of £250,000 per annum will have been reached.  I did not say that that was likely to be the best we could do.  I merely told the Dáil, as I now tell the Seanad, that that was the opinion expressed by the Drainage Commission.  I also tried, in the other House, to dispel the notion that the execution of works under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, would prove to be a great source of employment. The commission examined that matter and their estimate of the amount of constant employment to be given, assuming an expenditure of £250,000 per annum, was 1,000 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman and Senator Kingsmill Moore made a point which had not been made so far&mdash;that some opportunity should be provided for consultation before the publication of a scheme.  The reason they gave for making that suggestion was that, once a scheme is published, the tendency on the part of technical men is to resist amendment.  I do not think there is anything in that because I believe that the consultation, to which Senator Sweetman and Senator Kingsmill Moore referred, must actually take place.  Now, thinking along the line of those who would be most likely to be interested in such matters.  I would assume that the persons most likely to be interested, or whose interests would be likely to be involved, would be the <Col N="726" /> county council or the borough council concerned, or, perhaps, some industry or factory that might be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we have to arrange for consultation there.  That is a question of administration, and, administratively, the position is altogether different.  Administratively, it has always been the practice, not only in regard to this particular matter, but to other matters, to have these consultations between the Department of State concerned in the matter and the local authority that will be likely to be affected or the owners of portions of a river, or other interests, such as industries, factories, and so on, that might be likely to be affected.  In that connection, I may say that I think it is amazing, having regard to the complicated nature of this work and the execution of works of this type, the amount of agreement that it has been possible to secure.  In saying that, I think I can wind in the remarks made by Senator McEllin in talking about industry, the provision of cheap power, and the effect that an arterial drainage scheme might have on all these very important matters.  These are very important matters and, as I said in the Dáil, when you come up against a situation in which an industry or factory is dependent on water power&mdash;where the provision of water power is a vital necessity for the continuance of the work of that industry or factory&mdash;the matter has to be considered from that point of view. We try to protect the industry or factory, if at all possible, but if the power cannot be provided, or if the interests of the community in general can best be served by wiping out that industry or factory, then the rights of the owners have to be considered, and it is along those lines which were raised by Senator McEllin that these matters must be approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to three sections&mdash;Sections 17, 36 and 48&mdash;and, of course, he will have another opportunity of making known to us what <Col N="727" /> objection, exactly, he sees to those sections.  I think Senator Duffy has also referred to one of these sections, No. 17.  I have been looking at these sections since, and I cannot see what is in the Senators' minds.  However, when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill we shall, undoubtedly, hear more about them.  I think, Sir, I have covered all the points that were made. At least, so far as I remember the points that were made, I think I have endeavoured to cover them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary bear in mind my point as to Section 24?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, with regard to maintenance transfer orders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was not quite clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The section means that, when the drainage authority applies for a transfer order in regard to a drainage district that is, at the moment, being used by a local authority, the control and management of such existing drainage district shall be transferred to the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>But what is in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind about the implementation of that section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is this: Just as the Drainage Commission suggested that a period of five years would elapse from the time the work would be started before the maximum expenditure could be reached, before the organisation necessary to provide for a maximum expenditure of £250,000 could be set up, it would take that period of time to build up the necessary maintenance organisation, as indicated in the Report of the Drainage Commission, and I think that until we shall have the necessary organisation for maintenance built up, there would be no point in applying for a maintenance transfer order under Section 24.  Let me give one case as an example.  If we were to start with, let us say, the <Col N="728" /> Brosna district to-morrow and complete it in two years' time, we would then be responsible for the future maintenance of that scheme and for all new works that might be executed later on.  We would be responsible for the future maintenance of the scheme and for any new works that might be undertaken in connection with it, and, of course, in such a case, we would serve a bill on the local authorities concerned, but when we come to set up an authority or organisation in connection with the Brosna district, we shall have an organisation to take care of maintenance work.  In the case of a bigger scheme, however, under Section 24 we wish to take power to have these other outside districts transferred to us in order to give a full-time job to those engaged in the maintenance organisation established in the Brosna region.  Perhaps I have not made that very clear, but it is as clear as I can make it, and that sort of building up of a maintenance organisation will continue all over the country.  As I have said, Sir, I have tried to meet all the points that were made.  I must say that I have been met very fairly and helpfully by the members of this House, and that any criticism that has been offered has been very clear and helpful, and I hope that we shall have the same helpful atmosphere when we come to discuss the Bill in greater detail after Christmas.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary answer my question as to the matter of statutory limitations? If he is not prepared to answer my question now, perhaps he could convey his answer to me privately because, without an answer to my question, it will be impossible to frame an amendment to deal with the matter. Apart from that, I should like to point out that, when we were arguing or talking about the Barrow a moment ago, I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary was under the impression that I said that the Barrow scheme was not carried out properly.</P>

The river runs for about a mile between the Counties of Monaghan and Armagh and the area is in urgent need of attention. Representations were made to the previous Government and representations have also been made to the present Government in regard to this area and I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary could give me any information in regard to it.  If we could sink and widen half of the <Col N="730" /> river, it would drain close on 1,000 acres around Castleblayney.</P>

If the Senator wishes I shall look into the matter and give him all the information I can about it.</P>

I am not charged with the responsibility either of striking a rate, encouraging the local authorities to strike a rate, or of seeing that when a rate is struck, the local authority will collect it.  I am merely responsible for the enactment of a measure which in Section 28 gives local authorities certain discretionary powers in these matters.  How the Senator can knit that in with a request for information as to what the statutory obligations of local authorities are and what is the statutory position in relation to ratepayers, whether drainage ratepayers or otherwise, I must say I fail to see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending Bill and therefore, <Col N="731" /> in the first place, does not involve any new principle.  It merely amends legislation in existence already.  Diseases of animals legislation is based on the Act of 1894, which is referred to as the Principal Act.  One thing I want Senators to keep in mind is that in 1894 there was a different conception in regard to dealing with diseases like foot-and-mouth disease, pleuro pneumonia and swine fever.  They were dealt with principally by the local authorities.  Since that there has been a gradual change over to the idea of dealing more and more with these diseases through the central authority. That is, I should say, the big reason for this Bill, to give the central authority more power to deal with certain diseases but it is really only giving the central authority powers which the local authorities had in the beginning.  There are four sections of the Principal Act of 1894 which are being repealed in this Bill, Sections 5, 6, 8 and 9.  Sections 5 and 6 deal with cattle plague, a disease which we have not heard of in this country for years. Still it would be a dreadful disease if it should occur and hence the provision to deal with it.  Sections 8 and 9 dealt with pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease.  These are being repealed and all these diseases will be dealt with henceforth under Section 10 of the Principal Act.  Section 10 of the Principal Act is really more comprehensive and gives wider powers to the central authority to deal with these outbreaks.  It is more suitable under present circumstances.  Section 2 and Section 10 together effect the changeover of powers, as it were, from local authorities to the central authority for dealing with these particular diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with compensation. As the law stands at present, compensation is payable in cases of foot-and-mouth disease or of those other disease with which we have to deal, where a direction to have animals slaughtered is given by a veterinary surgeon or an inspector of the Minister.  It sometimes happens in the case of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that an inspector gives an order that all the animals on the <Col N="732" /> land are to be slaughtered, but before the order is carried out certain animals may have died.  Strictly speaking these animals should not rank for compensation.  On the occasion of the last outbreak we did, however, pay compensation in such cases.  We did it, if you like, by an <i>ex gratia</i> payment without legal authority.  That is a matter which is being made right in this Bill under Section 3, so that where an inspector comes along and gives an order for slaughter, compensation will be payable whether the animals die in the meantime or are slaughtered under that order.  Another matter arose during the last outbreak, and that is, that in a few cases carcases were discovered in Dublin which were affected with foot-and-mouth disease. They were confiscated, of course, by the veterinary authorities, and again under the present law there was no provision for compensation.  That is also dealt with in Section 3.  We can in future pay compensation for carcases so confiscated, and, of course, also for carcases that might be in contact with the carcases affected.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with the withholding of compensation.  Under the Principal Act, the Minister&mdash;the Board of Agriculture it was at that time&mdash;has power to withhold compensation where the person is guilty of negligence or of the commission of an offence which might have very serious consequences in the way of spreading the disease.  First of all, of course, this Section 4 extends that provision to the cases which are brought in under Section 3, so that the Minister could also withhold compensation for animals that die before the time for slaughter, and could withhold compensation in the case of carcases where there was culpable negligence of any kind on the part of the owner.  It also makes rather a big change in the present legislation in this way: the wording of the present legislation, based on the 1894 Act, refers to a person who &ldquo;did not take precautions in relation to the animals so affected&rdquo;; we are changing that to <Col N="733" /> the phrase &ldquo;did not take precautions in relation to the relevant outbreak of disease&rdquo;, because there are cases where a person may have been very particular about his own animals, but may have exposed other people's animals to the disease.  For instance, it did happen more than once during the last outbreak that, when a disease was coming near a particular farmer, he shifted his animals during the night to another farm six or seven or ten miles away.  He was more than particular about his own animals, but he was not very particular about &ldquo;the relevant outbreak of disease&rdquo;.  He might have created&mdash;and in one case at least did create&mdash;a whole new centre of disease by shifting his animals in that way.  As the law stood, we could not properly withhold compensation in that particular man's case, and we want to make the law right as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives power to the inspector to take ground for the burial of animals other than the ground owned by the owner of the animals. We were never actually up against such a case during the last outbreak, but there is no doubt that we would have been up against it if the outbreak had continued to the end of the year.  The Orders that were made confined the animals to the land on which they stood at that particular time, and if we had gone on, say, to the end of November, when the eleven months' period was over, the owner of the animals slaughtered in December would have had no right to the land on which those animals were grazing. If the owner of the land resisted, it is questionable whether we had any right to demand that the animals should be buried on that particular land.  Therefore we are bringing in a section here to enable the Minister or his inspector, where the land belonging to the owner is not suitable, to take a plot for the purpose of burying any animals slaughtered under the Order.</P>
    <P>The next section deals with the seizure of animals at a fair or market. As the law stands, the local authority has power to seize animals at a fair or market.  It has power, first of all, to <Col N="734" /> freeze, as it were, that particular market or fair, and power to take over a premises in a village or town in which to isolate those animals.  The Minister has no such power as the local authorities have in that regard.  This section will give to the Minister the power which local authorities have at the moment to seize those animals and also to take a place in which to quarantine them until it is discovered whether they have the disease and can be dealt with or whether they have not the disease and can be released.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with penalties.  At present a person who commits an offence by way of commission or omission, in not notifying the disease and so on, can be fined by the courts a maximum of £20 or £5 per animal whichever is the greater; that is if he has more than four animals the fine can be more than £20, because it can be up to £5 per animal.  If he has committed any offence in the way of shifting carcases, fodder, litter or dung, as is mentioned in the Principal Act, he can be fined an additional £10 per half-ton. That is all being taken out, and there is a maximum penalty of £100 put in, whatever the offence may be. I think that is a much fairer scheme, because it does seem to me that, under the present legislation, a man who shifts a load of straw or dung is very much more severely dealt with than a man who shifts animals, and there should not at any rate be a greater penalty for that than for the shifting of animals.  Therefore it will be the same penalty in future.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with compensation for the owner of ground taken for the disposal of animals by way of burial or for places taken for the detention of animals seized at a fair or market.  In this case, as Senators will see, the Minister and the person concerned will try if at all possible to come to some agreement.  If they fail to come to an agreement, it goes to arbitration in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with finances.  It was contemplated in 1894, when this Act was first brought in, that the local authorities would deal with those diseases, and there was a fund there called <Col N="735" /> the General Cattle Diseases Fund. Indeed it is there still.  The idea was that all outbreaks of this kind would be dealt with through the Diseases of Animals Fund.  That is no longer possible; at least it is no longer thought desirable.  Now those outbreaks like foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever, which are the two we have to deal with principally&mdash;there are also the other diseases I mentioned, if they should recur, that is cattle plague and pleuro-pneumonia-are dealt with by the central authority, and all expenses, compensation and so on, are paid out of the Exchequer.  In return for that, it is only fair that any fines or appropriations should come into the Exchequer and not into the General Cattle Diseases Fund.  That is provided for in Section 9.  Section 10 deals with the repeals to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one thing further&mdash;I mentioned it in the Dáil when speaking there&mdash;and that is, that I sympathise with Senators who have to deal with a Bill of this kind, because I know that when I was not in the Government I found that the study and understanding of a Bill of this kind took a good deal of research. It meant looking up the Principal Acts, amending Acts and so on to discover what exactly each clause in a Bill like this meant.  I had thought, when bringing in this Bill, of codifying, as it were, the whole lot and bringing in one Bill to deal with the whole matter of diseases of animals.  But then I came to the conclusion that it is almost certain that we will have to have more legislation before very long.  The committee that is dealing with post-war agriculture has presented a report on veterinary services and on diseases of animals in general and I think it is more than likely that in the implementing of whatever part of that report may be thought advisable by the Government further amendments will be necessary and, if the Bill becomes necessary, and if I am there to introduce it, I do hope it will be possible at that stage to bring in, as it were, a codification of all the Acts dealing with diseases of animals. <Col N="736" /> For the present, therefore, we must only get through as best we can with this amending Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve the Bill as far as it goes but I am surprised that in this Bill, which is to amend the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, the question of compensation for animals affected with tuberculosis is not brought in.  It is difficult to understand why cattle slaughtered by Order of the Government are paid full compensation while cattle slaughtered by order of the local authority get only partial compensation.  Any animal suspected of being affected with tuberculosis is supposed to be reported to the Gárda.  On receipt of notification, the Gárda send a report to the local authority and the local authority send a vet to inspect the animal and if after examination he finds it suffering from tuberculosis, he orders it to be slaughtered. If after slaughter the animal is found to be affected, the compensation that is paid is only one-quarter of the value.  I have been told by a vet with whom I discussed the matter that the Department of Agriculture will not allow the full value of any ordinary beast that is affected with tuberculosis to be reckoned at more than £6 and the owner will get only 30/- for a cow that is slaughtered.  If after slaughter it is found not to be affected, he will get the full value plus, I think, a quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the best way to illustrate the point I wish to make is to give an example of what happened recently, to my own knowledge.  A farmer living in the district where I reside had a cow which showed visible signs of tuberculosis.  He notified the Gárda. The vet came and inspected the cow. The cow was slaughtered and the man got from the local authority 30/- compensation. I understand the cow and was giving about three gallons of milk per day.  On reporting that cow to the local authority and having it slaughtered the farmer received compensation to the value of one week's milk of that cow.  Farmers will not be so very anxious to report cattle which are visibly affected with tuberculosis&mdash; although they are supposed to do it&mdash;<Col N="737" /> unless reasonable compensation is paid when the animals are ordered to be slaughtered.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House and I am afraid I might be ruled out of order but I want to say that I intend to put in an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.  I should, however, very much prefer the Minister to look into the matter and draft the amendment with the assistance of his experts.  They know better than I what would be suitable.  I cannot follow all the legislation that this Bill is supposed to amend and if the Minister will look into it he will save me a considerable amount of trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reactions to this Bill when I first saw it, and the reactions of the veterinary profession generally were that it was simply patching old clothes.  We have ample material for a new suit and we have, I think, the money to pay for it and sufficient coupons.  We can see that the Bill is only a post-mortem on the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and that all the amendments are the practical result of the experiences gained during that outbreak.  I fear that there has been too much of that mentality in the framing of this amending legislation.  It takes a considerable time to understand the meaning of the sections in this Bill, especially, I should say, Section 2.  An eminent lawyer who is a member of this House told me that he found it very difficult to understand the meaning of it because certain sections of the 1894 Act are repealed by Section 10 and reinserted in Section 2.  It is very difficult to follow that procedure. I think the explanation is that what is removed in Sections 5, 6, 8, 9 and 12 of the Principal Act, by Section 10 of this Bill, remain and are incorporated in Section 2 of this Bill, but they are incorporated only to the extent that this Bill gives the Minister power to make Orders dealing with the particular diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As originally introduced, it was found that the Bill contained considerable defects.  I should like at this stage to congratulate the Minister and <Col N="738" /> the officials of his Department for the way in which they met the representations made by the Veterinary Medical Association.  We suggested several amendments which were duly incorporated. Senators may like to know the reason for the amendments.  One of the principal reasons, as the Minister explained in introducing the amendments, was that local authority officials were utilised in the last outbreak in combating the disease. Actually, we were not officials of the Minister; we were not inspectors of the local authority.  We did things in that outbreak which we realised at the time we had practically no legal authority to do.  We had to use, you might call it, coercion.  To a greater extent it was a system of cajoling people to do what we thought was the right thing and which every reasonable person would think was the right thing to try to combat the scourge that afflicted the city and country during that outbreak. As far as Dublin and district were concerned, the outbreak was discovered in the municipal abattoir by a corporation veterinary inspector.  The diagnosis was made there.  There was no power in the Minister to pay compensation for the carcases of the animals slaughtered in the corporation abattoir.</P>
    <P>That has been rectified in the present Bill, because as the law stood it would mean that for animals which were quite innocently brought to the abattoir, and diagnosed as having the disease, the owner was not entitled to compensation.  Naturally he should get compensation by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> grant by the Minister for Finance, on the representation, I understand, of the Department and the Minister for Agriculture.  The position is being rectified now.  An alteration has also been made in the Bill, changing &ldquo;an inspector of the Minister&rdquo; to &ldquo;veterinary inspector.&rdquo;  That means that if we are called upon&mdash;and, please God, we will not be called for that purpose&mdash;the officials of a local authority will be authorised legally to take part in the offensive against any further outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
    <P>These amendments were inserted in <Col N="739" /> the Dáil and, on behalf of the profession, I desire to thank the Minister for incorporating them in the Bill. Everybody will appreciate that they are a benefit.  I may say now what I said several times outside, that but for the wholehearted co-operation of the municipal staff during the last outbreak, despite all the efforts of the staff of the central authority and officials of the Department, we would not have succeeded in eliminating the disease until all other animals capable of being infected would have got it.  That did not happen.  The disease was eradicated from Dublin, where the difficulties were 50 times greater than they would be in other parts of the country, through the contact with human subjects.  The amendments that have been inserted are very satisfactory, and if ever such an affliction should befall this country again we will be better equipped to attack it.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that Orders can be framed for dealing with disease. I should like to express the hope that when Orders are being drafted, there should be the same co-operation with representatives of the veterinary profession. I feel that the Department, as instanced by the framing of this Bill originally, if it did not take the point of view of people outside its own doors would make many mistakes.  I mention that for this reason, that the amendments to the Bill were accepted after consultation with veterinary inspectors and members of the veterinary profession outside the Department of Agriculture.  In expressing the hope that when framing Orders consultation will again take place I do so because I am very interested in one matter which necessarily will have to be dealt with by Orders.</P>
    <P>One great difficulty during the last outbreak concerned the supervision and control of the human subject, generally people who had come into contact with outbreaks of the disease. Senators will appreciate that that was ten times more difficult in the city than in rural areas, because people innocently came into contact with the disease, as well as owners and attendants, <Col N="740" /> through no fault of their own.  It would take too long to detail the instances with which we had to deal in connection with people who innocently came into contact with the disease, in order to try to get them and their clothes disinfected.  We succeeded in doing so but, having no legal authority, we ran great risks.  People were anxious to co-operate and submitted themselves and their clothing for disinfection and fumigation.  We spent days and nights at that work. We had to go to their homes to get workmen who had gone from their employment removed to the disinfecting department of the corporation. The great advantage we had in the city was that there was a disinfecting department to which people's clothing could be taken while they were having a bath.  In one instance a lady's fur coat, which would cost £60 or £70 had to be disinfected by fumigation.  If that coat had been destroyed in the process I do not know what would happen as we were practically acting without any legal authority.  A great deal of cajolery had to be tried to get the disease eradicated.  I repeat that that helped the Department to get rid of the disease within the city, and without that help the Department of Agriculture would never have succeeded in their efforts.  It is, therefore, all to the good that alterations should have been made in the Bill, empowering the Minister to utilise the services of inspectors other than Departmental inspectors.</P>
    <P>Turning to the sections of the Bill, Section 3 deals with diseases for which the Act of 1894 was enacted.  There is now no such thing as rinderpest in Europe.  I do not think we will ever hear of that disease in Ireland again, because veterinary science is so advanced throughout the world that even in Africa rinderpest is fairly well controlled.  In our insular position there is no likelihood that we will hear of it again.  Regarding sub-section (2), relative to pleuro-pneumonia, I am not sure if there is any such disease in Europe.  Thus in Sections 1 and 2 we are dealing practically with two non-existent diseases as far as Europe is concerned.  Sub-section <Col N="741" /> (3) deals with foot-and-mouth disease.  There I come to a point that I made previously, that the whole atmosphere of the Bill is a foot-and-mouth disease atmosphere.  The same phraseology is used to cover each of these sub-sections dealing with rinderpest, pleuro-pneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.</P>
    <P>Coming to Section 3 (3), the original Act is amplified to deal with animals that have been directed to be slaughtered and those that died before slaughter took place.  In cases of foot-and-mouth disease I think that should never occur.  I should like to know if it actually occurred during the last outbreak.  Although a fever in the adult animal, foot-and-mouth disease is never so acute that the animal dies suddenly, and if an animal is valued and ordered to be slaughtered, it should not die before slaughter takes place.  Otherwise, this would be an admission of delay.  There was criticism of the Department on the last occasion because the period between valuation and slaughter was too great; in other words, that there was great delay.  The introduction of this clause would indicate that that delay was admitted and that the Government seek to compensate the farmer whose animal is ordered to be slaughtered and dies before slaughter takes place.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is likely to arise in many cases and I do not think it occurred on the last occasion, but animals did die of the disease which are not covered by the amendment, that is, young calves, which were found dead after drinking milk infected with the virus of foot-and-mouth disease. Such cases did occur, when farmers, quite innocently and not knowing anything about the infection, because it came in milk from the creameries where the milk from infected cows was mixed indiscriminately with milk from other suppliers, fed that milk to calves. These calves became infected, with the result that the following morning they were dead.  These are the only cases in which foot-and-mouth disease would be quickly fatal, and these cases, so far as I can see, are not covered by the amendments, although representations <Col N="742" /> were made to have them covered. I still think they could properly be included.</P>
    <P>I know that the State or other authority cannot accept, or does not, like to accept, responsibility for valuing an animal already dead from disease, but we have come to the stage, and rightly so, of course, of compensating a man whose animal is slaughtered in an abattoir and found to be infected with the disease.  I think it would not involve so many cases&mdash;let us hope it will not have to cover any cases&mdash;but if we do have an outbreak and such cases arise, it is quite right that a farmer, whose calves are found dead and for which outbreak he cannot be held in any way responsible, should be compensated. It would not involve any large expenditure because a calf to-day is unfortunately of very little value.  A pedigree animal might have an enhanced value, but whether it be the calf of to-day's low value or a valuable calf, it is only proper that in relation to attempts to eradicate such a devastating disease as foot-and-mouth disease, the valuation would be allowed.  It would involve very little increased expenditure and would make the farming community generally more satisfied.  The valuation of animals slaughtered under foot-and-mouth disease Orders or under these measures is the full valuation before the animal became infected so nobody can advance any criticism on that score.  There is practically no deduction from the value of the animal before it became infected.</P>
    <P>We come then to sub-section (4) which deals with swine fever.  The same phraseology is used in each of the four sub-sections, and, in the case of swine fever, the same insertions are made.  In the case of swine fever, however, it is quite possible that adult animals would die from the disease without the owner knowing the cause.  The suspicion of swine fever would exist and he would report the matter, but, from the time of examination and valuation, it is possible that other animals would die. With swine fever, an animal can die between the time of valuation and the <Col N="743" /> time set for slaughter much more quickly than in the case of foot-and-mouth disease, unless there was some great delay in the latter case, but there is a difference in the valuations applied.</P>
    <P>In the case of an animal affected with swine fever, only half the valuation is allowed, while in the case of foot-and-mouth disease, the full value before the animal became infected is allowed.  I hope we will continue to have no swine fever in this country. The amazing feature of it is that since the importation of foreign bacon into this country was prohibited, we have had no swine fever.  Dublin City was a hot-bed of that disease and special Orders to deal with it had to be made. There is no such thing now as swine fever here.  It shows what extraordinary things these virus diseases are.</P>
    <P>Bacon was imported into the country containing the virus of swine fever and the question arises as to how it got to the pigs.  It was cooked, or semi-cooked, and went on the tables of restaurants, hotels or our homes.  It went from there to the swill tub, which is collected from hotels and restaurants by pig feeders and fed to pigs, so that the virus of swine fever, which lived in the bacon coming in, and lived through the cooking, was carried to the pig which consumed the swill from the hotels and restaurants and so the animal became infected, but since the introduction of the prohibition on foreign bacon we have had no swine fever.</P>
    <P>The same, unfortunately, does not apply to foot-and-mouth disease, which can be transferred very easily. One of the principal means by which the virus was spread was by contact with humans who carried it on their clothes and boots.  The valuation in the case of swine fever, though only half the value of the animal before it became infected, does not really concern us so much and no alterations have been made in this respect. Perhaps the Minister forestalled any criticism in this connection when he said he hoped to have a comprehensive review of the Diseases of <Col N="744" /> Animals Acts.  The Act of 1894 is one, I think, of 79 sections and five schedules, so that the amendments to a few sections made here make a very small contribution to the amendments actually required.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the question of withholding compensation.  I have nothing to say on that.  If a person is guilty of neglect so far as animals are concerned or of any offence relative to the outbreak as a whole, I think it is reasonable to give power to the authorities to retain the compensation to be granted.  The question of the use of ground other than that on which the animal was at the time, of more suitable ground elsewhere, is also reasonable. As the Minister explained, it has not occurred up to this, but it is very necessary as a safeguard in view of any further outbreak.</P>
    <P>In connection with Section 6 I have a point to make which I should like the Minister to note.  It only occurred to me on reading over this Bill very carefully since the amendments were inserted.  The first part of Section 6 (1) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever any diseased animal is found by a veterinary inspector in a market, fair, sale yard, or other public place...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his explanation of that sub-section the Minister referred to the use of the word &ldquo;suspected&rdquo;.  I think it would be a far better safeguard if it read &ldquo;diseased or suspected of disease&rdquo; Again we are dealing with the foot-and-mouth disease mentality.  I would put it to Senator Counihan that it has occurred on many occasions that a municipal veterinary inspector in the market found an animal which had symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease. That animal may be the only animal the owner had in the market and there may be no information as to what its previous contacts were.  Actually, the diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease is made when a large number of animals become infected quickly.  You will, of course, come across an isolated case of an animal with a lesion having the semblance of foot-and-mouth disease but it may not be foot-and-mouth disease on that account.  It may be a type of stomatitis which would mean inflammation of the <Col N="745" /> tongue and mouth.  If a veterinary inspector finds an animal or a few animals showing symptoms of a disease that may be foot-and-mouth disease, what happens is that the local authority's inspector contacts the central authority.  The central authority is quite convenient to the City of Dublin and the Department's inspectors come on the scene.  They have the onus then of declaring whether it is or is not foot-and-mouth disease.  I think that if the word &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; were put in it would facilitate the local authority's inspector and it would certainly be a help to the central authority's inspector because what would happen in the interval is this. With the facilities available in the Dublin market the whole traffic in animals could be held up until such time as the examination by the Department's inspectors took place without having any scare created.  There would be no publication or scare until the investigations were made and the diagnosis confirmed or otherwise.  It would get over the difficulty of definitely saying that the animal was diseased.</P>
    <P>This section applies to every other disease that is scheduled as well as foot-and-mouth disease, but foot-and-mouth disease is the one which is in all our minds at present in view of the outbreak we had and the fact that another outbreak is an every-day possibility when you have such numerous outbreaks on the other side of the Channel.  I think that the outbreaks on the other side of the Channel are caused by the meat of animals which have been affected with foot-and-mouth disease being distributed throughout the country and fed mainly to pigs, because a lot of these outbreaks are amongst pigs.  It is probably through contamination of the food supply of pigs that these outbreaks have taken place.  However, we are not out of danger, although the sea is between us.  There is still great danger of a recurrence of foot-and-mouth disease in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with penalties and here again we are obsessed with the foot-and-mouth disease mentality. The original Act covers sheep scab <Col N="746" /> amongst other diseases, and from year to year many other diseases have been added to the diseases scheduled under the Act of 1894, so that actually this penalty of £100 would be applicable to offences against any of these Orders.  That would look as if the Legislature attached great importance to this question of sheep scab.  I regard the question of sheep scab as being very important, because I believe it is one of the disease we should have eliminated long ago out of this country.  Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in doing that.  A penalty of £100 for failure on the part of an owner to report an outbreak of sheep scab seems enormously high in view of the fact that this year the Dublin Corporation prosecuted a person for having 75 sheep, which meant every animal in his place, affected with sheep scab and he was only fined 1/- per head, or 75/- in all. I think it is worth mentioning this in view of the fact that district justices do not all view the Orders and Acts of the Legislature with the same seriousness.  In this case the fine was 75/- for 75 animals, or every animal in the man's place, whereas in another case brought before the District Court in the city a man who had, I think, five sheep in the market affected with sheep scab was fined £15 or, at the rate of £3 per head, so that there is often injustice done to owners of sheep owing to their cases being brought before different district justices.</P>
    <P>Now that we are increasing the possible maximum penalty to £100, there may be greater discrepancies in the sentences or in the fines imposed, and if a district justice looks on a case very seriously he could easily fine a person £50 for an outbreak of sheep scab or one of the other diseases, such as swine fever.  Another district justice might fine a man perhaps 10/- a head. A person guilty of an offence under the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Order might merit a fine up to £100, but the fact is that there are other diseases of lesser importance included in the same Acts and, if that penalty would apply to them all, we may have comparative injustice done to different defendants in the cases brought to court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> I think the compensation is covered fairly satisfactorily in Section 8.  The Bill has been amended in the Dáil, so that if there is any disagreement between the Ministerial side and the owners, there is a system of arbitration. I think that has been satisfactorily dealt with in the other House.</P>
    <P>One thing that strikes me, so far as Section 9 is concerned, is that we have this antiquated system of the General Cattle Diseases Fund.  There is also the Pleuro-pneumonia Fund, which exists in the Act of 1894.  For that reason I think the Minister should be preparing the way to have a general revision of the Diseases of Animals Acts.  In the Act of 1894, in so far as it applies to Ireland, there is a clause that says that there is no necessity for a veterinary inspector to be appointed at all.  That might have been reasonable enough at the time, because there were very few members of the veterinary profession in this country and it was then possible that people who were not veterinary surgeons could deal with outbreaks of these diseases.</P>
    <P>That Act is antiquated in its general application to this country.  Section 65, dealing with fines recoverable under the Act, sets out that they shall be applied in so far as a part thereof, not exceeding one-third, may be awarded to the informer and the rest to the Crown, to be applied in aid of the general account of the General Cattle Diseases Fund.  The Crown was then in existence in this country, but the extraordinary thing is that this clause was specially framed to deal with the Act as it applied to Ireland.  In so far as it applied to England or Scotland, I could not see any trace of the provision dealing with the informer.  It is about time, in legislation dealing with technical diseases of animals, or any other diseases, that we should get rid of the phraseology concerning informers.  I have no objection to the phraseology still retaining the Crown in all these Acts that we had to adopt on the establishment of the Irish State.  The time has arrived for a new suit of clothes instead of all this patchwork legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> I should like to deal with the point raised by Senator Counihan in connection with the Tuberculosis Order. Certain kinds of bovine tuberculosis are notifiable under the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The valuation as arranged under the Order is the market value of the animal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuation, yes, but what about the compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuation will be the actual market value of the animal.  Only this week we slaughtered an animal which was valued over £30. There is a clause in the Tuberculosis Order which prevents the local authority from slaughtering an animal the valuation of which is over £30. That slaughter is prevented until the consent of the Department of Agriculture is obtained.  We had to get the consent of the Department of Agriculture because the animal was valued at over £30.  That tears the bottom out of Senator Counihan's argument about valuing a cow for 30/-.  If the cow was valued at 30/- that must be all she was worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>She was valued at £6 and only a quarter of the valuation is allowed to be paid&mdash;I am definite on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan said a veterinary inspector could not value the animal for more than £6 That is not so.  He can value the animal, but the valuation must be an agreed valuation.  There is a provision dealing with disputes about valuation.  If Senator Counihan owns an animal and I have to value it, we have to agree on the valuation and we can agree on a valuation up to £30.  If we go over that amount we have to get the consent of the Department.  If we disagree on the market value of the animal, an independent valuer may be brought in.  All that is provided for, so that the Senator seems to be absolutely misinformed so far as the Tuberculosis Order is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as regards compensation for the animal, it is paid on the <i>post mortem</i> findings.  It is not just one <Col N="749" /> quarter of the valuation; it is a quarter of the valuation if the animal is found to be infected and advanced, and it is threequarters if the animal, found to be infected, is not advanced.  It does not lie with the inspector to tell the person concerned whether the disease is advanced or not.  The owner has the right to have his own veterinary surgeon.  Naturally, the owner will not be in a position to estimate whether the disease was advanced or not, but he can have his own veterinary surgeon present at the slaughter.  He gets full compensation and £1 over if the veterinary surgeon who orders the slaughter is wrong.  It is a pretty fair system generally.</P>
    <P>The Tuberculosis Order in so far as dealing with the elimination of tuberculosis from cattle is concerned, is absolutely useless.  It is a public health Order, but it will never do anything to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle.  It is framed simply to prevent the transference of tuberculosis from the bovine to the human subject.  I do not want to go any further into that.</P>
    <P>Some of the clauses dealing with whether the disease is advanced or not advanced are sometimes unfair to the owner.  Where there are lesions on the pleura and peritoneum, that will make the infected animal advanced, whereas there are other cases where there may be far more tuberculosis in the carcase and it will be classified as not advanced.  There are difficulties in that way in so far as interpreting the effect of the Order goes.  There is hard luck in some cases.</P>
    <P>There is one defect in our present Tuberculosis Order.  It was copied word for word from the English Order &mdash;we copied it, mistakes and all.  I only hope we are departing from the line followed by the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Orders in England.  We have taken our own line from our own experience.  Since this Bill was introduced, I have seen in a veterinary paper that in England they are up against a problem which we are actually dealing with in this Bill&mdash;the question of the carcase of an animal either in contact with foot-and-mouth disease or infected by an infected <Col N="750" /> animal.  In mentioning that point, I express the hope that we have reached the stage where we can do things on our own without copying what is being done across the water, whilst always drawing from the experience they have obtained.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Tuberculosis Order defect, simply because we copied the phrase, mistakes and all, and it is there in that Order still.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the points raised by Senator Counihan regarding valuation.  If an animal has to be valued, it must be at the market value and it is not very easy to say what the market value would be of a cow bought in the market last week, brought to the dairymen's premises and then, after three weeks, found to be affected with tuberculosis of the udder.  One must realise that that animal, brought back to the market again, will have lost its bloom and will not be a fresh cow.  There is difficulty in agreeing on this, but the Order provides for agreement between the owner and the inspector.  Therefore, the Senator, in his remarks about the Tuberculosis Order, was quite misinformed.</P>
    <P>This is really the first Bill dealing with animals' diseases of this nature that has come before the Seanad in my time and I hope that I am being of some assistance to the House and to the Minister in raising these points for discussion.  The profession has brought several points to the Minister's notice already.  Generally, the Bill meets all requirements, in the narrow scope of the amendments which it covers.  We are urgently in need of a codification of all these diseases of animals.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will seriously consider the recommendations of the Post-War Agriculture Committee and I would also request him to publish their Third Interim Report as quickly as possible.  That report is now in the hands of the Department of Agriculture for a considerable time.  We have asked for it but, naturally, the Minister has replied that it must be placed before members of the Oireachtas before anybody outside the Department may see it.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession can be of <Col N="751" /> the greatest assistance to the farming community in the post-war period and, to this end, they have already given evidence before the Post-War Agriculture Committee, though on what lines the committee has reported on that evidence we will not know until the Third Interim Report is published. The farmer certainly requires the assistance of the veterinary profession in his everyday life and we feel that, by a reorganised system of services, the profession will be able to save the farming community some of the immense losses which they have to bear on account of preventable as well as epizootic diseases.  The loss through preventable disease has been estimated at something like £7,000,000 annually, which is a very big sum; and if even half of that loss could be saved, it would mean a lot in the collective revenue of farmers for the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>After the very long speech from Senator O'Donovan, which was very interesting in parts, I do not propose to hold the House long on this Bill.  I realise that the Minister is anxious to get the measure through, and it is the kind of measure on which there can be co-operation. While we hope this measure will not have to be called into use, it is an instrument which one must have ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take in the points made by Senator O'Donovan and try to incorporate them in the Bill.  It seems to me important that every possible case of compensation should be covered by the Bill.  The Senator makes a point with regard to a young calf, fed on milk, that has been contaminated, and if a death from that cause is not covered, it seems important that it should be.  In the effort to eradicate disease, no one should feel aggrieved by having sustained losses he may not be compensated for, while others have received compensation.  I would like to have heard Senator O'Donovan tell us whether there is any problem with regard to diagnosis in the case of an <Col N="752" /> animal like that, but I would not like to bring him to his feet again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the necessity for codification of the law regarding these diseases generally. One cannot read this Bill without realising the difficulties of the layman in trying to discover exactly what the law is.  In fact, I put it to the House that even lawyers will have to do a great deal of research in order to find out exactly what this Bill purports to do.  I hope that, at a very early date, the Minister will codify all the law dealing with this problem, of veterinary disease.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he has the recommendations of the Post-War Agriculture Committee on the problem of veterinary diseases in general, and Senator O'Donovan has pressed that he ought to publish their report.  I urge him not alone to publish the third report, but to set about implementing it.  I think its implementation is much more important, indeed.  It is required very badly and the least possible time should be lost in putting it into operation. Perhaps the Minister would tell us the speed at which he is travelling towards that end, as we are concerned about the future of our live stock. These diseases are our greatest difficulty and greatest handicap to-day and are most depressing in the development of our live stock.  They are problems which should be tackled through a better-planned scheme than there is operating at the moment. The Minister, perhaps, may have something more to say on that point.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  Senator O'Donovan, in passing, referred to foot-and-mouth disease across the water.  Hardly a week passes that one does not see announcements of two and perhaps more outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in England.  We here must feel rather perturbed about these continuous outbreaks.  We are perturbed at all times to know exactly what precautions are being taken to safeguard us from this invasion, the most insidious that we could possibly have to fight.  We noticed recently that more vigorous steps have been <Col N="753" /> taken, I presume, by the public health authorities in conjunction with the Minister's Department, to safeguard this country against the possibility of people from the other side who may have had contact with the disease coming in here unless they are thoroughly disinfected.  One hears rather disquieting suggestions on this head.  I have no knowledge of what the position is, but I have been told on more than one occasion that the disinfection carried out is a rather cursory performance.  The Minister, I think, ought to tell us what exactly the situation is in that regard.</P>
    <P>The precautions we take, no matter how vigorous, could not be too thorough in order to safeguard ourselves from the possibility of further outbreaks of this disease in the country.  Quite clearly, whatever Senator O'Donovan may know of the possibilities of danger in regard to the importation of meat from the Continent of America to Britain months or years ago, we, at all events, know that there is constant contact with the Continent of Europe without the possibility of disinfection of people in course of transport and so on.  In view of that, one can visualise the difficulties of the British people in trying to control a situation of that sort.  We here cannot afford to be slipshod.  We can have no sympathy with people crossing over here who want to scamp the operation of decontamination.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some reassurance to the House on these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject before the House is not one that I, personally, am acquainted with.  I have listened to the very learned explanation given by Senator O'Donovan. Arising out of what he said one or two points have occurred to me which it may be useful to put before the House. I should like to know how it is that there can be such a great variation in the valuation of animals.  Senator O'Donovan said that in one case an animal was valued at £30.  Senator Counihan, in another case, gave a valuation of £6.  There is very great difference between these two valuations, and it is difficult for the ordinary layman to understand how it occurs.  It <Col N="754" /> may be that the valuation is influenced by the parts of the body that may be used.  I am not going to enter into that.  Perhaps Senator O'Donovan, at a later stage, will tell the House if the valuation depends on the nature of the disease.  I take it that Senator Counihan's idea is that the disease should be dealt with at an early stage: that farmers and stockholders should be encouraged to report these cases early so that preventive measures might be taken.  Perhaps if that idea were acted on, there would not be the great variation in value that we have been told about, ranging from £30 to £6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan has welcomed this Bill on behalf of the veterinary profession.  I welcome it on behalf of the legal profession, because legislation by reference gives more and more work to lawyers and involves more people who require legislation to be interpreted for them.  It would be impossible to interpret this Bill without having a well-equipped law library containing not only the necessary statutes but also the necessary books relating to the interpretation of statutes.  As a matter of interest, I went through my statutes, and I found, first of all, that the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, was a consolidating Act itself.  It was an Act passed to consolidate the Contagious Diseases of Animals Acts from 1878 to 1893. Only a year elapsed before the British Legislature thought it necessary to consolidate those Contagious Diseases of Animals Acts.  Now 50 years have elapsed since the principal Act referred to in this Bill&mdash;the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894&mdash;was enacted, and since then it has been amended at least ten times.  It was first amended in the year 1896&mdash; Sections 24 and 26 of it.  It was again amended in 1903 for the purpose of the compulsory adoption of remedies for sheep scab when further Orders were made under it.  It was next amended in the year 1909.  That was what I might call a pleasant surprise for the members of Senator O'Donovan's profession, because under that amending Act a veterinary surgeon, or veterinary <Col N="755" /> practitioner, was entitled to a fee not exceeding 2/6 for every notification of a diseased animal.</P>
      <P>In 1911, for the first time, poultry were brought within the ambit of the Diseases of Animals Acts.  The 1911 Act was passed to enable Orders to be made under the Diseases of Animals Acts for protecting live poultry from unnecessary suffering and for other purposes connected therewith.  There was a further amending Act in 1914, in connection with the general cattle diseases fund.  The next Act which bears on this was the Agricultural Act of 1931 which transferred the administration of these Acts from the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland to the Minister for Agriculture.  Then there was the Diseases of Animals Act, 1932, which amended Section 71 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, dealing with the amount to be levied for the purposes of the said section.  The next Act was the Poultry Diseases Act, 1934, which was an Act to extend the Diseases of Animals Acts to poultry and to poultry eggs, and to make provision for other matters connected therewith. The next was the Diseases of Animals Act, 1935, which was an Act passed to amend the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, in relation to the slaughter of animals affected with disease, and the last Act passed before this Bill was introduced was the Diseases of Animals Act, 1938.  That was an Act to amend the Diseases of Animals Acts, and the Poultry Diseases Act of 1934, by the insertion of the words &ldquo;ducks and geese&rdquo; in the definition of poultry since these words had been omitted from the Act of 1934.  I now come to this Bill.  It would be impossible for a country solicitor, a local authority or the rural community to appreciate their responsibilities and liabilities under the Bill which is now being enacted without full and proper advice as to the effects of previous legislation.  It may be said that this Bill was introduced as the aftermath of the foot-and-mouth disease.  Section 6, which was referred to by Senator O'Donovan, states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever any diseased animal is <Col N="756" /> found by a veterinary inspector in a market, fair, sale yard, or other public place, it shall be lawful for the inspector to cause to be seized any animal (whether it is or is not diseased or suspected of being diseased) in such market, fair, sale yard, or other place and to cause such animal to be placed and kept in isolation....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;diseased&rdquo; there?  A veterinary surgeon who is not a lawyer and who may not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;diseased,&rdquo; within the meaning of the Act, may seize an animal which is not diseased within the meaning of the Act.  Under Section 59 of the Act of 1894, &ldquo;diseased&rdquo; means &ldquo;affected with disease,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;disease&rdquo; means &ldquo;cattle plague (that is to say, rinderpest or the disease commonly called cattle plague) contagious pleuro-pneumonia of cattle (in this Act called pleuro-pneumonia), foot-and-mouth disease, sheep pox, sheep scab, swine fever (that is to say, the disease known as typhoid fever of swine, soldier purples, red disease, hog cholera or swine plague).&rdquo;  This Bill contains no definition of the word &ldquo;disease&rdquo; and, therefore, a veterinary surgeon, while presumably knowing the law, may not know its application and may use in a wrong case what I might describe as the rather arbitrary powers given by the Bill.  Therefore, I say the necessity for qualification and definition was never more important than it is to-day.  Every amending Act is another square peg in a round hole, because, as Senator O'Donovan justly remarked, the fine of £100 introduced by this Bill may apply to sheep scab and to some alleged suffering of live poultry, as well as to offences in respect of foot-and-mouth disease.  In a consolidating Act, every type of diseases of animals would be put in its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>While the Minister said that this was an amending Bill, he did not say, so far as I remember, why it was an amending Bill.  We must only infer that it is so as a result of the experience of the Minister and his Department during the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. <Col N="757" /> Under Section 3 (3), the Minister will pay compensation for animals which were directed to be slaughtered but died before slaughter.  He told us that such payments were made during the comparatively recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  This Bill is not retrospective, and I wonder what the Comptroller and Auditor-General had to say as regards those payments. I suppose they have already been explained to him.  If such payments were made, there is no reason why the Minister should not face the situation and introduce some section or subsection to validate those payments. Section 9 of the Bill provides that the Minister</P>
    <P>&ldquo;may pay from the General Cattle Diseases Fund into or for the benefit of the Exchequer at such time and in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct any sum paid into that fund as a result of a prosecution under the Principal Act for an offence to which this section applies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section applies to an offence related to foot-and-mouth disease which was committed</P>
    <P>&ldquo;after the 20th day of January, 1941, and before the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister gave no explanation as to why he has inserted the 20th January, 1941, in this Bill.  As I am not in the cattle trade, and am not a veterinary surgeon, I cannot say what significance the date, 20th January, 1941, has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has great significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will tell us that.  I think that Section 6 places unlimited powers in the hands of veterinary inspectors.  A veterinary inspector may go into the Dublin Cattle Market and, if he finds a diseased animal, within the meaning of the Act of 1894, he has power to put all the animals in the market into isolation.  The Minister has not said how such animal is to live while in isolation.  Who is to feed him or how long is he to be kept there?  The Bill provides that the isolated animal may be removed as soon as circumstances <Col N="758" /> permit, but circumstances may require the animal to be detained in isolation for a considerable time, while the veterinary inspector may have been quite wrong and the alarm may have been a false one.  The section, as it stands, is more satisfactory from the point of view of the public than the amendment suggested by Senator O'Donovan.  Under that amendment, a veterinary inspector, if he suspected disease in one animal, would have power to isolate the whole cattle market.  That might be very good as regards the prevention of disease but the owners of the other cattle in the market should have some rights. We are all living in the midst of suspected disease, and animals move and have their being amongst other animals suspected of disease.  Therefore, I say that Section 6 should be so drafted as to ensure that its application will arise only in certain, definite cases.  I should like the Minister to say what compensation, if any, will be given to the owner of cattle which have been isolated.  It might happen that a farmer or cattle dealer would have sold his cattle in the Dublin market for export and the isolation of those cattle might result in their missing the boat and missing the market on the other side.  The isolation of those cattle may mean a substantial loss to the owner of the cattle.  I say, therefore, that this is a section of the Bill which requires very careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as far as the Bill itself, as a whole, is concerned, I do not find very much difficulty with it from the legal point of view, because I have considered all the other Acts in connection with it, but I can only repeat that 50 years have elapsed since the Diseases of Animals Act of 1894 and that, as Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, that was a rather archaic Act; that also it was an Act primarily concerned with England, Scotland and Wales, and that Ireland only came in through the back door, so to speak.  With regard to the provisions relating to Ireland, under that Act, I think that there are at least about 14 sections, which would require a lawyer to interpret, having regard to the remaining <Col N="759" /> sections of the Act.  In particular, Section 65 of that Act says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;for the purposes of the execution of the Act in Ireland the powers by the Act conferred on the Board of Agriculture shall be vested in the Lord Lieutenant acting by the advice of the Privy Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the Irish Free State was set up in 1922, and 22 years have elapsed since then.  This an agricultural country, and I say that legislation dealing with agricultural matters should be written in plain language&mdash;language which the people in rural districts can understand&mdash;because if you bring in a Bill, or pass an Act, enlarging a fine from £20 to £100 for an offence, it can easily be the case that the person concerned may not be aware, in the first instance, that he has committed any offence, since the provision dealing with the matter may be hidden away in some Act which he has never seen or heard of.  At the same time, it must be remembered that that does not exempt him from the penalty of the fine.  I think, therefore, that in fairness to people who are liable to penalties in such cases, the provisions involving penalties in these Acts should be put down in black and white so that the ordinary person can understand them.  I hold that these provisions should be put in plain language and made accessible to every person in the State.  Now the various Diseases of Animals Acts, from 1894 to 1938, are not accessible to these people.  A person cannot go down to the Government Publications Sales Office and purchase a copy of the Act of 1903, dealing with sheep scab: he will have to write over to the Stationery Office in London to get this Act. Accordingly, I say that our Government has a duty to the people of this country to ensure that not only every Bill introduced by the Government here, once it becomes an Act, should be available to the people of this country but also that our own people should not be required to write abroad in order to procure copies of Acts that are amended, such as the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894.</P>
    <P>I have very little further to say.  The Minister has told us that the post-war <Col N="760" /> emergency committee has already reported on the matter of veterinary services in connection with diseases of animals.  We do not know what their report is, and the Minister says that it will probably involve the introduction of further legislation, under which the recommendations in the report will be implemented, and that a Consolidation Bill will be introduced.  Now, the findings of that report may be implemented in five or, perhaps, ten years' time, and some portions of it may never be implemented. Accordingly, I suggest that even now, before this report comes up for consideration, the Minister should, at all events, lay the ground for the immediate introduction of a Consolidation Bill.  There are several grounds for the introduction of such a Bill, and there is certainly sufficient ground for its introduction now, for when the report of the commission comes to be dealt with, it will only mean one additional Act to the Consolidation Act.  I say, therefore, that, while I know very little about animals or their diseases, I do claim to know something about the various Acts relating to these matters, and this is the reason for my observations on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish to rise for a few moments in order to welcome Senator Ryan to the ranks of those of us who, time after time, for many years now, have appealed against legislation by reference.  I have been doing so for over 20 years now, and particularly I have objected to legislation by reference where old and somewhat obsolete English Acts of Parliament were concerned.  It was quite evident, when our State was being established over 20 years ago, that we should have to take over a large body of what had been British law and incorporate it in our own legislation, but it should have been the definite aim by all Parties here to choose the earliest opportunity of bringing in a Bill which would embody all the matters that were relevant in regard to the particular matter concerned, and which would be complete in itself.  After that, no doubt, there would have to be some minor amendments by way of reference, but I think it should definitely be Government <Col N="761" /> policy in every case to choose the first opportunity of bringing in a comprehensive Bill, covering all the relevant sections of previous Acts, dealing with the matter concerned, so as to make the legislation easier of comprehension, if not, perhaps, for the lawyers, at least for the ordinary people in the country.  I am not saying that this applies necessarily to this Act only. My view is that it applies to most of the Acts that have been passed during the last 20 years here.  In my innocence, I thought that that suggestion might have a stronger appeal to the present Government than to the previous Government, since I thought that they had less excuse than their predecessors, who had held office for ten years; but they have carried out exactly the same policy, and I hope that it is not too late now to ask for a change of policy in that regard. Again I wish to say that I am particularly glad that Senator Ryan has joined the ranks of those of us who have been appealing for so many years for something in that line being done.</P>

      <P>I do not want to turn the Diseases of Animals Bill into a debate on the question of Parliamentary draftsmanship, but since the matter has been introduced, and as I am a lawyer, I wish to make a few remarks in that connection.  I disagree with Senator Ryan that Bills of this kind are good for the legal profession.  They are not.  Nothing of this kind that brings the law into disrepute is good for the legal profession, and the fact that no ordinary person, and only a few solicitors and a mere handful of lawyers, can make their way through the jungle of statutes and come out safely on the other side of the jungle, should be proof that anything of this kind is not good for the legal profession.  An eminent judge recently pointed out that whereas the ordinary inhabitants of the jungle were able to find their way through the jungle paths, the officials responsible for the overgrowth of the trees and brushwood, afflicting the legislation of the Department concerned, had now got to the stage in which they were losing their <Col N="762" /> own way.  There is actually no necessity for this kind of thing. When, at the start of this State, we took over a body of legislation from the British, it was a bad beginning not to have made some effort at consolidation, but since then we have allowed that jungle, if I may call it so, of legislation to reach to an extraordinary growth and a monstrous fruition.</P>
      <P>If you wanted to see an example of how not to draft Bills, I could give a selection from those that have been passed in the last few years.  I notice that in the Report of the Vocational Commission, the commissioners were kind enough to suggest that the lawyers, in their spare time and without any remuneration, might undertake the offhand job of codifying the whole law of the country.  That is an impossibility, but a step can be taken towards it and the first practical step that could be taken would be to endeavour to make each Bill something in the nature of a Consolidation Bill.  Steps have been taken in that direction.  The new Arterial Drainage Bill is a step in that direction. The Bill which will be shortly coming before us dealing with mental diseases and mental hospitals is another step in that direction.  I should like to recommend to the Minister for Agriculture the excellent example which has been set by his Ministerial <i>confreres</i> in these two Bills.  I am aware that I am now perilously near talking entirely off the subject before the House, but seeing that the matter has been introduced, I really could not let the opportunity pass without saying how strongly I agree with Senator Ryan and Senator Douglas on this matter.  It is really serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the whole of Senator Ryan's speech but I am quite sure that if I had, I would agree with it in the main.  One reads of the 1894 Act and Orders made thereunder and we know that power is given to local authorities to make Orders.  We have, therefore, to search not alone for Orders made by the Department but also for Orders made by the local authorities in order to ascertain what <Col N="763" /> is the law in regard to sheep scab and kindred matters.  I think it is a pity that all these Acts and Orders were not codified long ago.  I imagine that a codifying Bill could be brought in that would be adequate to deal with any emergency that might arise in future.  It could show the powers given local authorities by the Minister &mdash;powers about the removal of animals, manure, hay, straw and other articles, and the prescribed penalties for contravention of these Orders.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan thinks that a penalty of £100 is too much in cases of prosecution for sheep scab.  I do not think any fine could be too much in cases of that kind because sheep scab is a very serious disease.  If sheep become affected with scab, it is nearly impossible to put sheep on the same land for a period of three years afterwards. The disease spreads like wildfire all over the country and I, therefore, think that a penalty of £100 is not too much.  Of course, that is the maximum penalty and a fine as low as 1/- can be imposed.  I would be glad if, even before the Committee Stage of this Bill were reached, something could be done to codify the law on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene only to break the spate of legal argument by professional lawyers.  I can say with Fintan Lalor that I am not a lawyer but I have had the experience of endeavouring in certain circumstances to read Bills much worse than this Bill and of attempting to relate one set of statutes and enactments, rules and regulations, including Emergency Powers Orders, to other legislation and of finding that the maze was one which I was unable to get through. The point I want to make is that all these statutes affect the lives and the pockets of ordinary citizens.  They impose penalties for offences created under these statutes.  These penalties are imposed by the courts on the plea that it is everybody's duty to know the law.  I think we have had the experience in this House that even Ministers do not always know the law as formulated in Bills which they bring before the House.  When they are <Col N="764" /> asked what are the implications of these Bills they sometimes find themselves up against a difficulty.  That applies even to those of them who are lawyers, not merely to those who are not trained lawyers.  I should like to urge on the Minister for Agriculture that he should set his Department to the task of codifying the law relating to the activities of that Department. I do not say that it can be done immediately. It would be a very long job, no doubt, but there should be some assurance from the Minister that he is alive to the need for this work and that he is taking the necessary steps to see that codification is brought about at the first opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an unexpectedly interesting debate on this Bill.  We started off on the rather low plane of sheep scab and we ended on the high plane of the theory and foundation of legislation in general&mdash;a thing I was not prepared for, I may say.  However, it is interesting to hear lawyers disinterestedly talking about law, not from the point of view, as one Senator said, of what they might make out of it, but altruistically talking on behalf of the man in the street, that he might understand the law, which, I think, is a very commendable thing. I should like to assure Senator Duffy that no Minister can possibly, as things stand, give an assured interpretation of a clause in any Bill he may bring in, because that is the function of the courts, and the courts may not agree with the Minister's view.  Therefore, the Minister can only say to the best of his ability what is the object of any Bill which is brought before the Seanad.  I would not undertake to interpret in this House a clause of any Bill.  After hearing some lawyers here express their opinions, I would prefer to confine myself to such things as sheep scab, foot-and-mouth disease and such matters.  I should like to say, however, in regard to the consolidation of the laws, that the Government has decided to go ahead with it. There is, as a matter of fact, at least one set of laws from my own Department with the draftsman at the moment.  The laws dealing with <Col N="765" /> fisheries will come before Parliament in a consolidated form&mdash;I think that is the correct term, not &ldquo;codification&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I think they will be ready early in spring.  I hope many others will follow on the same lines.  We had considerable difficulty, I might say, in deciding the procedure to be adopted. Various ways were suggested.  I think we shall have again to go into the matter of how they will be presented, whether they will be presented in a certified form, simply saying: &ldquo;This is the law as certified by eminent lawyers.&rdquo;  I do not know yet in what way the matter will be dealt with, but at any rate the first set is being prepared. To come back to the discussion on this Bill, Senator Counihan raised the point about compensation. Before he ended he said he was afraid he might be ruled out of order.  With all due respect to the Chairman, I think if he had read the 1894 Act he would have ruled him out of order, because tuberculosis is not mentioned in that Act at all, and, this being an amending Bill, Senator Counihan was very lucky to get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another Senator found it hard to understand the difference between the cattle spoken of by Senator Counihan and by Senator O'Donovan, but I think that was simple enough, because cows vary in value; one may fetch £6 and another £30.  The value taken is the market value, the amount the cow would fetch on a free sale, that is on the appearance of the cow without a veterinary certificate that she is tubercular.  If it is shown that she has advanced tuberculosis on slaughter, only a quarter of that value would be paid; if she is affected, but the disease is not advanced, threequarters of the value would be paid; if she is not affected, that is if the inspector has <Col N="766" /> made a mistake, then the full value is paid, plus £1, I think.  The matter does not come up for review here, but this whole question of tuberculosis in cattle will come up at a later stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the post-war agriculture committee's report, that report will be published, I hope, in the near future.  It will not, I assure Senator Ryan, take four or five years. I think it will be published in the course of a few months.  In fact, it is only the present delays in printing that will hold it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the implementation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of it &mdash;to whatever extent the Government decides to implement it&mdash;I think will follow in very quick time.  We can afford to wait for that implementation and for the legislation that will be necessary before we think of consolidation in regard to this particular code of the legislation.  Senator O'Donovan mentioned a number of points.  I am quite prepared to give an undertaking with regard to his first point, that the veterinary profession should be consulted before we make the necessary Orders under this Bill if it becomes an Act.  Senator O'Donovan said that he did not see the necessity for legislating for the payment of compensation for animals that might die before there was time to slaughter them.  I think there is such a necessity.  As a matter of fact the Senator himself mentioned that calves die very rapidly after drinking infected milk; so do young pigs, I believe.  All young animals are inclined to die very quickly from this disease.  If an inspector comes along and finds some diseased animals in a place, he may return the same evening or the next morning and find that some calves or young pigs have died.  Again, it may happen that a beast which is suffering from the disease is bought at a fair before showing any signs of the disease, and if that beast is put in amongst a herd the herd will inevitably develop the disease, but the beast that brought it in may not be noticeable amongst the rest.  Sometimes one beast is not very noticeable to the person <Col N="767" /> who is looking after the cattle, and by the time the other animals become infected that beast may be on the point of death.  There are many cases, therefore, where it may be necessary to pay for a beast that has died before there is time to deal with the herd by slaughter.  Senator O'Donovan said we should have included other classes.  He mentioned this class, calves and so on, that might be infected by milk.  Of course they are almost certain to come under some compensation clause or other.  Apart from that, we can always pay compensation <i>ex gratia</i>, as we did during the last outbreak.</P>
      <P>That brings me to a point that was mentioned by Senator Ryan, as to whether we had any observations from the Comptroller and Auditor-General with regard to those payments made during the last outbreak.  I think that where an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is made by any Department with the approval of the Minister for Finance&mdash;of course it cannot be done without his approval &mdash;and where the Estimate comes before the Dáil, the Comptroller and Auditor-General does not interfere because he takes it that everything is in order. That procedure was adopted in this particular case.  Therefore, everything was perfectly in order.  I think it is better that we should leave certain rather unusual cases which may arise in regard to those various diseases to be dealt with by <i>ex gratia</i> payments. We did, for instance, make <i>ex gratia</i> payments during a recent outbreak of anthrax.  We brought in an Estimate to the Dáil afterwards, and everything was fixed up in that way.  I think it is better to adopt that method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to another point with regard to funds.  There was for many years, back to 1894, a fund called the general cattle diseases fund, and a part of that was called the pleuro-pneumonia fund.  The pleuro-pneumonia fund was wound up in 1928.  Since then there has been only the fund called the general cattle diseases fund. Out of that certain diseases are financed, that is diseases which are controlled by the local authorities, like sheep scab.  The diseases which are controlled by the central authority, <Col N="768" /> like foot-and-mouth disease, are not financed out of the general cattle diseases fund; they are financed from the Exchequer.  Senators will see clauses in this Bill appropriating to the Exchequer any fines and so on that may arise in connection with diseases like foot-and-mouth disease.  That, I think, is quite fair; if the Exchequer pays out in the case of any particular disease, then if there are any appropriations from that outbreak the Exchequer should have them.  The general cattle diseases fund is made up partly from a general rate and partly from a grant from the Exchequer.  It is out of that fund that the local authorities finance their schemes in regard to any diseases that may arise. In the case of any diseases which we deal with centrally, we do not take anything out of that fund, nor do we put anything into it either.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan made a point about Section 6, and Senator Ryan also spoke a good deal about that section.  There was a point made by Senator O'Donovan which I should like to have examined.  I do not know whether it is covered by the principal Act in any way; if not, it is possible that some amendment should be brought in.  Senator O'Donovan made the point that it refers to a diseased animal, but does not refer to an animal suspected of disease.  I think he very properly made the point that an inspector might require the power to say: &ldquo;I suspect that animal of disease.  Therefore I must isolate that animal, and, in fact, all the animals in this particular place.&rdquo; I think Senator Ryan was more or less arguing against that.  He thought we were giving the inspectors far too much power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the theory may be with regard to respect for the law, the sanctity of the law, the sanctity of the rights of the individual, and so on, I am afraid that in dealing with a disease like foot-and-mouth disease we will have to give the inspectors a great deal of power.  They must act quickly if they suspect the existence of the <Col N="769" /> disease.  The cause of our big trouble in regard to the disastrous outbreak in 1941 was the fact that there was a certain number of diseased animals at a fair on two occasions.  Were it not for those two fairs, that outbreak would not have been 10 per cent. of what it was.</P>
      <P>In these particular cases, of course, they were not detected, so that I cannot say the inspectors had not the power, but suppose at a market an inspector were to suspect a beast of being affected with disease, if he could not act on that suspicion I think it might lead to a terrible outbreak because these animals would be scattered over the countryside and some would be railed to the seaports.  One does not know where the disease would be spread from that particular market if the inspector had not power to act quickly and decisively and to say that he would not allow any beast to leave that fair but was going to isolate all of them.  If an amendment is necessary to Section 6, I think we will have to face the fact that we are going to give the inspector very full powers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the penalty, I do not think there is very much in the point made by Senator O'Donovan.  If I knew more about the law I could, perhaps, mention many cases where very severe penalties are prescribed. Some of those who transgress may transgress in a very serious way. Others may transgress not in a serious way at all but the same maximum penalty is there and the court decides whether the maximum penalty should be imposed or whether there should be a very small part of the maximum penalty imposed.  It is the same in this case.  For instance, in connection with some of our regulations under the poultry diseases one could not imagine any judge inflicting a penalty of £100 because the person would not make £100, probably, in many years on the poultry and, therefore, in that case, the penalty will have to be very much smaller.  It is a matter for the judge and I think we will have to leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> When Senator O'Donovan was talking about the publication of the report received from the committee on post-war agriculture, Senator Baxter said that we should not only publish but implement it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The Senator does not know what it is.  I have read it and I should say that in all probability the greater part of it will be implemented, because it is, in my opinion, a very good report.  Some of it can be implemented in the very near future, and other parts will not be implemented for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter raised a point about people returning from Great Britain, where there is a rather general outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at the moment.  The precautions taken here are very strict.  Not only the public health authorities but the veterinary authorities are at every port of landing, both by sea and air, and anybody coming in who has had any contact with markets or fairs or farms on the other side, or who is likely to be in contact with animals in any way, is disinfected.  I cannot give the exact details, but I am satisfied, because I have been assured that the disinfection is quite effective and there is no reason whatever for saying it is done in a slipshod manner.  It is not.  It is done very thoroughly and effectively. I may say that that has been the practice always.  Whenever there is an outbreak in Great Britain these precautions are taken here.  Cattle dealers and people connected with the cattle trade who are going across voluntarily come and have themselves disinfected. Some of them, as a matter of fact, make it a practice to change their clothes before leaving the other side so as to be doubtly sure.  They come back in different clothes and still they are disinfected when they arrive.  On the other hand, buyers coming from the other side to our markets have a change of clothes when they arrive. I am not saying that it is done in all cases, but in most cases they have a change of clothes in whatever hotel <Col N="771" /> they stay and they change when they arrive.  They leave off that suit before they leave and go back in another suit. So that those connected with the cattle trade, both on this side and on the other side, co-operate in every way.  They try to have themselves disinfected and to prevent any spread of disease.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan pointed out, we are going back to 1894.  He quoted a very long list of Acts that were passed since that.  I notice that the 1894 Act does not repeal all the Acts that were passed before that.  In some of the sections it says: &ldquo;with the exception of clause so and so&rdquo;.  So that it was not really a thorough consolidation.  I hope that whenever we are dealing with this point we will have better consolidation and have the legislation up to date.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Ryan is right when he says that when I was introducing the Bill I did not say why the amendments are necessary.  I did not. I assumed that the Seanad would conclude why the amendments were necessary.  I did point out what the purpose of the various clauses was, what the present law is, and what these amendments are designed to do. I meant to convey to the Seanad at any rate that in my opinion the changes were for the better and would make things work more smoothly than they have worked up to the moment.</P>
    <P>The 20th January, 1941, is an important date as far as diseases of animals are concerned.  It is the date of the first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 1941 and that date is put in there in order that nobody may escape from the net as far as the fines and so on that were inflicted in connection with the outbreak in 1941 are concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree, of course, that legislation should be written in plain language. Senator Ryan advocated that.  But it is very hard to get lawyers to use plain language and all we can do is to go on trying.  On various occasions I have accepted amendments from members of the Dáil and Seanad and when I <Col N="772" /> referred them to the lawyers, they were astounded that I should say I would agree to them.  Of course, they then drafted for me what the Deputy or the Senator meant to say and what the Deputy or Senator put in three or four words the lawyers put into a page or more and said: &ldquo;That is what he meant.&rdquo;  I think, however, that what the landholder or the farmer wants to know is what are the notifiable diseases.  If he is going to suffer a penalty for not notifying, it is only fair that he should know what are the notifiable diseases.  We do a good deal of advertising and publicising and we try to bring the matter to the notice of farmers as far as we possibly can. When there is an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or sheep scab the place is practically covered with posters pointing out to the farmers that it is a notifiable disease and that failure to notify is an offence and we mention the penalty.  We usually give some information as to how the particular disease may be detected.  I think we cannot do better than that.  We bring to his attention what the notifiable disease is and what the penalty is if he fails to do his duty.  Of course, in due course he finds out the position about compensation and so on.</P>
    <P>We have had a very interesting debate.  There were a few points raised which I should like to look into, and if I find that the points are not covered by the Principal Act or some other Act, it may be necessary to ask the Seanad to make some slight amendments on another stage.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance to the community of the agricultural industry and the necessity of maintaining in that industry the maximum number of persons gainfully employed, this House deplores the inadequacy of the measures taken up to the present for ensuring to the farmer an adequate remuneration for his services and the low level of wages provided for the agricultural worker; calls attention to the unsatisfactory character of the machinery set up by statute to fix and regulate agricultural wages and requests the Government to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  provide by legislation for the payment of a guaranteed economic price for all agricultural produce including live stock and live-stock products, and</P>
      <P>(b)  reconstitute the Agricultural Wages Board in such a manner as to afford to agricultural workers direct representation on the board; and to take such action as may be necessary to ensure that agricultural workers will be paid a living wage adequate to the needs of the worker and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion in the name of Senator Smyth and myself was put down in the hope of drawing attention to the plight of those engaged in the agricultural <Col N="774" /> industry, so that as a result of discussion, an agreement might be reached which would result in raising the standard of living of those on the land.  If this House can do something to improve the position of those engaged in agriculture I am satisfied that it would have justified itself.  I hope that every Senator interested in agriculture, which is the foundation of all our industries, will help in raising the standard of living of those who are engaged in it.  We have had a native Government for a quarter of a century and it has effected many improvements throughout the country, the one exception being agricultural labourers and small-tenant farmers or uneconomic farmers.  I approve of the tillage policy of the Government wholeheartedly.  I support that policy because I believe that every farm, when the land is properly utilised, is the centre of a small industry.  Being in agreement with the Government's tillage policy, I think it is too bad that the standard of living of these workers is so low, and that there should be such a difference between their standard of living and that of other sections of the community.  That is not saying that the standard of any section is too high.  I take it that no Senator will contend that a family could exist at the present time on a wage of £2 weekly.  That is one point upon which I think there will be general agreement.  We hear every day that those engaged in the agricultural industry form the most important section of our people, and that without them the nation could not progress.  Why, then, is that section kept just above the borderline of starvation?  As a matter of fact, it amounts practically to starvation to expect a family to exist on £2 weekly.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government has not tackled the question in some way so that the present state of affairs would end.  There are difficulties. I am not one to minimise these difficulties, but the question is of such vital concern to the existence of the nation that all Parties should join in an effort to raise the standard <Col N="775" /> of living of these people.  Apart from the question of food, what chance have these workers of buying clothing? Since the war started a farm labourer could not afford to purchase a suit of clothes.  Where would the price come from?  Considering the cost of food, everybody must admit that there must be hunger in an average family of seven that has to live on £2 a week. No section requires more clothing and boots than farm labourers and their families.  The price of bed clothing is beyond their reach.  Farm labourers have long hours of work, no holidays, and no conditions of employment. From the cradle to the grave, they do not have holidays, and even if they got them, they would not have the necessary money.  They have no comfort, but hard work.  Is it any wonder then that we read of a decrease in the population of rural areas and of declining school averages?  Can we blame farm labourers for leaving this country to try to better themselves elsewhere?  Who could expect them to stay here, when their wives and children are in poor circumstances, if they can better themselves?</P>
    <P>In rural districts there is a decline in the average attendance at schools as well as increased emigration.  Every county medical officer is complaining about malnutrition, a beautiful word for starvation.  It is no wonder there is malnutrition and that children suffer from malnutrition when their parents or others responsible for them have not sufficient money to buy enough food to keep them.  We hear talk about the prevention of tuberculosis.  Picture the farm labourer who has only one suit of clothes.  He has to work in that suit all day and when he goes home, there is not sufficient firing&mdash;and this is particularly true of Dublin and Meath at present&mdash;to dry his suit, with the result that he has to turn out in that damp clothing next morning.  It is no wonder that the incidence of tuberculosis is as high as it is amongst that section.  I say it is due to want of food, want of clothing and want of firing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in emigration, <Col N="776" /> there was at all times in this country a certain section who were very anxious to emigrate and I will even go as far as admitting that occasionally there may have been isolated cases of persons leaving the country who had no need to go; but remember that the people in rural areas who are now going are forced to leave because of downright poverty and starvation.  What is completely beyond my understanding is how it is that, in a Christian country, we cannot give these people employment, when, by going across to another country, a democratic country, with the same system of Government as ours, they can get employment at big wages. They are employed making implements which, if the war were to end tomorrow, could be dumped into the sea as useless and which, if they are used, must be used for the destruction of life.  In this country we cannot give them employment at decent wages in producing something for the betterment and happiness of humanity in general.</P>
    <P>These people are forced, as I say, to emigrate because of want and starvation in their homes and not because of love for any foreign country.  I am not blaming the present Government &mdash;I am speaking in general&mdash;but if the Government of the Irish people is not fit to provide for these people, we should be honest about it.  I say that they could be provided for here.  We have the raw materials in the shape of land and bogs and useful occupations to which they could be put at a living wage, and I cannot understand why the problem has not been tackled in such a way as to bring that about. If the Government had tackled the question, it would have been done, and I fail to understand why it is the one matter which has been left aside.</P>
    <P>If it were not for the farmer and the farm labourer, I wonder where our neutrality would be.  It is very poor recompense to the farm labourer to have to see his children taking the emigrant ship, and the farmer himself has not much to boast of at present. We hear much about different types of social security schemes, but I remind <Col N="777" /> the House that the Irish people in days gone by were a very proud people.  They went to the far corners of the earth, even to the uncivilised parts, to earn the honest living which they could not get at home, and the majority of the Irish people to-day do not want doles or charity as much as they want employment at good wages. I remind Senators further that this nation will never prosper when we are reduced to putting so many of our people on doles and starvation wages. The only hope for the country lies in putting our people at work which will give a return and give them a decent living wage, because so long as we starve the worker, I believe we starve everybody.  It is not, in my opinion, a good or a sound policy.</P>
    <P>Going back to the days when the State was founded, we find that, in the proclamation of the men of Easter Week, of which we are all proud, it is stated that there should be equal rights for all our citizens Is the principle of equal rights given effect to when the most important man in the nation, the man who is keeping the nation in existence at present, is asked to work every day in the year and every hour of the day, whether wet or fine, for £2 per week, in a nation where people are paid £20 a week?  I cannot see how it can be said that there are equal rights for all citizens on that basis.  I say that it is wrong&mdash;and I do not mind who is offended&mdash;that a small section should get such an amount and that the more important man, so far as the nation is concerned, should get so little.  The higher civil servant is non-productive so far as the nation is concerned.  He is not as important as the agricultural labourer who has to work out in the muck from Monday morning to Saturday night for £2 per week.</P>
    <P>I stand for a decent living wage for all, but we have raised the standard very high in some cases while leaving it very low in the case of the farm labourer.  Not alone have we left the standard of the farm labourer low, but we have passed measures which mark a difference between those living in rural areas and those living in urban <Col N="778" /> centres.  More than one Act and more than one Order made by the Government gives preferential treatment to people resident in cities and urban areas as against those in rural areas. We say that we desire to encourage people to stay on the land, not to leave the rural areas, while encouraging them, even by Acts of Parliament, to move into the cities because it is to their advantage to do so.  That has been done in different Acts, in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, for instance, and it is one of the matters which should be amended forthwith.  If I were living in a rural area and thought my days were coming to an end, it would pay me, if I had a proper interest in my wife and children, to move into the City of Dublin because the amount I would receive would be higher.  It is a bad policy because children reared in a rural area would be trained in agricultural work and would, I believe, be a greater asset to the nation later on.</P>
    <P>So far as the farmer's side of the question is concerned, I do not intend to go at length into that.  I shall leave it to Senator Counihan to put the farmer's side of it.  I am sorry that Senator Baxter is not here.  But I will say that I am not satisfied that the farmer is getting a sufficient price for certain commodities.  I am sure Senator Counihan will put up that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is your motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will please you by saying that I am not satisfied that a sufficient price is being given for oats, and that, down the country, a sufficient price is not being given for milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken in another place with regard to cattle.  I hold that there is not a sufficient price being given for cattle.  The question of the price of cattle is a very big one. After all, I could not expect this Government, even if they were a Government of supermen, to be able to govern <Col N="779" /> the price of cattle in other countries or to be capable of fixing a price for our produce when it goes to another country.  But I do say that I am not satisfied, despite the statement that I saw in the newspapers yesterday from a certain organisation, that the farmer is getting a price for the cattle sold in this country proportionate to what the people have to pay for the meat they buy.  No later than yesterday cattle were bought in the Dublin Cattle Market at less than 5d. per lb. and, allowing for wastage and all that, I am satisfied that the margin is too great between the 5d. per lb. that the producer is getting and the 1/5 per lb. which the poor person in Mountjoy Square has to pay for steak.  That is a point which I should like the Minister to take note of and to have inquiries made into it.  Although the association says, with the approval of the Department of Supplies, that there are not excessive profits being taken by the retailers of meat, I am afraid there are.  The position is this.  When the price of cattle was raised at the commencement of the war, the people engaged in the sale of meat in this country were not very long about raising the price of meat to the workers and to the people generally.  But, now that the price of cattle has fallen to pre-war level, I am sorry to say that the price of meat has not fallen proportionately. No matter what the organisation may say about that position, I am satisfied that there is excess profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the price of cattle in general, I should like to see some sort of price fixed for cattle, because at the present time the price of store cattle is heartbreaking to the farming community. I am one of those who are not unreasonable.  If we do not put the farmer in a sound, economic position, we cannot expect a high standard of living for the labourer; we cannot expect him to give good wages.  On the other hand, if it has come to the point that the farmer is not capable of paying, if the Government is not able to raise the standard of the farmer sufficiently high to enable him to pay good wages, I say that the wages of the <Col N="780" /> labourer should be raised, even if it has to be done by subsidy.  The rest of the people are depending for their breakfast, dinner and supper on the farmer and the labourer and still they want them to remain in a state of semi-starvation.  The whole thing is wrong.</P>
    <P>I would divide those engaged in agriculture into three sections: the big economic, substantial farmer, the farm labourer and the small farmer whom I might term the uneconomic farmer. The uneconomic farmer is the hardest hit at present&mdash;he is finished altogether. Within the last two months I had an illustration of that sad state of affairs. I had a letter from a farmer in Tourmakeady, Co. Mayo.  He is the father of eight children&mdash;five girls and three boys.  He wrote asking if his eldest daughter could get employment in Dublin.  This man has one of the best holdings in the Tourmakeady district. In his letter he says: &ldquo;We cannot sell cattle&rdquo;&mdash;after all, there are very poor store cattle in that area&mdash;&ldquo;we cannot sell sell sheep, we have no pigs.  There is no employment to be had in the district. I produce turf, but I have to sell it at 15/- per ton&rdquo;&mdash;people in Dublin are not getting turf at 15/- per ton.  &ldquo;Not £1 came into this home for the last 12 months.  The shopkeeper has refused to give credit, with the result that I wish to God the war was over so that I could emigrate to the United States with my family.&rdquo;  That man is a native Irish speaker and every member of his family is an Irish speaker.  He was a member of the I.R.A. in his district and he did what he could for the freedom of the country.  He is an honest, industrious farmer.  It is very hard lines that the only prospect for that man is to wish that the war was over so that he could sell out his holding and emigrate to America with his wife and family, if he has sufficient money.  I am sure that those Senators who reside in Connaught are aware of many similar cases to that one.  Men of that type are the backbone of this nation.  Is it not hard lines that, after rearing his family, that man sees no prospect before him but the emigrant ship for himself, his wife and family?  Senator <Col N="781" /> Counihan has put down an amendment to this motion.  I always thought that Senator Counihan was an honest man, but I am very suspicious of him as a result of the putting down of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of derating is one of the biggest questions ever raised in this country and one of the most important.  So far as any land that is tilled is concerned, I do say that no rates should be paid on it because it is an asset to the nation. But I cannot understand why Senator Counihan should put down this amendment in order to cut across my motion.  If Senator Counihan wishes to table a motion that there should be derating of agricultural land, I am prepared to second it in order to have the matter discussed, because I have very strong views on the question of derating, so far as tillage land is concerned anyhow.  I hope, therefore, that Senator Counihan will withdraw his amendment and support the motion and, if he so desires, he can put down his amendment in motion form and I will support it in order to have it discussed at the next meeting of the Seanad.  I hope Senator Counihan will take that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the milk question has been taken up by the Government, but of course that applies only to in and around County Dublin.  Are the responsible authorities aware of the conditions under which dairymen have to work?  Talk about slaves in a foreign country&mdash;nothing could be worse.  The men who have to milk cows, dairy workers generally, are working on the 365 days of the year.  They have to work both in the morning and the evening and yet they are not paid sufficient to give them even the meals they need for the amount of work they have to do.  There are really no conditions of employment for the dairy workers.  The milkmen work hard in <Col N="782" /> order to supply milk to the children of this nation, and I submit that this section of workers has the highest rate of tuberculosis.  What is the reason? These men must work morning and evening; they do not get sufficient rest or food, sufficient warmth or nourishment, with the result that they are easy subjects for any disease.  Their lives are very short because of the conditions under which they have to work.</P>
    <P>I hope that the tribunal that has been established will end once and for all that cruel state of affairs.  I do not know what the conditions in Limerick are, or how they manage there.  I am aware that the dairymen in County Dublin, County Meath and the other counties that supply the city with milk are employed under conditions which are really a disgrace to the nation.  They have to work under really cruel conditions.  I hope if the Minister for Agriculture does not take action in this matter, that the tribunal will give careful consideration to it. These workers are human beings and why should they be treated as one would not treat a dog?  They are not treated as Christians or human beings. The majority of those who employ them should be ashamed to call themselves Christians.  These men cannot even attend their religious duties, such is the nature of their work.  Perhaps in summer time they can, but in winter time they cannot attend their religious duties, even on Sunday.  That is one thing I feel very sore about, and I hope it will be remedied forthwith.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a meeting the other day, said the only hope of the nation was the agricultural industry, that it was going to save the nation, but that the people would have to work harder and would have to be more efficient.  He did not say anything would be done to improve their standard of living.  The agricultural community have worked hard for the last five years, and they have saved this nation from starvation.  So far as our neutrality is concerned, if we were starving we would not be able to <Col N="783" /> remain neutral, and we would be starving if it were not for the effort made by the farmers and their labourers.  The least this nation should do in return is to give the labourers a fair wage and the farmers a reasonable price for their produce.</P>
    <P>The Transport Bill which we passed here has been welcomed by all sections. There are conditions of employment set out in that legislation and I am glad of those conditions of employment. At the same time, that legislation related to transport matters only, transport operating from the city to the rural districts, and I do not see why there should be a difference between civil servants, railway workers and any other types of workers in the country.  While I welcome good conditions for the railway workers, I cannot see why there should be special conditions for them and no conditions for others.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Agricultural Wages Board, that board does not represent the agricultural workers or the farmers so far as County Dublin is concerned.  I know some of the men who represent the farmers on that board and, speaking subject to correction by Senator Counihan, I am satisfied that the farmers of the County Dublin did not select them, and, as far as the labourers are concerned, we had the sorry position that when a wage was fixed last year there was a gentleman on the Agricultural Wages Board supposed to represent the farm labourers of County Dublin and at the time the agreement was signed he was working in Britain, having gone there nine months previously.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister's attention was drawn to that fact and he has remedied the position.  He has put another man in his place.  With all respect to the gentleman put on, I say he represents no section, nor has he the confidence of the agricultural labourers.  I am saying that, although he is a great personal friend of mine and a decent fellow in every respect; but he does not represent the agricultural workers of County Dublin. <Col N="784" /> Somebody asked me how he was selected, what were his qualifications. I do not want to go into that, because if I did I would be following the example of every shabby politician by saying that his only qualification was that he was a member of the Fianna Fáil club in Coolock.  That would be shabby, and I do not say that now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say it.  I know he has not the confidence of the workers of County Dublin, although he is a decent fellow.  I hope some machinery will be set up whereby the farm labourers of County Dublin will have direct representation&mdash;that they will be called together and be able to nominate their own representative. Surely they are entitled to that? Over in the Dáil the position was put strongly to the Minister.  He knew the County Dublin workers were organised and he should at least have consulted the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the Government at the time did realise the position of the farm workers and they brought them from a hopeless position just so far.  Nevertheless, the machinery as at present constituted is not satisfactory and does not represent the farmers of County Dublin.  I do not intend to suggest a solution of the entire problem now being discussed, but have just touched on it here and there.  I know it is a big one and I hope that the House will consider it and try to reach some solution.  If we are not in a position to offer more to the people who have done so much for this country, we are letting down the Irish people.  We should not offer doles.  I am in favour of the dole, if a man is unemployed and cannot find work, but the unemployed generally in the country are against that type of thing.  They want work at a good wage.  If we continue at the present rate for another quarter of a century <Col N="785" /> of native Government, I am afraid we will be a long distance removed from the pride and principle of our ancestors. The other few points I have to make I will reserve for the closing of this debate.  I hope the House will view this motion in the same light as I do and that it will be discussed in the hope of finding some solution for the problem.</P>

      <P>Senator Tunney has asked me to withdraw this amendment and to support the original motion.  I would be very glad to do so, if there were any common sense in the motion he proposed, but as it stands, I cannot in any way agree to it.  Senator Tunney and the Labour Party, when putting down this motion, may have done so with the best intention in the world to help the farmers, but they should know from the reception given by the Government to similar motions for the relief of farmers, proposed in this House by Senator Baxter and myself from time to time, that this motion in the names of Senators Tunney and Smyth has no possible chance of being accepted.  I do not think the House or the farmers want it accepted in that form.  Senator Tunney wants all agricultural produce, including live stock, subsidised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there definitely. The Senator said very little about the farmers' position with regard to agricultural produce and live stock.  His whole speech was on the wages for agricultural workers and the position they were in.  We all know that farmers are losing money this year on cattle, which are making £4 to £5 a head less than last year and £25 a head less than they made during the last war.  Most people know that the price of sheep has dropped practically to half and that pigs are selling for £2 a head less than last year.  The Senator said there was a very bad price for oats. We all know that many farmers grow oats as a cash crop.  A big quantity of that produced this year is a very bad sample and would not be sold even at the Minister's minimum price. Senator Tunney did not tell us how it was to be subsidised or how the Minister was to guarantee the economic price for that produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <P>The majority of crops grown by the farmers in this country are grown for consumption on the farm by the farmer's own stock.  Senator Tunney did not tell the House how we were to subsidise those crops.  Of course, the obvious answer to that is to subsidise fat cattle or live stock which, I suppose, would be more in line with the Senator's motion; but <Col N="787" /> that would raise another contentious question.  I can imagine the discussion then as to whether it should be given to the farmer who reared the calf or the farmer who fattened the bullock, and if the Minister decided&mdash;as he decided before&mdash;on the farmer who fattened the bullock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I can hear Senator Ruane and the Labour Party kicking up a fuss and saying that the small farmers in the west and in most parts of the country had no fat cattle and that this was another injustice to the small farmers who had no bullocks, as the Minister was playing into the hands of the big farmers and graziers. That is the way it would go.</P>
      <P>Some few years ago, I proposed in the Seanad that there should be a subsidy paid on fat cattle for export stall fed.  The idea at the back of that was that we would have stall fed cattle put to produce farmyard manure to grow more and better crops and retain the fertility of the land.  When the Minister turned that down, there is little hope that he will agree to the present motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this motion were accepted it would mean filling the country with Government inspectors.  We have enough of them at present, and the farmers do not want any more of them.  The Government could not pay subsidies in the manner suggested in Senator Tunney's motion without taking the step of appointing additional inspectors.  The result would be that the farmers would simply be persecuted. Our experience of Government measures passed with the object of improving the position of the farmer and agriculture has not, I am afraid, been a very happy one.  For example, we have the Pigs and Bacon Act, which we were told would improve the position of the pig trade; we have licensing regulations of various kinds, and we have a host of Orders made by the Minister.  I am <Col N="788" /> sure that all these measures were passed with the best intentions in the world, but they have all proved to be disastrous so far as agriculture is concerned, so that the position to-day is worse than it was before.  Speaking on behalf of the cattle trade, I desire to say that we do not want any more Government regulations.  We want as little interference as possible with our business.  We want to be allowed to carry it on in our own way without Government interference.  That would be the best thing the Government could do for us&mdash;to allow supply and demand to regulate prices.  I make that statement here with the full authority of the national executive of the cattle trade which considered this matter.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago Senator Baxter raised a question here about the poor demand and the bad prices for cattle. The Minister and Senator O'Callaghan replied on that motion, but in my opinion they both missed the principal cause for the prevailing bad prices.  I think the principal cause is that we have too many young and badly-bred cattle in the country at the moment. Cattle of that class are not wanted anywhere.  Another reason is this: that formerly the cattle produced by small farmers in the south and west were taken up to the big farms in Leinster and fattened or turned into good stores for export to Great Britain.  The position to-day is that most of these big farms have been split up, and, consequently, there is no room on them for the cattle produced in the south and west.  There are very few big farms left in Leinster to take in the small and young cattle bred in the south and west.  I tried to point that out when the Land Bill was under discussion in the Seanad, but I was not allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>I wanted to point out that the splitting up of the few remaining big farms that we have in the country would be a disaster for the small farmers; that the only market which the latter had for their young cattle was the big farm in Leinster.  I had intended to point out that the big farmer and the <Col N="789" /> small farmer are interdependent&mdash;that one cannot exist without the other, and that if we continue to break up the few remaining big farms we have, we will have several motions of the kind that Senator Tunney has moved brought forward in this House and in the Dáil deploring the terrible condition in which the small farmers in the south and west find themselves.</P>
    <P>The principal income of most of the farmers in the south and west, and, indeed, of all the new farmers established on holdings in Leinster, is derived from the sale of their live stock. It does not come from the growing of wheat, beet or oats.  Senator Baxter, when speaking some weeks ago, bemoaned the small prices which stores were making in Cavan.  There are other places besides Cavan where small and young cattle are making bad prices.  I have here a report of a fair held recently in Listowel.  I may tell the House that there is as good land around Listowel as there is in most parts of the country.  The report of this fair was supplied, I imagine, by a reporter from the Minister's Department. It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Listowel fair, held on Wednesday last, was very large, and demand was good for animals showing quality and condition.  The trade for other classes was slow.  Prices, approximately, were: Yearlings, first class, £3 10/- to £6; second class, £2 to £3 10/-.  Two-year-olds, first class, £9 to £12; second class, £7 to £8 10/-.  Three-year-olds, £17 to £20.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks that a farmer can rear a calf and sell it as a yearling at £2 should know that such a thing cannot be done.  That is not an economic price for a yearling.  The question is, how is the Minister going to rectify that position?</P>

      <P>I agree with what is said in the report, that there is good demand for good quality cattle.  I can say that there is sufficient demand for them in England, and that all of them that we can export will be taken from us.  The only thing that is holding up their export is lack of shipping space. If it were available all the good cattle that we have to offer will be taken from us by the people at the other side.  If we persist in the game of splitting up all the big farms and continue to produce badly bred young stock, a policy which has been advocated by the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil people, and even by Senator Sweetman, who has advocated the breaking up of ranches, then the position of the farmer is going to become worse.  I may remind the House that Senator Sweetman, when introducing his Bill a few weeks ago, said that he would not have done so if he thought that the passing of it would interfere with the activities of the Land Commission. According to the Report of the Banking Commission, every new farmer that we set up costs the country £1,100.  That free gift of £1,100 is paid by the taxpayer.  In addition to that free gift, Senator Tunney now comes along and wants the taxpayer to pay a subsidy to these new farmers for what they produce on their land.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that if the Government were to accept my amendment for the stabilisation of rates on agricultural land at the rates prevailing in 1914-15, that could be done without costing one penny in administration.  All farmers, small and big, would benefit proportionately.  It would go in a small way towards redeeming the promises made by Fianna Fáil before they become a Government. It would also have an influence on Partition, since it would help to allay the fears of high taxation shared by farmers in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would have an effect.  Every Party in this State, including Fianna Fáil, have promised derating from time to time, but nothing has been done.  I suggest this half-measure, which would be some relief.  It could be given without engaging in administrative cost, and it would benefit every class of farmer, big and small.  The cost of my proposal would not be very much. It is estimated that the rates raised on land in 1914 in the Twenty-Six Counties was £1,120,000.  The demand for 1943-44 was £2,814,000, so that the amount to be found would be about £1,700,000.  The administration of that scheme would cost nothing.  The farmer would still have to pay about 5/- in the £ on the valuation of his agricultural land, as well as the ordinary rates on his house and buildings, as people in the towns and villages have to pay.  If that concession were made, it would relieve the farmer of some of the rates which go at present to the upkeep of roads which are of very little use to him in his work.  In fact, they are more of a disadvantage to him in their present condition than anything else.  It would also help to relieve him in respect of the rates which he has to pay to provide water supplies, sewerage and other amenities which residents of the towns and villages enjoy at his expense.  Just as Senator Tunney hopes that his motion will meet with the approval of the House, I hope that my proposal for pegging the rates at the 1914 figure will be acceptable.  It is a very small concession to ask from the Minister.  My amendment to the last paragraph of the motion&mdash;to pay the agricultural <Col N="792" /> workers the highest wages the industry can afford&mdash;should satisfy the most extreme worker and the most extreme labour leader.  Senator Tunney has painted a very gloomy picture of the situation of the small farmer and the agricultural worker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is the only farmer who is paying any agricultural workers. What is the solution that Senator Tunney has or the Labour Party have for the relief of depression in agriculture? Last year, the farmers grew an enormous acreage of corn and other crops.  Having gone to the expense of producing those crops, they found themselves with a shortage of machinery, a shortage of labour and the worst harvest weather they had had for many years.</P>
      <P>What was the Labour Party's solution for that situation?  They issued an ultimatum to the farmers of County Dublin for higher wages, shorter hours, weekly half-holidays with pay, annual holidays with pay and several other preposterous demands which the farmers could not concede.  There was an implied threat that, if those demands were not met, labour would be withdrawn from the farmer and his crops allowed to rot.  That is the consideration which Senator Tunney and his colleagues have for the farmers. That is the sympathy they show to those who tried to save the people from starvation and to feed the animal population as well.  There was the threat that, if this wage was not conceded, they would call the men out and let the crops rot.  I do not think that Senator Tunney can deny that.</P>

Senator Tunney referred to the wages of agricultural workers in the North of Ireland and in England.  I say that the wages to which I have referred are better than the wages paid to the agricultural workers in England.  The increase is more than 300 per cent. over the figure for 1914 and the cost of living has not increased by that percentage.  If those workers were in England or the North of Ireland, or in the banks, or the Civil Service, many of them&mdash;single <Col N="794" /> men&mdash;would have to pay income tax instead of getting subsidies and doles. They are doing that in England.  The agricultural worker at the present time is satisfied.  I know many of them and I have discussed the subject with them. They say that, if there is security and constant employment, they want to be allowed to work.  They do not want any more big farms split up; the people who are getting small farms will have to try to work out their own salvation without any more subsidies; they are getting quite enough from the Government.  I would agree to subsidise wheat, beet and milk.  We are doing that at present and further than that I do not think we should go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayden</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion because I consider that it is one of the most important that has been put before the House for a number of years.  As an agricultural worker for over 40 years I think I have experience of what the farmer and the agricultural labourer have to endure in work on the farm.  In 1939, when this emergency started, it should be remembered that the farmers and the agricultural labourers came to the rescue of this nation.  That is why I wish to support this motion.  They came forward and gave of their best in order to produce food so that the people of this nation should not be hungry.</P>
      <P>I can say, as an agricultural worker, who has gone through the mill for over 40 years, that I know the conditions of the farming community.  I do not know what were the wages paid to agricultural workers in the years when I started work.  I admit that they were considerably lower than they are to-day, but what about the high cost of living to-day?  I have had experience with public boards, and I know of cases of some of these people having to look for home assistance.  I know of cases of agricultural workers actually having to look for home assistance because the amount they receive in wages is inadequate to sustain themselves and their families.  I know of cases where the parents are unable to provide food, clothes and shelter on the wages they receive.  I know of cases where the children cannot go to school because they have not got clothes or boots; and where agricultural workers are unable to go to divine service on Sundays owing to a lack of clothing, even though they are in receipt of a wage of £2 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own County of Carlow we have the medical officer of health pointing out that a great number of the children of these agricultural workers are suffering from malnutrition.  The reason they are suffering from malnutrition&mdash;and I think every Senator here will agree with me&mdash;is that their parents cannot afford to buy proper food for them.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture will agree with me on that, <Col N="796" /> and I think he knows that I am not one who makes exaggerated statements. Some people, of course, are always blaming the Minister for all these things, but I think the Minister knows that I am not that kind of person.  About 12 months ago, I heard a man blaming the Minister for Agriculture as being responsible for the lack of water on his land.  That kind of thing is ridiculous, of course, and I am sure that the Minister knows that I do not get up here merely to ridicule him.  I only wish to point out the facts. We have heard Senator Counihan, however, talking about the price of cattle, but the price of prime beef in butchers' shops in the country is 1/6, and the price of mutton is 1/8.</P>
    <P>Every day in the week is a meatless day for the agricultural workers, because they cannot afford to buy either beef or mutton.  I think that the Minister should do something to control the price of beef and mutton at the present time, because the difference between the price for cattle and the price charged by the victuallers is excessive. I know a great many hardworking farmers who have always paid good wages when they could afford to do so, but I cannot agree that all the farmers were always anxious to pay good wages to their workers, and I do not believe that an agricultural worker can support himself and his family in decency on a wage of £2 a week at the present time, and bring up his children as they should be brought up.  I think it is appalling to see the number of children in our country to-day who are without boots or proper clothing. I know that the Government has done a great deal of good work.  I do not wish to deny that, but I do hold that they could do a great deal more so as to enable the farmer to pay a little more to the agricultural labourers and enable them to feed and clothe their children properly.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the cases of many agricultural workers' families, and I find that a wage of £2 a week is not sufficient to provide even three square meals a day for many of these families.  Yet we have the medical officers telling us that our children are <Col N="797" /> suffering from malnutrition.  They are bound to suffer from malnutrition if there is not sufficient money in the household to provide proper food and, apart from malnutrition, they are subject to epidemics of various kinds.  For that reason I hope and trust that the Government will do something to enable the farmers to pay a higher wage to their workers because, at the present rate of wages of £2 a week, it is impossible for an agricultural worker and his family to subsist.</P>

    <P>As it is getting late, I do not wish to detain the House.  I am glad to see that this motion is not in the interests of one class more than another, though no doubt the proposer of the motion stressed the wrongs of one class more than another.  I think it must be admitted on all sides that the farmers and agricultural workers are the two most important sections of the Irish people, because they produce three-fourths of the wealth of the country.  In the old days I happened to be a follower of the late Arthur Griffith.  Arthur Griffith knew the importance of the farming industry and the large part it played in the national economy.  He realised, great thinker that he was, that it was necessary to develop the industrial arm in addition to the agricultural arm, that one section ought to help another.  It is, no doubt, almost impossible to start industries in the present period, because to start industries we have to import from outside the necessary commodities. I am a very strong believer in the afforestation of the country.  I believe that a great deal of wealth rests in that direction, but the Forestry Branch of the Ministry of Lands is held up at the moment because they cannot get wire to fence in land to be planted.  Other industries are also handicapped.  I look to the future when we shall have the homes of the people lighted by electricity, and have brighter and better homes.  In the meantime, the important thing is to carry on life as best we can.</P>
    <P>I have frequently heard Senator Counihan in this House.  He generally gives expression to a great deal of common sense, but I never heard more &ldquo;ballyhoo&rdquo;, as they say in the United States, than I heard from him to-night. Senator Counihan alleged that the quality of cattle in this country has <Col N="799" /> deteriorated considerably since a certain number of breeders went out of business.  I contest that statement, and I tell Senator Counihan here that cross-bred cattle are the best beef cattle.  They are better than pure bred cattle, and they are a greater asset than the few herds of Aberdeen Angus we had in the country.</P>
    <P>Even conceding his point, I would prefer to see people rather than cattle in the country because the wealth of the country lies in the human population of the country.  When the country was divided in ranches, we know how the nation decayed.  Senator Counihan, with his knowledge of the cattle trade, speaks of an open market across the water.  He did not tell us why a certain percentage was paid for cattle in from the Six Counties over and above what is given for cattle sold in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

We cannot be sure that within the next few years our present customers will be able to pay even the present prices for our livestock, so it behoves members of all Parties in this country to try to pull together so as to create a situation here in which the Irish people will be able to consume in their own land all the live stock&mdash;fat cattle, sheep, and pigs&mdash;produced in the country.</P>

      <P>I want to deal only with one question to which Senator O Maille has already partly referred. Senator Counihan stated in answer to a complaint made here by Senator Baxter that there were bad prices for <Col N="800" /> cattle, that we could attribute that to the fact that many of our cattle were badly bred.  For many years past we have heard a lot about efforts to improve the breeding of our cattle.  Is Senator Counihan's contention now that the present quality and breeding of our cattle are inferior to those of former years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, it is tantamount to a vote of censure on the Department of Agriculture.  Are the cattle bred in this country at present inferior to those bred some years ago here?</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate on this motion with interest.  Since the motion affects the farming community and agricultural labourers, I was inclined to approach its consideration sympathetically, but I must admit that so far I have heard no argument that would convince me that I should vote for the motion. Senator Tunney and Senator Counihan indicated that something should be done but further than that they did not go.  Nobody, so far, has been sufficiently explicit in stating what he expects this House to do, what it is that is required from the Department of Agriculture or what the Minister should do to improve the position of farmers and agricultural workers. Sub-paragraph (a)  requests the Government to &ldquo;provide by legislation for the payment of a guaranteed economic price for all agricultural produce, including live stock and live-stock products.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I would be correct in saying that the ruling prices for agricultural produce are higher than they have been since the last Great War, and if the farmers are not prosperous there must be some other reason for it.  I am one of those who believe that prosperity cannot be brought about by the manipulation of prices.  If the farmer's prices are raised to a higher level than those which exist at the moment, if <Col N="801" /> the price of butter is to be increased to 3/6 or 4/- a pound, if the price of bacon is to be raised, if the price of wheat is to be raised, what will happen? I suggest that you will be automatically raising the cost of living, and during the debate here to-night the greatest complaint has been that the cost of living is so high.  Surely it will be agreed that the cost of living affects the farmer as much if not more than anybody else.  I come from an area where the majority of the people are small farmers.  In fact, I come from an exceptional area, because in my county there are about 10,000 agricultural holdings with a valuation of under £20, and approximately only 1,000 holdings with a valuation over £20.  I know that the farmers in County Leitrim and all over the West of Ireland are very seriously affected by the cost of living.  We must all agree that the farmer is a purchaser of butter, bacon, flour and sugar, and if the prices of those commodities are to be increased his standard of living will be affected.  While I agree that the farmer should get the highest possible economic price having regard to all the circumstances, I would not suggest that the cost of living should be raised to a point which would reduce the standard of living, because I have always considered that the standard of living and the cost of living are in inverse proportion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the paragraph which proposes that the agricultural workers should get a higher wage, I agree that the man who works on the land should get as high a wage as it is possible to give him, having regard to the farmer's ability to pay.  I think there has been a great improvement in the wages paid to agricultural workers, and I would say that they are comparatively better off now than they were previously, but I do agree that they are entitled to as good a wage as people in comparable employment.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of agricultural prices, surely we must admit that if normal conditions prevailed we could not export any of our agricultural produce at present prices.  If normal conditions prevailed, other people would be able to produce as good an article <Col N="802" /> at a cheaper price, and those who needed that article would buy it in the cheapest possible market.  At the moment our only exports of any consequence are live stock.  Because we have no control over the prices ruling in a foreign market, we are not able to regulate the price of our cattle.  I agree that there is a great difference between the present price for cattle and the price paid by the consumer for fresh meat.  Nobody has suggested what the Minister for Agriculture is expected to do.  If I heard a convincing argument to the effect that such and such a thing could be done, I assure the proposer of the motion that I would support it, but I have not heard that argument.  I suggest that we cannot assist the people engaged in agriculture by raising the prices for their produce, which would result in raising the cost of living and reducing the standard of living.  The only way in which we can help them is by the introduction of better methods of production in agriculture.  There was a lot to be said for the philosophy of the late Minister for Agriculture.  He wanted to see one more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough.  I think the solution of our agricultural problem here is to be found by the adoption of that method.</P>
    <P>I agree that the present Minister for Agriculture has the same views. Unless there is increased production, the farmer, and more particularly the small farmer, cannot continue to exist. If the small farmer is not in a good position at the moment it is because of his inability to make a big turnover. A big turnover seems to be the secret of success in any business, whether it is a farm or a factory or a retail shop. How is the small farmer's turnover to be increased?  I think increased production will have to be achieved by the introduction of more scientific methods in agriculture.  It will also be necessary to ensure that the people engaged in agriculture, particularly the small farmer, will have ample capital and will be taught how to use it on the proper lines.  I think the Minister for Agriculture should take steps to ensure that after the war every possible effort will be made to increase <Col N="803" /> our production by the introduction of scientific methods and by making ample capital available to the people engaged in farming in a small way.</P>
