    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to resolve a doubt which has been cast on my Department's interpretation of Section 8, sub-section (1) of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, and Section 20, sub-section (1) of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.  These sub-sections provide that, where a pensioner is in receipt of any remuneration or allowance payable out of public funds, his military service pension will be abated in accordance with a scale set out in schedules to the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions granted under the Act of 1924 were, except in the case of serving members of the Forces, payable as from the 1st October, 1924, or from 1st October, 1934, if application was made after the passing of the 1934 Act, <Col N="938" /> and pensions under the 1934 Act commence as from the 1st October, 1934. Senators will appreciate, however, that all pensions cannot be granted simultaneously. Investigations must be made into each case and these investigations take varying times to complete, with the result that pensions are granted on different dates.  Once granted, however, arrears were and are payable in every case from the dates which I have mentioned&mdash;1st October, 1924, in the case of the 1924 Act and 1st October, 1934, in the case of the Act of 1934, and in the case of applications under the 1924 Act made after the passing of the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>In case there may be any misunderstanding, I think it well to emphasise that the present Bill has nothing to do with the general principle of the abatement of pensions in respect of other receipts from public funds.  That principle was established in the 1924 and 1934 Acts by both Houses of the Oireachtas and does not arise now. The Bill is necessary because of the difference which I mentioned between the date of award of a pension and the date from which payment commences. The specific question which gives rise to it is, whether the abatement of pensions of public servants should begin from the date of commencement or from the date of award of the pension.</P>
    <P>The invariable practice of my Department for close on 20 years, in fact since military service pensions were first paid, has been to abate the pension not from the date on which it was granted but from the date on which it commenced.  For instance, if a person receives a pension in 1944, dating back to 1934 and carrying arrears as from 1934, then the pension is abated over the ten years according to the amount he received each year from public funds.  That seems the obvious intention of the sections, as well as being the only interpretation that could be justified, for, otherwise, it would mean that all such pensioners were not treated alike, despite the fact that their pensions became effective as from the same date.</P>
    <P>This interpretation of the sections <Col N="939" /> remained unquestioned for almost 20 years but, recently, it has been stated that the pension should be abated, not from the date of its commencement, but from the date on which it was granted.  This claim has been put forward by a few persons and, on its being rejected, they have threatened legal proceedings.  No case has been tested in the courts but I am advised that, though the new interpretation is questionable, it might be accepted by the courts.  As it is felt, however, that the Oireachtas never intended any such inequitable interpretation, the present Bill has been introduced to remove all doubts on the subject.</P>
    <P>An illustration may, at this point, bring out the difference between what is now being asserted and what has been the practice.  Suppose, for instance, that two persons&mdash;A and B &mdash;each in receipt of £600 a year salary from public funds, applied on the same date and were each awarded a pension of £200 a year under the 1934 Act, but that A was granted his pension in 1934, while B, through delays of one kind or another, did not receive his award until 1944.  The newly-suggested interpretation contends that A's pension is rightly abated each year from 1934, but that B's should be similarly abated only from 1944.  Thus B would be better off than A for pension purposes to the extent of about £2,000&mdash;that is, he would be entitled to ten years' pension without abatement simply because it had not been possible to deal with his case as expeditiously as with that of A.  The Departmental view and practice are, however, that both persons for pension purposes are similarly circumstanced and that both pensions fall to be abated over the whole period.</P>
    <P>I feel that it was never the intention of the Oireachtas to make any such discrimination as that now suggested between pensioners in receipt of remuneration out of public funds, but that the clear and equitable intention was to treat them alike.  Accordingly, the purpose of the present Bill is to remove any legal doubt which may exist regarding the interpretation of the sections and to confirm what must undoubtedly have been the intention <Col N="940" /> of the Oireachtas and what has always been the practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of approaches in regard to this matter.  Legal opinion has been sought and it has been more or less divided. We have been advised that the interpretation which has been given to the Acts is the correct interpretation and will stand the test of law, and then again we have been advised that it might, in fact, go against us.</P>

      <P>I think that the Seanad might ask the Minister if there were cases of persons who considered they had a claim under the law as it stands and who incurred expenses in order to test that claim.  In passing legislation to block up that gap in the law, I think we would like to hear from the Minister whether, as a matter of <i>ex gratia</i> payment, he would be prepared to pay any expenses which might be incurred on the part of pensioners in testing the law.</P>

      <P>I am informed that no civil bill has been served and outside of that I do not think it would be possible to meet the suggestion which the Senator is making because we can easily understand that there would be all sorts of exorbitant claims.  If there have been any cases brought to a stage where a civil bill is served we might consider that.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios agam nach féidir linn athrú a dhéanamh ar an mBille seo.  Tá daoine sa tír fá láthair a bhí páirteach sa troid ar son na tíre agus sílim nach bhfuil siad ag fáil cothrom na féinne mar atá siad agus ba mhaith liom dá bhféadadh an tAire rud a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis na daoine sin.</P>
      <P>I think we all here agree with the view put forward by the Minister that one set of applicants ought not to be able to take advantage of the position that would give them the full amount of their pension for a number of years when their claims are held in abeyance. There is, however, a large body of people who are connected with the various national associations that helped the Irish Volunteers and the Republican Army in the fight for freedom, and who claim that the law as it stands is unfair to those who are in Government service and in the service of public boards by making a reduction in their pensions as a result of the service they have given to these public boards or public authorities.  There is another view also: that these people who gave national service have, as a result of that national service, lost advancement in the Departments in which they were serving.  They did not receive the same appreciation as did other people who stood quietly in their posts.</P>

      <P>I would like your help in this matter, Sir.  Are we not entitled to propose an amendment here?  I take it that this Bill is an amending Bill and in view of that, are we not entitled to propose amendments?

      <P>I take it that, if a Senator desires to discuss the principle of making deductions from military service pensions on the grounds that the persons concerned are receiving salaries in the Civil Service, that could be discussed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get the matter clarified.  It seems to me at the moment that we are about to legalise an injustice.  The law, up to the time that this Bill is passed, will give benefits to certain pensioners. The Legislature has discovered that there was a loophole in the law and, by a backdoor method, we are trying to deprive people of something to which they would be legally entitled if this form of retrospective legislation were not passed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator O'Donnell is wrong in his opinion.  We are trying to rectify the position under a certain clause.  The principle was established under previous Acts that no person in receipt of money from public funds, as an official of the State or of a local authority, should draw the full military service pension.  There was a graded scale and, if the salary of the officer reached a certain amount, he could receive no pension.  From time to time, pensions were granted and it seems that delays, instead of being dangerous, would now mean a profit to the individual.  A person who would get his pension in 1944 would be in a much better position than a person who obtained his pension immediately after the passing of the Act in 1934.  I think that we should pass the Bill.  I do not know whether we would be allowed to discuss the different aspects of the clause under which this question arises.  My opinion is that, if a person who had served this country is granted a pension, it should be given to him irrespective of whether he is a public employee or not.  A sort of class distinction seems to be involved.  If a man receives a salary outside the State service, he can draw his full pension but, if he receives, the same salary <Col N="944" /> from the State or a local authority, he may not be entitled to any pension. The Bill deals with the rectification of conditions under that clause.  Whether we would be allowed to discuss the matters to which I have adverted I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Second Reading of this Bill on the grounds that we are asked to agree to something to which some of us are opposed &mdash;deductions from the pensions of persons employed in the public service.  I was rather surprised at the Cathaoirleach ruling Senator O Maille out of order because the matter to which he was referring is really the kernel of the Bill.  Some of us do not understand the procedure.  Are we not entitled to discuss the position of pensioners who have money deducted from their pensions because they are engaged in the public service?  I referred to this matter before and I was told that it was not relevant to the particular Act under discussion.  I had no communication from the Old I.R.A. or anybody else.  I raised the matter simply because I had believed for a number of years that injustice was being done to some of these pensioners.  I got no communication from any organisation. I did not belong to any of the organisations concerned because they were, in the main, military organisations. These deductions are made, in some cases, from lowly-paid workers such as the men who sweep the streets for the corporation.  Deductions are also made from the salaries of lowly-paid civil servants.  There seems to be no purpose in giving a man a pension for services rendered if you deduct 25 per cent from his pension.  Under this Bill, I think we are entitled to raise that point because it is intended to deal with a matter to which some of us are opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the ideas expressed by Senator Colgan and Senator O'Donovan.  The 1924 Act was passed in very special circumstances. The circumstances of 1922 and 1923 had created a special type of difficulty for a large number of men who <Col N="945" /> were detached from their normal occupations and who were prevented by the events of 1920-1921 and 1922-1923 from finding a position in the economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>There was a general desire at the time to find employment for as many of those men as possible.  A large number found positions in the Civil Service and with local bodies, but quite a large number could not be catered for at all.  It was out of the pressure of the particular circumstances at that time that the 1924 Act was passed at all.  The view then taken was that as men did get employment in the State there should be some sort of an off-set by way of a reduction in their pensions: that it should have some relation to the amount of money they got from their State employment.  The circumstances at that time were very difficult.  The views then taken on financial and certain other matters were rather stringent and narrow, and the passage of time has shown very great inequities and inequalities in the application of that particular section in the 1924 Act, a section which was carried into the 1934 Act.  Twenty years have elapsed since the 1924 Act was passed.  The number of people affected is growing smaller, and since then very great changes have taken place in the value of money, and in everything else.  It is time, I think, that this whole thing, which has been a source of irritation, injustice and inequality, was completely taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the necessity for this measure in order to get an inequality as between different classes of people who are benefiting simply because their claims are examined at different times rectified.  I think that if the Seanad opposes this Bill completely it should indicate at the same time that it is prepared to pass a measure correcting whatever maladjustment the Bill sets out to deal with provided steps are taken now to end the application of this deduction in the 1924 and 1934 Acts.  By doing so, the House would be putting the Minister in the position that he could say that he had the opinion of a substantial majority of the Seanad behind <Col N="946" /> him, indicating that this type of deduction should come to an end.  It should also be indicated to the Minister that, when a decision was taken to bring these deductions to an end, anything that required to be done retrospectively to settle the type of case affected by this Bill would be done.  I desire to support Senator Colgan in his direct statement as well as the implication in the speech of Senator O'Donovan that this Bill ought not to be passed in order to get the general question faced up to.</P>

      <P>I understand that, in a case of proceedings under the law as it stands, it would be necessary to obtain the <i>flat</i> of the Attorney-General before proceedings could be instituted; that, therefore, it is not really the date of the service of the proceedings that would be material whether a man had incurred expenses or not, but whether, in fact, he had asked the Attorney-General for his <i>flat.</i>  If any person has asked the Attorney-General for his <i>flat</i>, then I think the Minister should agree to reimburse him the costs that he has incurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mulcahy that there is something to be said for getting away from the system of making deductions from military <Col N="947" /> service pensions, and specially in the case of those who are poorly paid.  I understand that during the last régime as well as under the present régime there are many people in this country who resigned under Article 10 of the Treaty and who, to-day, are in receipt of handsome yearly sums from the Government despite the fact that when they decided to go out on pension under that Article of the Treaty they signed a declaration to the effect that they were not prepared to serve under the change of Government.  I understand that the number of such people has been growing.  At one time I understood that if a man resigned under that Article of the Treaty and got a pension, the Government would not give him any work that would entitle him to receive anything from State funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no longer the case, and I understand that it has not been the case for quite a few years.  If the deduction does not apply in the case of these people, why should it be applied to the unfortunate fellows who fought in 1919 and later?  Why should those who served the British Government be exempted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention whatever of opposing the Bill.  I consider that one of its objects is to continue to apply what has applied over the last 20 years.  The Minister stated that those who received pensions in 1935 and in 1936 under the present Act have had deductions made from their pensions ever since.  Therefore, it would be unfair, in my opinion, if those who receive lump sums in cash now were not to have deductions made from their payments at the same rate. As the Bill is intended to deal with sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the original Act, I would again appeal to the Minister to press forward the claims of those on the lower scales of pay in the Civil Service and that deductions should not be made from them now.  I understand that in certain circumstances where a bonus has recently been granted, with clothes <Col N="948" /> and boots at present prices the men concerned instead of suffering a reduction of 5 per cent. have suffered a deduction of 10 per cent.  The same thing applies to Old I.R.A. men and members of the Cumann na mBan who may possibly be drawing old age pensions. If they are granted military service pensions they will, in some cases, suffer a loss.  One case has been brought to my notice.  It is that of a man with 10/- a week old age pension. Because he got 9/1½ by way of a military service pension, he has lost not only his old age pension of 10/- a week, but also the food vouchers and the free fuel allowance vouchers that went therewith.  It is because of hardships of that sort which have been brought to my notice that I would appeal to the Minister to implement the suggestion that he made in the other House promising to put this matter before the Government and see what could be done.  If the question of cost enters into this matter to any great extent, those whom I represent would not ask, I think, that the deletion of the deductions would be made retrospective. I think they would be satisfied if the deletion of deductions from the lower paid civil servants and Government employees generally were made operative from the present time or the nearest approximate date that the Minister would consider suitable.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I entirely agree with Senator Miss Kennedy that this Bill ought to be passed, because if it were not passed, certain people would enjoy advantages arising out of purely chance circumstances, that is, A would get more than B, simply because it took longer to investigate his claim, or because A applied much later than B.  We would all be in agreement that purely fortuitous circumstances of that kind should not benefit one person more than another at the expense of public funds.  But, since the Minister is endeavouring to stop a gap that may exist in the Bill, it raises on this stage the general question as to whether these deductions should be made at all.  On that point what Senator Mulcahy said is correct.  These deductions were arranged in particular <Col N="949" /> circumstances in 1924, and the Schedules attached to the Bill defined an income of £500 from public funds as entirely cancelling a military service pension.  I think it is now desirable that, in the light of a much higher cost of living than was experienced in 1924, or even in 1934, it should be considered whether the £500 limit should not be raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Colgan's point that deductions from people on the lower amounts should be completely excluded should also be examined.  I know there are cases where people who are employed as Government messengers at a very small wage, sometimes not more than £3 a week, and often even less than £3 a week, have deductions made for the reason that they have a very small service pension and the same thing applies to old age pensioners and to those qualifying for unemployment assistance. I think that certain injustices have also been inflicted on those who obtain unemployment grants.  For instance, one of the things mentioned in a document which has been circulated to us here is the case of the lower-paid Government servants who get 10/- bonus weekly.  This bonus brings them to the point at which a greater deduction must be made from their pensions, so that what the Government hands out with its left hand, it takes back with the right.  I am not saying that the Government meant that, but it looks rather like it, and I do not think anyone would be dissatisfied if that kind of injury were ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Maguire made an interesting point, and it was one on which I happened to have personal knowledge. When the last Government was in office it was decided that any man who retired under the Treaty because he would not serve an Irish Government and who took what were known as Article X conditions should not be eligible for Government employment. That rule has since been altered, and there are people in the Bar Library to-day who refused to serve an Irish Government and who were very far, indeed, from being what would be called Republican.  They did not lift their fingers in any way against the <Col N="950" /> Treaty and did not support, even constitutionally, those who opposed the Treaty.  To-day these people are enjoying Government briefs and Government incomes, while, at the same time, they are drawing their full pensions under Article X.  In raising that, Senator Maguire put his finger on a very objectionable point in our pensions legislation.  On the other hand, a Government messenger out in 1916, and now getting the lowest pay in the Government service, has his pension reduced by deduction because of the comparatively small sum which he gets as a Government messenger.  That is unjust and I think that the Minister ought to consider changing it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a general discussion on the whole matter, but even if the principle was not abolished, I think the changed circumstances as between 1924 and 1944 and the incidence of certain of the benefits which Senator Miss Kennedy has mentioned &mdash;old age pensions and food and fuel allowances&mdash;require consideration.  In the light of all the things that have happened and the increased cost of living, the whole matter might be reexamined with sympathy, so as to provide that people, particularly in the lower grades, should not be obliged to suffer.  The matter does not personally concern me in any way, but I think there is a case for it, and even if one were required by the ordinary rules of the Chair to advance such an argument only by opposing the Bill, I must ask the Chair's indulgence, seeing that this Bill ought to be passed before anybody takes legal proceedings.  I am wholly in favour of passing it to-day, because I do not think there is any amendment which Senator Colgan could move, no matter what the Chair allowed him to do.  The change could only be made if the Minister for Defence undertook to have the matter investigated. The problem should be considered from the point of view of raising the scale, and preventing the anomalous situation whereby a man with a pension finds himself caught by unemployment assistance or the old age pension.  If we had an investigation, I think it would be possible to <Col N="951" /> get an amelioration of the present position.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, should give that matter careful consideration and promise the House that he will have these complaints examined.  He would, perhaps, give us an idea of the value of these deductions, and of what the additional cost to the State would be if alterations were made to meet the grievances of the lower-paid grades. As a matter of fact, the Act of 1924 was worded in a particular way.  It was ruled afterwards that employment in the Electricity Supply Board was not State employment.  Neither is employment in the Turf Development Board and the Sugar Company, although you have a variety of organisations which have subventions from the State and which in some cases are run entirely by State funds.  One example came to my notice.  This was the electricity service of the Dublin Corporation which was transferred to the Electricity Supply Board.  A person working in the cleansing department, who was out in the 1916 Rising with the Minister, and a number of other people, would still have a deduction made from his pension.  If he was working in the lighting department and had been transferred to the Electricity Supply Board he would have got the same salary and there would be no deduction from his pension. I think that is inequitable.  The whole subject is well worth inquiring into from the viewpoint of the present cost of living and without the intention of imposing any undue burden on public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start off by stating that this Bill does not affect in the slightest way any Old I.R.A. man who was receiving a pension <Col N="952" /> allowance for any period, either from 1924 or 1934.  I have seen statements in the public Press which were complete distortions of the truth, and I believe they were deliberately written for the purpose of distorting the truth and making people have an idea that something was being done which was not being done.  I want to say here and now that the only purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the Acts which have been operating over a period of almost 20 years in the case of the 1924 Act and ten years in the case of the 1934 Act will continue.</P>
      <P>There have been many digressions in the course of the discussions on this Bill.  We have discussed other things besides what is contained in it, and it is very difficult for me to take up the various matters which have been mentioned here by the Senators.  I might express my own views by saying that I am in sympathy with most of what has been stated, but the fact remains that, when these Acts were passed, I presume that they were carefully considered by the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1924, and later on in 1934, and they were passed with full knowledge of what they meant.</P>
      <P>Now, the question of scaling down &mdash;if that is the right term&mdash;the Schedule is a very difficult one.  The more I looked at that as a means of bringing about amelioration, the more difficult I could see it would be.  For instance, you could bring down the first or the second, but then you have the third or the fourth so close to these that the people in these and the other categories would naturally feel that a grave injustice was being done to them, and they would, of course, continue to make the claim that their demands should also be included.  I came to the conclusion that the only remedy would be to remove the Schedule completely, and the section which applies, but I do not think that the Dáil or the Seanad want me to do that.  Indeed, I do not think it could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would cost something <Col N="953" /> in the nature of £50,000 annually. It is very questionable if we should do it.  Senator Mulcahy has given the reasons why, in the first instance, the Schedules were established, and I can say that we followed the precedent created in the 1924 Act by inserting the Schedule in the 1934 Act so as to make both Acts as nearly identical as possible.  As regards these lowly-paid men, such as ushers and messengers, the point in their case is that we, just as the former Government, deliberately put into employment, wherever it was possible to do so, men who, at some time or other, gave national service.  We felt that, in giving these men with national service a gainful type of employment, we were doing something which was much better than leaving them merely with their pensions.</P>
      <P>It was felt that that was also a reward for the services given and, if it was intended in that way, then there should have to be some abatement in respect of the pensions.  However small the abatement may be in their cases, it is true to say that some of the bonus payments have made it somewhat more difficult for the individuals who secured them.  Whether, in fact, we can do anything in respect of the Schedule, it is very difficult to say.  I do not think it would be possible to do anything.  Having regard to what Senators have said, I will undertake to bring their statements to the attention of the Government and to do whatever is possible for these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 31, after the words &ldquo;specified age&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not below the age of 65.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment in order to limit to some small extent the very wide powers the Minister proposes to take under the Bill.  He proposes to fix &ldquo;any specified age&rdquo; limit for all officers, for a number of officers or for one particular officer, so that the Minister may of himself decide at what age a particular officer of a vocational education committee must retire.  Having done that, he is not obliged by anything I can see to submit that decision to, or get approval for that decision from, any House of the Oireachtas.  He can simply make an Order that a man or woman shall retire at any age he deems proper and that man or woman must thereupon retire.  Such a person will be deemed to be disqualified for service after that.  I think that is altogether too wide a power to give to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a defence, the Minister will probably say that this is the same provision as is contained in the Local Government Act dealing with Local Government officials.  I maintain that vocational education officers are not at all in the same position as the ordinary officers of county councils or local authorities.  These teachers work under a special Act, the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and, to go back further, the original Technical Education Act, 1889.  What I should like to see, and what I believe to be absolutely necessary, is a special pension scheme for vocational teachers. It may be said that we cannot have that because these teachers are employees of local committees.  The same might be said of national teachers, and to a lesser extent of secondary teachers, who are not employees of the Government.  Yet, each of these bodies has a special pensions scheme, especially suited to their conditions. I could never understand why there was not a similar scheme for vocational teachers.  The usual argument against my proposal is that no <Col N="958" /> injustice would be done by the present Minister; that he would not do anything but what was perfectly fair, and that we are not concerned with the actions of future Ministers.  As the Minister knows, there has been a case, which I mentioned in this House on the Agriculture Bill, and for which the Minister has been actually responsible, where an advantage or, if you like, a privilege, which certain teachers enjoyed for 25 years was taken away, on the ground that it was necessary to do so, so that younger people would get employment.  If we give to the Minister the power he seeks we may find, even if he fixed the age at 65, 60 or 55, that at some future time a number of young people will be looking for employment and in order to give it to them some older people must retire. Something similar has been done by the present Minister about another body of teachers.  In the amendment I put the age that I wish to have fixed as the ordinary retiring age, but even then many teachers, especially those in the service of vocational committees, owing to the peculiar circumstances that exist, will not at 65 be able to qualify for the full pensions.</P>
    <P>This is a new service into which men and women went at ages much later than is the case with teachers who are now entering it.  I understand that certain calculations have been made, which show that the average age of those who were taken over under the Vocational Act would be about 33 years and that some 300 of them, even at 65, cannot qualify for full pensions.  It is possible that they may get added years.  I understand that a certain suggestion made to that effect would depend first on the goodwill of the Minister, secondly, on the goodwill of the Minister for Local Government, thirdly, on the goodwill of the Minister for Finance and, finally, on the goodwill of vocational committees.  By the time that a teacher got around and induced these four bodies he would be very lucky if he succeeded in convincing them to add some years to his service.  We know that some vocational committees are very good in that respect, inasmuch as they recognise the claims of their <Col N="959" /> teachers and do everything they can to help them, but there are others&mdash; not many&mdash;of whom the same cannot be said, and who are not always ready even to give the privileges which the Minister for Education or the Minister for Local Government would be prepared to give.  I understand that one or two committees have not even paid an emergency bonus to their teachers. The proposal I make is a reasonable one, which it would be in the interest of the Minister to accept.  If it should happen that the Minister fixed the age for a particular individual&mdash;as he is taking power to do&mdash;it would put him in a very invidious position, and may cause some difficulty when he is justifying his action in dealing with such a case.  It would be much better if there was some general age fixed, below which the Minister could not force retirement.  I suggest that 65 is a reasonable age, and is the usual one for compulsory retirement from all public services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment and to endorse the remarks of Senator O'Connell.  Even if the amendment is accepted, several transferred officers will be very seriously affected unless the Minister takes a compassionate view of their cases.  I refer to officers who were the real pioneers of the work of vocational education and who had not security of tenure or pension rights until the passing of the Local Government Acts, 1919 and 1925.  Some of these men were appointed at low salaries and at a time when the striking of a rate for technical purposes was not compulsory on the bodies administering the Act.  As a result people who took up the service one year found that a local body might refuse to strike a rate the following year.  These teachers received very meagre salaries and had no fixed centres.  They had to move about from place to place, very often on bicycles.  The salaries were so meagre that they could not marry until late in life.  I ask the Minister to take particular notice of these cases, because they are deserving of consideration. Many of these men carried on their work at certain times at the risk of <Col N="960" /> their lives.  They are undoubtedly entitled to special consideration in regard to pension rights.  I trust the Minister may see his way to accept the amendment and that he will not be forgetful of the services of these officers.</P>

      <P>It would seem from this amendment that Senator O'Connell is in favour of fixing a retiring age.  That being so, then the only difference is as to whether that age should be 65, 60 or, in certain cases, even less.  What we have to remember in connection with this matter is that the vocational education service is not comparable with the primary or secondary education service; the type of subjects taught, the conditions under which teachers have to work, are very different.  I had experience for a considerable time of vocational teaching and I may point out that it meant considerable travel in all weathers, late and early.  Looking back and remembering these experiences, I should be very happy to feel that men and women engaged in certain aspects of the vocational education service could retire at an age earlier than 65 instead of having to work all their lives under these trying conditions.  Unless something is done to enable certain classes of teachers to retire at an age earlier than 65, I am afraid many of those I have in mind would never live to enjoy a pension, at least for any reasonable period.</P>

    <P>Take, for instance, some of the lady teachers who have, in the course of their work, to travel from one centre to another.  I know of cases myself out in the country where the hardships such teachers have to endure in travelling are of a very slavish nature. What I should like to stress is that provision be made for giving these people a reasonable number of added years in order that their pensions might be brought up to a reasonable level.  I have myself a list of teachers who are likely to be affected.  Very many of them are Irish language teachers, old Gaelic League teachers, who came into the service at rather late ages, and if these people have to retire at 65, there is no doubt they are going to suffer considerable hardship. <Col N="961" /> These are the lines, that is, the provision of adequate pensions, on which I should like to see this aspect of the problem tackled.  What is important in regard to the vocational education service is that it should be an efficient service from the point of view of education, and if it is essential that an age below 65 should be fixed, then, in the interests of education, we should take our courage in our hands and fix the age at the proper limit; but again let me say I should like to see the question of pensions adequately covered.  It would seem, however, that this is not the place to have that dealt with; I understand a Bill will come along later on which we shall have an opportunity of discussing this particular question.  On the whole, having examined the matter thoroughly, not alone by myself and for myself, but in conjunction with one of the most responsible bodies in the country dealing with vocational education, I am satisfied that the power to fix the age should be left as it is in the Bill.  I have not heard anything since the debate opened to convince me of the opposite view.  I am sorry I cannot agree that it is in the interests of education that the power to fix the age should be taken from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree that it is very difficult arbitrarily to fix a retiring age, in the case of these officers, particularly an age as high as 65.  I think Senator O'Connell rather indicated that his grievance was not so much the actual age, as the fact that certain officers, owing to the special circumstances&mdash;some of the older members of the present staffs&mdash;if they are to be retired before 65, will suffer certain hardships.  There is no doubt, as Senator O Buachalla has pointed out, that work in vocational schools is not of the even nature of work say, in a national school or in a secondary school.  A secondary teacher in one particular school can go on teaching Latin, and a secondary teacher 100 miles away can continue teaching French normally until they reach the age of 65.  Vocational teachers, on the other hand, embrace a very large and varied number of classes and I think <Col N="962" /> there is a necessity to have power to fix different ages, but the anxiety really is to see that, if different ages are fixed, injustices should not be done.  As time progresses and as the scheme goes on and people are recruited in the ordinary way, the matter should be very simple as the situation will be the same for everybody and there will be no danger of injustices, but what people are anxious about is that certain persons who entered the service and did good work before the State was set up, should not find themselves in their old age in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator O Buachalla will find that the Minister for Education has power to recommend to the Minister for Local Government that people who taught Irish under the Gaelic League and later continued under the vocational education system, should have their services under the Gaelic League counted for pension purposes.</P>

      <P>There is power that the thing should be done eventually.  I take it that people who taught even before the Irish Free State Act came into being are also to have their services regarded as continuous, but what we are really endeavouring to do here is to cater for particular cases in legislation dealing with everybody.  I think it is correct to say that we cannot do that.  The best thing we can do is to leave the Minister power to fix the age and to see whether the Minister can do anything for people who might be harshly dealt with if they were made to retire at 65.  We certainly cannot do that, I think, by inserting an amendment.  We cannot in this way remedy particular grievances no matter how much we should like to remedy them.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I did not forget at all that the power is there to give these added years in the case of old Irish teachers. Even so, there is still reason to be anxious about this point, because recently we became aware of the case of a committee which refused to make <Col N="963" /> the necessary recommendation for added years and, as a consequence, a certain teacher had to go off with a very much less pension than that to which he was entitled.  When I say that I am anxious that this matter should be carefully looked into, what I have in mind is that, if it cannot be done in this Bill, whenever the proper Bill comes along, we should see to it that the Minister will, if possible, have the power, notwithstanding the attitude of any committee, to make these added years available for the computation of pension.</P>

      <P>Senator O Buachalla stressed that our principal object in the vocational education service should be to have an efficient service.  The corollary to that is to have a satisfied service.  Therefore, it is necessary that we should not do anything that would make vocational education officers feel that they are getting a raw deal or that they are being treated otherwise than members of other services.  I agree with Senator O'Connell that these officers should not feel that an age limit for classes could be fixed in an arbitrary manner, but I do not think there is any possibility or likelihood of such a thing happening.  It would be preferable, I agree with Senator Hayes, not to fix an age in the Bill, not to bring even the numeral 65 into the Bill, because it may well be, as time goes on, that the retiring age would be fixed at a higher level.  It would be much safer for us first to see how things will work out. We should try this Bill for a few years and then we shall see what a proper retiring age will be.  If we put the numeral 65 into the Bill, 65 will be accepted as the normal retiring age. It may be put in as the minimum retiring age, but figures are imperative kind of things, and I think it would be better to leave them out of this Bill. Another difficulty I find in supporting Senator O'Connell's amendment is that there is no such provision in any other similar Act we have&mdash;the Local Government Act or the Agricultural Committees Act.  We discussed the age question when we were arguing the merits or demerits of those Acts, <Col N="964" /> but there was no insertion of any amendment such as Senator O'Connell proposes.  If we put in such an amendment now it seems to me that injustices, inequalities and anomalies would arise.  I naturally think of women.  There are women working under agricultural committees, and they have not what Senator O'Connell would call the protection of his amendment.</P>

The women employed under the vocational education committees would have a certain thing specified in their terms of service that would not be included in those of women doing identical work in another service.  There are women teaching in the rural domestic economy schools and there are poultry instructresses and dairy instructresses, and no amendment, such as Senator O'Connell proposes for the vocational teachers, has been incorporated in the Acts dealing with them.  Therefore, I think it would be much better, in the interests of the teachers themselves, that we should allow this particular clause to stand for the present in order to see how things work out and that we should not insert any numerals in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Senator O'Connell.  I think the amendment is a very fair one.  The Senator does not fix any age, but he asks that these teachers and employees of vocational education committees should not be asked to retire below the age of 65.  He does not suggest, if vocational education committees so desire, that they may not retain these people in their service, after 65.  For a man of my age, 65 is a comparatively young age.  When I was a lot younger, a man of 65 appeared an old man to me but, as I got on, I discovered that 65 was not so old.  Not so very long ago we considered 70 years of age was the normal retiring age.  Lately 65 has been accepted as the general age for retirement. Possibly it is a good thing.  It <Col N="965" /> has its advantages.  It leaves vacancies for younger people.  But, at any rate, nobody ought be asked to retire below the age of 65.  In addition to that, there will be the psychological effect of retiring a man or woman below 65. Often, when people are retired when they are comparatively young, they feel that, so far as employment is concerned, they are finished and the only thing they have to look forward to is simply to fade away like old soldiers.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the point made by Senator Mrs. Concannon.  We raised this point on the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill.  But the type of people envisaged in that Bill and the type of people we are dealing with in this Bill are quite different altogether. It was pointed out that those people would have to cycle long journeys throughout different counties and that 65, and possibly below it, was the age at which they should be retired. But here you have people who, in the main, have given good service, people who have to have very high qualifications for many of the posts.  It ought to be assured, at any rate, that they shall have a certain number of years service before them to qualify for pensions.  I think the main point is that these people ought to know the minimum age at which they will have to retire.  I think that is the point Senator O'Connell wants to make, and I heartily support it.  If people have pension rights, they ought to know when they will be retired, and we are not asking too much when we ask the Minister to agree that these people will not be retired below the age of 65.  As to the question of added years for Gaelic League teachers, I should like to ask the Minister has there been any case where a request of that nature has been turned down.</P>

It is very difficult where I sit, I regret to say, to hear the words of wisdom that flow from the lips of my colleague, <Col N="966" /> Senator O Buachalla.  But I think I heard him say&mdash;I possibly misunderstood as well as misheard him&mdash;that the reason for this fixation of a retiring age is to create vacancies to which younger men may aspire; in other words, that, in view of an overcrowded market, competent men are to be dismissed&mdash;because that is what it amounts to&mdash;in the fulness of their powers and efficiency, in order to make room for others.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that, if the Minister came to the House with proposals fixing the age for certain classes and if, as Senator O Buachalla said, we took our courage in our hands and did fix a certain age for certain classes, the Oireachtas would have an opportunity of discussing the matter and hearing the case in favour of fixing the age below 65 perhaps for a particular class.  But here the Minister takes power entirely into his own hands to do that and does not consult the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas will have no opportunity of seeing, before that age is fixed, whether it should be fixed for that particular class or not at the specified age at which the Minister thinks it should be fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Magennis raised a very important point.  He wished to know whether the age will be fixed only in the case of vacancies for incoming teachers.  My reading of it is that the Minister will be able to, and possibly <Col N="967" /> will fix a retiring age for those already in the service.</P>

      <P>In this Bill, anyhow, that is his intention: that is what he proposes to do.  That is possibly the reason for the great uneasiness and discontent which exist in the service at the present time.  We all know that a discontented service is a bad service. I do not suggest that all should go on to 65, or be compelled to go on teaching till 65.  Provisions can be made&mdash;and are made in other services. &mdash;whereby an officer may retire voluntarily at an earlier age and get a pension based on his appropriate service. I think it is very essential that teachers should know what the retiring age is.  The power that is given to fix any age the Minister may choose is entirely too wide a power to give to the Minister with regard to these particular teachers.  That was my purpose in moving this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recommend the Seanad to accept this amendment. Apparently, Senator O'Connell now believes that, at least, the retiral age may be fixed, and perhaps those who disagreed with the proposal in the first instance will now agree with Senator O Buachalla&mdash;who, I think, can claim to speak on behalf of the Standing Council of Irish Technical Education&mdash;that the provision will lead to greater efficiency in the service. I see no reason why, in the matter of the retiral age, a distinction should be drawn between one type of officer in the local service and all the other officers governed by the corresponding provision in the Local Government Act, 1941, particularly when it is known that there is a retiral age for the Civil Service and secondary and primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated, on the last occasion I spoke here, that a valuable concession had been granted to those who might be regarded as having cases demanding special consideration or worthy of special treatment, in that the Minister <Col N="968" /> for Local Government and Public Health had promised that, if proposals came up from committees to give added years, particularly in respect of those who had teaching service in other branches, he would consider them favourably.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Magennis, I may say that the way in which this matter would be dealt with is that the Minister would make a general Order fixing the retiral age, either for vocational officers generally or for particular classes of officers.  The intention I have at present, if it falls to me to make the Order, is to fix the age of 65 for officers generally.  I have explained in An Dáil, and wish to emphasise here, that there may be reasons why a lower age might be fixed for certain classes of officers.  When a person enters a service, whether local or national, at about the age of 25 and gives 40 years' service, bringing him to the age of 65, the 40 years' service is generally regarded as a full life's service, entitling the officer to full superannuation.  As Senator O Buachalla has pointed out, the work in the vocational education service is probably more arduous, as there is more organising work and more travelling to be done.  Generally speaking, officers would require to be more healthy and active than even in the other branches of the teaching service. Therefore, when I say 65, I say it because the Minister must have regard to the retiral age fixed for corresponding branches in the service.</P>
    <P>At the same time, before fixing any age, the Minister ought to consider all the relevant circumstances&mdash;I assume that the Seanad will agree with that&mdash;and while, in general, the age should, I think, be 65, I am not prepared to say here and now, as I have not examined the matter closely enough, that 65 would and should be the age for all types of officers or even for particular classes of officers.  All I can say is that that would be the intention unless, after close examination of the whole problem, it is found that there are very strong reasons&mdash; and there would need to be very strong reasons&mdash;for departing from the general age of retiral, even for special classes of officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> I have mentioned the case of physical training instructors as an example.  They are only a small body, but it will occur to Senators that there may be officers of a particular class who it may be found upon examination will not be, on the average, giving efficient service at the age of 65.  Any Order that is made will have regard to the general interests of the service and also to the interests of the particular officers in whom Senators are interested.</P>
    <P>The question for solution is whether we should keep on those officers who have not sufficient service to enable them to get full superannuation, and let them remain on teaching until say 70 years; or whether we should ask them to retire at whatever age is fixed&mdash;supposing it is 65, at 65&mdash;and then try to deal with their cases by way of added years.  I think it is a better solution, and more in the interests of the service and its efficiency, that they should retire at whatever the retiral age may be, in the ordinary way, and that their cases can be considered on the basis of giving them added years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that I am not against the fixing of an age.  What I am protesting against is the giving of that power to the Minister.  He said now, and we all agree with him, that an officer with 40 years' service gets the full pension; but the Minister himself&mdash;as I have said more than once&mdash;withdrew a privilege from a certain number of teachers. He withdrew the right to get the full pension on 40 years' service and forced them to retire after 35 years' service, without getting the full pension.  That is an example of what can be done when the Minister has wide power of that kind.  I am anxious to put some limit on the wide powers given to the Minister.</P>

      <P>&mdash;I am not conscious of <Col N="970" /> breaking any obligation in that matter. As the Senator knows, it had been the custom, even before the Irish Government came into office, for teachers to retire at 60.  It is true that, more recently, since the Irish Government came in, women teachers remained on until 65.  There is nothing whatever to show&mdash;and I would like Senator O'Connell to indicate that there is, though in my opinion it is rather irrelevant to the discussion&mdash; that there is anything binding on the Minister for Education or ever was anything binding on him to permit women teachers to remain on after 60 years of age.  As I say, the rule fell into desuetude and had to be revived owing to the number of young teachers that we have unemployed.  Unfortunately we have had that position and this is the only way, rightly or wrongly, we have been able to devise to deal with it.  If the position were to improve and if it were possible to see greater prospects of employment for our younger people then we might be able to relax, but at the moment I do not see any such prospect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-section (4) of Section 6 I want to point out that the Minister, in his last reply, seemed to indicate that there was very little difference between vocational teachers and the ordinary members of the Civil Service.  I am unable to agree with that view, but that does not, of course, mean that the Minister is wrong.  The ordinary civil servant has a specified number of hours to attend to office duties and when the clock strikes at the termination of that period and he goes home, he may occupy himself in any way he pleases.  The vocational teacher, like all other teachers, really begins the hardest work of his day at the particular <Col N="972" /> time at which the ordinary avocation work ceases.  He has a variety of classes and he has to prepare what he is to teach them subsequently. His position, therefore, is rather more than the professional civil servant or the professional employees of county councils whose cases were dealt with when the amending Act to the Local Government Act was before the House.  On that occasion I put up, as usual, an ineffectual plea to take the ordinary considerations of commonsense instead of rigidities and hard and fast rules of a certain class of mind which wants to reduce to uniformity things that are different.</P>
      <P>I am not pleading for any particular class of vocational employee that he may not have a grievance, but if I am at liberty I want to repeat again what I said in regard to the former measure. The taxpayer has to be considered as well as the individual officer.  When a low age of retirement is fixed regardless of efficiency or inefficiency, the satisfactory or unsatisfactory nature of the discharge of duties, the result is that we can have a duplication of salary holders.  After all, superannuation payment is really deferred salary and the taxpayer is obliged to pay deferred salary in the name of superannuation and to pay also the salary accruing to the actual occupant of the office.  I submit with all respect that that consideration is lost sight of when we proceed to discuss retiring ages.  I am not making the point now that one man may be highly capable at 70 and another man totally incapable at 40 or 35.  Undoubtedly, there is an element of arbitrariness allowed for in giving power to a Minister to specify any age he pleases for any office he pleases. Who are to pay these salaries?  We dealt with portion of that already and passed it in Section 4 of the Act relating to local authorities.  Are they not to be considered as to whether, with their knowledge of a given officer, he is in their judgment competent to continue? Is the Minister to receive no representations?  Is there to be no consultation in regard to whether A, B or C is really to be dispensed with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this point before I had the valuable assistance of Senator <Col N="973" /> Rowlette, who spoke for the medical officers in the employment of county councils.  Much of what he said in regard to them is equally applicable to vocational officers.  The Minister for Local Government at that time and many of my colleagues since argued what I thought I heard a Senator argue to-day, that the older men must make room for the younger men.  Do we take the broad view that a man entering service, say, at 25, can contemplate employment for no longer than 40 years, that in fact the engagement, therefore, is for 40 years?  Let us grant that and when he retires should not the reasonable view taken of his retirement be that the contract is ended? He has accomplished the task which he was engaged to discharge.  He has had his 40 years and he goes out.  But look at this monstrous proposal&mdash;I say advisedly monstrous proposal&mdash;in sub-section (4).  Certain persons who come under a preceding sub-section, when they are to be subjected to compulsory retirement, are not to go out as men retired by virtue of an ordinance agreed upon by the Legislature, but are to be deemed to have become incapable of discharging the duties of such office with efficiency through old age.  Any man would be quite willing to go out when he had reached the retiral age for the office he held, but would he be willing to be branded in this way&mdash;that he has gone out of office because he has become inefficient through old age?  Is it not quite enough that he must cease to draw his higher salary, that he must cease to do the work in which his heart is and which he believes himself still competent to discharge, without having this stigma put upon him&mdash;that he is deemed by an enactment of the Legislature to have retired because of incapacity to discharge the duties of his office with efficiency?  Personally, I am quite satisfied to go out of any paid office I hold because the appointed time has come for my retirement, but if I feel, and am adjudged by others to be, as competent as ever to discharge the duties I had been discharging in preceding years, am I to be asked to accept this stigma of having become inefficient?  I deny <Col N="974" /> I have become inefficient, while should willingly consent to be retired I think that there is a certain reckless ness in deeming something or other to be what it is not, or, at any rate, need not necessarily be.  I desire to make that representation to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

I have no doubt that, if an advantage were being granted, even on that basis, the Senator would not be disposed to accept it, but I can assure him that the effect of the sub-section in this case is to grant a concession to vocational education officers which, if this provision be deleted, they will not receive.  Since it is a concession, they may be prepared to accept whatever stigma the phraseology connotes, having regard to the financial advantages that accompany it.</P>

      <P>May I apply balm to the wounded feelings of the Senator?  If you deem A to be B, it is because you know perfectly well that A is not B.  It is the regular legal method of getting over a difficulty; you assume something to be the case when it is perfectly obvious that it is not the case.  If a person was being retired because he was incapable of carrying on his business, there would be no difficulty.  But if you are retiring a person for convenience, although he is perfectly well able to do his <Col N="975" /> work, you deem him to be incapable of doing it.  So far from placing any stigma upon him, that implies that he is capable but that, for certain purposes&mdash;calculation of pensions and gratuities, which is what the section of the 1925 Act refers to&mdash;you deem him to be incapable.  There is a joke in the Civil Service that, if you want to resort to extreme measures for a particular purpose, you deem the object which you want to attack to be a musk rat.  That is because, when musk rats were endangering the foundations of the dykes in England, they passed a series of measures which allowed you to do anything you pleased with a musk rat&mdash;tear him from limb to limb or crucify him head downwards. Since then, if you want to get rid of any other animal, you can get rid of him by deeming him to be a musk rat.  I do not think that any person deemed to be incapable of discharging the duties of his office has the slightest stigma put upon him.</P>

A man may be allowed to retire so as to mitigate the ignominy of being dismissed and he is deemed to have resigned his post from such and such a date.  That is very reasonable and very fair, but to ask him to agree to be deemed to be something that, in the eyes of the public, is disability, that his powers are decayed, that, in short, he is an incapable&mdash;that is inequitable and nobody knows that better than Senator Kingsmill Moore.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned by the Minister a few moments ago that service as a Gaelic League teacher may be taken into account for the purpose of fixing pensionable service. The Minister is to recommend to the Minister for Local Government that that be taken into account.  There are teachers with service as primary and secondary teachers and with service <Col N="976" /> under the Congested Districts Board and, so far as I know, this service is not to be taken into account for pension purposes, though it could be so taken if the Minister would recommend to the Minister for Local Government to accept it.  I suggest to the Minister that local committees should be authorised to take such service into account.  When a man gives service to the community in one or other of these capacities, it is only right that it should be taken into account when his pension is being fixed.</P>

It might happen that a person employed under one local authority would have his years of service as a secondary teacher taken into account for pension purposes and that another local body would refuse to grant a pension commensurate with the number of years' service of a teacher similarly circumstanced.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by way of custom that superannuation is granted on a certain basis.  With regard to the added years, a committee, as in the case of the County Roscommon Vocational Education Committee, may decide in their wisdom or unwisdom not to grant an officer who had service as a Gaelic League teacher the full number of added years which it would be possible to give him on the ground which, I understand, was the reason given by the Roscommon Vocational Education Committee, that while they were willing to give him added years in respect of the period of his service within the county, they were not prepared to give him added years for service outside the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> That question will certainly arise with the vocational education committees if they are being asked to add on a considerable number of years by way of superannuation for service as a secondary or as primary teacher which had not been given within their own county and, having regard to the heavy liabilities in regard to superannuation that will be falling on local authorities, there may be some disinclination to put up proposals.  But, as I said on the Second Reading, I think that, generally speaking, committees will be disposed to treat these cases considerately. If a committee refuses to recommend an officer for the full number of added years to which he may be entitled, he has the right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government.  If he does not appeal within six months, then his case goes by the board.  That is what actually happened in the Roscommon case so that it cannot be reopened now.</P>
    <P>The case of the Congested Districts Board officials who are now in the service can be dealt with if they can be considered to be special cases.  The Minister for Local Government, in promising me that he will give special consideration to cases of officers who would not receive superannuation of a reasonable character as they would not have, let us say, 25 years' service, and extra consideration, if I may use the term, if they had primary or secondary teaching service to their credit, does not exclude other types of cases where there might be hardship. It is part of the understanding with the Department of Local Government that, if there are other cases, they can be considered so long as there are special circumstances relating to them, and they are recommended by the committee to the Minister for consideration. The Minister has not promised that the number of years I mentioned in the Second Reading debate will be given in all cases.  They would be the maxima.  The intention was that every officer with less than 25 years' service, for example, when the age of retiral affected him, might be granted up to a maximum of five years' additional service. If he had a number of years' service as a primary or secondary teacher he might be granted ten added <Col N="978" /> years.  That would be the maximum. That does not, as I have said, exclude other cases which had special circumstances relating to them and were deserving of consideration.</P>

      <P>I need not spend any time on this amendment because an identical one to an identical section in another Bill was accepted by the House less than five weeks ago.  A section similar to this appeared in the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill.  I moved exactly the same amendment to it that I am moving now to this section.  It was accepted by the Minister and passed by the House.  I think it would be unfair to the House to repeat the reasons for an amendment which was accepted so recently.  The acceptance of this amendment will bring the sections in the two Bills into uniformity, a matter about which we heard so much.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the acceptance of the amendment, although I do not know that it is really <Col N="979" /> necessary.  The meaning that I take out of the expression &ldquo;as soon as conveniently may be&rdquo; is &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;, having regard to the circumstances. If, for example, an officer is suspended by reason of the misuse of funds under his control, it may happen that a special audit, which will have to be made, let us say before the inquiry, will be rendered necessary. Therefore, even with the greatest desire to get the matter dealt with urgently, in justice to the suspended officer, there may be an unavoidable delay.  I take it that Senator Kingsmill Moore appreciates that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>

      <P>If a considerable lapse of time occurred between the suspension and the holding of the inquiry into the justification for the suspension, there might be a very considerable loss of salary in the event of the accused person being found wrongly accused. The very words in the sub-section that &ldquo;such alleged failure, misconduct or unfitness is being inquired into&rdquo; postulate that the inquiry ensues upon the suspension with the least possible delay.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 14, after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or the appropriate vocational committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under this section, the vocational committee itself, or the Minister, may suspend an officer, but only the Minister may remove a suspension, and that does not seem to me to be right.  I am proposing that the appropriate vocational committee may terminate a suspension under this section and I do not think there is any need for me to dwell on the arguments in favour of it.  I think it is common sense that if the committee suspends, the committee should have the right to terminate the suspension, just as when the Minister suspends, he has the right to terminate the suspension.</P>

      <P>I desire to support that. Remember that the vocational committee is the body that appoints the teacher who has been suspended, and the members are in touch with the particular teacher's work.  If it comes to their knowledge that something has occurred necessitating the suspension of that teacher, and subsequently they find out that their action in suspending him should be modified and they should remove the suspension, I think they should have the right to do it.  I thoroughly agree that if a teacher is suspended at the instance of the Minister, only the Minister should have the right to remove that suspension.  When a teacher is suspended by the body appointing him, that body should have the right to reinstate him when it has had an opportunity to investigate the circumstances.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="981" />&ldquo;The Minister or the appropriate vocational committee may terminate a suspension under this section and every such suspension shall continue until so terminated.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That may not be the intention.  If it were clear that the amendment referred only to suspension imposed by the committee itself, and sought to give the committee power to terminate it, there might be something to be said for it, but even there, I think, such an amendment ought to envisage the sanction of the Minister being necessary.  If the committee were to be able to terminate the suspension of an officer, having first suspended him, without any reference to the Minister, I think that would be unfortunate.  I believe the sanction of the Minister should be necessary, and it is clear that the committee could not be given the right to terminate a suspension imposed by the Minister.  That would give rise to confusion.</P>

      <P>My want of knowledge of drafting must be responsible for leaving the amendment open to the interpretation which the Minister sees in it and which, I now agree, it contains. I intended only that if the vocational committee suspended a teacher or an officer, it would have the right to terminate that suspension, but I did not propose or suggest at all that if the Minister suspended a teacher the committee should have the right to terminate it.  I am glad to hear that the Minister admitted that something might be said for what was my real intention and, therefore, with the permission of the House, I will withdraw this amendment and try to get a suitable form of words for the Report Stage.</P>

If it is the intention, as it seems to be, to withdraw the present amendment and to consider a further one, I would suggest to Senator O'Connell seriously to consider whether it would not be far better, in the interests of the teachers and of the committees, to leave the matter as it stands in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Under sub-section (3) of this section, the Minister may terminate the suspension of a teacher. Sub-section (1) provides for two different authorities.  The first is the Minister.  Where there is reason to believe that certain things have happened, he can suspend the man against whom the allegations are made. Under sub-section (3), the Minister may terminate a suspension.  What I am not clear about is this: does that apply to a suspension other than that made by the Minister himself?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, of course.  The Minister may terminate a suspension arbitrarily or on grounds stated.  Is that act of the Minister taken in substitution for an inquiry? It is clear that where the vocational education committee is the suspendor, <Col N="983" /> an inquiry is to ensure, with a view to determining whether or not the suspension is to be permanent.  In other words, is there to be dismissal along with the punishment of having portion of the salary sequestrated?  But where the Minister is the suspendor, he is empowered by the section to terminate the suspension, as a result of an inquiry, or merely as a result of representations made to him, or merely because he has come to the conclusion that the offender is sufficiently punished. It seems to me that there is quite an amount of vagueness and want of proper determination in the wording of that clause.  So much for sub-section (3).  With regard to sub-section (5), the Bill declares:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The holder of an office who is suspended under this section shall not be paid any remuneration in respect of such office during the continuance of his suspension....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister said, just now, that in the case of the suspended officer making a good defence, or on its being discovered that he has been unjustifiably suspended, compensation can be paid to him, but I thought he added some reservation in regard to that which I did not quite clearly apprehend.  It is possible under sub-section (5) that the holder is not paid any remuneration in respect of his office during the continuance of his suspension which may be unduly prolonged owing to protracted investigations.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... the remuneration which he would, had he not been suspended, have been paid during the period of suspension shall be wholly or partly forfeited, or paid to him, or otherwise disposed of, as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see nothing in the wording there but the conferring on the Minister of very arbitrary power.  By implication he is permitted to fine.  He is not a court of law; the Minister is not a court.  By implication in this section he is permitted to fine by withholding the whole or part of the salary.  The Minister, incidentally, in a previous reply said: &ldquo;He was not employed <Col N="984" /> during that interval,&rdquo; meaning, as I took it, he therefore had earned no salary.  Let us not forget that he was suspended by his employers because of some allegation or other which has not been sustained, in the supposititious case that I make of the man being cleared in regard to the offence with which he is charged.</P>
    <P>It seems to me this is very arbitrary and, with regard to that, I should be so audacious as to say that the Minister has been very badly served in the draftsmanship of his Bills.  This is not the first Education Bill which has been a mass of words, clauses within clauses, exceptions within exceptions, until we have had just now one section where there was a sentence I counted of 35 lines.  It is very hard for anyone to follow the complexities of these statements.  I take it on myself to allege that Section 7 is a particularly bad example of draftsmanship:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever in respect of the holder of an office under a vocational education committee there is, in the opinion of such committee&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This Bill abounds in &ldquo;suches&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or of the Minister, reason to believe that such holder has failed to perform satisfactorily the duties of such office or has misconducted himself in relation to such office&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>whatever that means&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or is otherwise unfit to hold such office, such committee or the Minister (as the case may be) may suspend such holder from the performance of the duties of such office while such alleged failure, misconduct, or unfitness is being inquired into...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is not verbiage, I do not know what verbiage is.  In attempting to understand it, I can only say that sub-section (5) amounts to conferring on the Minister the power of penalising, inflicting a penalty, and that, as I understand, under the Constitution, belongs to a court or a tribunal equivalent to it.  There is a want of thought about the whole matter, as if the thing were arrived at hurriedly.  I regret to say that, but I feel it my duty to say it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;An officer who is suspended under this section shall not receive any remuneration from the local authority during the continuance of his suspension, and at the termination of his suspension the remuneration which he would have received during the period of suspension if he had not been suspended shall be wholly or partly forfeited, or paid to him, or otherwise disposed of, as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been operating these powers for the past 11 years and I do not think I have ever had a case of suspension of that kind&mdash;perhaps I might have had one or two.  I certainly think that Senator Magennis's fears are groundless&mdash;unless we are to deprive Ministers of all reasonable discretion in dealing with cases of suspension by endeavouring to put down in black and white, in advance, all the circumstances that may arise.  It may happen that the Minister, if he took a severe attitude in regard to a suspended officer, might press for his dismissal.  On the other hand, he may consider that the suspension over a period has been a sufficient punishment&mdash;and the Minister may not be wrong in that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that the fact that there is a similar provision to this in legislation already passed, does not necessarily make this right or justified.  The Minister has power, should he wish to use it, to refuse to pay any remuneration to a teacher for the period of his suspension, even though the charge may be unfounded.  I do not see any reason why, if the complaint on which he has been suspended is found on investigation to be unjustified and unsustainable, he should not get full payment for the period of suspension.  All the Bill says is that it might be wholly or partly forfeited, or it might be paid to him or otherwise disposed of.  But there is no assurance that, even if he is found not guilty of the charges made against him&mdash;even if it is found that there is no justification for the complaint on which he was suspended&mdash; that he will be paid his salary for the full period of his suspension.</P>
      <P>I can cite for the Minister's information a case which occurred under a previous Government, before he was appointed Minister for Education, of a teacher who was arrested and charged with an offence.  Some considerable time elapsed before his trial came on and he was then found not guilty.  In the meantime, another teacher had been appointed in his place and was being paid by the Department.  When the teacher asked that he should be paid for the period of his suspension, the answer was: &ldquo;We cannot pay two people for the same job at the same time.  We have already paid a teacher and we cannot pay you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eventually, and only as a result of a threat of legal proceedings, of bringing the Department into court, they did pay up.  They could have been taken into court only because they made a <Col N="987" /> technical mistake at the beginning, but only for that the teacher could have gone without his salary, just because another teacher was paid in his place. It is not fair that there should not be a full assurance to the teacher concerned that if charges against him prove to be frivolous or unfounded, he will get his salary for the period of his suspension.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not replied to my inquiry with regard to sub-section (3): &ldquo;The Minister may terminate a suspension under this section.&rdquo;  My question was whether he did that by his absolute <i>flat,</i> or as a result of some inquiry or substitution for an inquiry.  On the constitutional point, may I be permitted to give a parallel out of my own experience?  For the first five years of the operation of the law in respect of the censoring of films, I had the unpleasant office of chairman of the Film Appeals Board, and, according to the law, the film renter's representative here was at liberty to appeal against the decision of the State censor refusing a certificate of exhibition, on depositing the sum of £5.  If the chairman of the appeal board decided against him, that is, in favour of the State censor's refusal of a certificate, the £5 could be, and frequently was, forfeited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of my period of office, when the &ldquo;talkies&rdquo;, as they are called, were beginning to make a threatening appearance above the horizon, I wrote a report on the operation of the film censorship legislation and the work of the censorship by way of advice to the Government, and I pointed out that, in exercising this function and withholding from the film renter the reimbursement of his £5, I was, in effect, inflicting a fine.  I fined him £5 for daring to appeal against the State censor without being able to win, and I drew attention in that report to the fact that there was nothing in the Constitution entitling our Film Appeals Board to fine anyone, for that was the function of a judge, according to the Constitution.  In our new Constitution, because of that representation, I take it, there is a specific <Col N="988" /> article empowering bodies which are not in the strict sense courts of law, or individuals who are not in the strict sense judges, to do certain things which are equivalent to acts of a court. I regret that, speaking <i>extempore,</i> I am not able to cite the number of the Article, but I know it is there.</P>
    <P>Surely if, as was pointed out by Senator O'Connell, the Minister is authorised to withhold payment of his salary from a man who has been suspended, even though it is proved in the last resort that he has been unfairly suspended, it is analogous to that of the chairman of the Appeals Board on films fining the renter's representative for not having succeeded in his appeal.  I suggest, with all respect, that the Minister should take this Bill back and reconsider its wording.  As Senator O'Connell very properly says, the fact that it was passed in 1926 does not make it valid in 1944, when it undergoes revision, or ought to undergo revision.  A great many things pass through without being adverted to, which subsequent reflection will show should have been considered at greater length and in more detail.  There is one thing we ought to avoid, and especially in an Act for the beneficial improvement of the education of the people, that is, injustice.  It is an irony to introduce the power to do an injustice into a Bill which purports to be for the betterment of the educational system of the country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I had to leave the House on the business of the Seanad.  I wanted to make a point on this sub-section.  Vocational teachers are not extremely well-paid.  They can ill afford to lose an income, and if a man is suspended and it is subsequently found that there was no reason for his suspension, it is quite unjust that for something over which he had no control and which occurred through no fault of his, he should be deprived of two, three, or perhaps six months' salary.  The Minister who knows these circumstances as well as we do should provide that where a man is found not guilty, against whom nothing is proved and whose suspension proves to have had no reasonable grounds, <Col N="989" /> he should not suffer.  He belongs to a class of people who are not well paid and the loss of a few months' salary is a very serious matter for him.  If the committee or the Minister has made the mistake, then the committee or the Minister should pay for it, and not the victim of the mistake.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what is the meaning of the words &ldquo;or otherwise dispose of&rdquo;.  If a man is not paid his salary during suspension, I can quite understand his salary being withheld, if he is found guilty, and if there are extenuating circumstances and a man is reinstated, I can quite understand a partial payment being made.  It would be a matter between the paying person and the employee, but how the Minister can take power to dispose of it otherwise, I find it very difficult to understand. I find it difficult to see that there would be any moral right to dispose of it otherwise, except maybe by paying it to the man's family.</P>

      <P>It might be given to the man's family.  Only one or two cases have arisen during my period of office, and the legislation generally regarding these matters of suspension is in conformity with the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1941.  Generally speaking, the disciplinary code which is enforced through the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would be similar to that enforced by the Minister for Education, so far as the vocational education service is concerned.  The hypothetical cases mentioned do not get us very far.  Even if, to meet the point made, a definite amendment were put into the section, providing for the case where it had been proved that a suspension was wrong and unjust, there would still remain, I presume, the position that the Minister would have to be satisfied before the suspended officer could be paid.  I do not think you could give the power to the committee, any more than you could give them power to terminate the suspension without reference to the Minister.  I do not think you could give the committee power to pay an officer, without any reference to the Minister, as <Col N="990" /> to whether the circumstances justified it.  In the long run, you either have to accept the position that I mentioned in reply to Senator Magennis, to leave the Minister discretion, and agree that he ought to be satisfied or you do not.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I did not fully realise the point made by Senator Magennis and did not go as far as I could have gone in meeting him.  I should have made it clear that I have no doubt whatever, where it is proved that the suspension was wrong, or unjust, or should not have been made, that the Minister would direct that payment should be made to the officer for the period of his suspension.  Even if the amendment was introduced, I do not see how the matter could be settled without reference to the Minister, in the last resort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. <Col N="992" /> I was chidden, very gently by the Taoiseach for making a Second Reading speech on the First Reading of this Bill.  In the circumstances, he gave me plenary absolution and exacted no penance.  I think it is due to him to make some amends, and I propose to make those amends by making a First Reading speech on the Second Reading of the Bill.  The First Reading of a Bill is a matter of explanation and the Second Reading is a matter of discussion of the principle.  It became obvious, I think, in the course of the speeches on the First Reading that my attempted explanation of this Bill had not been adequate to make it understood and that, on the other hand, the principle which lies behind the Bill was accepted fully and explicitly and by no less a person than the Taoiseach himself.  He had been anticipated, as I reminded the House, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, when an amendment was proposed which, in the main, had exactly the same effect as this Bill, replied that he could think of no case that he could make against it.  The Taoiseach himself, if I may quote his words on the First Reading&mdash;I am not going to attempt to quote the speech in full; I am leaving out at this stage the qualifications which the Taoiseach made and with which I shall have to deal later&mdash;as reported at column 884 said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am as jealous for the democratic rights of legislative assemblies such as this as any member of the House, I believe, could be.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an earlier portion of his speech, he pointed out that the democratic rights of legislative assemblies, for which he was jealous, were in essence, the rights of the Houses of the Oireachtas to control the making of laws by the Executive or any person to whom the Executive had delegated that power; because, the Taoiseach said, he felt that the power of amending statutes or suspending them was a very serious power for any Executive or any Minister to have; and that he himself had tried to separate those Orders which purported to exercise power, so that a special procedure <Col N="993" /> could be adopted in that regard. Further, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the democratic point of view there must always be some objection to extended powers of this nature given to a Minister or a Government. The only ground that can be urged for giving such powers is the absolute necessity arising out of the emergency, that you cannot devise any means that will give the necessary power to enable things to be done quickly, where swift action is necessary, otherwise than by giving almost complete discretion to a Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At a later stage, the Taoiseach said that he personally had been impressed by the view which had been expressed previously in the Seanad on this question and that he seriously and earnestly tried to get some accommodation so that we should be able to deal with it; and his only reason for questioning not the importance, but the practicability of this Bill, was that he was not certain that you could meet both needs, that is, the needs of the emergency and the natural desire to see that representative institutions retained their full power even during the emergency.  On those quotations I rest my assertion that the Taoiseach has stated that he is as jealous as any person for the rights of a representative assembly to control legislation by the Executive and I do not propose to consider any further the question of principle involved in this Bill because, as I understand, it is already accepted.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is commonly credited and, I think, correctly, with having had a very considerable amount to do with the drafting of the Constitution which now prevails in Éire.  That Constitution deliberately set up a form of government which is known as representative democracy, and nobody in this House can suggest that it is not one of the cardinal rules of a representative democracy that it is the Legislature and not the Executive that makes the laws.  If, for the purpose of convenience, or in the stress of emergency, power is delegated to the Executive or to other people to make the laws, then the Legislature must retain the ultimate <Col N="994" /> power of controlling the laws so made by the Executive.  A lawyer would say that the admissions to which I have referred have already shifted the onus of proof in regard to this Bill and that it did not rest with me to persuade Senators that this Bill was necessary in principle; but that, as the principle has been accepted, this Bill must pass unless adequate reasons could be put forward by those who are anxious to oppose it.</P>
    <P>I, like most lawyers, object to standing on legal points, and therefore I propose to examine, with your assistance, the objections to this Bill which were adumbrated on the First Reading. Before I do so, may I say this. The Bill before you is a skeleton.  It is a skeleton which can be expanded or compressed and to which you can add flesh and blood.  It is put before you by a person who stands here as an Independent and who has not asked one single person in this House to cast a vote in its favour.  I have endeavoured, in drafting this Bill, to solve a problem.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that my solution may not be a perfect one and, if a Second Reading is given to this Bill, in Committee it may be possible to amend it and improve it in various ways.  The reason why I have not asked one single person to vote for this Bill is because I want everyone here to help with it.  I want nobody to approach this from the point of view that it is introduced by a political Party, that it attempts in any way to impede the Government.  I ask you to approach it as people who want to help me in solving a problem which the Taoiseach has admitted has given him great anxiety and which he says that the Civil Service has failed to solve.</P>
    <P>Now that was the first argument that was used against this Bill.  The Taoiseach said that because of the serious political issues which were involved&mdash; abstract political issues&mdash;and because he felt that it was wrong that a power such as this should be in existence, he had referred it to the Civil Service to suggest some means by which the unlimited power now indirectly capable of being reposed in them could be in some way limited.  I wonder did the Taoiseach expect that the Civil Service <Col N="995" /> in their various departments would be tumbling over themselves in their eagerness to suggest something which should, even in a small degree, limit their autocracy?  If you were to say to a spirited horse: &ldquo;Go away now and design a bridle for yourself,&rdquo; what do you think would be the reply of that horse if he had any Civil Service training?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do better than that.  I was going to suggest that he would say that he had considered all forms of bridles, from those used by the ancient Egyptians in Europe and those used by the ancient Aztecs in America, right up to the latest suggestions on the files of the Patent Office, that he had measured them, that he had tested them, that he had compared them, that he had given serious consideration as to whether rope or leather were the better; but, at the end of it all, after the closest possible analysis, he had come to the conclusion that no conceivable bridle would be suitable for him.  That, of course, is the reply of the Civil Service who are asked to suggest some means by which they may have to be a little more careful about the framing of these Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in this House before dissociated myself from the thoughtless and erroneous criticism which is usually passed on the Civil Service. But, at the same time, I am not willing to subscribe to the view that &ldquo;they are the men and that wisdom will die with them.&rdquo;  They are human, and because they are human, they are apt to make mistakes.  They are human, and because of that humanity, they do not very much care for these mistakes to be pointed out and corrected.  They are human, and to them the easiest way of doing a thing is the simplest and most acceptable. They are human, and they are not altogether dead to the pleasurable thrill which comes from the sense of what is an enormous unlimited power. Therefore, I say that the mere fact that the Civil Service did not suggest a suitable method of controlling the unlimited power of amending or suspending <Col N="996" /> legislation is no reason for assuming that a solution of the problem cannot be found.  The object of this Bill is to see if the Seanad, by its united brains and its united experience, cannot solve that problem which the Civil Service profess to have baffled them.</P>
    <P>In this House, however, there are men who can combine the experience of very many walks of life, men of very different education and of very different outlook; and it does seem to me that, if this problem is to be solved, it is more likely that the solution can be found by pooling our brains for once instead of pitting them against each other and seeing if, after having given this Bill a Second Reading, we cannot on the Committee Stage produce a Bill which will attain the main object, accepted by the Taoiseach, without involving him in any of the difficulties which he suggested might arise.</P>
    <P>Before going on to the further objections which were raised, I think I should deal with a matter to which I have already referred, which is not so much an objection as a ground of misunderstanding.  The point has been made that Orders such as those with which this Bill deals&mdash;what the Taoiseach calls the parent Order&mdash;are, in fact, tabled before the House.  This Bill does not deal with Emergency Powers Orders in general.  It was quite apparent at the First Reading that some people were under that impression. This Bill deals only with Orders made by what has been called aptly the cow and calf method.  The method is that you have an original Order which is known as the cow Order, made by the Government.  That Order, as you would expect from a quite animal like a cow, does nothing at the time.  It merely gives the cow liberty to calve.  The Order you have to watch is the subsequent Order, made by the cow when it calves.  In other words, the original or parent Order gives to a Minister&mdash;or anybody else, and it might be to me, since the Act goes as far as that&mdash;the power to make an Order on certain lines. Now, it has been suggested that objection could be taken and debate promoted when the cow comes into existence&mdash;but there is no statutory period of gestation for this cow.  You <Col N="997" /> do not know when it is going to calve and you do not know what the calf will be like when it comes.</P>
    <P>Therefore I say it is a futile objection to suggest that, when a power is given to a Minister to do something, the whole matter can be suitably debated on the Order giving the power. That power may never be exercised and, therefore, it would be ridiculous to waste the time of the House discussing whether it is right or not. When it is exercised, conditions may have so changed that it is a very proper and beneficial exercise to which every member of the House would say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;.  The only practical time for examining the calf is when the calf is born.  The object of this Bill is merely, when the second Order is made, when the circumstances are known and when the terms of the Order and the need for it are known, that it may be examined in this House; and then, if it be excessive, if it be careless, if it be oppressive or erroneous, this House can control what is done by that Order.  Remember that there is nothing at the present moment to prevent power being given to the Minister for Justice, at such time in the future as he desires, by an Order made in his study, to abolish the criminal courts of the land and to substitute courts-martial for every man, woman and child in Eire.  That could be done and, if it were done by this method, the necessity or the desirability of such an Order could not be questioned in either House.  So much for the argument that, because the parent Order has to be tabled, there is no necessity for a provision for the tabling of the delegated order when it is made.</P>
    <P>In the next objection, it was suggested that this Bill, if it be passed in its present form by the House, would in some way interfere with&mdash;and here I quote the Taoiseach, or, it may be, Senator Quirke&mdash;&ldquo;the necessary power to do things quickly where swift action is necessary&rdquo;.  Let me disabuse the House of that: there is not a word about that in the Bill.  There is not a word in this Bill which would prevent either the Government, or the person to whom power has been delegated by the Government, from making the <Col N="998" /> Order 30 seconds after he thinks it necessary.  This Bill does not purport to interfere with any power of making Orders given by an Emergency Powers Act in existence.</P>
    <P>The next argument was&mdash;and this was certainly Senator Quirke&mdash;that this Bill would make the work of the Civil Service impossible, as they would have to table all Orders. Senator Quirke said there were some 40,000 Orders in respect of fuel. Apparently that is so, as I notice that the sheaf of paper for notes which I have before me has on its back a large number of unused fuel Order forms. Again, it is hardly worth while stressing the answer to that.  The Bill does not do that: it does not make necessary the automatic tabling of a single Order.  So far from all the 40,000 Orders mentioned by Senator Quirke and the various Government regulations having to be brought before the House by this Bill, not one single delegated Order will be tabled, unless seven members of either this House or the Dáil have put their names in writing to a requisition, giving the name and number of the particular Order which they think should be brought before the House for discussion, and requiring that that Order shall be tabled.  You have there two safeguards. First of all, you have a safeguards, in that no Senator is likely to expose himself to ridicule by asking that there be brought before the House an Order of purely administrative, local or individual importance; and seven Senators are a great deal more than seven times less likely so to do. It is only when a Minister, or another person who has made such an Order, receives a written requisition naming the particular Order which, in the view of those who signed the requisition, should be tabled before the House, that he need put it before you.</P>
    <P>The next point made was that certain Orders might be of a confidential nature.  The instance was given of an Order putting a person into an internment camp.  The actual Orders in those cases are usually not made under a delegated emergency power.  But can anybody conceive Orders of that nature&mdash;which are Executive, Ministerial Orders&mdash;being required to be <Col N="999" /> tabled?  You must distinguish between those which are known and those which are not known.  If they are not known, they cannot be requisitioned.</P>
    <P>The only kind of Order which in practice you could require for tabling would be an Order which was actually in print and published because if you did not know about it you could not require it.  Someone may suggest that there could be a requisition as to a confidential order.  I do not think that objection is seriously meant.  Again I think you will agree that seven members would not be prepared to do a thing like that.  In so far as this is concerned, I am prepared if it is in my power to do so&mdash;unless the House votes against me&mdash;to accept on the Committee Stage an amendment in this form: if the Minister or a Minister of State certifies under his hand that the publication and tabling of the Order would endanger the security of the State or public safety, that such a certificate would be an answer to the requisition by the seven Senators.  In that I am adopting the procedure we use in the law courts, because in the law courts one litigant can force another to discover all documents which are relevant to the case, but if certain of these documents happen to be documents of State then an affidavit made by a Minister that the production of those documents is against the interests of the State protects the documents from disclosure.  An amendment along those lines, worked out in Committee, is one which I, personally, would be perfectly willing to accept.</P>
    <P>The last objection was that Orders affecting private firms might be disclosed. Again, that entirely misconceives the scope and nature of the Bill but, again, I would be prepared to accept an amendment that a certificate by a Minister saying that the production of the Order would involve disclosure of commercial secrets, should be a sufficient answer.  I do not think these amendments are necessary because I think the suggestion is perfectly fantastic that this Bill would have any effect upon such purely administrative Orders, but if there is any fear and if Senators think that would in any way be the position, I am willing <Col N="1000" /> to accept such an amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this House has appreciated the moderate nature of this Bill.  The Taoiseach has referred to the principle whereby legislative Orders are to be controlled.  There are a number of ways of doing this.  The way suggested in this Bill is milder than any way that has yet been used. The ordinary way was that a provisional Order had to be passed as a statute through the Houses.  Then there was the method by which Orders made by the Executive or under Executive power should be laid before the House and should not come into force until resolutions had been passed by the House or tabled by a certain time.  These methods were clearly inapplicable in the cases of emergencies and, therefore, the Government introduces in the Emergency Powers Act a provision which applies to Emergency Powers Orders made by the Government.  Section 9 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every emergency Order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling such Order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which such House has sat after such Order is laid before it, such Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a section introduced by the Government.  It provides that the Government can make an Order and that nothing ever done under that Order shall be subsequently impeached.  But the Order may be discussed and if necessary annulled.  Surely if the Government was willing, and thought it necessary, that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be given a controlling power such as that over Orders made by the Government, is it not very much more necessary that the House should have some similar power over Orders not made by the Government at all but made by some underling to whom that power has been delegated and who will not have the same responsibility and care as the Government that have made <Col N="1001" /> such an Order?  The provision I have drafted follows word for word the provision in that section.  It is provision for having the Order tabled, provision for discussing and annulling it.</P>
    <P>In respect of these Orders, which should be much more jealously guarded than Orders made by the Government itself, I have gone further and suggested that there should be no automatic tabling of the Orders at all, and that they should be merely tabled if seven responsible members of the Legislature think it is necessary. Could a Bill be more moderately drafted or less oppressive than that? It does not provide that every Order shall come before the House.  It gives full scope for having an Order made as soon as anyone thinks fit.  It allows that Order to remain in force, and whoever has made that Order cannot be impeached for anything done under it.  It merely says that if the Order turns out to be bad Senators and Deputies will be able to say: &ldquo;Put it before the House, so that we will see if it may be annulled.&rdquo;  And, of course, even if an Order were annulled the Minister would make another Order next day embodying the criticisms made and improving the Order which had proved to be defective.</P>
    <P>If I were to say that this was an opportunity for this Seanad to subserve at least one of the purposes for which it was created, some people might take umbrage at the form of the expression.  Let me put it in a very simple way.  It has been suggested that it is impossible to combine this principle which everybody accepts with practical work.  I do not accept in this or indeed in anything that word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;.  I believe it is possible.  I believe that the Bill I have drafted does do it, and I am quite sure that it can be improved and amended in Committee.  Let us approach this in a spirit of co-operation. Let us first of all give it a Second Reading and let us then unite our brains and our experience.  If you do, I am perfectly certain that a Bill will emerge which when it has passed this House will be adopted by the Taoiseach as a Government Bill and which will combine the principle of <Col N="1002" /> representative government with the needs of the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the very clear exposition of the provisions of this Bill from Senator Kingsmill Moore.  Certainly he has not been excessive or violent in what he has urged on the Seanad.  I think all of us, not only in recent months but for years past, have been aware of the dangers that lurk in an excessive power to legislate by Order.  I use the words &ldquo;to legislate by Order&rdquo;, but my chief objection to it is that it is not legislation at all, but making a law by mandate or declaration, not by legislation.  That practice went on very largely for many years before the present emergency and it gave rise in other countries with democratic constitutions to a considerable amount of uneasiness inasmuch as it increased the power of individual Ministers to add to the law that Parliament was considering or was about to accept.  Everybody who gave attention to the matter felt uneasy about that condition.  One of the highest legal authorities in a neighbouring country wrote a book specially to explain how unsafe it was to allow such a habit to grow.  However, it was not interfered with and it grew enormously during the emergency, which affected other countries as well as our own.  Far more laws are now enacted on the authority of a Minister than on the direct authority of Parliament.  That is so in a country where the abuse is, perhaps, not so great as in this country.  Perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; until I have adduced some argument to justify its use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us were anxious that this special legislation should endure for the emergency only and should not persist for a longer period.  I do not think that any of us four and a half years ago had any conception that Emergency Orders would flow out in such torrents as has been the case during the past few years, Many of us have seen the drawbacks and the viciousness of the system of taking away the power of a Parliament to legislate for the country for which it is supposed to legislate. Many people who have not taken the <Col N="1003" /> trouble to condemn the system have felt very unhappy about it, and the matter has been considered by many members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I may be permitted to refer to the opinion expressed by a commission set up six or eight years ago to consider plans for a new Seanad.  At that time, the Seanad had disappeared from our Constitution and a commission was appointed by the Government of the day to consider the advisability of establishing a new Seanad.  That commission considered many and varied topics.  Amongst those topics, was this question of legislation by Order, and the commission expressed an opinion upon it.  The report of the commission is an awkward one with which to deal because it is a personal report by the chairman of the commission, the late Chief-Justice Kennedy.  It states the decisions of the commission as a whole in regard to many points and, at other times, it states the views of a section of the commission.  One has to attend to the wording in order to be assured as to whether it is the opinion of the commission or of a section of the commission that is being stated. That commission had as members a number of people with Parliamentary experience.  Some of the members are now Senators.  The opinion expressed by the commission on this matter was not a majority or group opinion.  There was no dissent from it.  The suggestion was that Orders made by way of legislation, or for carrying out legislation, should be the particular care of the Seanad.  Such Orders, it was held, might be the peculiar study of the Seanad with a view to deciding whether, in the opinion of that body, they should become law or not.</P>
    <P>I remember the discussion that took place at a meeting of the commission in an adjoining room.  I do not think that I am misrepresenting any members of the commission when I say that none of them was opposed to that measure of protection.  Whether that recommendation or the proposal by Senator Kingsmill Moore, which we are now discussing, would be the more efficacious, I do not know, but the present proposal falls in well with the ideas of the commission which considered <Col N="1004" /> this matter.  There is nothing, therefore, revolutionary, radical, unconstitutional or anti-constitutional in accepting such a measure as Senator Kingsmill Moore proposes.  I understood from his speech just now that he is not tied to the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the Bill which we are discussing, that he is quite willing to consider any amendments to improve the measure that the Seanad considers advisable.  We must keep before our minds the necessity of protecting democratic legislation and not allowing it to lapse into a series of mandates or ukases from individual Ministers, however much we may respect their judgment and admire their devotion to their duties.  I think I am not exaggerating when I say that, when special legislation is introduced for a specific purpose, it has a way of being carried on for months or years after the conditions that called it into being have disappeared.  Some of us may remember that, in another country, it was found necessary to control the sale of cigarettes between 1914 and 1918. Orders which were issued at that time for the purpose of dealing with so simple a matter as the sale of cigarettes during a time of emergency were carried on for years after the emergency had ended and conditions of normal peace had been restored.</P>
    <P>From mere inertia, a dislike to change an Order in existence, it is very hard to avoid these things being carried on, of people being hampered and tied up and their liberty interfered with by Orders which have no relation to the circumstances existing at the moment.  I think we ought to do everything in our power to make it clear that, in the opinion of the Seanad, these Orders are an abnormal form of government.  I do not say, of course, that very many of these Orders are not necessary.  I am sure most of them are, at any rate at the time they are made.  I do not think that any of us would move in this House to have the power of making Orders abolished.  I certainly would not join with any fellow-Senator who wished to make that the policy of the country.  The power to make Orders is very useful and very necessary, particularly in <Col N="1005" /> times of emergency and for convenience at other times also, but it constitutes a danger which we have to guard against.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore's Bill calls for a very simple precaution which would, I think, avert the chief danger arising from these Orders under which we are living at present, and the tenor of which most of us do not know or cannot find time to know.  I certainly do not know.  Senator Kingsmill Moore quoted the enormous number of Orders in existence at present on some minor matters.  My memory does not retain the number of them, thank God. Is there any Senator who could reckon in the middle of the week the tenor of the various Orders that we get every day?  They are flooded out in the cataracts that we have been accustomed to during the last four years.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Seanad will decide to move in the direction that this Bill points, whether they decide to adopt the Bill as it is or with amendments, which probably would be the more practical and feasible thing to do.  I am sorry for detaining the Seanad, but I have come on the quotation that I want to give from the statement made by the chairman of the commission, the late Chief Justice Kennedy, to which I referred earlier.  Paragraph 9 of the report of the commission reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The commission is of opinion that the examination of the Rules and Orders for giving effect to legislation also affords material for the special attention of the Second House, or of a special joint committee of both Houses set up for the purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of Senators to that statement: &ldquo;The commission is of opinion.&rdquo;  It does not say how many members: whether that was the opinion of a majority of the members or of so many members.  It says that &ldquo;the commission is of opinion that the examination of the Rules and Orders for giving effect to legislation&rdquo;. As that is given in the singular case, it would seem to suggest that, among the members of the commission, there was only one opinion on this matter. The report does not say whether the commission was unanimous or not.  It <Col N="1006" /> is impossible to say because the report does not state definitely that it was the unanimous opinion of the commission, but the wording certainly suggests it.  But that was the policy which this commission recommended six or eight years ago, and which, I hope, the Seanad will back up now to the extent of supporting Senator Kingsmill Moore's Bill or such modification of it as they think fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the Bill.  Notwithstanding all the fancy phrases that we have had from Senator Kingsmill Moore, I do not see any reason whatever for changing the opinions that I expressed here when this particular Bill was last under discussion. Senator Kingsmill Moore gave us a picture of the horse that was sent to look for a bridle for itself.  He likened the Civil Service to that particular horse which came back and said that it could not find any bridle suitable for itself.  I would hand back that story to Senator Kingsmill Moore and tell him that he is himself in the position of that horse, and that a lot of very sensible people who sat in this House before he came into it decided that, in this emergency, it may be necessary to apply certain restrictions, to provide certain bridles and to give certain liberties to certain people, to certain individuals or to certain Ministers. When Senator Kingsmill Moore came along he said that those people did not know what they were doing, and that he was the only one that could point out to them where they were wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Senator, one would imagine that something terrible had happened within the last week, month or two months.  Is it not a fact, however, that during the last four and a half years the country has carried on under the system which the Senator is now challenging, and that there has been no serious complaint made against the system?  I think, regardless of what Senator Kingsmill Moore tells us, that the average person in the country would resent very much the suggestion made by him or by anybody else that any further newfangled bridles are necessary to hamstring the <Col N="1007" /> present Government in their conduct of affairs during this emergency. Senator Kingsmill Moore, in his enthusiasm, said that, if some such arrangements as he suggests are not accepted, no questions can be asked in connection with any of these Orders. The Senator must know as well as anybody else that there is no trouble whatever in having a question asked in either House.  That has been done in the past.  I am afraid that the Senator completely under-estimates the seriousness of what he himself suggests.  I think he has grave doubts about the statements made by me. Unfortunately, I was called out while he was speaking, but the Senator seemed to be doubtful about certain statements I made when speaking on the last occasion.  The Senator, however, can easily verify them.  The fact, at any rate, is that in connection with the Department of Supplies 50,000 petrol permits are issued every month, and 23,000 motor vehicle permits are issued every month.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the Department of Industry and Commerce where thousands of instruments are issued in connection with turf, the compulsory acquisition of land for drainage purposes and the making of roads into bogs.  Were it not for the fact that such things were possible we would be in a very different position to-day from the point of view of fuel supplies.  Our fuel requirements are completely dependent on many of those Orders, but Senator Kingsmill Moore tells us that his Bill would not, in fact, restrict things at all.  He bases his whole argument in support of the Bill on the ground that it would not be possible that any seven members of the House would allow themselves to be used&mdash;if you put it that way, although it is a strong term to use.  I have no doubt whatever that seven people could be found to put their names to an application of that kind, if it suited a certain purpose.  I do not suggest that seven people would come together and assemble themselves in a conference and say: &ldquo;We believe we can do a lot of harm to this Government if we sign this document.&rdquo;<Col N="1008" /> I do not believe that there would be seven people who would deliberately do that, but seven people could be found who would be glad to score a point over a Minister by demanding the tabling of an Order.</P>
    <P>The whole debate is entirely unnecessary. As was pointed out the last day, it would be possible, because of personal spite against a firm, to demand the tabling of a document which would not be in the interest of that firm.  To get over that point, Senator Kingsmill Moore says he would be prepared to leave it to the Minister to say whether or not it was in the national interest, or contrary to the good of the individual or the firm concerned, or whether or not it would be wise to table a motion.  Then we come to the point where we would have borderline cases, cases which might be decided one way or the other.  If the Minister, in such a case, said he did not think it would be wise to accept the request, then the people who had originally made it would bring along a motion asking him to explain the grounds on which he came to that decision.  The whole fact of the matter is that the result of this Bill, if it were to become law, would be a tendency to retard the wheels of progress, so far as this emergency is concerned.</P>
    <P>In connection with tillage or the acquisition of land for various purposes, as I have pointed out before, there would always be in the public mind the possibility that such an Order might be annulled, and there would be continual agitation.  I could well visualise Senators being canvassed by people in the country to put their names to such a document in the hope that, as a result, they might score a point over a political or a business opponent.  Senator Kingsmill Moore goes to great lengths to tell us that he stands here as an Independent. One would think he was the only Independent in the House.  We are all supposed to be independent and non-political here, and the fact that certain groups stand together and, generally speaking, vote together is not, after all, unreasonable to expect.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Kingsmill Moore, I am a very young member of this House and I had a tremendous lot of sympathy with the idea behind the Bill which, I felt, was the preservation of our democratic institutions. But, the more I listened to him the more I discerned the fact that while he himself appreciated the difference between the cow and the calf, he was not aware that he was perpetrating another Irish bull in the form of this Bill.  He says he objects to this delegated legislation, and that he cannot know about it if the thing is not printed, but that he is quite prepared to accept an affidavit from the Minister about a thing on which he knows nothing, to the effect that there is nothing wrong in it.  I cannot see the point in the amendment which it is suggested would be brought forward in the course of the further stages of this Bill.  The Senator says, in effect, that if a Minister certifies that it is not in the public interest that the Order should be tabled, he is quite prepared to accept the Minister's certificate. But, in effect, is not that what is happening to-day?  It is, by inference, I would suggest, because when the Emergency Powers Act was passed, it was accepted that the Government, in their wisdom, would not publish certain Orders on the grounds of public security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming by inference that the same thing applies. You are now saying that if a Minister certifies that it is not in the interest of public security that an Order should be tabled you are prepared to accept the Minister's certificate.  I hold that that, in effect, is what happens at the <Col N="1010" /> present moment.  The Government are not publishing certain Orders or disclosing their contents.  I cannot claim to have as good a knowledge of logic as the Senator, but I am talking realistically and I cannot see that there is any real difference between the form of amendment as suggested by him for a further stage of this Bill and the form of procedure of acceptance of the Orders made by the Government to-day. I would say that when you go on to suggest that the Minister for Justice might make an Order abolishing the courts you are straining at the gnat.  I feel that if any Minister for Justice abolished the courts and legal procedure, he would meet with public acclaim.  We all know that the courts should have been abolished long ago, and the longer I am a member of the House the more I am convinced that it would be a welcome Order.  But to imagine such a thing would happen, or that any Minister for Justice, either present or future, would make it is overstating the case and is not facing the real facts of the position.</P>
      <P>I was very sympathetic towards what I thought was the underlying idea of the Bill, as I said that, so far as it could possibly affect it, the Legislature would control any decrees made by the Government which might involve the common good.  But when you say you are prepared to accept an amendment enabling the Minister to give a certificate, to my mind it seems almost entirely opposed to the principle of the Bill.  I do not see there was any reason for introducing the Bill, if the Senator had any such amendment at the back of his mind, and I am opposing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind as to whether it would be possible to amend this Bill on the Committee Stage in such a manner as to make it acceptable to the Taoiseach and the Government, but I do feel this, Sir, that in view of the generous statement and the generous attitude taken by the Taoiseach on the First Reading of this Bill, it is disappointing now, on the Second Stage of it, to hear the statements of Senator Quirke and Senator O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel when the Taoiseach suggested, on the occasion of the First Reading <Col N="1011" /> of this Bill, that it should be printed and given a Second Reading, that he put this House on its mettle&mdash;that he put us to the test.  He has, in fact, challenged us to produce a Bill that will act as a brake on delegated legislation and yet not interfere with Ministers and higher civil servants in the course of their duties during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I feel, if this House rejects the Bill on Second Reading, that we will be definitely running away from that challenge.  I suggest that the House should pass the Second Reading of this Bill and see what we can make of it on the Committee Stage and, if we have to admit failure ultimately on the Report Stage or the Final Stage, let that be the stage on which we will retire from the struggle to solve this very vexed question of delegated legislation by Order rather than by Act of Parliament, but do not let us run away from the issue at this early stage of the Bill before anyone has had the time or the opportunity to see what can be done in the way of its amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood when we had this Bill under discussion some short time ago that the House gave permission for a Second Reading in order that a case might be made for the Bill.  It was held by various Senators that it would not be right to oppose the First Reading, that permission to produce the Bill should be given to the Senator, so that he might have ample opportunity of putting before the House reasons for the suggested amendment.  I have listened to Senator Kingsmill Moore, but I have not found him advancing one solid, practical reason why this Bill is necessary in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He gave us some quotations.  The first quotation was from the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was dealing with the Children's Allowances Bill, and he states in support of his argument here to-night that, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce accepted a suggestion of his that certain Orders made under the Children's Allowances <Col N="1012" /> Act should be laid on the Table of the House and the Minister accepted that suggestion and embodied it in the measure, he had by that very act given Senator Kingsmill Moore something to go on in relation to all the Emergency Orders.  The subject under discussion that night was a particular Bill and not an emergency Order.  We have listened here to-night to a number of quotations of that kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore went on to refer to the cow and calf method of procedure.  As I understand the procedure, this cow Order that the Senator referred to is laid on the Table of the House and, as a body of intelligent people, when such a document is laid on the Table we should have, I think, sufficient intelligence to gather from that Order what it contains and what can or may be done under it, and we have power there and then to put down a motion to have it annulled.  But, of course, Senator Kingsmill Moore goes further and says we must wait until this cow calves. He went on to state that we may at some time have a Minister for Justice who, under the Emergency Powers, might abolish the courts and set up a court martial or military courts of various kinds.  Surely, when such action would be contemplated, that would be the proper time for Senator Kingsmill Moore to ask the House to do what he now proposes?  I suggest that as the Senator has not made a case for the Bill to the satisfaction of the members of this House, we must oppose the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather concerned to see that the House appears to be so very complacent about the privileges of Parliament.  I do think we ought to be very much concerned at the increasing growth of legislation through Orders and we ought to welcome any Bill which puts a reasonable&mdash;I would emphasise the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;&mdash;curb on such activities. It is well known that these powers are necessary, but I think in any democratically-minded State they are very much deplored and there is every desire to limit them without impairing their usefulness&mdash;to limit their extension <Col N="1013" /> in every possible way.  Therefore, I am concerned that the House seems to be willing to allow its control over legislation to be relaxed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reasonableness of this measure, I feel that Senator Kingsmill Moore has shown absolutely fully that there is no danger involved in the proposal he puts forward.  There are ample safeguards for the efficient conduct of business and no business need be in any way retarded by reason of the safeguards that he proposes. Senator Quirke&mdash;and this is not surprising, coming from him&mdash;draws a most fantastic picture of seven mischievous Senators setting out to obstruct the proper efficiency of government. I think there is no justification for anything like that.  Our record in the past has never shown that we have any desire to obstruct the efficiency of government or the proper use of legislation by Order.</P>
      <P>I could not follow the arguments of Senator O'Donnell.  It appears that he made out that every Order that was delegated that could not be tabled was so excluded from the Table on account of public security.  Not a bit of it. There are a great many Orders that are not tabled for which no Minister would for a moment claim public security as a protection.  It simply happens that they are delegated.  They are the operative Orders as against the enabling Orders.  If I am right, the Order that is tabled is an Order giving general powers to make Orders on a certain subject.  Nobody objects to the general powers, but there may be definite objections to specific Orders and if these specific Orders are not tabled the Legislature would have no say in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel this is a most important matter in a democratic State.  It is in the long run advisable that the Government of a country should be vigilant about its powers; otherwise we will drift slowly into the position that has now arisen with regard to local government.  I have heard it said on all sides that men are increasingly loth to enter local government because so much power is put into the hands of Ministers and so little responsibility is left to the local bodies.  There is considerable <Col N="1014" /> danger if Parliament allows these powers to get more and more into the hands of the Executive.  You will get indifference and a lack of that vigilance which is necessary to the proper functioning of any democratic machine.</P>
    <P>We talk glibly about democracy, but it is a very difficult thing to put into force, and if we want a country to be governed in the interests of freedom and democracy we must be alert and vigilant; we must see that the people are educated and instructed as to what it means and what are their responsibilities, and the more that is left to the Executive and the more that is taken out of the power of Parliament, the greater is the danger that democracy will be an inefficient instrument for the protection of the State.</P>

      <P>To emphasise the point made by Senator Quirke, that this House was supposed to be independent, I rise to oppose this measure, notwithstanding the fact that the name of my colleague, Senator Foran, is appended to the Bill.  My position in this matter is very simple.  I approach all matters of this kind from the point of view of the emergency which exists in this country, and, in dealing with measures of this kind, that is the overriding consideration with me.  I know that Senator Kingsmill Moore and his colleagues, in introducing this Bill, were actuated by the highest motives and had no ulterior object in doing so. I know that they are desirous of preserving the democratic institutions of this State.  I am just as anxious as they are, but this emergency, if we are to believe all we are told, and I believe it, is with us in a more aggravated form at present than ever before, and, while that condition continues, I am not prepared to take any power away from the Executive which we gave five or six years ago when this House, those of us who were then members, voted to give them the Emergency Powers Act.  That, in brief, is my attitude towards this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore has endeavoured to strike fear and terror into our hearts.  He envisaged the position which might be created if the <Col N="1015" /> Minister for Justice were to abolish the ordinary courts of the land and set up courts-martial to try the citizens. I can conceive a position arising in which that might be necessary.</P>

The people are intelligent enough to see to it that, when this emergency passes, the Parliamentary institutions will come into full operation again, that the restrictions on liberty of speech and liberty of the Press will be cleared away, and conscious as I am of the restraints and restrictions imposed on all of us by Emergency Powers Orders, I should prefer to continue to suffer them rather than to precipitate any crisis by way of the Bill promoted by Senator Kingsmill Moore and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any real need or desire for this measure.  I do not agree with Senator Quirke that we have not suffered from these restraints and restrictions.  We have all of us suffered in some degree, and, while I am as anxious for the maintenance of the democratic institutions of the State as those behind this Bill, I really do not think we ought to take away from the Executive the powers which have been given to it.  It seems strange that we have gone on for five, and nearly six, years under all the restraints imposed by Emergency Powers Orders and that it is only now becoming manifest that they are chafing some people, at any rate.  I do not impute any wrong motives or evil intentions to the promoters of the Bill. As I say, I approach this measure from the point of view that this emergency still exists, and so long as it exists, I am prepared to give this Executive, or any other Executive which may follow it during the course of the emergency, all the powers they need for the maintenance of that neutrality which was decided on by every section of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> Senator Kingsmill Moore says that the Bill is in skeleton form and that the Seanad can put as much flesh on it as it desires.  I think it was his job to do that, to dress the skeleton up before presenting it to the House.  I hope, however, that the skeleton will be restored to the cupboard for the duration of the emergency.</P>

      <P>It will do just as well to leave it in the cupboard.  I know that it is not introduced by a political Party, but, still, one cannot get away from the feeling that this measure would be used to bring many matters before the House which it might be well not to bring before the House. There are many measures which one could see being introduced by way of Emergency Powers Order which could be brought under the terms of the Bill. I do not at all agree that the civil servants are so desirous of grabbing all the power they are supposed to have at present.  I am sure the Civil Service as a whole would be glad to be rid of all this worry and trouble and to revert to their ordinary avocations, and I do not at all agree that bureaucracy is endeavouring to control and guide the affairs of this State in the way in which Senator Kingsmill Moore suggests.  I am not prepared to give any support to a measure which will impede or impair in any way the job which the Executive of this country has at present of maintaining the neutrality of the State, and that, simply, is my position in the matter.  I do not wish to reply in detail to the points raised by Senator Kingsmill Moore, Senator Rowlette and the other Senators who are promoting the Bill.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;cow and calf&rdquo; has been used repeatedly in this debate and I think it is appropriate that the Bill should be called a cow-and-calf measure because it originated in the humane slaughter of animals. That is an absolute fact.  Senator Kingsmill Moore has become obsessed by a debate which took place here in connection with two Emergency Powers Orders.  One was the &ldquo;cow&rdquo;, and it <Col N="1017" /> was laid on the Table of the House in 1942 and implemented subsequently by an Order of 1943.  Senator Kingsmill Moore, speaking of this Order and the method of its implementation by the Government, used the word &ldquo;chicanery&rdquo;, which word he subsequently withdrew.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am lost in admiration of the ingenuity which thought of this method of repealing legislation without bringing it before either House or giving either House a chance to say a word.  I withdraw the word &lsquo;chicanery&rsquo; and substitute &ldquo;ingenuity&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He took up columns and columns of the Official Report in making his remarks, but I think that any of these Orders, as I think has been mentioned already, can be discussed in either House.  They can be raised by question in the Dáil and can be raised here, as this very Order was raised by Senator Kingsmill Moore.</P>
      <P>The original Order, Emergency Powers (No. 212) Order, 1942, was laid on the Table of both Houses.  It was, if you wish, not very explanatory.  It appears in the Official Reports at column 173.  It is signed by Eamon de Valera, Taoiseach&mdash;I do not want to read the Order as it is already in print &mdash;and it means that the slaughter of animals by an approved instrument could, at any time the Minister thought it necessary, be suspended.  It lay there for over a year and then, on information which came to him and which some of us did not agree was absolutely correct, he implemented the Order in a subsequent Order by withdrawing the necessity for the use of the humane killer.  That is the genesis of this Bill and if there is nothing more serious in any of the other Orders, I think this is all merely a storm in a teacup which does not justify the time spent in debating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was personally very interested in both of these Orders.  I read the first Order when it was published, and I saw the meaning of it.  When it was enforced, I stated in this House that I did not see the absolute necessity for it.  It was worked in as an Emergency Order because, but for the existing <Col N="1018" /> emergency there would not have been a shortage of humane-killers, or, if you wish so to call them, &ldquo;guns&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am only relating it to the other Orders.  That is all I wish to say but, as the matter was referred to in the debate, I want to bring it back to the source, as it is because of that we have this Bill.  We have full powers to discuss Orders that are placed on the Table of the House and, if we have sufficient interest, we can see their implications.  If we hear of any subsequent Orders which would not be in the interests of the country we have power to raise the matter in either House.  I cannot anticipate in this emergency period a Bill such as this being at all essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate Senator Kingsmill Moore on introducing this Bill.  The issue seems to me to be a simple one, whether we do or do not believe in democratic government; whether we believe that democratic government consists of a Government elected by the people, or whether we, as part of the Legislature, should have power to criticise the acts of the Government.  As one who is opposed to the Emergency Powers Order, as introduced for one purpose and used for another by the Government, I am going to support the Second Reading of this Bill.  I think Senator Kingsmill Moore has made abundantly clear the reasonable purpose he had in mind in introducing this measure.  I have not heard any argument from any Senator opposite, or from any Senator on this side of the House, that has lessened my feeling that it is my duty to support a Bill which would limit the power of the Government to some slight extent, while not crippling them in any way from carrying on the essential work of government.  That is what I think this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, members of this House who are more interested in supporting the Government than they are in supporting <Col N="1019" /> democratic principles should vote against the Bill, but those who favour democratic principles rather than favour supporting the Government, should support this Bill, which does in some small degree meet the case which the Senator who has just spoken mentioned, but which I do not intend to follow, because I intend to support the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that this Bill has been discussed in a rather disappointing manner.  Senators in the Government Party really take the line that everything the Government does is all right, that nobody need worry about it, and that anybody who is worrying is a mischief maker.  Senator Kingsmill Moore put the matter very clearly and very calmly.  Senator O'Donovan a moment ago said something which, I think, was for the first time absolutely dealing with the Bill.  It is quite untrue to say that the Bill proposes to take power from the Government. It does not do any such thing.  It proposes to leave power with the Government. It is even open to argument that the Bill does not confer much extra powers on this House.  What is in the Bill is that if seven members of the Seanad ask for any particular Order to be tabled, it will be tabled, and if they move a motion of annulment and if the Seanad passes it, the Order will be annulled.</P>
      <P>That would be the new power of the Seanad.  Two Senators, as Senator O'Donovan indicated, have power at present to put down a motion asking that a particular Order made by a Minister&mdash;Senator Kingsmill Moore called it a calf Order&mdash;be revoked.  On February 25th, 1942, I find an entry of the proceedings of this House when we resumed a debate on a motion of mine:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, 1941 (Compensation) Scheme, 1941, dated 17th September, 1941, should be revoked.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was an Order made by the Minister for Finance to settle the compensation to be given for personal injuries <Col N="1020" /> sustained during the bombing.  We had a debate on that motion in this House. It only required two Senators to have the motion put down, and as a matter of fact when certain speeches were made in the House the Minister for Finance in an entirely proper manner intervened.  We adjourned the debate as he told us he was going to make certain changes in the Order. That power already exists, so that the power asked for here, that seven Senators should be able to deal with an Order, is not so very much extra.</P>
    <P>I do not understand Senator Campbell's view, that in some way the Bill contemplates destroying the necessary powers that this or any other Government should have during an emergency or that it would in some way imperil the security of the State.  That seems to me to be pure imagination on the part of Senators who put it into the Bill. If we are to discuss the Bill at all, we ought to discuss what is really in it. For my part I find the power we have already to be not insufficient.  I will vote for the Second Reading, but I remind Senators who think it an immense change that it is not an immense change.  It provides that the House can annul an Order, but in a House such as this, with limited powers, what you really need is power to discuss and not so much power to annul. If you cannot convince the majority or the Minister of the reasonableness of your case you will not be able to carry a motion.  The Bill does not imperil our neutrality.  We are getting into the position that one can hardly open one's mouth, but some one says &ldquo;Ssh, what about our neutrality?&rdquo; There is nothing in this Bill to justify any such statement.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Campbell&mdash; having disagreed with him so strongly &mdash;that I do not think civil servants are sitting in offices making dreadful plots for the ordering of our lives.  I think they would be glad to get rid of some of these powers.  On the other hand, civil servants and indeed Ministers, and all Governments have always the feeling that what they want to do is very urgent.  Nobody has had more experience of that than I have.  Every Ministerial <Col N="1021" /> Bill is always very urgent, and they do not particularly like having anybody saying anything about it.  We had other motions here.  We had a motion dealing with the importation of fabrics, for instance, and I think that it is entirely a wrong line for a member of this House to say that you could get seven mischief makers here who would put down a motion that would do harm to the State.  That kind of talk reflects no credit on anybody, least of all on the person who used it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the person who said that.  I said, not that I believed that seven Senators would do something in the belief that it would harm the State but that seven Senators could be got to put down a motion if, for no other reason, than that they believed it might embarrass a Minister. I repeat that you could get seven Senators to do that and there is the list.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach recently wanted to get rid of the English language. I always feel after listening to Senator Quirke that we should get rid of the English language and use only the Irish language in this House because I can never follow what the Senator means when he speaks in English.</P>

      <P>I know Tipperary English quite well and I know what they say in English in Tipperary about the Senator, but that is another day's work.  I will not tell the Senator because I know it would be quite out of order.  In any case, the Senator said that seven Senators could be found in this House willing to put down a motion which would embarrass a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What harm is there in that?  Are we to make the putting down of a motion which may embarrass a Minister as one of the seven deadly sins against Caitlín Ní Houlihán?  Did anyone ever hear such an absurd doctrine preached in a parliamentary <Col N="1022" /> assembly, that to embarrass a Minister is a sin against our national institutions? It is no such thing.  Senator Kingsmill Moore moving the Second Stage actually put into other words an idea which I suggested on the First Stage, namely, that if a Minister certified that it was in the public interest that a particular instrument should not be tabled, it need not be tabled.  That disposes, I think, of Senator Quirke's suggestion.  I, however, have a different view from Senator Quirke as to the facility with which one can get Senators to move in matters of this kind.  No matter to what part of the Seanad one turns, I think it would be very difficult to get seven Senators to do anything except they were seven carefully marshalled gentleman under a Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer is that the Bill takes away no power from the Government and that it does not give us any extra power to criticise the Government or to embarrass Ministers.  We already have every power in this respect that we desire as far as debate is concerned and as far as criticising Ministers is concerned but there is this to be said, and in a way it is an argument against the Bill: modern Parliaments have an immense number of functions, functions which have increased enormously in the last 40 years, particularly since about 1911 and since the Lloyd George Act of that year.  Every year since, Parliaments and Governments have been asked to increase the scope of their activities.  For that reason it is becoming increasingly difficult for any Parliament to follow in detail what is happening.  It is quite open to argument that a Parliamentary assembly which endeavours to follow all the details of government is missing the wood for the trees; in other words, that we should not be so interested in details as to miss general principles. For that reason, I think we should not be so terribly excited about following every detail of government.  I think Senator Sir John Keane was unduly alarmed about the way in which Parliamentary assemblies are having their functions usurped, as he said.  The simple truth is that Parliamentary <Col N="1023" /> assemblies cannot do all the work which they delegate to Governments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to encroach unduly on the time left to the Taoiseach to speak on this Bill.  In any event, the Bill makes a very modest proposal and the amendment that Senator Kingsmill Moore suggests would remove any suspicion or suggestion that we might discuss something which it would not be in the public interest to discuss. This question has been dealt with by members on the other side of the House, with one exception, simply on the basis that this is a grand Government, that it makes splendid Orders and that it is not right for us to interfere with them.  I do not take that view at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear.  I signed this Bill and I am very glad I did so because I have learned in this debate how little importance a number of people attach to Parliamentary government.  Many Senators here appear to be willing and anxious to throw away their powers and rights.  That is the only argument I have heard against the Bill. Because certain people put their names to the Bill they are called mischief-makers and trouble-makers, but these are the people who make any country, not the subservient nor the slavish followers of any Government.  They make nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for having put my name to this Bill.  I think that the Taoiseach himself made the best possible case for it on the First Reading when he told us that he himself was very much concerned about government by Order and had taken steps to repair the injury done to democratic control, but he found that he was not able to find an alternative.  He certainly made an excellent case for the Bill.  To argue that when we claim the right to question the actions of the Government, of Ministers or of people appointed to act on their behalf, we are willing or anxious to do harm to the country, is ridiculous and it is certainly an argument to which I am sure the Taoiseach himself would not subscribe. Senator Quirke has doomed this Bill, and it is a pity, because there <Col N="1024" /> is too little democratic control in the world to-day.  As I see it, by opposing this Bill we subscribe to a dictatorship. That is how it strikes me.  If we are to preserve the rights of Parliamentary control, we certainly should have the right to criticise these Orders in a democratic way and without doing any injury to the safety or the security of the State.  I know that the Taoiseach desires an opportunity to speak on this Bill to-night, so I shall give way to him, though I have a good deal more to say on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I can add very much to what I have already said on this subject on a few occasions.  Senator Kingsmill Moore asked us on the last occasion to give a chance to the members of the House to express their views on this matter, to point out how, without clogging the machine, so to speak, a method could be found which would give greater control over Executive actions than obtains at the moment.  My own attitude, as I pointed out to the Seanad on that occasion, was that we would not get any distance by doing so.  We would have very largely a repetition of the arguments which were adduced here on a previous occasion.  I had hoped, however, that the interval would have been availed of by those who sponsored this Bill to show what amendments they thought could be made in the Bill, so as to improve it. As it stood, and as it stands, it seems to me to be a useless Bill&mdash;really useless. If it is going to be operated in one way, it will be harmful; if it is not going to be operated in that way, it is practically unnecessary.  As Senator Hayes has pointed out, the House has already most of the powers of bringing matters before it for discussion. Senator Kingsmill-Moore is very naïve in his suggestion that we give the Bill a Third Stage&mdash;the Committee Stage. I have no doubt that, if he got to that stage, he would say: &ldquo;We should work the Bill for a little while and see how it operates, so let us pass it now.&rdquo;  There is no doubt whatever that that is the line.  I think it is time to act seriously and to make up our minds about it.  My own view is that it is a useless Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I have tried to get some sort of classification of all these instruments and I find it very difficult indeed to do so.  They run all the way from acts that are simple executive acts to wider administrative acts, using the word &ldquo;instruments&rdquo; in the sense in which it is defined legally.  Then you have those of a more legislative character.  If you take them all in the sense given in the Bill, you will have an impossible situation, unless you make all those exclusions which have been suggested already.  That is to say, you will have to exclude those matters which, in the public interest, ought not be discussed. It would be necessary to obtain the Minister's certificate that it is not in the public interest to discuss a certain Order, and there would be a dispute about that.  Then, if the Minister wants to satisfy those who dispute it, he will have to go into the merits of the case and will involve himself in difficulties, which may mean revealing the things which, in the public interest, ought not be revealed.  There are also those acts of a confidential character, where the private and confidential business of persons would be exposed.  There will be other classes, too, so you will have to exclude from the definition large classes of Orders.  I do not think that Senator Kingsmill Moore, if he were given a few years to try it, would get the definition to include the type you want and to exclude the others.  Up to the present, he has given no indication that would give a definition saying which were the ones which could be brought up and which could not be brought up.  I certainly have not been able to find any general definition here.</P>
    <P>With regard to remarks that the civil servants do not want to bridle themselves, my experience of the civil servants over some years now is that, if we ask them genuinely to try to do something, they set about doing it and certainly try to do it.  We must remember that their relations to Ministers are simply this.  The Minister is the one to give the orders.  They are executive officers and, if the Minister says he wants to get something done, it is <Col N="1026" /> their duty to do it.  They try honestly to do that.  If I ask civil servants to go into this and try to give me a report on it and to get reports from various Departments, to see if a satisfactory solution can be obtained, and if I examine their report and see in it that the arguments given one way or another do not support their own statement that a solution is not to be found, then I ask why would not such and such a solution do.  In other words if, given the facts, I think their conclusion is not in accordance with the facts, I can ask them to examine the question again.  Every Minister is in the same position.  The civil servants are there to give their views honestly to the Minister about certain things, but they are also there to undertake his instructions and orders and to obey him.  As far as my experience of the Civil Service is concerned in that respect, there is the fullest recognition of their duty.  A wise Minister will listen carefully to the advice his officers give him and will carefully examine the information which they put before him; but, if the Minister takes a line different from that of his advisers, he is entitled to do so and it is their duty to do what he says ought to be done.  It is a mistake, therefore, to say that the whole thing lies in the hands of the civil servants.</P>
    <P>If I may just digress slightly on this matter by talking about that, I might say that, no matter what system of government you may have, a man cannot simply undertake to deal with all details, so that there must be some agents all along the line to deal with certain things.  The best method of getting that done is to put a certain amount of responsibility on those people down along the line for their actions.  There is no other way but that of giving them duties and holding them responsible for what they do. That is, of course, within the machine; the Minister has to take public responsibility for everything that is done in that particular way.  He can deal with an officer inside, if the thing is wrong, and he has various disciplinary measures at his disposal.  If a Minister asks the Civil Service to produce something which might either limit their <Col N="1027" /> own powers or limit his power&mdash;and, ultimately, it is the Minister's power that would be limited in this measure &mdash;they will work honestly to produce it, if it can be done.</P>
    <P>I got this report and I was fully alive to the fact that people do not naturally curb any powers that they may feel necessary to solve their own problems, but it is not simply for love of power or lust for power that these things are done.  It is because they have got a practical job to carry out and they know that, if they are to do that effectively, the less shackles put upon them the better.</P>
    <P>Just as Senator Hayes was anticipated by another Senator, so did Senator Hayes anticipate some thoughts I had in this matter.  In this whole question of democracy, we have to be very careful to see that we safeguard the essentials and do not bring down democracy itself through inefficiency of one kind or another.  It does tend to make the working inefficient if you put on shackles which hinder the necessary action.  The whole purpose in giving these powers to the Executive in a time like this is to enable them to do the things that are necessary.  They are of course fallible: they can make mistakes; but there are the two Houses of the Oireachtas to watch them.  Particularly, there is the Dáil, which can watch them from day to day in their executive actions.  It can hold them to account and, if they do something which the majority of the directly elected representatives of the people believe is wrong, they can be dismissed. As time goes on, as the functions of government become more and more complex, and as the State touches the life of the individual at more points, we must be very careful to see that we give the Executive the necessary freedom to be effective, whilst at the same time maintaining the power of dismissing them.</P>
    <P>We can do that.  One of the values of our particular form of government is that the Executive can be dismissed by a majority of the representatives of the people for inefficiency at any particular <Col N="1028" /> time.  I am a realist and I know that that is not an easy thing to do; that Executives are generally supported by a Party and that a Party will be very loth to dismiss the Executive unless there is something very grievous indeed in their conduct. That is, of course, one of the difficulties that lie in the way of that power of immediate dismissal of an Executive which might otherwise be called for.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot see that there is any real value in this Bill.  There are a host of instruments that you will all agree should not be called for.  It is proposed to leave it to seven people to do that.  Very well.  If there is a necessity for dealing with any of these particular matters, that can be done at present by two Senators.  It is true you cannot annul directly by your vote, so to speak, a particular instrument. But you can, by your vote, indicate clearly that it is a matter upon which there is such strong public disagreement that any Minister or any Government would have to take very serious note of it.  I do not know of any case that has been brought forward.  There were a few Orders of that sort&mdash;I remember one, I think 187 was the number of it&mdash;on which there was a considerable amount of public discussion. These were all discussed just as fully as they would be under any measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>One of the results of my examination was to ease my own mind to a considerable extent, because I found that, where any particular instrument would have the effect of repealing or altering legislation, it invariably was in the class in regard to which the two Houses have power of annulment.  I tried to have that examined carefully, and so far we have been able to get no instance of a contrary nature.  In fact, I was informed by the draftsman that he would not dream of drafting an instrument which would have the effect of altering or repealing legislation without its being covered by a Government Order.  That is there.  The thing that affected me most was this power of, so to speak, repealing and altering existing legislation which had been passed with all <Col N="1029" /> the care that is exercised in the passing of legislation.</P>
    <P>That is a great safeguard.  You have that.  It is no use arguing, as Senator Kingsmill Moore argued, that you cannot anticipate; that when you see a Government Order giving power to a Minister to do so-and-so, you cannot anticipate what further instrument would come under that.  It seems to me you might as well say when legislation is passed that you cannot anticipate all the particular administrative or executive acts that will follow in consequence. You cannot legislate for particular things; you can only legislate for general things.  As to the case that was brought up, by some extraordinary accident that one was not presented.  Most of these Orders are presented to the two Houses as a matter of routine.  They are nearly all presented.  By some extraordinary happening I believe that one was not. I believe that one of the reasons was because it was covered very explicitly by a Government Order.  As it had been so explicitly covered, it was felt that it was not one of general application which would come under that procedure. I believe it was some consideration of that sort.  I do not know whether it was considered very fully.  I tried to find out how it was that that particular one slipped.  I believe it was not presented.</P>
    <P>I think that we cannot have it both ways at the present time; in other words, we cannot have the ordinary checks and lengthy debates that we would have under the ordinary barriers to executive action.  We cannot have that at present.  Otherwise the community would suffer.  You want to have the greatest amount of flexibility on the part of the Executive.  You will have, at least in the emergency, to say to them: &ldquo;All right, we will give you this power because there is a serious situation which has to be dealt with. You will have to act quickly on many occasions.  We will give you this power, but, if you do anything wrong, we will hold you responsible and kick you out, if we can.&rdquo;  There is no other way in which you can manage it.  You have that power at present, because two Senators can bring up these matters <Col N="1030" /> for discussion just as well as seven could.  I do not want to say that I think you could not have vexatious action by a group.  We all know such a thing is possible.  We all like to say as complimentary things as we can about ourselves and organisations and institutions.</P>
    <P>But we are all realists and we know that there can be organised opposition and organised obstruction for certain reasons under certain conditions.  I will admit that, in times of crisis such as this, as a Government we certainly cannot complain that we have not got from both Houses the utmost consideration in carrying out our work. We have.  I have to say that but, at the same time, what is the use of putting temptation unnecessarily in people's way?  If there is any particular matter that needs to be ventilated, there is a way for doing that.  My view generally about this is that I understand the frame of mind of those who brought forward the Bill and the attitude of those who support it, but, on the other hand, from the point of view of trying not to add a fifth wheel to the coach and not putting any unnecessary barriers in the way of executive action, I think that the Seanad would be well advised to drop the Bill at this stage.  I do not believe that, on the Committee Stage, you can do anything which would make it worth spending further time upon it.  Therefore I would ask the Seanad not to pass it.</P>
