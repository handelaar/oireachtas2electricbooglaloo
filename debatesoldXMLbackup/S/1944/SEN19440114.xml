    <Title>Children's Allowances Bill, 1943&mdash;Second stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Whatever may be said as to the introduction of the Children's Allowances Bill not being due to a popular demand or about the lack of enthusiasm that marked its introduction, I think that no argument will be advanced that the measure has not been accepted by all sections of the people as a very popular one.  That popularity may be gauged by the anxiety displayed by the leaders of several sections to claim responsibility for originating the idea.  However, the fact is that the children's allowances proposal has caught on both with those who hope to benefit substantially by it directly and with those who do not. I cannot understand how a demand for such a social service can be regarded as in conflict with Catholic or Christian principles.  If that were so, that very important social service that meant so much to the people of this country&mdash;old age pensions&mdash;would be in conflict with Catholic or Christian principles.  I recollect the day on which the first payment of old age pensions was made in the district from which I come, and I can yet vividly recollect the silent enthusiasm that marked its advent on the part of those who benefited by it&mdash;enthusiasm which was not quite so manifest when this country subsequently secured far greater reforms.  The peculiarity is the enthusiasm that marked the introduction of old age pensions has been carried on and is still evident on the part of those in receipt of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> I see nothing wrong in this country following any headline that may be set by Britain in so far as the improvement of social services is concerned. So long as economic conditions in this country make it necessary for thousands of our boys and girls annually to make the trek to England in search of employment which they cannot get at home, there is bound to be a repercussion in this country as a result of any social service introduced in Britain.  So long as this country is wrongfully partitioned, any benefits in the way of improved social services that obtain in Northern Ireland are bound to have a repercussion on Southern Ireland and no administration in Éire will neglect the needs of people in this part of the country similarly circumstanced to those in Northern Ireland.  It has been insinuated that this Bill to provide children's allowances may give a pauper-like complexion to <i>bona fide</i> applicants.  That, however, has been provided against by the abolition of the means test and by making it possible for members of all sections of the community who are qualified to avail of the benefits of the Bill.  At the same time, we had the statement by the Minister the day before yesterday that, while there was no means test and while members of every section could apply for the benefits of the Bill, that did not mean that the benefits would apply equally to all sections because&mdash;if I caught his words correctly&mdash;it was intended to modify the income-tax code so that those who are at present rather interested in that code would not reap the full benefit of children's allowances.  I am aware that several people, large income-tax payers, do not intend to apply for the benefits that they could legitimately secure for their families under this Bill. I consider that it would be most unfair if such people were deprived of the concessions given them in the income-tax code, in so far as members of the family up to a certain age are concerned, when making the annual assessment. By all means deduct from the allowances given under that code a sum equivalent to that which may be got by income-tax payers who avail of the benefits of children's allowances <Col N="499" /> But it would not be fair to make that apply to those who do not wish to avail of the benefits.</P>
    <P>When the idea of children's allowances gained prominence in the Press, it secured a great deal of support from people who will not come within the provisions of this Bill.  These people were, in the main, of opinion that the introduction of such a service would do much to provide a very necessary impetus to early marriage.  The meagre allowances outlined in this Bill will not, to my mind, provide any such incentive. I know no better means of making up for that than by incorporating in the Bill the very excellent suggestion made by Senator Mulcahy earlier in this debate&mdash;that provision be made for a marriage gratuity or bonus to be paid to such as would care to avail of it.  I believe that that would have very excellent effects.  The provision in the Bill that deprives children in rural Éire from benefit once they reach the age of 16 years is not quite fair because very few children in rural Éire obtain employment at that age.  Many of them secure employment only two or three years later&mdash;some in this country and some as migratory labourers in Great Britain.  I hold that small allowances such as these should be paid in respect of those young people until they secure remunerative employment.  Nobody will suggest that the amount of the allowance would be such as to promote demoralisation amongst those concerned or that they would endeavour to avoid work so as to continue in receipt of it.  As soon as employment is provided for such people, by all means let the allowance drop.  Various difficulties were referred to in the debate. I do not intend to take up the time of the House by referring to them.  In all efforts of this kind, difficulties are bound to arise and the most serious difficulties will only manifest themselves when the measure is being administered.  By the time these difficulties manifest themselves, there will be power to remedy them.  As matters are, I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly regret that I cannot give my blessing to this Bill. This is the first occasion on which I have spoken in this House on a controversial measure, so it may be as well to explain my own outlook on these matters.  It is that we, in this Second Chamber, ought to state the truth as we see it without regard to whether or not we gain thereby any access of popular favour.  I am very glad to know that there are many members in this House who have the same viewpoint as myself on that point.  The reason I cannot swell the chorus of praise is because of my concern for social reform and for the betterment of the poor.  In view of the enconiums tendered to the Minister during the past few days, this may seem somewhat of a paradox but I shall hope to resolve that paradox a little later.</P>
      <P>I am in very general agreement with Senator Tierney's point of view, though by no means on all points.  I, certainly, do not intend to express myself so trenchantly as he did.  I was wondering which I admired more, the Minister's introductory speech on the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil, because of its sheer ability, or the sphinx-like impassivity he was able to preserve during Senator Tierney's philippic&mdash;or perhaps I should say his poker face.  Possibly, he was secure in the knowledge that this Bill, without substantial change, is certain to take its place on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One further point before I come to my main objections.  I was reminded of it by one of the remarks made just now by Senator Ruane.  I think that any claim advanced here by a Senator that his point of view is in accordance with the teaching of Catholic sociologists is a mistake.  It merely leads to cross-disputes between people who take opposite points of view on a particular measure as to which of them is the true interpreter of the sociological standpoint of the Catholic Church. Senator Tierney commenced by correcting&mdash;if I understood him correctly&mdash; what he said had been alleged, the view that the provision of children's allowances was in accordance with Catholic teaching.  He had no particular <Col N="501" /> difficulty in showing that it was not, except as a palliative.  Senator O Buachalla takes the opposite point of view and Senator Foran&mdash;quite legitimately&mdash;also takes the opposite point of view.  Senator Ruane has reinforced what Senator Foran said.  They are all entitled to their opinions.  This whole business is likely to be somewhat disedifying and I think it is better dropped.  People like ourselves can study to the best of our ability, and do study, the Papal Encyclicals and articles by leading Catholic sociologists here and in Great Britain and America and we can make up our minds, as responsible Parliamentarians, what we think is really the truth on a particular issue before the House and state it.  The actual authority behind our opinion is, I think, best left alone.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the Bill.  We are living in very abnormal times and conditions will, certainly, not get better within the next few years.  I should think it must be admitted that there is no immediate necessity for the Bill.  In other words, if the Bill were not introduced, if this social reform, admittedly desirable in normal times, were left alone, we would get on as we are getting on at the moment.  I fail to see that there has been any substantial public demand for it in spite of what Senator Campbell said last night and what Senator Ruane said this afternoon. What I should like to know is: what are the future demands on our finances by means of post-war schemes for employment, and so forth, likely to be?  Senator O Buachalla told us that the State is not a bottomless well.  We shall have a great influx of migratory workers to this country after the war from Great Britain.  We shall have a considerable demobilisation of the Army.  We do not know what our position will be in regard to importing the raw materials for our essential industries. When I say that &ldquo;we do not know&rdquo;, I mean that nobody can tell at the moment how all these different factors will impinge on our financial economy.  It is quite certain that private finance will not be able to bridge the gap between abnormality and normality in this country.  The gap <Col N="502" /> will have to be bridged by schemes undertaken by the Government and financed out of taxation.  The extent of that financing nobody yet can tell. Therefore, I think it would be prudent to save up for the rainy day.  Even when we shall have done all we can do in the post-war epoch to provide for employment, there will still be a hard core of unemployment, a certain modicum of destitution, that will need an increase of our existing social services. Therefore, I should plead for caution in this matter of State expenditure which is not absolutely essential at the moment.</P>
    <P>My second point is that, owing to the war, it is not possible to make a proper statistical survey of other schemes.  As the Minister told the Dáil, provision for children's allowances is in force in several countries.  So far as I have gone into the matter, I do not think that there are more than a couple of countries where there is neither a means test nor a contribution from the worker.  At any rate, the Minister referred in a cursory manner&mdash;he could do no more&mdash;to the countries that had these schemes and he admitted his inability to give details because of the conditions prevailing.  One of the important details would be details of administration.  Senator Sweetman raised that question last night.  He asked what part of the £2,250,000 it was estimated would go in administration. We do not know, but it is certain that new hordes of officials will be created under this Bill.  I myself was an official once and I regard all officials as parasitical.  A figure of £2,250,000 was given us.  That is a respectable figure.  But the cost may be very much more.  Our existing social services cost £10,000,000.  At one swoop, on one social service alone, which is not necessary at the moment and may be of doubtful value, we are going to spend 25 per cent. more in these abnormal times.</P>
    <P>With complete candour and honesty, the Minister gave the Dáil specimens &mdash;only specimens&mdash;of the taxation that would be necessary&mdash;income-tax, 1/- in the £; tobacco, 1/- per lb.; tea, 2d. per lb.; sugar, ½d. per lb.; beer, 1d. per pint.  Taken together, these taxes <Col N="503" /> would produce £2,250,000.  Part of this would be direct taxation, but the greater part would, I think, be indirect. If you increase direct taxation beyond a certain point, you are going to constrict employment.  We have already had certain companies complaining of the corporation profits tax. The Minister for Finance, in his last Budget speech, said that to maintain the corporation profits tax at its existing level would have a hampering effect on the expansion of our native industries. Similarly, in regard to income-tax. I think that it is true to say that the more you increase direct taxation beyond a certain point, the less employment you are likely to give. Our salvation in the future will lie in our being able to give employment to as many of our people as we possibly can and in having as few of our people as we possibly can on these social services. Indirect taxation will, of course, bear more heavily on the poor than on anybody else because the poor cannot stand it as the middle-class can. We have comparatively no rich in this country.</P>
    <P>What is the object of the Bill?  Nobody has maintained that it is the encouragement of large families, as was the object of similar legislation in other countries.  The Minister himself &mdash;again with complete candour&mdash;told the Dáil that it would not, in his opinion, encourage large families.  It was assumed by the Minister, and universally assumed here, that it would alleviate poverty.  I am not so sure of that.  I, certainly, think that it is a matter for demonstration.  Take the case of a man with three children who is just above the poverty line.  He gets no benefit under the Bill, but, in view of the indirect taxation he will have to pay, he will be somewhat worse off and may be driven below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>A man with four children who is just short of the income-tax level will get a benefit.  I do not know how many such men there are in this country; it is a matter of statistics.  The man who is just above the income-tax paying level will get some benefit, but it will be inconsiderable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> The Minister referred to a number of countries where these schemes are in operation.  Some things of interest may be said about two of them, Italy and New Zealand, with which I happen to have some personal acquaintance. In Italy, the National Fund for Family Allowances, as it was called, was founded in December, 1934.  It was the direct result of the establishment in the same year of the 40-hour week. The 40-hour week would benefit the unemployed because it spread-over the available quantum of labour, but it was particularly injurious to heads of families with dependent children.  The family allowance, when established, was intended to supplement the wage of those working a 40-hour week. Benefits were confined to heads of families employed in industries working a regular time schedule of that number of hours&mdash;40 hours a week. The fund was established by a contribution from all workers equal to 1 per cent. of the gross wages paid and the contribution from all employers was equal to 1 per cent. of all wages paid.  It was restricted to industrial workers.</P>
    <P>A very striking point about all social reform is that you cannot stop once you start.  You must go on, and that applies just as much in a dictatorial country as Italy was before the fall of Fascism as it does in a democratic country.  As was said by Jefferson:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;human nature is much the same on both sides of the Atlantic and will be influenced by like causes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A very true saying.  Senator Tierney can put that alongside his quotation from Pindar.  We do not know very much about Pindar, or whether family allowances were paid in Thebes!</P>
    <P>To come to Italy: only 18 months after that law had been promulgated, that is to say in July, 1936, the scope was considerably extended.  It was made compulsory to include all industrial workers with children under 14 years of age, whatever the duration of the working week, whether 40 hours a week or greater, as in the motor factories in Milan and Turin.  The allowance <Col N="505" /> was fixed at 4 lire per week for each child under 14.  Additional funds were necessary and the employers' contribution was supplemented by a grant from the State but the employees contribution of 1 per cent. remained.  In the last year for which I can get figures, 1938, the total annual expenditure was 344,000,000 lire of which the employers' contribution was 215,000,000 lire, the workers contribution 86,000,000 lire and the State contribution 43,000,000 lire.  The astounding fact is that in the case of a Great Power such as Italy was before her downfall, the State was paying a family allowance of 43,000,000 lire which I suppose, at the rate of exchange, would be slightly under £2,000,000, whereas this small country with its not potentially rich population, is going to pay £2,250,000.</P>
    <P>I now pass to New Zealand.  I happened to be in New Zealand when the family allowance question was before the public there, a few months before the General Election of 1938.  It was first introduced in 1926 and was known as the Family Allowance Act of 1926. There was no popular demand for it. The Coates Government (Conservative) was then in power but was about to go to the country.  In competition with the Labour Party, as usual, certain promises were made, one being that the Family Allowances Bill would be introduced; so that this particular chicken came to roost when the Coates Government got in.  There was very little public discussion in the House of Representatives, but such as it was I read it.  It was mentioned that the object was to encourage large families. As Senators know New Zealand is a country five-sixths the size of Great Britain and yet has only the same population as this State.  The Act provided for an allowance of 2/- per week for children under 15 years of age in excess of two children where the total family income of husband, wife and children did not exceed £4 a week. During the debates Mr. Martin Savage, Leader of the Labour Party, and afterwards Prime Minister, a grand old Irishman, whom I knew personally, said that Mr. Coates and his friends had stolen the idea from the Labour Party.  That is rather like what we <Col N="506" /> have been hearing during the last few weeks when this Bill was before the Dáil.  Mr. Savage said that 2/- a week was not enough, and he was in favour of 10/- a week, not very unlike Senator Mulcahy's suggestion that there should be a marriage allowance.  All the Parties during the debate said that they had thought of it first.  &ldquo;Codlin was the friend, not Short.&rdquo;  In other words, they were putting the State up to auction, as happens in so many democratic countries.  One can find the counterparts in the New Zealand debates of Senators Mulcahy, Foran, Campbell and O Buachalla.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla&mdash;who, if I may say so, is a Senator with whom I am glad to know I have much in common&mdash;made a somewhat inconsistent speech.  He pleaded&mdash;and pleaded very movingly&mdash;for certain things to be done: capes on the L.D.F. model to be provided for children and shoes for the barefooted.  I think he hoped the time would come when the allowance might be made available for every child and not for every child exceeding two.  He also said that he hoped a contributory scheme might come later on, but he pointed out that the coffers of the State were not a bottomless well.  It is the universal experience in modern government that, when the State has provided some benefit, it cannot modify that benefit adversely, still less take it away. Every additional service given merely whets popular expectation and any attempt to cut it down is met with anger and dismay.  Let me make my point clear.  If the times were normal, if the war had not occurred or if we had sailed through the difficult post-war period and were in calm seas again, I would be in favour of a Bill of this kind, with certain modifications, a Bill that I would be sure would benefit the people I want to benefit, namely, the children of the poor.  For reasons I have given, I do not think I can support this one.  Senator Sweetman said the Minister must have statistics about other ways of spending the money.  I doubt very much if he has. This Bill is, to a large extent, a leap in the dark.</P>
    <P>Two things are of paramount importance <Col N="507" /> for this country.  One is the establishment of a Ministry of Reconstruction. I do not want to pay fulsome compliments, but I have no doubt in my mind that the proper man for the job is the Minister listening to me now.  So far as I can see, whatever thought is being given in Governmental and Civil Service circles to the very vexed problem of reconstructing this country from the bottom up when the war is over is being done in piecemeal and disparate fashion.  At any rate, so far as the public is aware, serious plans are not being prepared now.  If they are being prepared, this House and the Dáil should be made aware in outline of what is going on, so that responsible men here and outside can contribute their quota of knowledge and help.  In some countries, notably Canada&mdash;which is at war, and we are not&mdash;the Prime Minister, Mr. MacKenzie King, said that the times demanded something more than the Civil Service could give, and he made a public appeal.  He is getting men who were earning thousands of dollars a year and they are working for a mere pittance for him, for patriotic reasons. I feel that similar appeals from Mr. de Valera would assemble what was called a Brains Trust when President Roosevelt first came into power after the Wall Street slump, when everything was going west.  President Roosevelt gathered around him some of the best brains in business life.  What is needed in this country is more business in Government and less Government in business.</P>
    <P>The second thing I would like to see here is a commission on social welfare &mdash;not an inter-Departmental committee, but a commission.  It could be somewhat on the lines of the commission which has been sitting for some years on vocational organisation, except that this commission would be asked to do its work very much more expeditiously, because of the urgent necessity of the times.  Such a commission would include social workers, and persons of distinction in every field&mdash; in business, in the professions, in the Civil Service, and they would survey the whole field of social welfare and <Col N="508" /> social reconstruction and see what could be done and where and how best to do it.  The terms of reference might include this matter of allowances for children.  My point is that the Ministry of Reconstruction which I have envisaged would be able to plan more clearly&mdash;and more clearly still, as time went on&mdash;exactly what could be done in regard to people employed.  The other side, the commission on social welfare, could proceed <i>pari passu</i> with that in the exchange of information and see what employment the State could give, and stimulate industry to give, so that the poor should get no poorer but that poverty should be alleviated.</P>
    <P>I was struck by what Senator Campbell said last night&mdash;I am sorry he is not here now&mdash;that he and others preferred to see people fend for themselves without Government assistance. That is largely the sentiment which permeated Senator Tierney's more trenchant speech and, in that respect, I am in full agreement with them.</P>
    <P>I come now to some points of detail, in regard to this Bill, which will only take a moment or two.  I have read the Bill with extreme care and I think it is admirably drafted.  Once you grant the premises that there ought to be children's allowances on this basis, the Bill itself seems to have provided for most contingencies and loopholes. Section 3 is somewhat diffuse and, when the Bill is printed as an Act, will probably run to six or seven pages, which is rather long for one section; but I do not see how it could be broken up conveniently.  Section 11 (1) deals with the repayment of children's allowances overpaid and provides that, if allowances have been paid to which a person is not entitled, he is liable to repay them.  It goes on: &ldquo;or, in case such person is dead, the personal representative of such person&rdquo;.  I do not want to over-emphasise this point, but I feel that, when a man dies, his delicts should die with him.  The amount covered in one year by that particular phrase would be trifling and possibly the Minister might consider dropping it altogether.  Supposing a man dies and there has been fraud, <Col N="509" /> misrepresentation or honest mistake by him or by the Government, is it worth while pursuing it as against his personal representatives?  As I have said, I do not wish to make too much of that point.</P>
    <P>Section 19 has been briefly adverted to already by Senator Sweetman.  I had better quote the section in full:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing into operation this Act, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by Order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation, and any such Order may modify the provisions of this Act so far as may appear necessary or expedient for carrying the Order into effect.</P>
    <P>(2)  No Order may be made under this section after the expiration of one year from the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some such provision is undoubtedly necessary and exists in other Acts. Years ago&mdash;I think it was the first year the Minister was in office&mdash;I remember his defending a section of that sort from the chair where he is now, in connection, I think, with the Unemployment Insurance Bill.  It was necessary because you could not quite foresee all the snags or pitfalls that might arise. Senator Sweetman expressed the hope that nothing vital to the Bill would be altered in that way.  It is unreasonable, and certainly not in accordance with the best Parliamentary tradition, that an Act of the Oireachtas should give <i>carte blache</i> to the Government to make an alteration without reference back to Parliament in any form and without Parliament's formal knowledge. I know that this is only for 12 months, but an Order made within 12 months will not necessarily be brought before us and, at any rate, it will be a permanent alteration in the law.  That, I think, is not desirable and I propose to put down an amendment for the Committee Stage roughly on these lines, that any such Order should be laid on the Tables of both Houses and shall be subject to the annulment provision, and also that any such Order <Col N="510" /> shall have validity only for 12 months after the passing of the Act.  My object there is that, while I do not want to do anything to incommode the administration of the Act by the Minister and his staff, on the other hand it seems to me that my proposal will safeguard Parliamentary tradition.  What would happen if such an amendment were passed would be this: that some time, perhaps in nine months&mdash;at any rate some time before the end of the 12 months' period&mdash;a Children's Allowances (Amendment) Bill would be introduced and the whole matter would come before both Houses and, dealing as it would with mere matters of administration, it would not meet with any great opposition&mdash;certainly not from myself.  With regard to the Statutory Rules and Orders that will be made by the Executive, under Section 20, I have a strong feeling that there should be a provision to ensure that they will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, with the usual provision as to a possible motion for annulment within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that I have long looked for.  I think it was four years ago that Senator Quirke and I had a discussion with regard to agricultural matters and I remarked that there did not seem to be much done for the poorer types in agricultural life in Ireland since the inception of the Irish Free State.  I live in the midst of an agricultural community which contributes to every service in the State.  The agricultural labourers in that locality do not benefit through the Shannon scheme; they have no water supply scheme, and they have no transport facilities in the shape of buses or otherwise.  The labourers in that locality are living in such circumstances that they genuinely require assistance.  I do not want to be too definite, but I may state that there is a Catholic organisation in that area that has recommended to its members, where they can afford to do it, to pay family allowances to their employees. For the past five years there is a firm in my district that has been doing that. Of course, some people might consider that that system has its faults and defects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> I think it was in to-day's <i>Independent</i> I read that Senator Colgan stated that this is the best that can be done until such time as the State can create the position where a man will earn sufficient to support a family.  That is precisely at what we should aim.  I think the Minister has done the correct thing and if, in the near future, he will make provision for a marriage allowance, such as was suggested by Senator Mulcahy, he will do something which I will greatly appreciate.  Unless we give some definite encouragement to the farming community, there is little prospect of the boys or girls in the rural districts settling down to the most essential service in the State. I did expect, after all our years of fighting, that something of a reasonable nature would be done for those who are engaged in agriculture. Within the last 40 years the United Irish League and many other organisations endeavoured to carry out ambitious programmes and they had elaborate schemes in mind for the development of agriculture.  I and others expected when Dáil Eireann was established that much would be accomplished in order to help the farmers.</P>
    <P>I did not expect that the highly-paid services running through the State and running through this House would be one of the first things to engage the attention of the native Parliament.  I had hopes that much would be done for the people who were foremost in the fight and who did so much for the country in its darkest days.  I thought they would be the first people to be attended to.  I did not expect to find the people of Ireland saluting every T.D. and Senator when they wanted a job, nor did I expect to find people prepared to support Bills here provided they got a contract or something else. These family allowances are overdue. If they are operated in the same cheap and economic fashion as old age pensions, much satisfaction will ensue.  I speak for large numbers of agriculturists and agricultural labourers. Among the agricultural labourers the position is really difficult.  I know of one family of eight where the total income is £2 a week&mdash;of course, they may <Col N="512" /> have some perquisites.  Two of them are married, one having four in family and the other three.  You cannot expect loyal and devoted service if the State does not give some encouragement and assistance.  We rely on the farmers to produce bacon, butter, milk and other essential commodities.  The scarcity of butter and milk is unnatural. According to the published statistics, there are as many cows in this country as ever there were.  The reason we have not sufficient agricultural produce is that we cannot get the workers to accept the terms they are offered.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill because I believe it will be of assistance to many people living in the rural districts as well as in our towns and cities.  So far as popular demand is concerned, I have never pandered too much to it; I am nearly always in a minority.  It so happens, however, that I nearly always get there.  If they did not put me there, I would be a hang sight richer man by looking after my own affairs at home.  The fact, however, that the Bill is popular is no reason why we should decry it.  It is looked upon by most people as a social necessity and it is time that it was introduced.  It is true we have a number of other social services but we are not too badly provided for ourselves.  We do not, however, lose our independence by reason of the fact that we receive allowances for our services.  It is all very well talking about independence, but we all remember the time when there were no old age pensions.  I remember standing at a chapel door for hours collecting subscriptions for our M.Ps.&mdash;Tim Healy, Joe Dolan and others.  The fact that we had to do that did not sap our independence, but there is no necessity to do it now.  We saw to that and we must think of the underdog sometimes because those at the top of the ladder will have to admit that it is kept up by those at the bottom.  For that reason I do not pay too much attention to the various difficulties envisaged by those who spoke in opposition to the measure.</P>
    <P>These difficulties have been pointed <Col N="513" /> out by reasonable men whose motives I admire but if they had to live in an area where there is a vast amount of bogland, or if they had experience of how difficult it is for parents who are reared in these surroundings and who love their children as much as any of us, to bring up these children, they would probably look upon this Bill with more favour.  For that reason I support it.  I think that the advocacy of Senator Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon and the Minister has secured its practical acceptance.  I hope that it will be administered cheaply and economically. As Senator Colgan has stated, it is the best that can be produced in a time of very great necessity and for that reason I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill more from the fact that I regard it as evidence of the good intentions of the Government than that I am impressed either by the adequacy of the relief provided or the method of its distribution. I regret that the Bill does not contain provisions to make this a contributory scheme because, like Senator Tierney, I agree that the giving by the State of moneys to any class of the community for nothing, and in return for no service, is one of the most damnable parts of our social system as it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite convinced that one of the greatest evils we inherited in this country from our neighbours in Great Britain was this system of doles in return for no service.  I cannot, however, agree with Senator Tierney that there was no demand or no necessity for this Bill.  While I have these objections to the Bill, I must say that, in the absence of that statistical information to which Senator Mulcahy referred, I consider that the Minister has done the best job he could in the circumstances.  It is my opinion&mdash;I speak, of course, subject to the correction of the Minister&mdash;that that statistical information is probably available in some quarters.  In the absence of that information, I do not see how the Minister could have adopted any attitude other than to make the Bill of universal application and non-contributory.  For these <Col N="514" /> reasons I hope that the Bill will not be long in operation before we shall see some day introduced a Bill to carry this scheme further.  Before such legislation is introduced, I hope that the Minister will make available to the House and to the public the necessary statistical information by which we can then judge whether his further suggestions for social services of this nature are adequate or not.  I would also suggest to the Minister that if he desires to bring about a saving in administration, at some future date he should bring in a Bill to co-ordinate all these various social services.  In that way he would ultimately effect a saving for the National Exchequer, a saving in administration costs, and prevent the army of officials from growing out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I should like to advert.  I was surprised, not to say pained, to hear Senator O'Donnell threaten that legislation of this kind, which will of necessity involve extra taxation, both direct and indirect, might be used by Irish manufacturers as a lever to increase the cost of goods to consumers.  I trust that the Senator in making that statement was not speaking officially for the Federation of Irish Manufacturers or industrialists.  If he was, I can only hope that the Minister, in his capacity both as Minister for Industry and Commerce and as Minister for Supplies, will take the necessary steps to see that no attempt is made to start a vicious spiral of increasing prices as a result of social legislation of this nature.</P>
    <P>I should also like to get from the Minister, in conclusion, some information regarding certain aspects of this Bill in relation to the income-tax law. I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to answer or whether he is willing to do so.  If he is willing and able to do so, the information would be of great interest to many members of the income-tax paying community.  Is it the intention of the Government, where this allowance is not claimed by the head of a family who pays income-tax, to reduce that person's allowance for his children?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> In a family where there are only two children, they are not eligible for the family allowance, but will the income-tax allowance for the children in that case be interfered with in any way? Alternatively where there are three or more children in a family and the family allowance is not claimed, will the income-tax allowance be interfered with?  It would certainly be of great interest to a number of people if the Minister were in a position to answer that question.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that everybody seems to be in thorough agreement on the Bill, it would only be pushing an open door if I were to add anything to the speeches made welcoming it.  I simply desire to say that I agree wholeheartedly with the Bill as introduced by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was obviously a reasonable request, which was put forward by many Senators, that on the introduction of a proposal involving a substantial increase in expenditure upon a service designed to alleviate social hardship, an attempt should be made to show that such hardship existed to the extent required to justify that expenditure, and that we should have, if possible, a review of social conditions which would enable the members of the Seanad to understand precisely why a measure of this kind is considered necessary now.  That request, while reasonable, is not easy to meet.  We have never carried out in this country a survey of social conditions. Such surveys have been carried out in other countries by voluntary organisations.  But I have always been somewhat suspicious of the published results of these surveys because the organisations usually undertook them for the purpose of supporting a particular point of view or a particular set of proposals with which they were associated.  It might be desirable, and possibly would be useful, to have such a survey undertaken.  I have frequently thought of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, since this Government came into office we have <Col N="516" /> never had a reasonably long period of time in which it could be said that conditions were normal.  We either had economic or physical wars, and the temptation was to postpone the undertaking of such a survey until something approaching normal conditions existed, so that the findings resulting from it could be regarded as reasonably valid even some years after it had been completed. There was, however, a suggestion in the speech of Senator Mulcahy, and I think it was positively asserted by Senator Sweetman, that there is available to the Government some body of statistics which is being withheld from Senators&mdash;some information concerning social conditions or unemployment which is not available to them. That is not correct.  The Government has no information concerning probable social conditions prevailing&mdash;the gravity of the unemployment problem or any other social evil&mdash;which is not also available to the members of the public in the various published documents following upon the census or other special survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  I am dealing now with statistics or information relating to our special social conditions.  It is true that the Government has facilities for interpreting the information better than those available to Deputies.  I do not mean that in an offensive sense&mdash;I mean that we have in our service skilled statisticians&mdash;people whose business it is to draw correct conclusions from these statistics&mdash;and that we can refer to these officers at any time that the obvious conclusions arrived at from such statistics appear to be in conflict with common knowledge or commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation of this kind must naturally be based upon knowledge, and while I cannot give you a statistical report which would show that the operation of a scheme of children's allowances will alleviate hardship in a specific number of families, nevertheless there is available sufficient information to show that it is necessary. <Col N="517" /> We all know that poverty exists.  We all know, however, that the causes of poverty are many.  It is necessary to state that, because some Senators have spoken in a contrary sense.  A remark of Senator Foran's appeared to convey the view that all poverty is due to unemployment, and Senator Mulcahy gave us the result of a social survey carried out on a very limited scale, and in his remarks relating thereto he suggested that the poverty revealed by it was all beyond the control of the individuals concerned, and imposed upon the State an obligation to provide for these families a certain minimum income.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that people become poor, and very frequently remain poor, through causes within their own control&mdash;improvidence, bad management, intemperance, or even an inability to pick winners.  I do not say that the State has no obligation whatever to these people.  We have imposed upon the local authorities the obligation of relieving destitution arising from any cause, and in so far as improvidence, bad management, or intemperance has had an adverse effect on the dependents of these people, we do recognise a responsibility to relieve hardship upon their dependents.  In the provision of many social services we do not ask if the individual could have avoided reaching the situation in which he finds himself, but merely ask as to his circumstances.  There is not upon the Government an obligation to provide a minimum income for people who could quite well provide that income through their own efforts.  On the other hand there is a great deal of poverty not due in any sense to the fault of the individual concerned. Senator Tierney painted a picture of the ideal citizen, poor but proud, unwilling to take any money that he did not earn, prepared to endure all the hardships of poverty rather than appeal to public assistance.  It was a pleasant picture, but it was as false as any other picture painted here.  It was the picture of a sentimentalist, in so far as a sentimentalist is a person who allows his views to be determined by his emotions instead of by his judgment. He was allowing his emotion <Col N="518" /> and not his judgment to operate. People become poor and require assistance, not because of their disinclination to work, but because they are in ill-health, or because they have passed the age at which it was possible to obtain employment, because of accidents, or because the breadwinner of the family dies&mdash; there is a multitude of causes, and even in the case of able-bodied men, there are thousands of them who tramp the streets morning and night wearing out shoe leather looking for work, and who go home in the evening with the same tale of despair and defeat.  Does it do any harm to such person when it is not possible to find work for himself, to prevent hardship developing unduly by providing public assistance.  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Let me say, however, that the service we are now proposing to-establish has to be distinguished from all other social services by one outstanding characteristic.  It is quite true that we should provide for the alleviation of bad conditions by increasing national productivity and by putting people to work if we can.  That is the real solution of most of our social problems, and if we succeed&mdash;and to the extent that we succeed in doing that&mdash;the payments we are now making in unemployment assistance, national health insurance and other social benefits will diminish.  If we could put everybody at work we would have to pay nobody unemployment assistance.  If we provided good houses, food and hospital accommodation, we would reduce the incidence of sickness, and consequently diminish the demand on national health insurance funds.  Increase the general level of prosperity, and the number of people who qualify for old age pensions and other social security payments will diminish.</P>
    <P>But while a diminution of expenditure might be looked for in every other social service, the expenditure here will continue to go up, because this is not associated necessarily with unemployment, ill-health, or any other of what I hope we can call temporary social evils.  It is much more true to say that the necessity for children's allowances arises from <Col N="519" /> the standard wage&mdash;the policy which the trade unions of this country feel it is essential to establish to protect the interests of their members.</P>
    <P>Probably many years ago it was a standard practice with employers in a less competitive age to adjust the wages which they paid to individuals according to the needs of those individuals, and we could possibly conceive a system in which wages would be related to individual needs.  In what likes to regard itself as the most modern state&mdash;Soviet Russia&mdash;they related wages to individual capacity and merit, and regarded the standard wage as a product of the bourgeois system. But in our community the standard wage is here, a wage which is paid irrespective of individual needs or merit, to a single man as well as to a man with ten children.  It may be more than sufficient to give a reasonable livelihood to the single man; it may be adequate to the man with a small family, but quite inadequate for the man with the large family.  It is to meet that problem&mdash;and it arises in every class in the community&mdash;that a system of children's allowances is deemed to be desirable.</P>
    <P>The productivity of the farm, a fishing boat, or a small shop is not determined by the needs of the owner; it is determined by purely economic circumstances. The needs of the owner will vary, according to the size of the family or other conditions.  I do not think that it can be contended that the institution of a system of children's allowances is contrary to Catholic teaching.  It may be that Catholic teaching does not require Governments to enact legislation of this kind, but I am quite certain there is nothing in Catholic teaching which declares it undesirable to do so.  On the contrary, various publications that I have seen on the matter have all commended the idea of the establishment of a system of children's allowances.  Members of the Hierarchy in Great Britain have supported the idea of a family allowance as a means of easing the difficulties of life for the family.  The Encyclicals, <i>Casti Connubii</i> and <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> make reference to it. The latter says that if in the present <Col N="520" /> state of society this is not always feasible&mdash;that is to say, what we would all regard as a desirable situation, that fathers of families should receive a wage sufficient to meet ordinary domestic needs&mdash;, then</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Social justice demands that reforms be introduced without delay, which will guarantee such a wage to every adult working-man.  In this connection We praise those who have most prudently and usefully attempted various methods by which an increased wage is paid in view of increased family burdens, and special provision made for special needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The history of children's allowances begins with the history of the establishment of equalisation funds in continental countries.  The employers in various industries came together and established funds to which they all contributed in proportion to their wage bills, and out of which special payments were made to workers with large families.  That system is practicable; it is actually at work now, and has been for some years, in a number of countries, but it is clearly confined to industries of a certain type.  Some Senators have spoken of a contributory system, and there is a great deal to be said for it.  But clearly it must be confined in its operation to those who receive regular wages, and from whom a regular contribution can be secured. If the principle of an increased income for families in proportion to the size of the families is approved, then it applies to all and not merely to those who work for wages.  It applies to all who work for their livelihood, whether it is in the form of a weekly wage or any other form.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have found it possible to have adopted in some form the contributory principle in relation to this scheme.  I believe that the development of social security services will be facilitated if we can get the contributory principle accepted.  The only limit to our programme on the basis of contributions is the willingness of the people to contribute, whereas a number of other factors must obviously be taken into account when the entire cost of our programme must be met <Col N="521" /> out of general taxation.  That is a matter we can discuss on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the economic programme of the First Dáil and to President Roosevelt's Second Bill of Rights and to the Beveridge Report. I always feel a certain amount of resentment when general statements are related to the provisions of a particular measure.  The democratic programme of the First Dáil was intended to contain certain directive principles for the new State then to be established. They are set out more fully in the Constitution.  We have been pursuing legislation in accordance with these principles.  We have not completed the job, and if in 20 years' time, Fianna Fáil ceases to be the Government, there still will be work to be done by our successors in full implementation of these principles.  President Roosevelt's Second Bill of Rights was nothing more than an intention to introduce a number of Acts of Parliament in the United States which already are in operation here.</P>
    <P>The Beveridge Report was one man's plan, and I object strongly to a comparison of the provisions of this Bill with that report.  Because this is a Bill introduced by the Government.  It is a Bill that has been planned out in detail.  The Government has planned what it is going to do, and is prepared to do it.  The Beveridge plan has been submitted to the British Government. What that Government is going to do we do not know.  The only declaration made on its behalf was a statement by one Minister to the effect that many parts of the plan had, on examination, been found impracticable.  Furthermore, those who refer to the Beveridge plan refer only to the benefits which it is contemplated the plan will confer. They leave out of account certain conditions which Sir William Beveridge said were an essential preliminary to the operation of his plan.  One of them was that by economic measures a condition of full employment should be established in Great Britain.  How many people who refer to the benefits set out in detail in the Beveridge plan have adverted to the fact that Sir William Beveridge said that this plan <Col N="522" /> will not work unless and until they can have full employment in Great Britain? If we had full employment here would it not be possible for us to embark upon far more elaborate schemes of social protection than we now find possible?</P>
    <P>Our ability to provide social security services depends on our productivity. Our only source of wealth is what we produce by the application of human effort to national resources.  There is no other source of wealth.  The development of social services must, therefore, proceed side by side with the development of plans for economic development.  We are, by setting up this service, proposing to divert purchasing power from one section of the community to another, and we think we are justified in doing it because of the need of the section which will benefit.  That is all we are doing.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell said something which was intended to try to link up this proposal with the plans of a group of individuals for financing consumption. We are not financing consumption here.  We are financing increased consumption by certain families, but at the expense of other families and I should like that fact to be clearly understood.  What is involved here is a transfer of purchasing power&mdash;not an extension of purchasing power.  An extension of purchasing power can only come through the economic measures which we hope to adopt when conditions make them possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie found fault with a remark of Senator O'Donnell's as to the effect upon prices of the taxation necessitated by this measure.  All taxes affect prices and I think that is what Senator O'Donnell meant.  He was not threatening that Irish industrialists would offset increased taxation by raising their prices.  He was stating what is in fact an economic law, that any increase in the burden of taxation will have its effect upon prices eventually, and there is no avoiding that.  I know that some people believe that that does not necessarily apply to increases in income-tax, but that also is a fallacy. Every tax is a charge upon production and will eventually have its reaction upon prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> It has been said that I have not shown any enthusiasm for this Bill. That was stated by Senator Tierney, but it is not quite accurate.  Everybody here knows the political set-up in the Dáil.  There is no conservative Party, nobody who is willing to express the conservative viewpoint of the individual who dislikes change and is prepared to agree to change only on the basis of a full review of all the possible consequences and a clear demonstration of need.  The position in the Dáil is such that each Party is in fact prepared always to outbid the other in proposing innovations.  I felt, therefore, in introducing the Bill into the Dáil it was desirable that, even though I was appearing as an advocate of the Bill, the other point of view should be indicated.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that Senator Tierney and Senator O'Sullivan spoke as they did, because, even though one may not agree with their point of view, it is a point of view that must be taken into account, and I am sure it represents the viewpoint of a much larger number of people in the country than has been suggested.</P>
    <P>There are reactions from the introduction of a scheme of this kind other than the benefits which certain people will enjoy, and these reactions must not be left out of account.  I think we are justified in proceeding with this measure, but not merely did I put the case for it with these qualifications and feel it was necessary to do so because it was unlikely that the conservative viewpoint would be put forward in the Dáil, but I also had another reason, which, I think, is pertinent.  Even if we set up a committee of all the most enthusiastic advocates of this measure and said to that committee: &ldquo;The utmost which the Government can afford to provide for new social services is £2,250,000, and the utmost which, in present circumstances, we can provide for all social services is £10,000,000 or £12,000,000.  How best can that money be expended so as to secure the maximum results in the alleviation of want?&rdquo;  I doubt very much if that committee of enthusiastic supporters of the Bill would be unanimous <Col N="524" /> in the view that the best possible way of spending it in our circumstances would be to devote it all to this one purpose.</P>
    <P>There was a time last year in the Dáil when there was on the Order Paper a number of Private Members' motions advocating the adoption of schemes, the total cost of all of which would be about £50,000,000 per year. Everybody in the Dáil and a very large number of Senators said: &ldquo;Yes, we are in favour of this scheme&rdquo;, but not one of them dropped any other scheme because of this.  That is the danger I see as a very real danger.  It is not merely that we are considering the desirable things we want to have, but we are not relating these things to our resources, and our resources are limited.  We are not a great, wealthy country.  Our wealth is conditioned by a number of limiting factors, and, until we have dealt with these factors, we cannot contemplate many socially desirable services which other people may be able to afford and which are theoretically necessary.  The view which I asked the Dáil to accept in putting the Bill to them, and the view which I ask the Seanad to accept is that, in present circumstances, we should devote the whole of the additional sum which we can make available for social services to the provision of children's allowances, and to accept that the provision of that sum for children's allowances means necessarily the postponement of increased expenditure in other directions.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy suggested marriage gratuities.  Whether there is a case to be made for marriage gratuities or not, I do not think it arises on this Bill.  I said in the Dáil, and I repeat, that I do not think the enactment of this Bill will influence either the marriage rate or the birth rate in this country.  There are a number of factors operating to create the present position in which we have one of the lowest, if not the lowest, marriage rates in Europe and the highest birth rate, but Senators will note that the association of these two facts leads to a third conclusion, that is, that the cost of children's allowances in this country per head of population is likely to be greater than it would be in other countries, because <Col N="525" /> although we have a smaller number of married people in relation to total population, we have a larger number of children, the conclusion being that the number of large families is proportionately higher than elsewhere and consequently the provision of children's allowances to aid large families will cost more per head than it would cost elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the provisions of the Bill.  Senator Mulcahy proposed that certain alterations should be made in the system of payments in order to ensure that the payments would become proportionately greater in respect of families of largest size.  Consideration was given to the desirability of sliding the scale of payments up or down with the size of the family.  Personally, I think there would be a much stronger case to be made in favour of giving a higher payment in respect of the first qualified child and a lower payment in respect of subsequent children, on the general theory that the maintenance of two children is not precisely double the cost of maintaining one, and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy says that we should go the other way and give a standard payment in respect of the first, second and third child and a higher payment in respect of the fourth and fifth.  That was the sense of his proposal.  His particular proposal would cost something slightly less than £400,000 per year.  I think an examination of all the factors will justify the Government's conclusion that the best method was to have a flat-rate payment continued, irrespective of the size of the family.  That is the course I would urge on the Seanad, and, if the matter is raised in Committee, I shall urge the retention of the provisions in the Bill as they stand in that respect.</P>
    <P>Most of the matters I now propose to refer to are matters that might be discussed in Committee, but perhaps by giving a general indication of my view concerning them now, I may prevent the unnecessary tabling of amendments on Committee Stage.  One of these matters does not affect the Bill, that is, the question of income-tax. The suggestion was made that income-tax <Col N="526" /> payers who certify that they will not draw the children's allowance should not be subjected to a reduction in the allowance under the income-tax code.  That, I think, is not practicable, even if it were desirable.  I should say that the administrative problem involved in that suggestion is quite considerable, apart from the fact that the Revenue Commissioners would be strongly opposed to it.  The Revenue Commissioners regard all information which comes to them as strictly confidential. It is not available even to another branch of the Government service. You cannot even get from the Revenue Commissioners the names of those who pay income-tax.  They regard all the information concerning the private business of individuals as their concern only, and in so far as that scheme would involve a disclosure by the Revenue Commissioners of certain information concerning the economic status of individuals they would, I think, be strongly opposed to it.</P>
    <P>In any event, I think it is undesirable. It would involve a comparison between the lists of those claiming children's allowances and those paying income-tax to make sure that there was no duplication.  Only one person in 1,000 may, in fact, try to get it both ways, but in order to prevent that one person in 1,000 getting it both ways you would have to set up machinery which would supervise everybody.  That is one of the difficulties in the administration of legislation.  I think, however, we can devise a system under which persons who so desire it can arrange to have the children's allowances paid into a bank account or paid in some form which will convenience them to a greater extent than would appear to be possible under the general scheme of administration to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I have no information on that.  In fact, as the Senator himself knows&mdash;he was a member of Government himself&mdash;a member of the Government has no information concerning the payment of income-tax or of the statistics relating thereto other than those appearing in the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners. The suggestion was made by Senator. O'Buachalla that we should provide for assistance in kind.  I would not agree with him, any more than I would agree with the suggestion of Senator Mrs. Concannon that we should take positive measures to ensure that these allowances will be used for the benefit of the children.  We are proposing to increase the income of the family. What happens that income is the concern of the family.  I do not think that we should interfere so as to ensure that this particular proportion of the family income should be used for the benefit of the children any more than we should interfere with any other portion of the family income.  If there is a defect in the law relating to the obligation of parents to maintain their children, then amend the law or, if there is a need for new provisions in that respect, make them, but do not tie them up with this scheme.  This is a scheme to inflate the income of large families.  Any further interference by the State with the expenditure of the family income should be carried out separately, and only after a very careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ruane objected to the maximum maintenance age being fixed at 16 and wanted an extension beyond that age.  Any extension of the age beyond 16 would involve a substantial increase in the cost of the Bill.  There is no country in which children's allowances are paid beyond the age of 16, except in certain cases of children who are mentally deficient or incapable, in any circumstances, of earning their livelihood. But, if there was to be any extension beyond the age of 16, there <Col N="528" /> is a less case for it in the County Mayo than in any other part of Ireland, and a less case for it in the rural areas than in the cities.  Senator Ruane spoke as if the reverse were the fact. The available statistics will show that a far higher proportion of young people over 16 are returned from the rural areas as being occupied than from the cities, and a far higher proportion from the western counties, and particularly the County Mayo, than from other rural areas.  I think that in the County Mayo the percentage is well over 80, as shown in the census returns, as being occupied at that age.  If there was any case for discrimination as between one part of the country and another or between one section of the people and another in the matter of extending the payment beyond the age of 16, it applies more particularly in the cities than it does in the rural areas.  As all the members of the House are aware, we have, in fact, a very special problem in regard to juvenile unemployment in the cities in connection with which a commission is now sitting.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruane also suggested that we should bring the district justices into the administration of the Bill.  I would oppose that strongly.  I think that in a national scheme of this kind you must ensure uniformity of practice. If you bring the district justices in you eliminate the possibility of uniformity of practice.  Everybody knows that one district justice, for some particular class of offence, will impose a fine of 2/6, while another district justice will impose a fine of £10 for the same offence.  You have very frequently differences of opinion between district justices as to the gravity of particular offences.  I am certain that if the district justices were brought into the administration of this Bill each of them would act on different principles so that eventually you would have a different system of children's allowances operating in each district justice's area.  I think that we should maintain, in connection with this scheme, the practice that has been followed in all other schemes and have central administration so as to guarantee uniformity of practice and <Col N="529" /> uniformity of interpretation in all parts of the country.</P>

      <P>No, it is an administrative matter.  Senator O'Sullivan referred to Section 19.  On the face of it, it looks a big power to give to a Minister.  This is the section which gives the Minister power to amend the Act itself by regulation during the period of 12 months for the purpose of bringing it into operation.  The best defence I can offer of that section is that every similar Act passed in this Parliament and the British Parliament during the past 21 years has a similar section in it.  It is not a legal innovation as some people seem to think.  It is contained in the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, in the Local Government Act of 1925, in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and other similar Acts, where it was anticipated that considerable difficulty would be experienced in getting the Act to work during the period of transition and experimentation in connection with which freedom of action is necessary.</P>

      <P>It is for the purpose of bringing the Act into operation.  We can discuss this and other points that were raised on the Committee Stage. I have thought it desirable to refer <Col N="530" /> to some of those matters so that my views on them may be known.  There is just one other matter.  Reference was made to the possible effect of all this expenditure on the financing of post-war reconstruction plans.  It is quite clear that every charge on the revenue limits the power of the Government to expend revenue on other services.  The transition period in connection with which reconstruction plans are being prepared will be one, however, in which we cannot hope to finance all the activities required from revenue.  We are not balancing our Budget at present.  I know that the threat of increased taxation under this Bill had little effect on the Dáil because the Budgets are unbalanced and we are carrying a deficit from year to year.  I think we cannot hope to bring that deficit to an end in the first or second year after the war, at which time the reconstruction schemes will be brought into operation.</P>
      <P>Apart, however, from that consideration, many of the reconstruction schemes which we contemplate will not be unremunerative.  They will be self-financing. Let me take, for example, the question of rural electrification. The intention is that the consumers of electricity will pay the whole or, at any rate, a large part of the capital cost of the extension of electricity to them.  As regards housing schemes and public utility works of one kind or another, all of these have been subsidised to some extent, but only to some extent.  A large part of the total cost will have to be recovered from the users of the amenities or the schemes in one way or another.  Many of our plans for the post-war period will, of course, relate to purely productive activities which we hope will be not merely self-supporting in the matter of revenue but, eventually, will yield a profit to the community.  I do not think, therefore, that it can be said that the introduction of this service need necessarily limit in any way our power to finance adequate reconstruction plans for the transition period after the war.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that the Government should take steps immediately to amend with retrospective effect Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act, 1943 (No.14 of 1943) so that sums payable in accordance with the terms of Section 7 by way of Special Allowance in respect of a wife or children and because of the needy circumstances of the family while the husband pensioner is living, shall not be discontinued on the death of the husband when inevitably the general family needs and financial difficulties have become greater.</P>
      <P>The case I have to put before the Seanad is a very brief and a very simple one.</P>
      <P>The section of the Act of 1943 was spoken of by the Minister when introducing the Bill on the 4th March, 1943, in the following terms (column 959):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" />&ldquo;...the fifth purpose of the Bill is to deal with the very special problem created by the passage of time and by economic circumstances of men and women who fought during Easter Week, 1916, and who are now incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity. Section 7 applies to every person who is in possession of a military service certificate in respect of service during Easter Week, 1916, or who is in receipt of a disability pension in respect of a wound or injury received or a disability contracted during that week, provided that the person is incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of mind or body and that his or her yearly means from all sources do not exceed a certain sum.  For a single man or woman that sum will be £78 a year; if married, £97 10/- a year, and for each child the sum is raised by £10 8/- a year.  In other words, if a single person be totally destitute he or she will be entitled to £78 a year, or if married of £97 10/- a year and £10 8/- a year will be added in respect of each child.  On the other hand, if the person be not totally destitute, but be in receipt of a service or disability pension, his means will be brought up to the scales of allowances mentioned.  It will thus be seen that every person qualifying under this section will be entitled from all sources, if single, to 30/- a week, if married, 37/6 a week, and to an additional sum of 4/- a week in respect of each child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister took this action because, as he indicated, a very special problem arose with regard to a limited number of people who are entitled to recognition for service during 1916 and whose means were inadequate.  Now, the Bill was introduced on the 3rd March, 1943, and it became law on the 27th April, 1943.  Normally, it might be thought that no very special difficulty would arise under it but, in actual practice, a very serious defect has been shown up.  I submitted an amending Bill to deal with the matter in a systematic and clear way, but the decision was given the other day that that Bill could not be introduced <Col N="533" /> because it was a Money Bill.  I am now asking the Seanad, after hearing the details I am going to put before them, to ask the Minister to amend the Bill so that grants which the Minister considered should be provided even while the father was living, should not be discontinued simply because the father dies.  Since the passage of the Bill one particular case has come to my notice.  This was the case of a man who, about 1941, met with such an accident that he became permanently disabled for life.  Under the Work-men's Compensation Acts he got a sum of £300 or something less than £300, and after two years maintaining himself and a wife and seven children under 15 years of age, there was very little of that money left.  He had a pension of £35 a year and, in fact, immediately before he died his pension was being supplemented by a payment of 25/- a week from the home assistance authorities in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>If he lived until the Act was passed, he would have been entitled to have his money increased so that he would have a total income himself of 30/- a week. Actually, his pension amounted to about 13/- a week, but in addition to that 30/- from the pension and supplementary pension he would have been getting 7/6, as well as seven times 4/-, or 28/- a week for his family.  Between the additional allowance for himself and his wife of 7/6 and his allowance of 28/- he would have received in respect of his wife and children 35/- a week and that income would be coming into the house because of his wife and children as well as his basic income of 30/- a week.  The family were looking forward to this measure and to the additional income they would obtain, but about three weeks before the Bill was passed, the man died, and even if he had been in receipt of a pension at the time of his death, the whole pension in respect of himself and his children would have stopped.  The proposal made in the Pensions Act was deliberately put forward for a special class and special circumstances and it dealt with the case of a man himself, his wife and children.  It meant that there was nothing coming into the house.</P>
    <P>Under a non-contributory pension <Col N="534" /> scheme the widow would be able to get 7/6, the same amount as is contemplated in the Army Pensions Bill, but, in respect of the first child, she would receive only 3/6 and in respect of the other children only 1/6.  Under the widows' scheme she would only receive 20/- a week, and contributions will be paid only up to 14 years of age or to 16 if her children were going to school.  Under the Army Pensions Act they would be paid up to 18 years of age.  Again, under the non-contributory widows' scheme that 20/- would be reducible by 1/- a week for every 1/- the family was able to earn in any kind of way up to 12/6.  If the man had been a little longer disabled, the widow would have come in under that scheme, but due to the particular length of the period he was disabled, and, I think, due to the friendly ingenuity of Senator Foran, who has considerable experience of national health insurance and widows' pension matters, it was decided that the widow was entitled to a contributory widows' pension. Under the contributory widows' pension she was entitled to 10/- a week, for the first child 5/- a week, and for each of the six others 3/- a week, so that actually by the chance of the husband not having been too long disabled and the friendly advice of Senator Foran she was getting 33/- a week.</P>
    <P>Under the Army Pensions Bill she would have got 35/6 a week, but children's allowances under the contributory widows' pensions scheme are payable only for children under 14 years of age, or under 16 if they are going to school.  In fact she was able to get one of these boys employed as a telegraph messenger.  He is just 15 years of age, and inside the next 12 months he will be entitled to sit for an examination that may make his employment permanent, but if he does not pass the examination, he will be affected by the Post Office rule not to keep on young fellows over 16 who are not eligible for continuous employment by the Post Office.  There is just a chance that the boy may find himself disemployed at the end of the year and, instead of 4/- a week paid to the <Col N="535" /> widow in respect of the boy, the boy will be able to get nothing.  In a very special way, the Minister makes provision that the children's allowances should cease completely because the man is dead.  That is both unreasonable and unsound.  If it was considered under the Act that, when the man was living, the seven children should be entitled to 28/- a week for their maintenance with his basic of 30/- a week to keep the house over them, it is wrong that the widow should now be reduced to 23/- a week with the man dead and the basic 30/- that would keep the roof over their heads gone.  There is the additional disability that the grants will relate only to children under 14 years of age or 16 years of age if going to school. The Act contemplated that, if the man were alive, the increased grants would be continued up to 18 years of age.  I think it is a great weakness when we consider the small number of cases&mdash;I doubt if there can be a single other case in which actual payments are made.  I do submit that the Seanad should urge on the Minister to make the amendment I suggest to the Act, and to allow that the children should get the allowances contemplated after the man's death and so long as his children are under the age of 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very much to have heard the case for the motion, and it may be that it is better tactics to hear what I have to say than to allow me to listen to what I would like to hear.  However, the position is something like this.  First of all, I would like to say that Senators should try to appreciate the intent and purport of Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act of <Col N="536" /> 1943.  In order to do that it is necessary to understand the reasons why it was introduced.</P>
      <P>For a considerable time before its introduction, it was represented to the Government by various organisations that a number of men who had fought during Easter Week, 1916, were in distress because on the one hand they were incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of mind or body, and because on the other hand their military service pensions were in themselves inadequate. Certain specific cases, mainly of pensioners resident in Dublin, were brought forward, and after due investigation it was decided that the complaints were reasonably well founded, and that something should be done to relieve the distress of the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>The question then arose as to the best means of dealing with the problem. The obvious way to do it was by amending the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934 so as to increase the pensions payable to all persons who were in possession of military service certificates in respect of Easter Week, 1916, but on investigation it was found that this solution though simple was open to grave objections. For one thing it might easily have led to the belief that all pensioners were equally entitled to have their grants increased, and for another, even in the restricted category of 1916 men, it would give increased pensions to men who were in comfortable circumstances. At this stage it became apparent that if the problem was to be solved with due consideration for public funds some form of means test would have to be introduced, and as the introduction of any such test would be repugnant to the spirit and tenor of the military service code, it was deliberately decided not to touch that code, but to increase the military service pension by means of a special allowance under the Army Pensions Code.  That code already provided for a means test in certain cases, so that by dealing with the 1916 problem under it there was no danger of introducing undesirable precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> It is quite clear, therefore, that the special allowance provided in Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act, 1943, is in effect an increase of military service pension in certain cases of distress, for the military service certificate is the basis of the allowance.  If the increased pension had been given by amendment of the Military Service Pensions Acts, it would not have been possible, therefore, I think, to bring forward this motion because the question of passing it on to the widow could not have been put forward, for it is a principle inherent in those Acts and in all similar service Acts, whether military or otherwise, that the pension is personal and dies with the recipient.</P>
    <P>Even from the point of view of the Army Pensions Acts, this motion, if accepted, would introduce a new and undesirable precedent.  Under these Acts the pension cases on the death of the pensioner, but another pension, technically called an allowance, becomes payable provided that the pensioner has died from a disease or injury attributable to service.  That principle obtains in the case of a 1916 man in receipt of a disability or wound pension even though he may also because of his needy circumstances be in receipt of a special allowance under Section 7 of the 1943 Act.  This motion, however, would grant such pensions or allowances to the dependents of 1916 men even though the death of the latter had no connection whatsoever with his military service, and it thus cuts across the principles not only of the Military Service Acts, but also of the Army Pensions Acts, and would introduce a new and unprecedented principle into both codes.</P>
    <P>For the reasons outlined, I am unable to recommend to the Government the terms of the motion.  If the principle be conceded that a military service pension does not cease with the death of the pensioner, then we may have to face the contingency of continuing of pensions to the dependents of deceased pensioners and it would be impossible to measure the financial implications of such proposals and I would seriously suggest that Senators should, therefore, hesitate before accepting the motion under discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Minister every possible credit for Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act, 1943.  When he introduced it, I am sure he was running absolutely counter to Civil Service advice and had fought and won a hard battle with the Department of Finance.  That Section 7 is meant to meet a very difficult and, presumably, unique situation.  There is a particular flaw in it, which is disclosed by the terms of the motion before the House.  The Minister's answer is that the motion involves the breaking of a principle under which pensions are granted and paid.  In other words, having, in that Section 7, brought in something which was not a Civil Service idea, having done something entirely creditable to himself, to his colleagues and to all of us, the Minister is now proceeding to argue on the basis of &ldquo;keeping the file right.&rdquo;  The whole basis of his argument is that, if he did this for a very small and diminishing group of people, the file would not be right in the Civil Service Office.  I have had that kind of argument put up to me before and I understand it perfectly.  I suggest that the Minister is not only doing an injustice to a small number of people, but is also doing an injustice to himself and to the line he took when he put Section 7 into the Act of 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how much and, indeed, how little the Minister is being asked to do by this particular motion.  The number of people who were out in the Rising was very small&mdash;not more than 1,000 men and women in Dublin.  It is 28 years ago, and many of them are dead.  Quite a number, like the Minister and myself, are in quite good circumstances. The Minister brought in a provision in the Act of 1943 to deal with a small number who were in bad circumstances.  We received that warmly and thought it a credit to the Minister.  He broke a principle, because he augmented the pension instead of amending the Army Pensions Act. He provided for a small number of people.  He is now asked to deal with the children of those people who are in bad circumstances and who are under 18&mdash;or, if he likes, under 16.  He is only asked to deal with the children, as the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions <Col N="539" /> Act deals as well with the widow as if she were dealt with under the Army Pensions Act, 1943.  Therefore, this narrows it down to the orphans, who get the special allowance provided for in Section 7.  There is only a small number: perhaps the Minister could say how many there are.  I know quite a number of 1916 men, and very few have children under 16.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing himself a wrong by refusing to seek the very small amount of money which would be required to make this Section 7 absolutely flawless.  He refuses simply by quoting a Civil Service principle in the Pensions Act.  The only difference between this Act and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act would be with regard to the provision for the orphans. The Seanad cannot make this change, and it is quite clear that, if the Minister does not agree to do so, there is no use in passing the motion, so we must try to convince the Minister rather than force him.  Section 7 says that you can calculate the means of the person and then add to the means. The Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act payments would be means.  What Senator Mulcahy and myself ask is that the means should be supplemented for the children under 18, if they are in needy circumstances.  That was not our own idea: it was put into legislation for the first time by the Minister himself.  We merely ask him to go a short step further.  This request is to deal only with the children of 1916 men, to deal only with the children of needy 1916 men, to deal only with the children of needy 1916 men who die, and to deal only with those orphans who are under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose any motion ever asked for a smaller amount of money, but this is for a special class of people whom the Minister has at heart as much as I have.  I am not arguing about that at all: the Minister has shown his interest and, I think, from his own point of view and from that of legislation, it is worth while bringing in this very small amendment to make this right.  It deals with such a small number of people that, if I were Minister, instead of arguing against this on <Col N="540" /> a Civil Service principle, I would argue that there are so few cases that they would not be worth dealing with.  The Minister argues on a principle which he has broken already&mdash;the Minister is a sinner who has committed mortal sin against the Civil Service, but the more sins committed against the Civil Service from that point of view, the better.  It is in the national interest that these few people in needy circumstances should be dealt with and I suggest that the Minister, having inserted Section 7 in the Act of 1943, should make it absolutely right and thus do credit to himself and show that he is able to act on his own, as I am sure he did when he brought in that section.</P>

      <P>As an old 1916 man, I think it will be agreed&mdash;without taking from anyone who took part in that historic fight&mdash;that, as in all cases of fights and revolutions, a large proportion of the people involved were men and women of no property&mdash; Fintan Lalor's &ldquo;men of no property&rdquo;. Many of them lost their employment after the Rising and were hit very hard from the economic standpoint.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the Minister. I am supporting this motion and I believe that, if it is at all possible for the Minister to put it into force, he will do so.  I know his sympathies have been with the 1916 men and with Old I.R.A. men generally: they have much to be thankful for since he became Minister for Defence.  Many of these men have been in poor circumstances and, when they die, there is always the problem of the children left behind.  I will not elaborate the point, as I know that, if the Minister can do anything to meet the wishes of the mover and seconder of the motion, he will do so.</P>

If the Minister has had the representations he speaks about, I imagine he would know how <Col N="541" /> many cases are involved.  I know of one case where a little woman of 40 years of age is left with seven children, whose ages are 15, 13, 11, 8, 6, 4 and one year.</P>

I am going to see that your income is raised to 30/- by a special allowance for yourself, with an additional 7/6 for your wife and 28/- a week for your children, and I am going to guarantee that the children will have that 28/- a week until they are 18 years of age.&rdquo;  Then this particular man dies and, instead of all these things coming to the people for whom the Minister was preparing them&mdash;and I take it the Minister was preparing them for these people under the special conditions&mdash;the position that I have already indicated came about.  The family for whom this man was working are deprived of benefit because the man dies.</P>
      <P>I think the principle involved in the Minister's speech and in the section ought to be made wide enough to include the children of a man in that position, a man for whom the allowance was going to be made.  By so amending the Bill, the children of 1916 men who would be qualified under the section, and who have died, will be provided for until they are 18 years of age.  I think that is merely keeping in touch with the spirit intended in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this case is concerned, I know it will cost for the one family&mdash; and I doubt if there is another&mdash;£13 a year.  Such action as is suggested will indicate to that little woman who has <Col N="542" /> that family around her that she will not be cut off in her allowance, her widow's pension, when the children are 14 or 16 years old.  It will tell her, if her boy is not able to pass the examination that will qualify him to remain in the employment of the Post Office after 16, that her income will be assured.  There may be one or two cases of that sort, but I submit that this particular case is really deserving of earnest consideration.  Anybody who walks into a house of that kind cannot but realise how humane was the provision as originally intended. Apparently, now the flaw is that the head of the house dies, the basic income of 30/- a week is gone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I leave this matter entirely to the decision of the House. Perhaps there are other Senators who feel keenly about it and who may wish to express their opinions.  I do not want to press this to a division, but I feel it is necessary that I should draw attention to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear, as regards everything that Senators Hayes, Colgan and Mulcahy have said about these individuals, that I feel all these sentiments myself but, however lightly we may talk of principles, we have to recognise that the principles are there and they must be guarded.  There are approximately 15,000 people drawing pensions in this State for military service, and of that number there are possibly 2,000 who are 1916 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the 2,000 still alive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say they are all still alive.  There are some among the 15,000 who may not be alive. I could not indicate the number alive <Col N="543" /> at the present time, but the figures I have given represent the numbers who were originally granted pensions.</P>
      <P>I could not possibly recommend the terms of this motion to the Government for the simple reason that every individual who is drawing a pension may, when he dies, leave behind him a widow and orphans, and the dependents concerned would feel as justly entitled to have a continuing pension as would the individuals whom this motion covers.  That is one of the things that I, as a Minister, however my sentiments may run, must recognise.  However this particular situation might be met, in my opinion it cannot be met by establishing a precedent the results of which none of us could foresee.</P>
      <P>It is admitted the sum of money that would be involved is almost negligible. If it were merely a question of the money involved in this case the simplest and easiest method for me to adopt would be to accept the motion. It might be a dishonest way of doing it, but it would be the easiest way. However the case covered by the motion may be settled, in my opinion it cannot be settled in the way Senator Mulcahy suggests.  I am not going to be too dogmatic in this statement, but I believe there is no nation in the world to-day that grants a service pension to the widow of a soldier, and why this nation, which has so often been described in our own Legislature as being in an impoverished condition, should be asked to do it baffles me. There may be other ways of doing it, out at the moment I cannot suggest what they are.  I cannot see it being settled through the method that has been suggested.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see a method by which the matter can <Col N="544" /> be dealt with?  Has he not broken the principle already in the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not broken the principle.  I have certainly done something that I suppose has not been done before.  It was a situation that created so much difficulty in the minds of myself and the officials of the Department of Defence, that that was the only way we could see to deal with it.  We took advantage of the Army Pensions Act of 1943 to do it.</P>
