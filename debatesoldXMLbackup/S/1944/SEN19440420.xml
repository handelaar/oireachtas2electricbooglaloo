      <P>Before taking the next stage, I should like to suggest to the Minister that he should defer the further stages until after a conference has taken place between representatives of the Trade Union Congress and representatives of employers.  There is a good deal of misgiving about the retrospective effect of the Bill.  It goes back over a number of years and it is not going to do very serious harm if it is held up for a while longer.  If the Minister is willing to adopt the course I suggest it might remove a good deal of doubt and suspicion that exists amongst trade unionists about the effect of the Bill.</P>

      <P>My feeling is that I do not think there is any ground for doubts as to the effects of the Bill but if they exist I am prepared to meet the parties concerned for the purpose of removing them.  A very high percentage of the persons affected did not know they were affected until this amending Bill was introduced.  I think it would create unnecessary industrial disturbance if the enactment of this measure was delayed now that this knowledge has become general.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (c), page 4, line 6, to delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment in order to give the Minister the opportunity, if he cares to take it, to make the Bill a little less rigid in respect of the means test. The sub-section as it stands reads: &ldquo;The scheme shall prescribe maximum limits regarding income.&rdquo;  The Bill seems to make it obligatory on scholarship committees and county councils when preparing their schemes to include means tests.  I hope it may be possible to leave the thing open so that if any county council thought fit not to have a means test it might be open to them to omit the test.  Personally, I do not want to start a new debate after all we had yesterday on the question of the means test, but the view I have on the matter is that whereas these scholarships have always been associated in the minds of the public with a means test, it is rather regrettable that they should have been so associated.  Though there are arguments for the means test I think general principles are against such a test.  It would be much healthier if these scholarships were open.  The number of cases that would be affected by having them open would be very small, not more than a half dozen in any one year.  The only real argument in favour of the means test is that it <Col N="1371" /> might happen in certain cases that the children of poor parents would be prevented from gaining scholarships, if it was not there.  I think cases of the kind do happen.  I have a feeling that difficulties that arise in this respect could be got over, for instance, by having the number of scholarships more elastic; by having power in the hands of the committee or the Minister to award extra scholarships where hardships of this kind arise.  While the objections to the means test are many and serious it is the test that gives rise to all those borderline cases where decisions have to be reached on points about valuation and so on.  I should like to see it elastic so that any county council could abolish this means test for its own scholarships, even as an experiment.  I have only put down this amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of saying whether he would make this slight change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter.  As I announced last night I feel, personally, that there may be a good deal in the arguments of Senator Tierney and others.  The booklet I have here lays down certain rules governing scholarships under the 1923 Act.  Up to the present councils have based their schemes on these rules.  Clause 3 (a) says that in the scheme they should make provision for the award of scholarships to the children of parents whose means would not be sufficient to provide them with a secondary education, and they may also make provision for varying the amounts of the scholarships according to the valuation and the income and other means of the parents.  In introducing this Bill I had not in mind the bringing in of any new principles.  I had been endeavouring to see that if there was any doubt in the long run where a dispute arose as a result of the local authority insisting on putting into its scheme some condition that seemed to be unfair, the Minister would have power to refuse to sanction the scheme.  In order to avoid doing this I have been seeking power to amend and modify <Col N="1372" /> schemes so that it would be clear to councils that there was no use in putting up fruitless demands for certain conditions to be inserted which the Oireachtas think should not be included.  The intention really was to accept the scheme of things as it is at present, leaving the local authorities entirely free to bring in schemes or not to bring them in, as they thought fit, but to secure that, when schemes were brought into operation, the scholarships would be awarded strictly in accordance with the conditions laid down, that there would be proper publicity and, if there was a dispute, that the Minister would be able to say he had certain legal backing in making his wishes known to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not attempted to interfere with the means test.  The House will see that, in the Long Title, the Bill is described as &ldquo;an Act to make provision for... payments to young persons to assist them to attend or continue to attend approved schools.&rdquo;  Section 4 (c) has the words: &ldquo;for the purpose of limiting the receipt of scholarships to persons who need them.&rdquo;  If we departed from that, the whole framework of the Bill would be altered because, in accepting the existing situation, we have accepted the principle of the means test.  At this stage, I do not think that we should depart from it.  Even if this House and the Dáil were agreeable to accepting Senator Tierney's amendment, I do not think that it would prove of very much value because, even if the option were there, I do not think that the councils would avail themselves of it.  Rightly or wrongly, the schemes for the past 20 years have been worked on the basis of assistance to the children of poorer parents&mdash;that is to say, parents who, according to the means tests in the different schemes, can prove to the satisfaction of the council that they are not able to give their children education beyond the primary stage.  I think that the Senator himself mentioned that, if we were to throw the matter open, imposing no limits whatever, hardly any council would accept such a view.  It would have the disadvantage to which the Senator <Col N="1373" /> referred that children in urgent need of this aid would be excluded because of the scholarships being given to children of parents who, it might be claimed, were in a position to educate them without this assistance.  While I can see that there is an argument in favour of helping the most brilliant student and that it is a serious matter if a brilliant student is passed over, nevertheless, we have to bear in mind the fundamental aspect of the scheme. That must be the overriding consideration. In the long run, if we have to make a choice between the two things, we must come down on the side of giving assistance to those who, otherwise, would lose the advantage of securing post-primary education.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned during the course of the debate that parents who are in receipt of incomes greater than the amounts laid down are getting scholarships for their children.  As Senator Tierney has said, it is very difficult to investigate means and it may be that some people are getting away with these things.  Although, occasionally, councils seek the opinion of the Department or ask for a ruling on certain matters, we do not seem to have had any cases of that kind brought before us.  If such cases arise, I am hopeful that, under Sections 6 and 9, it will be possible to deal with them.  As the Senator mentioned, the easiest way out of the situation would be for the councils to increase the amounts available. It would be much better to do that than to exclude deserving children.  The total number of scholarships granted is in the region of 340 and there is no reason whatever why that number should not be greatly increased. I hope it will be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to leave it to a council to fix the means test in the area under the control of that council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I cannot see at the moment why I should interfere.  I cited last night cases in which, I think, the limit is rather low&mdash;an income of £150.  But I think it would be much better if those interested moved in the matter.  Perhaps the local representatives would do this through the <Col N="1374" /> scholarships committees, which may take a more impartial view than the members of the elected bodies.  If the scholarships committee consists of educationists from the area, I think that we could fairly leave the matter to them.  I would not think of interfering arbitrarily even though I am not satisfied with some of the conditions.  I think that we shall have to try to secure our objectives by persuasion rather than by instruction from the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a specific example of the point I raised.  In Kildare, last year, the representatives of the elected council were completely ignored by the manager.  The scheme which the elected members of the council had considered very carefully and drafted was completely wiped out by him, and a new scheme substituted. He sent round a circular asking us what we wanted done.  Having got our views, he proceeded to do something entirely different.  I do not think that that can arise now under the reserved function section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the matters dealt with by the Minister were not pertinent to the amendment. Senator Tierney's amendment, if accepted, would not abolish the means test, because power is left by this Bill to the local authority to settle the terms of the scholarship, subject to the Minister's approval, and also the amount of the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to abolish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Bill of 1923 and the original scheme left the power I have mentioned to the local authorities.  Then, as Senator Sweetman has pointed out, the manager had that power quite recently.  Now, the Minister has, in this Bill, given back that power to the local body.  All that Senator Tierney's amendment asks is <Col N="1375" /> that the local bodies should have the power to decide that there be no means test.  It does not mean that there would be no means test.  It means that if a local body decided to experiment with a scholarship scheme in which there would be no means test the Minister would not be able to compel them to insert a means test.  The history of the matter is really not very relevant. I appreciate the Minister's explanation of what the 1923 Act contained, but we are not bound to accept what is in the 1923 Act.  The first object should be to help people who are not otherwise able to provide themselves with secondary or vocational education.  It seems to me that, having given extra liberties and powers to the local authorities in other directions, we might go so far in this Bill as to give them power to decide whether or not they should have a means test.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Title, that, of course, can easily be amended.  There is not very much in that.  I think it would not require amendment.  If it did the Minister as well as others have seen sufficient amendments of Bills not to worry about the amendment of a Long Title.  That is a very small obstacle in the way of getting something done.  The figure of the means test is far too low in Dublin City and in a great many other places.  Senator Tierney can take this consolation to himself, that if this amendment is carried there need be no means test and, even if it is not, a local body which wants to carry out the experiment can raise the level so high that in effect there is no means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister apparently is in the frame of mind that he believes it should be higher than it is, but I think it would be better not to put it in the minds of councils by paragraph (c) of Section 4, that they absolutely must have a means test.  The means test in the country, and, I am informed, in Dublin, involves a great deal of deception. I have not investigated many cases, but, as far as I could investigate one particular case in which a scholarship was held, I found the income was far higher than the level prescribed. <Col N="1376" /> It is one of those things which is very difficult to establish.  We all know that in the country it is difficult as between two people to decide what the precise income is.  All this leads to more and more investigation, more and more inquiry, and more and more evasion of the actual law as it is. Anything which will put us in the position that we do not want to evade the law, and that we have no need to evade the law, is a good thing.</P>
    <P>We are not actually discussing the question of the means test, and we are not called upon to say whether there ought or ought not to be a means test.  You can vote for this amendment and believe that there ought to be a means test.  A member of Dublin Corporation or a member of Longford County Council could vote for it and then argue on the corporation or on Longford County Council for a means test for scholarships.  That is quite feasible.  In this amendment we are asked not to make it obligatory upon county councils to impose a means test.  I wish to make just one other observation about this.  There is a very sound provision in this Bill which I think was not there before, that you can reserve scholarships for particular types of areas.  That is a really sound provision.  You can also reserve a certain number of scholarships with a means test, but as long as we keep the paragraph in its present form you cannot do without a means test.  I think it would be wiser to give local bodies power to carry out the experiment of having no means test, and for that reason the amendment is a reasonable one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I am fundamentally opposed to the amendment.  The Bill as it stands recognises that there is a certain group forming a very large section of the community, in the position economically that they are not able to give their children the education they ought to have.  If you abolish the means test you are reducing the already limited number of scholarships available by throwing them open to people who are in a more favourable position to compete.  The child of the unemployed <Col N="1377" /> or semi-employed man, farm labourer or builder's labourer with small wages is severely handicapped compared with a competitor whose parents are in a much better position to look after him both physically and mentally.  Now you are going to put a child who is already in a favourable position on equal terms with the boy who was handicapped because of the economic position of his parents.</P>
      <P>The boy whose parents are not in a position to spend money and to give him the education that his talents deserve ought to be encouraged either by the local authority or by the State. If you remove the means test you are certainly limiting, very seriously limiting, the possibility of the agricultural labourer's child or the builder's labourer's child from qualifying.  For these reasons I am fundamentally opposed to the abolition of the means test.  There must have been at one time a reason for the inclusion of the means test and the situation has not changed so far as I know, or improved the lot of the great bulk of lowly paid people.  We ought to conserve these scholarships and to give them to the children I refer to as a start in life, provided they have the ability to win them by competition.  I do not think that they ought to be penalised or handicapped now by others who are in a much more favourable position.  We know the constitution of these councils. We need not go into the question of evasion of the law raised by Senator Hayes and Senator Tierney.  There will be evasions of the law and even if the amendment is carried evasions will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we should not lose sight of the fact that the scholarships are to be financed out of the poor rate.  What the legal implications of that are, I do not know, but one would think that the poor rate was only legally applicable to the relief of the poor.  That is a <Col N="1378" /> point we cannot leave out of consideration. I do not know anything about the limitation of rates or the application of rates, but on the general question I agree with Senator Foran that this Bill was primarily intended for the laudable purpose of helping people who could not otherwise give their children a proper chance of education after the compulsory period of education was over, or give them a chance of developing the talents that God gave them.  It is not clear that the proportion of poor children, as suggested by Senator Maguire and adopted by Senator Tierney, is such that it would limit the number of scholarships.  The better-off child has many other advantages and lives in a bookish atmosphere.  The poor children in the slums or in poor homes do not have these advantages.  They have their natural talent, but if you put them into competition with children from homes where there are more advantages, I do not think they will get the chance that this Bill intended to give, and that was the original conception of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support those who are opposing this amendment. Senator Tierney and Senator Hayes went to great pains to tell us that the amendment does not mean the abolition of the means test, but, in my opinion, it opens the door in that respect.  While it would be quite possible for a county council to increase the figure for the means test that would not benefit people for whom this Bill was intended.  The principle of the scholarship schemes was to help people of limited means to give their children a secondary education.  If the means test is abolished the fundamental principle underlying the scheme and the Bill goes.  I feel that the Minister is acting wisely in resisting the amendment.  I know from experience in the City of Dublin that boys and girls got scholarships who otherwise would not have had the opportunity of going to secondary schools.  I agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon that children of well-to-do parents have a better chance in life than those whose parents are lowly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If we knew <Col N="1379" /> how paragraph (e) was going to be administered we could find a solution. There are two excellent reasons for giving free education.  One is that the person to whom you are giving it could not otherwise afford it and that natural ability enables him to make the best of it.  Obviously that should be the main object of this Bill.  The second reason for giving free education is that there may be people of such outstanding ability and intellectual merit that if they got free education, which might not be given them otherwise, even though their parents could afford it, they are going to make such use of it that they are going to return to the community a dividend quite out of proportion to the amount of money originally expended on their education. I would be anxious to see that these principles were preserved and that while there would be no diminution in the number of scholarships which should go to those who qualify, because they were not able to pay for education, but were capable of making good use of it, there should also be a few scholarships earmarked which would benefit not only the recipients but the community in general.  I should like to be assured by the Minister that the provisions of paragraph (e) are intended to cover such cases as I referred to.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The scheme shall reserve to the said corporation or council power, with the approval of the Minister, to award in special circumstances the whole or part of a scholarship to a person who does not comply with the provisions prescribed under paragraph (o) of this section in respect of such scholarship.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to say, the means test.  I would oppose the amendment if I felt there was a loophole whereby a scholarship could at some time be given on the ground of outstanding brilliance to a person whose parents, if he did not get it would not be sufficiently enlightened to give him the advantages of further education.  I seek <Col N="1380" /> further light from the Minister.  I do not see why paragraph (e) should not operate to meet both sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Tierney is asking for a great deal in this amendment.  I would not be prepared to open the door indiscriminately and I do not think the Senator is asking for that.  I put it to the House that probably no county council or municipal body would accept or operate this proposal.  I do not think there is much point in arguing about what the poor man's child is to get. The fact is that on county councils the dominant voices in these matters are those of poor men.  That is so in Cavan and in the neighbouring counties. Senator Johnston and Senator Hearne can bear out that statement.  Hardly any counties would agree to the absolute abolition of the means test.  Even if the Minister conceded the request in the amendment he would not be conceding very much.  As to the point raised by Senator Mrs. Concannon, as as far as I am aware, this rate is not levied as a poor rate but as part of the total expenditure of a local authority. It comes under the category of poor rate like many other things.  I do not think there is any special classification for it.  I am not in agreement with the opinions expressed about the poor man's child, that that child is not getting the chance that other children get.  I suggest that practically all pupils who will compete for scholarships will be pupils of national schools. I know of no better educational foundation than that given to our children in the national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no better foundation in the matter of education than that which our children get at national schools. The truth about it is that most scholarship winners, no matter what kind the scholarships may be, are the pupils of national schools.  If you follow them further to the secondary schools, you will find that the students who are doing best are the children who came from national schools.  I suggest to those who spoke on behalf of the poor that they are misrepresenting the capacity of the poor.  I question very much if children of the poor and children of the so-called rich were in a race for <Col N="1381" /> any scholarship that you would not find the poor boy or girl coming out on top.</P>

      <P>Maybe I have put a different, interpretation of poverty to Senator Foran, but I got the impression that if the parents of many of the better-off children send them to one type of school that these children definitely had the better opportunity in a scholarship examination than those from national schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that Senator Mrs. Concannon or Senator Hearne said so.  I am giving the House my interpretation of what was said by Senators on the back benches. Children of the poor have national schools to go to, and I put it to the House that is where they will go from to sit for scholarships.  There is no better university for any child than the national school.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any better.  As I did not get any better so perhaps I could not know of anything better. That is the experience in my own house.  Some of the children went to one school and some went to another school, but that was the start&mdash;the national school.  Even amongst the poor there are divisions with regard to their ability.  I am sure that will not be questioned.  It is not often the best-fed or wealthiest pupils are richest in brains.  I know homes in which there is enough money to feed the children well and to send them to &ldquo;the pictures&rdquo; but they never buy a book.  I know children where the tradition in the home is different from that.  Some parents would almost prefer to give their children reading rather than give them food that might make them look better.  That is the type that comes up at examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I do not subscribe to the view that if the Minister accepts this amendment we are throwing the door open for the abolition of the means test.  People who have experience on local authorities would not agree that that would take place.  It would not take place in County Cavan.  We are neither very rich nor very poor but it would not be possible to get the means test abolished there.  I wonder if it would be possible to make provision in this measure to enable local authorities, if they wish, to give one scholarship to children, say, above a certain valuation or above a certain income?</P>

      <P>Other councils might determine to do something else, but we might not have a rigid rule.  I am afraid I react against the point of view that we must always have some very rich and a whole lot of very poor people.  I heard Labour Senators, arguing that view.  I wonder if the position is to be that they think we will always have many poor people who can never raise enough money to help their children, and whose incomes will be so low that they can never make any provision for them.  That is a wrong mental approach to the difficulties we have to face.</P>
      <P>Supposing the scholarships were thrown open and it was found that seven-eighths of the successful people were children of the poor homes, what would be the effect?  I hope it would be enlightening.  I do not know, but it might happen.  If that was done, it is doubtful if the children of the very poor would be in a much worse position in regard to the number of scholarships they enjoy than they are now.  Those who take the line that you have to protect the poor and to have special opportunities are really fighting a shadow and are really afraid of themselves.  They are afraid to have these children they speak of tested against the others.  I do not accept that view at all.  I think the children of the poor are well able to meet the others, and that they can do so confidently. The Minister ought to give them that chance.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment. I have still to hear an argument in support of it.  There may be some fairly reasonable argument in support of the amendment, but we did not hear it from Senator Baxter.  The only attempt he made to bolster up any kind of an argument was to point out that the majority on county councils were the representatives of the poorer people, and that therefore it was all right to leave the matter in their hands.  Surely the Senator is not so pessimistic as to imagine that the people in control in Cavan will always be in control of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the House had accepted the principle of the Bill when it passed the Second Stage, but now we are apparently to have a discussion on much the same lines.  I agree with Senator Baxter when he said that if this amendment was accepted, not very many county councils would put it into operation, but in case there might be any generous council which would be anxious that the scholarship scheme should continue without any means test, I would be prepared to oppose that in the interests of the people.  I believe there is no local authority which would put forward any scheme of open scholarships.  We are bound by the view that the great percentage of those passing the examination and getting scholarships would often be drawn not from the very poor, but from people who, in the opinion of the ratepayers and of the majority of the county councillors, were not in a position to pay for secondary education for their children.  I hold that view, because I know that parents who are well off would set out to give their <Col N="1384" /> children extra tuition that could not be afforded in the case of the children of the poor.  As a result, the children of the poor would have to meet unfair competition.</P>
      <P>That would be a rather peculiar state of affairs.  The result would be that ratepayers who elected these county councillors would say: &ldquo;You are spending our money giving secondary education to the children of people who can well afford to do so out of their own means.&rdquo;  Naturally it would follow that in a very short time the whole scholarship scheme would be abolished by the county councils concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter put up one argument in favour of this amendment.  He said that the majority of county councils were composed of representatives who are themselves small farmers and workers.  I think that that in itself is one of the greatest arguments in favour of the non-acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>From many years experience of committees responsible for the administration of primary scholarship schemes I feel there should be a retention of some form of means test.  The object for which the scheme was founded originally was to give the benefit of secondary education or scholarships to children whose parents had not means to provide secondary education.  I think if there is no means test the position will be, because of the fact these scholarships are very attractive, that you will have parents employing tutors to give the children training after school hours.  You will have parents sending their children to secondary schools with a view to joining a scholarship class so that they may gain one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only trouble about the means test is that I think it is not very easily arrived at.  You have the case of persons whose means can be computed by a local authority, pensioners, railway clerks or police pensioners.  There are other people who are far better off but whose means cannot be so easily arrived at and whose children are not debarred from applying for these scholarships while the children of the <Col N="1385" /> small pensioner are.  Although I do not know how it could be done, I should like to see some regulation by which the means test would not operate unfairly against the classes referred to. If the means test is abolished I know of no regulation that any local authority can frame that will make it possible for the children referred to to get a fair chance.</P>

      <P>I wish to express myself in favour of the retention of the means test but I am not so sanguine about it as some of my colleagues, because the means test I suggest cannot operate without a good deal of injustice. You have, first of all, those who are on the borderline, whose incomes are just above the limit.  These people will always feel that they have a grievance and the scholarship committee will find that a good deal of its time will be taken up convincing such people that their children have been fairly excluded from the scholarship. The question is not one of providing a scholarship for the brilliant child of a poor person.  I think that question is very much overdone, as some people regard the brilliant child of 13 or 14 years of age as merely a precocious child. From the national point of view I should think it of far more importance to provide the not very brilliant child of the poor person with secondary education rather than the brilliant child. I would like to see the competitive examination system abolished entirely and scholarships awarded on recommendations of the school authorities.</P>

I am quite sure I know Senator Tierney well enough to say that he does not intend that at all.  Having heard the arguments on both sides it seems to me there is a possibility that the poor child will be victimised if we insert &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this case. Because the majority of Senators feel that that may occur perhaps Senator Tierney might reconsider the matter, <Col N="1386" /> and, perhaps, withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my views to those already expressed against the abolition of the means test and against the amendment.  I come from a county which Senator Baxter knows.  There are large numbers of small farmers and labourers in the county whose children would qualify for scholarships under the means test but if that test were done away with it would be a different position.  In County Monaghan the position would then be that a number of people that could afford to do so could send their children to a convent school, Christian Brothers' school or a model school. There are facilities available by which these people could get their children educated at a higher school preparatory to the scholarship examination. On the other hand, poor parents, working men or small farmers, might not be in a position to send children to a convent school, a Christian Brothers' school or a model school to get special tuition.  This is a rather delicate question and it is very much to the forefront in County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the remarks which I am now making I do not want to be ministerpreted and I hope that, as happened some time ago, my words as given in the Official Report will not be misinterpreted. We have a number of schools in which the teachers are perhaps husband and wife.  They are both teaching and, if the means test is abolished, their children would be free to compete with the children of poorer parents.  I am making no reflection on such teachers nor am I making any charge against them, but it will be very hard to convince poor people that their children are getting as good an opportunity of preparing for scholarship examinations as children who have been specially prepared for such examinations.  I shall give one instance which may be perhaps outside the scope of the amendment but I think it will have some bearing on it.  I do not fully agree with the system at the present time, with a means test or otherwise.  My opinion is that the best brains and the most talented children in the State should be educated free <Col N="1387" /> for the benefit of the State, though that may seem rather far-fetched at the present time.  The cleverest and most talented children in the country should get an opportunity of fitting themselves for the highest positions in the country.  They should get if possible a university education so that their talents and their brains would be developed to the fullest possible extent for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>I want to give one instance of a case that arose in my own neighbourhood which may possibly interest the Minister.  It concerned a child of poor parents who showed special talents at the national school.  He was given a certain problem in arithmetic to do. He worked out an answer but it did not agree with the answer given in the book.  He was a very brilliant boy and the teacher sent him back again to reexamine it.  He spent a couple of days at home in working it out but he still got the same answer.  He then told the teacher that the answer given in the book was wrong.  The teacher drew the attention of the inspector to it and it was found that the pupil was right and that the answer given in the book was wrong.  That boy subsequently got a scholarship, but the amount of the scholarship was not sufficient to enable him to avail of it. It had to be supplemented by a certain amount and his parents were unable to provide that amount.  Eventually the boy got a Diocesan scholarship which was of a sufficient amount to enable him to avail of it.  To-day that boy is one of the cleverest men and occupies one of the highest positions in the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the composition of the county council in his own county but from my experience of the council in Monaghan at present I think that the children of most members there would be disqualified under the means test.  I do not at all agree that the means test should be done away with because, if it were, you would not have the same confidence amongst people generally that the children of poor parents would be given a <Col N="1388" /> fair opportunity of competing.  It has been pointed out on many occasions that children of the poorest parents can aspire to the highest education and the highest positions in the land. I do not believe they can because, in most cases of which I am aware, even when the children of such parents are awarded scholarships, the scholarship has to be supplemented to some extent before they can avail of it.  If the means test is done away with, in my opinion the children of poor parents will never have an opportunity of reaching the highest positions in the country.</P>

      <P>Listening to the rather long debate that has ensued on this amendment, I cannot help wondering whether several members of the Seanad are not mistaken about the body to which they belong.  Senator Hawkins and others seem to think that they are not members of Oireachtas Eireann but rather members of <i>Parliament Chloinne Thomáis.</i>  Senaator Johnston has rather let the cat out of the bag.  He has pointed out, what I suspected to be the case all along, that the means test is designed to exclude the children of national teachers.  To my mind, that one argument alone is enough to condemn the means test.  A scheme designed, on a purely economic basis, to exclude certain classes of the community from public benefits, is a mean scheme and the sooner it is done away with the sooner we shall have a chance of decent conditions.  A good deal of the discussion seems to have proceeded on the basis that provision for the education of poor children was never heard of until the county councils came along with these niggardly schemes, whereas the truth is that for nearly 100 years the diocesan colleges, which were operating on their own money and money voluntarily given to them, provided such scholarships.  There was never a means test in connection with these scholarships and they produced brilliant people and gave a first-class chance to the children of poor men.  I have not heard that there was ever a case of discrimination against the poor <Col N="1389" /> man's son in connection with these scholarships or that he was excluded because of his poverty.</P>
      <P>I cannot help feeling a certain indignation when I hear national teachers referred to in this way.  I am a poor man's son and I may say to Senator O'Donnell that I do not need any testimonials from him as to my <i>bona fides</i> on this question.  I could not have gone to a secondary school if I had not got a scholarship.  I was able to get through the examination because of the work of a national teacher who gave up his Saturday afternoons to help me for nothing, who never asked as much as a farthing from me, and who had children of his own as well to look after.  Surely the right attitude to adopt is that we have to consider the public interest.  These scholarships are not given to make children of poor men rich.  As a matter of fact, it is very questionable indeed whether any amount of education is of any great assistance in modern times in making people rich.  We have quite a lot of people in this State who have succeeded in getting quite rich with a very small amount of education. It is fairly safe to say that, on the whole, riches are in inverse proportion to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right attitude to adopt towards this whole question is that these scholarships are not intended to make the children of poor men rich, or to give poor men a chance.  They should be intended to help children who will be able afterwards as educated men to give good service to the community.  Candidates for scholarships must be tested by some system of examination.  I do not agree with people who object to examinations in that respect, because this is about the one case where examinations are justified.  Surely, what is at stake here is not the elevation of one class against another, or the setting up of economic discriminations but the public interest.  It is for the public good that the ratepayers should assist in the education of able boys and girls in each county, not in order to make these boys and girls rich men and women but in order that the community may <Col N="1390" /> derive some advantage from the education they get.</P>
    <P>I am rather amazed to see how our attitude on this question of the means test varies in different circumstances. I protested here when the Children's Allowances Bill was before the Seanad against the abolition of the means test, but the Seanad was practically 100 per cent. in favour of its abolition.  It was quite impossible to preserve the means test in relation to children's allowances, but in this question of scholarships, the means test is to stand.  It is one of the pillars of society.  The whole scheme goes to pieces without it. When it is a small advantage to people who are comparatively well-to-do the means test is abolished.  But when it is going to do harm to the comparatively well-to-do it is kept. That is <i>Parliament Chloinne Thomáis.</i> We talk about democracy.  When we passed the Children's Allowance Bill we turned people who could well afford to look after their own children into dependents of the State.  But when it is a question of doing something for education in a fair and open way we impose the means test.  What will it do?  It will keep a man with £30 valuation out of the scheme in favour of a man with £25 or even £29 valuation.  Border line cases are the whole issue.  One of the reasons why there is a smear over the county councils is that a large part of the community feels that there is discrimination on the part of the councils in relation to this means test.</P>
    <P>I quite admit that there are abuses in connection with these scholarship schemes.  The whole country has gone scholarship mad to a certain extent and there is always the possibility of certain people getting grinds for their children and getting them trained for these examinations.  That could be avoided.  Scholarships could be reserved to pupils of national schools; that is one simple way of doing it.  If it was found that anyone got a special grind for the examination he could be excluded.  In the long run special grinds will not enable a boy to get to the top if he has not got it in him.  If <Col N="1391" /> the good boy gets a fair chance he will always come to the top.  In order to give county councils power to vary the scheme a little and enable them to devise a better scheme I have introduced this amendment.  The amendment does not do away with the means test, it leaves it open.  I do not propose to press this amendment.  I merely wanted to test the Minister's attitude towards it and to give this opportunity to county councils.  I am all for making progress by consent, and I am glad the Minister is taking the attitude that he will not force the county councils into any action.  I want to see, if there is any county council enlightened enough to prepare a better scheme, that it will have an opportunity of doing so.  I do not intend to press this amendment.</P>

I suggest to those who think the means test should not be there at all, or that it is too low at present, if the case is as good as they think, they may be able to get the local authorities to raise the limit.  I do not think I should interfere.  Where a council itself feels, that a particular parent would be excluded on the strict application of the actual limits laid down though his personal circumstances <Col N="1392" /> might make him a most deserving case, they might consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 5, immediately after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 21 and within the brackets to insert the words &ldquo;and including also expenses of locomotion incurred by non-council members of any scholarships committee, that may be appointed by a council of a county, in travelling to and from meetings of the said scholarships committee.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I have always considered the treatment of members of county council scholarship committees in regard to the payment of travelling expenses as being unfair.  In the Dáil the Minister quoted from the recent circular issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health dealing with the question of the managerial system:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provisions applying to the appointment of committees by county councils are Section 18 of the County Management Act, 1940, and Section 58 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  The effect of these sections is to preserve the powers of the council to appoint committees with the sole restriction that no executive function can be delegated to a committee except by a manager.  The appointment of a committee to exercise reserved functions or supervisory powers of the councils is accordingly a matter of which the council are the judges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he <Col N="1393" /> thought there was no doubt, judging by this circular, that the local authorities have the same powers as always. From this it is quite clear that the power of county councils in regard to scholarships committees is beyond doubt, but scholarships committees are composed either wholly of members of county councils or partly of members of county councils and partly of other persons.  It has been held that travelling expenses could be paid only to the members of a county council who are members of the committee, and the marginal note to Section 8 of the Local Government Act, 1941, states that this section authorises payment of expenses to members of local authorities&mdash;travelling expenses to members of county councils.  County managers have held that this excuses them from payment of travelling expenses to non-council members.  Then you have this position that a scholarship committee consisting wholly of county council members can be paid travelling expenses for attending meetings of the committee, but where the committee is composed of county council members and non-county council members only the county council members can be paid travelling expenses.  That seems to be unfair and rather a slight on those non-council members who have given very valuable assistance to the community as a whole.  Statements have been made here that rather pained me.  One was that in the main scholarship schemes are devised by county council members.  I am quite certain of this&mdash; I know it is the case in my county&mdash; that the people who prepare these schemes are not actuated by any of the motives that have been suggested here.  All I am asking is that these outside members should get the same treatment as those who are also members of county councils.  All those persons, such as principals of colleges, people with experience of education, and teachers, who are willing to give their time to this work, should be paid travelling expenses as well as county council members.  That recognition is due to them for the very valuable work they have done in the making of scholarship schemes.  Two additional sub-sections arise out of this amendment. My only concern is that county <Col N="1394" /> council members will not be in a better position than the non-county council members are, that the same regulations regarding distances will apply to both.</P>

I think the procedure is, or would be, that when a committee is set up by a local authority, the Minister can by Order under Section 80 of the 1941 Act treat the committee itself as a local authority and pay travelling expenses accordingly.  I am informed that if the case is made to the Minister he will consider if such Order may be made.</P>

The result is that, when the scheme goes back to the local bodies, it is in words which have been either adopted or originated by the Minister. He has had full opportunity of altering the scheme in any way he likes and he must be deemed to have approved of the scheme as one which expresses with clarity and precision and in suitable language the intentions which he has formed.  That is the effect of Section 2 (3).  Having made himself responsible, and adopted the wording, he then very properly takes care that this scheme, which has been carefully considered, is brought to the attention of those people who are intended to benefit by it.  By sub-section (5), it is made mandatory upon the local body to publish such scheme in such manner as appears to them to be best calculated to bring the provisions thereof to the notice of the persons intended to be benefited thereby.  That means that he takes pains to call to the attention of those persons whose children are intended to be benefited by the scheme the provisions of the scheme.  They are told what benefits are provided for them, subject to what conditions and in what manner.  They are entitled to put on the wording of the scheme whatever be its correct intention. A promise is made to them and they, presumably, so arrange their actions in regard to their children as to take advantage of the scheme in <Col N="1397" /> the way in which it has been formulated. It is an impossible thing to hope that even, as was suggested by the Minister, with the aid of senior counsel or with the aid of several senior counsel, any scheme can ever be drafted in a way in which there can be no possible doubt as to what it means.  Acts are drafted with the greatest possible care, and we all know that instances arise&mdash;on occasion in this House&mdash;in which it is very difficult to say what they mean.  However, in 99 cases out of 100 one can say what the proper legal interpretation is.  The whole object of having a scheme considered by the Minister is to secure such clarity and precision as will remove any doubt from the minds of the people who read it and who organise the lives and form plans for their children accordingly.</P>
      <P>Turn to Section 9&mdash;the section which I seek to delete.  What does it say? It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every question or dispute which shall arise in relation to the interpretation or construction of a scheme under this Act shall be determined by the Minister whose decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That assumes, and assumes, I think, correctly, that questions and disputes will, probably, arise in relation to the interpretation and construction of these complicated schemes and the person who is given the task of saying what the scheme means is the very person who has drafted it and made himself responsible for it.  In other words, having failed so to draft a scheme so as to avoid ambiguity and subjects of dispute, he is then given the task, when such an ambiguity has clearly arisen, of saying what it means. The very fact that an ambiguity or dispute has arisen shows that he must have failed in his duty to draft it so clearly and precisely as to avoid such a dispute.  It is, of course, inevitable that he will give a construction to it which represents what he meant to do and not what he has represented to those who were intended to be benefited <Col N="1398" /> by it.  It is a maxim that the person who has drafted any instrument is the person least capable of construing it. No lawyer will ever construe his own draft.  Although occasionally, a judge has to construe an Act with which he may have had something to do as Attorney-General, it is proverbial that the decisions of a judge who is trying to interpret his own work are exceedingly untrustworthy and have usually to be corrected by a higher tribunal. The reason for that is obvious.  I am not suggesting, and never will suggest, that it is a matter of any kind of dishonesty or <i>mala fides</i>, but the very brain which, perhaps, through some small blind spot or through some mental kink, has failed to convey itself in a way which is perfectly clear and obvious and which has raised this question of difficulty and ambiguity, when it comes to interpret it is bound to interpret it, not in the correct way but in a way to represent what its personal intentions were&mdash;not the intentions as expressed in the wording and as conveyed by advertisement to those people intended to benefit by it.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that whereas we can see the mental defects and the curious mental combinations of those around us, every person, including Ministers, imagines that he is free from any such human frailty.  Every mind has its defects, and these defects are only shown up when they are subjected to analysis by outside persons.  If a person who has drafted a thing and drafted it erroneously attempts to construe it he will merely repeat the mistakes he has already made.  In this measure we must pay attention not merely to the transmitting end of the communication but to the receiving end.  We must not in our anxiety spare Ministers from the analysis in the courts of law of their mistakes, or forget that those to whom their words have been conveyed in the provisions of the Act have got a right to see whether the interpretation that they have put on them is not the correct one.  They have their rights also and the effect of this section is to prevent a person who has given a correct interpretation of the language from having that declared in his favour by <Col N="1399" /> the court, and from having given to him those rights which it was declared he had, and on which he based his plans.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered the person responsible for the wording is the Minister.  If there is any ambiguity the person responsible is the person who should suffer.  If the Minister has failed to convey his meaning clearly, and the words which he has written convey something other than he intended, it is not the person who has read them, and read them correctly, should suffer, but the Minister who is responsible for drafting them erroneously. The least recipients or intended recipients of the benefit can expect is that they should, if necessary, be entitled to resort to an entirely independent tribunal which will analyse these words upon the well-known principles of language, and the canons of law, and that they should not be subjected to a second mistake at the hands of the person who made the first one.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of importance.  I know the House will probably feel, as was indeed suggested yesterday, that this might involve time or expense.  I do not think it will involve either.  In many cases where a question arises and is referred to the Minister&mdash;and that can be done if this section is struck out&mdash;the Minister would give his interpretation which would not necessarily be wrong, and it would be accepted by both sides.  I think that in at least 75 per cent. of the cases if the Minister intimated that the intention of the scheme was such and such a thing, it would be accepted by both sides.  What I object to in this section is that even where the Minister has gone palpably wrong, though not consciously wrong, there is no power that the people to whom the promise has been made, and to whom the offer has been given&mdash;and which they accepted by modifying their plans&mdash;should be allowed to go to the courts and say: &ldquo;The scheme clearly means so and so; it was offered in such a way and accepted as such.  Now <Col N="1400" /> we are told by the Minister that he is going to put a different construction on it, and there is no power for us to go to that tribunal to which, by the Constitution, the power of interpreting legal matters is entrusted.&rdquo;  That is the sum total of my objection.  I do not want you to consider this is a lawyer's objection.  It is a real objection. It will apply now to this Bill and to other Bills.  I ask you to accept so much from me as a lawyer&mdash;that the man who has drafted a thing is the person least capable of construing it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I would like to refer to by way of illustration. It may be suggested that no unreasonable claim would be put forward by the Minister or the Department.  I did refer shortly yesterday to two cases.  I chose merely cases in which I was personally concerned in the last two years.  I selected only those which are published in the Official Reports, so that anything I say can be checked.  Of course, they represent a mere fraction of the extravagant claims which are made by the Department, because I imagine not more than one-tenth of the people who have extravagant claims made against them have either the energy, the interest, the money or the facilities to resist the claims of the Department.  I gave these two claims as being representative examples of the kind of thing that is happening every day.  I give them a little bit more fully than I did yesterday.  If any Senator is anxious to know the exact references, in the Official Reports, I will give it now or subsequently.  The first case was a tillage Order.  It was provided that a certain proportion of each person's land should be cultivated in a certain year, and the tillage Order went on to say that the word &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo; as used in this Order shall mean &ldquo;till&rdquo;. Now that is a fairly clear provision. A farmer anxious to take up his crop of meadow determined that he would cultivate or till in September in order to prepare the ground for winter wheat.  I should say that the word &ldquo;cultivate&rdquo; was defined as &ldquo;till and put in seed&rdquo;.  He intended, having taken the crop of meadow, to break up <Col N="1401" /> the land and put in winter wheat.  In the month of August he was prosecuted because he had not cultivated the requisite proportion of land in the year 1940.  He replied: &ldquo;There are still four months of the year 1940 to go, and I have the fullest intention of cultivating my land, tilling it and putting in seed.&rdquo;  Despite that perfectly reasonable answer, based on the wording of the Order, he was prosecuted under the Emergency Powers Acts. Pressure was brought to bear.  When I say pressure was brought I mean the case was put forward that he should be fined some incredible amount of money.  It was necessary to take the case to the High Court.  It was pointed out, in the words of the judge, that this Order was either framed by a lawyer who knew nothing about agriculture or a farmer who knew nothing about the law.  It was pointed out that if the framers of the Order chose to use words which did not represent their intention or were ambiguous, it was not the people who read these Orders and gave them their proper meaning who should be penalised, but the people who failed, either through negligence or incapacity, to convey their meaning in plain English.</P>
    <P>The second case was the case of a Fuel Order.  It laid down that the retail price of turf was to be so much a ton, and proportionately for smaller quantities.  All the turf was sold by Fuel Importers Limited.  The fuel merchants were not in a position to get turf except from Fuel Importers Limited, which I think I may describe as a quasi-Government company if that term will not be misunderstood. It was one of those companies which the Government has properly thought fit to promote in dealing with the emergency.  Fuel Importers Limited said to the merchants of Greystones: &ldquo;We will charge you 5/- more for the delivery of turf at Greystones than we do at Dublin.&rdquo;  The result of that was that if the fuel merchants of Greystones were to sell and deliver the turf at the price laid down in the Order they would lose a matter of 1/- or something more for each ton.  What the Order provided was this, merely that the <Col N="1402" /> retail price of turf was to be so much a ton.  Accordingly the fuel merchants of Greystones sold their turf at that price or actually a little below it, exyard, for anybody who would go and get it, and if the customer required them to undertake carriage they charged a matter of 4d. per bag with a little variation I think for distance. Again the Department came in and said: &ldquo;You were to charge so much per ton.  We did not mean that as price at all.  We meant that to be the price plus the cost of delivery. You must not only sell but deliver, and deliver at any distance turf at the price which we have laid down as being the price of turf.&rdquo;  There again it was necessary to bring the case to the High Court and, of course, the High Court said: &ldquo;The Department may have intended that, though it seems unreasonable that they should have intended that, but they did not say it, and when a Department says the price retail of turf is so much per ton it is bound by what it says, and the price of turf does not mean the price of turf plus the cost of delivery.&rdquo;  I give these two examples of the way in which Government Orders are interpreted by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen in this case? Are we going to assume that the Department of Education will be entirely free from any of those little blemishes which can occasionally be discerned in other Departments?  If the Minister has approved of a scheme which clearly means one thing, when doubt or difficulty subsequently arises, and when it is obvious that it is either ambiguous or properly bears a construction other than that intended, are we to assume that he will not, either from natural inclination of men's minds or pressure of business, give to it a construction which is most in harmony with his desires?  Let him do it, but give some power to the people to appeal against any such unconscious mental obliquity.  I ask you to take this section out as a whole because it is an intellectual iniquity that a person who has drafted or adopted the drafting of a section which turns out to be ambiguous, should then be allowed to <Col N="1403" /> declare that it has an interpretation which he desires it to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the House last night that in the schemes as followed for the past 21 years the Minister for Education has had authority to sanction schemes.  I referred also to the question of administrative convenience, and the fact that my sole purpose in bringing forward this legislation is to facilitate councils and the public generally and as far as possible to see that anomalies are removed from schemes, that they are duly published and that their operation gives as little occasion as possible for disputes or conflict arises.  The schemes come from 31 councils and corporations and are examined very carefully in each case by the officers of the Department. Experience has shown that there is considerable alteration and amendment of the schemes even from year to year. As experience shows it to be necessary councils introduce these amendments. The object of the revision&mdash;if I may use the term&mdash;of the schemes by the Department is to see that the terms of the schemes are made as clear and as unambiguous as possible.  We are thinking of the public and of those interested in the scheme.  I think that there should be an authority in this matter.</P>
      <P>If Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment was accepted, even the authority needed from a legal point of view for the Minister to revise and look into these schemes, might be questioned.  A situation might arise where, in fact, the Minister found that he had no power to bring about some change which he considered necessary.  The Senator, of course, is approaching this matter from the point of view of the lawyer, and is as anxious as I am to preserve the rights of the parents. Surely if parents feel that they are in a position to do so and think it worth while, they will resort to the courts, even if Section 9 becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at present is that I get letters regularly from parents who say <Col N="1404" /> they feel that their children have been wrongfully deprived by councils either of a scholarship or of the right to enter for a scholarship.  I take it that if Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment is accepted, the only remedy I can offer to such parents in future would be to advise them to go to the courts.  I feel that the vast majority of these parents will not be in a position to go to the courts and, if we are to carry the thing to its logical conclusion, it will mean that in respect of all these small points that arise&mdash;not necessarily as a result of a dispute between a parent and a local authority upon which I submit I might be regarded as an honest broker, but the question of what exactly is the meaning of the particular terms in the scheme as submitted by the council&mdash; authority would be taken away from the Minister for Education to say what the intention was.</P>
    <P>The Senator has laid great stress on the fact that the Minister drafting a scheme, perhaps, would come in later to sit in judgment and presumably to declare in favour of himself, but at present the drafting is done by the council.  It is true that the Department of Education asks councils to make matters more clear so that the public generally may not be under any misapprehension as to the meaning of the conditions.  The Senator may no doubt claim that even in suggesting certain changes for example in the wording the Minister is thereby drafting a scheme but the alternative seems to me to be, in fact, that there would be no authority except the courts to which councils could apply in case they themselves be in a reasonable doubt.  For example there may be two different opinions expressed at a scholarships committee when the results are declared as to whether a particular child should be awarded a scholarship or not.  If there was any legal question, and if the matter was submitted to me, I would of course submit it to the legal advisers to the Government.  They may not be infallible, but I can assure the House that if there was any legal question involved I would have at least the benefit of their advice on the matter. <Col N="1405" /> The type of question that might arise is, let us say, as to whether, in fact, a parent is resident in an area.  I think I may make a frank admission and say that my Department felt a doubt as to whether they would be in order in trying to force upon councils the view that a person who was resident in an area on the actual qualifying date was in fact <i>bona fide</i>, or ordinarily, resident.  I am advised that the legal position is that such people are ordinarily resident or as we have it in the Bill <i>bona fide</i> resident. I do not think it should be necessary to determine the question whether a person was living in a particular area on a particular date.  If a resident appeals to me I do not think it need necessarily be a matter that need go to the courts, although I can see that it may be a very important question and that the parents might like to go to the courts.  I should not care to interfere with the rights of parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take out the section you will not only be depriving the Minister of the right to adjudicate in that particular case, but in any case in which there are grounds of dispute or a difference of opinion.  You will be equally taking away from him the right to give a decision.  For example, in a good many schemes there is the question of the determination of what is a small school.  Some bodies reserve a number of scholarships for children from small schools, and my officers' sole purpose would be to see that whatever terms in the scheme were applying to that particular matter would be carried out.  I can see that persons who believe the courts are the only solution, that we ought even encourage people to go to the courts, would think that a matter of that kind could only properly be determined by the courts.  But there is also the question of the means of the parent.  I must frankly confess that I do not recollect a case of that kind coming up. I think that the House ought to give the Minister the opportunity, by means of the method which he has been <Col N="1406" /> operating for the last 20 years, of trying to get councils to be reasonable in these matters.  Senator Kingsmill Moore referred to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Supplies and to particular Orders which they made and the interpretation of these Orders.  These Ministers, I suggest, in fulfilment of the policies which they were carrying out, were compelling people to do certain things. I suggest I am seeking to compel people to do nothing comparable to what other Ministers have been seeking to do in their respective spheres under emergency legislation.  The most, I can truthfully say, that I am trying to do in the present Bill is to see that when councils publish certain terms for their schemes they adhere as far as possible to these terms.  You must, therefore, either have confidence in the Minister for Education having sufficient knowledge of his experience over the past twenty years to be willing to give him this power, or prefer to take the strictly legal attitude that Senator Kingsmill Moore has adopted.  The only interest of the Minister is to put schemes into operation.  If there is the question of the Minister giving final judgment it does not necessarily mean that he may be called upon to take any stringent action.  The idea is to avoid long delays which may hold up schemes completely.  I suggest that the analogy of the Department of Supplies and the Department of Agriculture does not hold.  We are not claiming certain things.  We have no direct interest in this matter, but when there has been any legal question as to the actual meaning of conditions, we have always referred the matter to the legal advisers of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard Senator Kingsmill Moore and the Minister, I feel bound to say that the Minister has the better of the argument.  I feel that my friend Senator Kingsmill Moore has misled himself by this analogy with the Department of Supplies and the Department of Agriculture. They are operating under emergency Orders made by themselves, interpreting those Orders themselves, apparently in some cases interpreting them, if the Senator's facts are well <Col N="1407" /> founded, in an entirely unreasonable way in their own favour.  I think the Minister is quite right in saying that in the present instance there is no analogy to that situation.  I gathered from him that the schemes are made by the council and that he is the natural arbiter in the case of dispute. I think it is quite right that the Minister for Education should have that power.  Similarly in regard to disputes about <i>bona fide</i> residence, it seems to me that there can be no arbiter but the Minister.  Unless I am very much mistaken, Senator Kingsmill Moore has not established a case for his amendment and I think this would be an appropriate time for him to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If my amendment had been either answered or understood and those remarks had been made, I would have been delighted to withdraw it, but the Minister has suggested that I desired to interfere in some unseemly way with his administrative powers.  He started off by saying that it was necessary to have a co-ordinating authority under these schemes.  If there is anybody in the House more violently in agreement with the Minister than I on that point, I should like to know who he is.  I agree that he must have such powers if a scheme comes before him for the purpose of being co-ordinated or being amended.  In so far as the Minister suggests that my amendment would interfere with his administrative powers to ensure uniformity in schemes, I can assure him that it does not, nor does it interfere with any authority he may have to decide questions of fact as to whether a person is or is not resident in a certain locality.  May I again call the attention of Senator O'Sullivan, and the House in general, to the effect of the section?  This section does not say that every question or dispute which shall arise in connection with a scheme or the qualification of certain persons shall be decided by the Minister. It says only that the Minister is to be the complete and unappealable judge on questions of interpretation or construction of the scheme.  This merely makes the Minister the judge <Col N="1408" /> of what the words mean.  It has nothing to do with administration whatever and the Minister's speech was devoted to answering a case which was not made and which would not have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested further that if this scheme became law the people could still resort to the courts.  That is not so.  The effect of this section, which, as I say, is confined to allowing the Minister to interpret or ministerpret words, is that the Minister's decision is final and conclusive.  That means that no matter how much the Minister goes wrong he can never be put right.  If the Minister chooses to say that words which mean black are in fact the most remarkable illustration of the qualities of white, you cannot put him right because his decision is final and conclusive.  I do with respect say that if Senator O'Sullivan had realised that this section is confined to allowing the Minister to put a legal interpretation on words for which he has himself been responsible and has approved, even though he might not have drafted them with his own pen the Senator would not have opposed the amendment.  It is a limited section giving the Minister legal powers of construction.  Matters of construction, as far as I know, have always been regarded as the exclusive prerogative of the courts.  If you desire that the Minister, having made a mistake, should be in a position to perpetuate that mistake, then you will vote against the amendment, but if you realise that this section gives the Minister no additional administrative power and does not convey to him any ability to harmonise schemes over and above what has been given to him in the earlier parts of the Bill, if you once realise that it seeks to put him in the position of a judge who can declare his earlier mistake to have been no mistake, no matter how palpable it may be, then I think you should support this amendment.  The Minister can still give his opinions and his opinions will be followed in the vast majority of cases, where they are right, or where they have even a specious appearance of right, but where they may be wrong&mdash;and as we are reminded <Col N="1409" /> in the song, even the very good go wrong&mdash;there will be power to control what may be an unintentional but nevertheless a possibly calamitous misinterpretation. Accordingly, I ask the House to vote for the deletion of this section.  Its deletion is going to do no harm, and it will avoid the possibility of great harm being done.</P>

      <P>I should like to get this matter cleared up.  I can assure Senator Kingsmill Moore that I am at least as jealous of the ordinary rights of the public and as opposed to the encroachment of Ministerial and bureaucratic authority as he is, but I understood from the Minister that these schemes are in fact prepared by the council, though apparently they are approved by the Minister.</P>

      <P>They are approved by the Minister.  Then, as often happens, some dispute arises over a document.  Whom will this dispute hurt?  Again, I gather from the Minister that the disputant in all probability will be some aggrieved father who does not receive what he feels to be his due rights under the scheme.  As the person, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, is not a person who is well off and cannot afford money to go to law, or even if he has money to go to law, I feel that the fact that the Minister is the arbiter on a scheme on which he has ruled but has not actually drafted, is perfectly defensible. I do not think that this represents any increase of Governmental authority at all.  If I can be shown how it is, then I may change my mind, but I understood from the Minister that this system has been in force for upwards of 20 years.  It seems to me to be perfectly sound.  In most local matters, the only arbiter in cases of dispute is the head of the appropriate Government Department.  Further, there is no analogy at all between schemes of this type and those hateful Emergency Orders which are so often promulgated and so often misinterpreted by their promulgators.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words on this amendment and I trust <Col N="1410" /> that the good sense of the House will lead to its defeat.  I have always a certain reluctance in going to law.  I remember when I was at school a long time ago reading a story of the two cats who went to law with a monkey about some cheese question.  I feel that Senator Kingsmill Moore was making his case not so much from the point of view of a Senator of this House as a lawyer.  I feel that the last place to go to settle a dispute is to the law court.  My view of this section is this: if a dispute arises, obviously it must be between the county council and the claimant of a scholarship.  I prefer that the Minister would be there to adjudicate, because in 99 out of every 100 cases the aggrieved person will be a claimant for a scholarship.  Personally I prefer to see the Minister adjudicating because he would approach the matter in a sympathetic way.  It is generally agreed that the people who benefit by these scholarships are the poorer element in the community.  Can anyone visualise a person claiming a scholarship suing a county council or corporation to court to maintain his rights?  I believe Senators in voting against this motion will be helping people who want to make a case against a corporation or county council because they have been unfairly treated.</P>
