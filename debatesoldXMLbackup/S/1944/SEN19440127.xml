      <P>I desire to thank the Minister for submitting this amendment to cover the point which Senator Foran and I had in mind when we put down amendment No. 2.  I congratulate the Minister on doing so.  His action is a valuable recognition of the work of the Charlemont Utility Society to which the amendment refers, whose members receive no pecuniary or material benefit of any kind from their endeavours to provide houses for certain classes of people.  I also desire to thank Senator Mrs. Concannon for her co-operation and the Minister for making retrospective the operations of Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I got an undertaking from the Minister yesterday that he would consider a point I raised and deal with it to-day, namely, whether he could provide that, in case of a dispute on Section 5 (1) (b), the county committee would have an opportunity of asking for an inquiry. I want also to refer at this stage to a general question.  I am sorry the Minister is not available because I was going to congratulate him on his magnificent achievement in this House yesterday.  Whether that achievement was due to the apparent conciliatory nature of his terms or whether it was due to what I might describe as his sweet and reasonable method of dealing with the Opposition I do not know but he achieved something in this House yesterday which was very much greater than what he succeeded in achieving in the other House.  When this Bill came up for discussion in the Dáil Senators will see, if they refer to the Debates, Volume 92, No. 2, that Alderman Corish, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, was extremely definite that the powers contained in the Bill, particularly in Section 5, which is perhaps the whole embodiment of the principle of the Bill, were such as should not be asked <Col N="671" /> for by a Minister, I find that Alderman Corish described the Bill as one &ldquo;which has been shown to be absolutely autocratic in its tendency&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Above all committees, I think this is the one committee which should not be interfered with by the Minister....  Consequently I cannot see the necessity for a section of this kind.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only reason I raise the matter on this stage is to congratulate the Minister for having achieved with two Labour Parties in this House what he was unable to achieve with one in the other House, because in the Dáil nine members of the Labour Party voted against the section but I think Senators on the benches on my right voted yesterday in favour of the section.  It would be as well if this House took note of the inconsistency with which they approached the problem, and if the House would consider that inconsistency sometimes in regard to some of their other utterances.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the toleration of the Chair in this matter. We are speaking now about a Bill which is likely to become law, but Senator Sweetman wants to identify it with political Parties.  Does the Senator not know that the Seanad is a non-political body?  I do not know if I would be in order in following the Senator's example, but I want to say that he has a long way to go before he will understand the objects and aims of Labour.  The Senator should bear in mind that this House is non-political and that we are not now dealing with Labour, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I ought to apologise to Senator Sweetman for not having mentioned this matter before the Report Stage was taken, but it is usual for a Minister to wait until a question has been raised before he addresses himself to it.  In connection with the amendment to Section 5, which the Minister for Agriculture said he might consider, all I can say is that he has considered it, and decided that it would not be possible to put down an amendment which could be effective, and which would not completely stultify the purpose of the paragraph After all, I cannot see any form of words which would get over the constitutional difficulty, that the Minister is accountable to the Dáil for the reasonableness and normality of his actions.  If, in a matter of this sort he should act contrary to reason or in any way abnormally, the place in which he can be called to account is in the representative Assembly to which he is responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer a few considerations on the Final Stage of this Bill.  I was much impressed by the speech&mdash;I think a very remarkable speech&mdash;made by Senator Tierney on the Second Reading, and I have pondered on it a good deal since.  I take it that the main idea in Senator Tierney's mind is that much better value could be obtained for roughly the £10,000,000 spent in this country on social services.  He probably would say for £10,000,000 there need be no poverty, if the money was wisely spent.  As a general statement, of course, that makes one think, and it is difficult to disagree with it, but I think it is generally agreed that a great deal of the money spent on poverty goes to people who do not need it while others who need it do not get relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a big question and the only way I can see it can be approached is that the Government, if they are in sympathy with that approach, should appoint a commission to consider the whole question of the social services. Perhaps they might all be brought within the purview of one Minister, and it should also be the purpose of that commission, at any rate, in the first instance, to have no regard for what is being done now, but to set down a scheme as if the slate were quite clean, and, having done so, say if we had £10,000,000 we would do it in this way and make recommendations immediately, or in the long view, to accord with those schemes.  At the same time, a body of that kind could inquire into the relationship of State and voluntary charitable services.  I think close regard is due to the philosophy enunciated by Senator Tierney, and I feel <Col N="674" /> that the Government might consider approaching it on the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKeogh" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate if he can say, at this stage, how the administration of the Bill will be carried out.  The Minister may recollect that I raised a question on the Second Reading about the particular machinery that will be evolved to carry out these proposals.  We hear of investigating officers, but will the investigating officers be charged with the payment of the allowances or the existing old age pensions officers?  To the latter body, it is a matter of some import, because if they are to be burdened with these duties in addition to the many onerous tasks they discharge at present, certain questions will arise. Some of them have asked me if I can ascertain if it is proposed to ask them to administer the Act.  If that is the case, there are cognate questions of remuneration, etc., which I would like the Minister to clear up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to some extent to join in the appeal made by Senator Sir John Keane that the whole question of the social services should be carefully examined in the sense of unifying them instead of having a lot of scattered and more or less separate services.  When this Bill was going through the Dáil a remark was made that the country need not hope for any further advancement of the social services for a long time to come.  I do not remember the exact words, but that was the sense of the remark.  It meant that the Government was going to close its eyes to the need for further development of social services until the country had recovered from the expenditure of the money required by this system of children's allowances.  It seems to me that that is a hopeless position to take up.  The social services have been a scattered patchwork since the State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will not hold itself firm that no further development should take place until they had forgotten about this £1,250,000 to be spent on children's <Col N="675" /> allowances.  I would like to call attention to another point.  It was not adverted to during the discussion on the previous stages of the Bill but it is this: the effect that the institution of children's allowances is likely to have on wages.  It seems almost certain to me that this additional income coming into everybody's house will have its reaction on the tendency for wages to rise to fit themselves to changing circumstances.  Suppose a wage dispute arises and a tribunal is dealing with the matter.  The tribunal is bound to take into its mind, consciously or unconsciously, the amount of income received by the house, and to consider it in the light of the question of fixing future wage rates. That seems to me to be a very dangerous procedure, and I am very much surprised at the encouraging attitude towards the Bill adopted by certain members of this House who would generally be regarded as interested in labour questions.  It would be out of order to refer to them as Labour Senators when this is a non-political House.  If this Bill passes it seems likely to me that they might deeply regret the amount of assistance they have given to make it the law of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has referred, in terms with which many will agree, to the fundamental value of the speech which Senator Tierney has made to the House.  It would be impossible to summarise in a few minutes what Senator Tierney tries to teach us, both practical and theoretical, but it seems to me that his speech was very largely devoted to the same end as that of Senator Sir John Keane's to-day&mdash;the development of social services on logical and well-organised lines instead of on the haphazard lines of years past.  The danger was increased by the remark which, I understand, was made the other day that we need hope for no more social services.  That seems to me to be a very helpless attitude for the Government to take. Perhaps these observations would have come in more appropriately at an earlier stage of the Bill, but I was not able to attend here regularly during <Col N="676" /> the last few weeks, and I do not think we could let this measure pass the House without drawing attention to the points I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention at all of saying anything on this stage of the Bill, but in view of the fact that Senators have referred in such kind terms to the remarks I made on the Second Reading, I feel bound to say one or two words.  I refrained altogether from trying to amend this Bill on the Committee Stage, for the reason that I did not see that any amendment of the Bill, that would be of any value, was possible inside the rather admirably rigid framework that the Bill provided.  Once the principle of the Bill was accepted, to my mind, we were committed to practically everything it contained.  I should like to say that I have seldom seen an example of a Parliamentary measure being so carefully and cleverly articulated together as this Bill is, or so difficult to amend or alter in almost the smallest particular.  It reminds one of those latest types of battleships which are so constructed that, no matter where a bomb or a shell hits, it bounces off.  This Bill is something of that kind, but in spite of my admiration for the skill displayed in the draftsmanship of the Bill, I still regard it as a bad Bill, and one that is calculated to do very little good and which may do a great deal of harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as my remarks on the Second Stage are concerned, I was agreeably surprised to find, without my having had consultation with anybody, what a large volume of support my views received, both by way of correspondence and otherwise, from members of the outside public, some of whom were in a position to speak very authoritatively, especially about the moral aspects of this Bill and what I referred to on the Second Stage as its relation to Catholic and Christian sociology.  I should like to repeat what I said then in regard to that matter.  A Bill of this kind does not fulfil the requirements of the Christian ideal.  It falls short of it in very many ways, and it ought to be repeated and borne in mind that, according to the most <Col N="677" /> authoritative teachers, the Christian social ideal is not family allowances of this kind, paid by the State, but a family wage; that the real crux of the problem is the living wage paid to the wage-earner, who is entitled to receive such a wage as will enable him to support a family in reasonable comfort. Anything that falls short of that falls short of the ideal, and anything that is done to make up for the defects in the present wage system, falling short of that ideal, is to that extent by no means perfect, and is to that extent nothing but a palliative which, while it may perhaps do a certain amount of good in tiding over a difficult situation for a short period, is likely in the long run, if it follows on imperfect lines, to do more harm than good. Accordingly, I am afraid that I must continue to regard the whole notion of handing out these allowances from the State indiscriminately to all citizens, whether they are in need of them or not, as a dangerous notion and one that is likely to lead, in practice, to a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading&mdash; and the Minister himself indicated as much&mdash;this is far from being likely to be the last Bill of this kind.  In spite of what Senator Rowlette said, I am quite convinced that in a few years you will have pressure put on the Government&mdash;whatever Government it may be&mdash;at any rate, to increase these allowances, and that whatever else may happen, the bill for these social services is certain to go on increasing, and I cannot contemplate any increase in services of that kind without feelings of the most profound alarm, because what this Bill is doing is taking money out of the pockets of people who are already poor and distributing it among people who, in many cases, are no worse off than the people from whom the money is being taken.</P>
    <P>This Bill is certain to have two sides to it.  It will do a certain amount of good to what I believe is a small number of people, and it will inflict considerable hardship and injustice on a larger number of people who are at least as badly off as those people whom the Bill is designed to help. <Col N="678" /> That is an aspect that we should not forget.  I am not talking now of income-tax payers or the better-off citizens.  The taxation that will be necessary to carry out the purpose of this Bill will fall heavily, and most heavily, on the poorer classes of the community, and to contemplate calmly an extension of a service like this, and the raising of more millions of money in this particular way by the State, is to me something that we ought not to allow ourselves to indulge in.  For that reason I should like to wind up by agreeing with what Senator Sir John Keane has just said: that if we want to avoid a further rather casual and unsystematic expansion of this kind, of what to me at any rate is undoubtedly wasteful expenditure, we ought to have in the shortest possible time a complete and far-reaching inquiry into all these social services.</P>
    <P>I am very far from denying or trying to deny that there is an enormous problem of poverty in this country and that a great deal needs to be done to alleviate it, but I am questioning whether this or any similar machinery is going to do anything real at all to alleviate that problem, or whether, once this machinery has been set up and put into operation, we will not find, after a few years, that we still have the problem at least as bad as ever it was and, in some degree, perhaps, aggravated by this very machinery.  If we want to avoid that, and to avoid going into a quagmire of unnecessary expenditure and increasing poverty, we ought to take steps to have a clear and complete inquiry into all our machinery for alleviating distress and putting an end to poverty, and we ought to try to find some means by which we can calculate the extent of remediable poverty in the country, and some means by which we can apply redress to that poverty.  It ought not to be beyond the capacity of any legislature to deal with a problem like that if the proper means are taken, and the proper means, to my mind, consist in a full and most painstaking and complete inquiry into the conditions that exist.  Until we have that we will get no further at all with the problem, and we will not be able <Col N="679" /> to prevent a further extension of the damage that Bills like this, to my mind, are quite certain to do to the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the feeling that it is questionable whether we should be proud of passing a measure like this, or whether we should be in the frame of mind which Senator Tierney indicates to the House that he is in about this measure.  I really do not know whether it is something that we ought to boast about or not, because if we regard our social services as being at a high level, I know that it seems to be a popular thing to acclaim what has been done by way of the improvement of social services.  This measure, I think, despite what Senator Tierney has said, will be regarded as an improvement from the point of view of the social conditions of a considerable number of people in this country, but while saying that I am rather inclined to agree with Senator Tierney's view to this extent: that it looks like beginning rather in the middle of things: that the introduction and passing of such a measure as this would seem to be starting off in the middle of things rather than starting down at the foundations.  I am convinced absolutely that the right line of approach to an improvement of social conditions for all our people is to seek out a plan by which we would be enabled to give full employment to the people who are able to work, and when we would achieve that much we would, to a considerable degree, measure the sort of social problem left for us to solve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator interrupts to say there would not be any. I think there would.  I am not inclined to agree with Senator Tierney when he suggests to the House that, having found a condition of full employment for all, there would not, even then, be a necessity for a scheme of family allowances.  In my opinion there would, because I cannot see how you are going to have conditions in which, for instance, you <Col N="680" /> would have two agricultural labourers, one an unmarried man and a good worker and the other a married man with eight children, and not such a good worker, and you could meet them both adequately in the matter of wages.  How am I going to be expected to pay the married man a wage which will equate his expenditure on the upkeep of his family?  It cannot be done.  In equity and justice I must pay, and would be expected to pay, in relation to the sort of service I get from these people, and there is not, I think, an obligation on me to pay the father of the eight children a larger sum because of that fact.  There is a social problem there.</P>
      <P>I think that there is a fault there in Senator Tierney's argument.  I am in agreement with those who suggest that an improvement in the whole social standing of the people can only be brought about by starting where we ought to start.  In the first place it is a matter of regret that we have not more information before us from the Minister&mdash;the kind of information on which he based his decisions.  We have done nothing in this country the equivalent to what has been done in Britain by Mr. Rowntree.  If we had any data like that, which would be an example to us of the costs involved, the incomes and the salaries, and the allowances in respect of rural and urban centres, we would have the sort of data which is necessary to enable us to determine the degree to which even this measure is going to alleviate the poverty and hardship that we know exist at the moment.  But we have nothing like that.  I think, myself, that we should all make up our minds that to just go on boasting about our social services is not good enough.  There are various ways of improving social conditions, and I am in agreement with Senator Tierney in the view that you may not be actually improving the social conditions of the people by taking a certain proportion of some people's incomes and distributing it among others, when there are possibilities that, by a better planned economy, we could raise the income level of all the people in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> There are a good many people in this country, and I am one of them, who are convinced that it is possible for us to do that.  I think if we started in that way we would be getting down to the root of things.  If there is to be an investigation at all&mdash;Senators Sir John Keane and Rowlette have expressed the view that the whole problem of social services should be studied with a view to seeing how they could be better co-ordinated&mdash;the first question to which we should try to find an answer is what are the possibilities of finding full employment for all the people able to work.  If there are people able to work but not willing to work they have got to be dealt with, and the sooner we face that the better. Because these people are a real social problem and a real social menace, and they are trying to live on the income of other people, and quite a number of them are managing to do it very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot ignore the fact that this Bill which we are passing is only the beginning, and there is no use any Minister saying that we are not going to have any additions to social services for a long time because we are going to spend so much on family allowances.  I wish we did not have to have additions.  I wish we could set about ensuring that all our people would be earning a living wage, and that into their own homes from their own industry would come sufficient to provide the necessaries of <Col N="682" /> life for themselves and their families up to a reasonably decent standard of comfort.  That ought to be our aim, because it is only then that we are going to be able to cut down the necessity for, or even the extension of social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undoubtedly a matter for regret that we are going to impose such a drain as this on the normal incomes of the people at a time when these incomes are actually contracting.  That is one of the real problems which the Ministry are going to be faced with. The total income of all our people&mdash; there may be a degree of inflation be cause we are getting a certain amount of income from people who are earning outside the country and who are not producing physical goods inside of it&mdash; is not being increased in the quality of goods produced and available for redistribution. In fact, that amount of goods is falling.  It may be that the money value of them is rising, but that is an unsatisfactory condition of things. The truth is that the real income of the State is not increasing, and from that lower quantity of goods, which in fact ought not be increased in value, you are going now to take this considerable addition to the national expenditure and re-distribute it over the people.  I agree that in the circumstances of the time that seems to be imperative.  I think that even Senator Tierney will agree that the problem of living is such a grave one for many citizens that something had to be done.  There is general unanimity that this measure is an approach to the solution of the problem.  I agree that it would be better to increase the incomes, by some means, of the people whose incomes are at present too low and that this measure ought to apply only to the people who require an increase in their incomes to give them a standard of living that will keep them in full health.  These allowances are to be given to all, and they are to be given to all without those who receive them making any contribution on their own. I think it would be sounder economy and psychologically would give better results if the people who are to draw these incomes from the State were expected to make some contribution <Col N="683" /> towards the pool from which these incomes will be drawn, because I agree with the point of view that if we continue taking from the State and expecting to get everything from the State, the State must become the all-powerful concept in the lives of our people, and we have built that up perhaps to a degree which is not desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown a good deal of ability in drafting his measure, in piloting it through the House, and in explaining his point of view, but I think he ought to go much further. We are only scratching the surface with this measure and leaving the great problem of a better living for all our people still unsolved, and, I am afraid, not even tackled.  Things will not be better until we can sit down, not to make an inquiry as to how better we can co-ordinate our social services and cut down the costs of administration, but to make an inquiry which will point the way to a planned economy and to the carrying out of a policy which will provide full employment for our people at productive labour within the country. You will then raise the incomes of all our people and to the extent that you may have to extend social services on the other side, you will have such an increase of income as will enable you to do so, if it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I think this is starting things in the middle.  Nevertheless, the circumstances of the times are such as to demand that some action like this be taken.  The Minister regards it as the only way, but there are other points of view.  Generally, the acceptance of the measure throughout the country is such that one can scarcely feel that it does not represent public opinion and does not satisfy the public demand; but while this House may put it through by a practically unanimous vote, I think it is of importance that it should be recognised that, as Senator Tierney says, there are dangers in the propagation of the policy which this measure embodies, and that we should all recognise that it is not by any means the final solution of the difficulties which confront <Col N="684" /> us in regard to finding a better living, especially for people on the lower income levels whose position can only be improved when we are able to find them productive employment which will enable their earnings to give to their families the standard of living which decent men ought to be able to enjoy in their own country.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, Senator Kehoe, I was somewhat perturbed as to the administration of the measure, and as to whether it would be better to have it more localised or centralised.  I put down amendments dealing with these points, but, after the Minister's explanation, I agree that he has made a very good case for his view that centralised administration for a start at least would be most effective.  I think that when the Bill is working smoothly, it will have a very good effect on the poorer classes. Reference was made to Senator Tierney's speech on the Second Reading with which most of us, I think, could agree to a great extent.  He remarked, incidentally, that there were people in the House, and probably outside, speaking about poverty who knew nothing about poverty, and he gave as an example his own experience.  He said that he and the other members of his family had been raised on a ten-acre holding and that they really knew what poverty was.  I had the experience of being raised in a very poor part of the country.</P>

      <P>But reference has been made to Senator Tierney's speech. However, I can close the matter by saying that there is no poverty known in the poorest part of the country comparable with that which may be seen in the slum parts of towns and cities. It has also been suggested that certain sections, the poorer sections in particular, are not quite prepared to help themselves to the extent they might and that they are always making demands on the Government; but that is not entirely confined to the <Col N="685" /> poorer classes.  We find it amongst every section.  We find it amongst the wealthier classes.  We find it amongst that section which is bursting the walls of the banks with money.  If that money were more evenly distributed amongst those who earn it and who work for it, there would be very little necessity for Bills of this kind.  There is not a day that one looks at the paper that one does not see demands for increases in prices, subsidies, and all that sort of thing.  The only point I want to make in that connection is that the poorer sections have no monopoly in the matter of demands on the Government.  The demands come equally from every other section.  I think the Bill has the imprimatur of the general bulk of the people.  It has been well received and I hope it will have the good effects which we all hope it will have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amazed to hear the views given utterance to in connection with this Bill, particularly by Senator Tierney.  In one breath, Senator Tierney tells us that the principle of the thing is bad, that it was simply taking from one section and giving to another, and, in the next, he deplored the making of the statement that social services would not be further extended for a long period to come.  So far as this measure is concerned, I personally feel that if there were any politicians in this non-political House with the courage to go out on the hustings and denounce it, they would get their answer from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed by every class.  We are told that it is not the ideal Catholic solution.  We agree; none of us has suggested that children's allowances represent the ideal Catholic solution, or conform to the principles enunciated by Pope Leo XIII in his Encyclical.  The ideal solution is to give the father of the family a sufficiency to keep him and his family in frugal comfort and to enable him to put by something to maintain him in old age and infirmity.  We are not suggesting that this is an alternative to Pope Leo's dictum as far as the family and a family wage are concerned but until the ideal of the home as envisaged <Col N="686" /> by Pope Leo XIII comes to be realised I suggest that it is not fair to criticise this measure and by innuendo or otherwise to suggest that it is not in conformity&mdash;I take that word from Senator Tierney's speech&mdash;with Catholic social teaching.</P>
    <P>I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, I believe the Minister and the Government have done a very good day's work.  If the people who stand up here and smugly talk about being reared on a ten-acre farm would come along with me through the slums of the City of Dublin, they would appreciate what poverty means to thousands of families in the City of Dublin.  I have always maintained, though I believe some people will disagree with me, that poverty is not known outside the city, that the poverty that we find in the city is not to be found in the rural areas.  People may be poor in the rural areas; probably they are but they are never as poor as one finds some people in the cities.  If these people who talk about being reared on ten-acre farms would come with me through the slums of Dublin they would see in every step they take justification for this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of this measure and, if it were necessary to divide on it, I would certainly vote in favour of it.  I do not, however, approve of the method of its origination and its introduction because I do feel that this Bill, which represents the general wishes of the people as a whole and cannot be regarded as a political measure, should have been introduced, not as a Minister's Bill or as a Civil Service Bill but as the result of an inquiry or a commission before which all expert and interested parties could give evidence and on which all expert and interested parties could be represented. I have read with great interest the debates in the Dáil and the Minister's answers and I would again like to pay tribute to the arguments he put forward, but how much more convincing would these arguments have been if they had been adduced to a tribunal trying to find out the best method and the best shape into which to put a Bill <Col N="687" /> of this nature rather than in defence of the Bill already introduced by the Minister, almost every point of which he felt bound to stand over, both because it was his Bill and also in honourable defence of his staff who had taken part in drafting it.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe, and have never subscribed, to the rather thoughtless and somewhat humorous criticisms which are passed on the Civil Service. It is said by a lot of people, half in jest, that civil servants are under-worked, overpaid and incompetent.  I entirely disagree from that.  I believe they are underpaid, that they are overworked, and that they are competent but, having said that, I do not accept the proposition that the Civil Service contains within its own circle all the wisdom of humanity or that a Bill of this nature dealing with a most complicated and interlocking subject, a Bill which is to serve as one of the lynchpins of our social system&mdash;I do not accept the proposition that the last word on a Bill such as that can be expected from, or that the ultimate truth can be discovered by, either Ministers or the Civil Service because it is perfectly true that every profession and every occupation tends to develop a mind of its own and to look at different things from a particular point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also familiar with the jokes one hears about the lawyer's mind and the lawyer's point of view.  I gather that jokes of that nature find sympathy amongst a great number of my colleagues in this House.  I am glad of that because it serves to emphasise my point.  There is also the Civil Service mind.  In fact, one might say that every single profession or occupation suffers from what I might call occupational myopia.  They are short-sighted along their own particular lines.  My reason for addressing the House at the present moment is that I think this Bill has suffered and the plan has suffered, because there was not put into its framing the experience of all classes, because evidence was not taken by a commission, because it was not separately <Col N="688" /> investigated by economists, by trades union leaders, by representatives even of capital, and of all the interests which must be affected by a Bill such as this.  I appeal to the Minister not to introduce a Bill such as this in future without having it independently examined by people without any bias, people with expert knowledge.  I appeal further to the Minister to consider whether all the social services which have grown up in the most haphazard manner&mdash;administered, some of them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, some of them by the Minister for Agriculture, some of them through the Post Office, a great many through the Local Government Department&mdash;could not be simplified and unified under one Minister.  Historically, they have grown up in the same way that you stop holes in a leaky boat&mdash;where the water is coming in too fast the person nearest shoves in something to stop the leak.  In the case of social services, whatever Minister appeared to be nearest shoved in something to deal with these various needs.  I am appealing to the Minister that, in regard to any similar Bill, he will first have it independently investigated and, secondly, that he will see whether he cannot interlock his system with the systems administered by other Ministers so as to have something in the nature of joint control over all these social services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Fifth Stage of the Bill you, Sir, certainly have been very patient.  I notice that the only thing you ruled out was autobiography so that I cannot compete with those people who on Second Reading explained in some detail in what extravagant poverty they were reared. What I feel about the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that he is clear and he is very often frank, but he was never clearer or more frank than he was in this House and in the other House on this Bill.  He made it clear that the Bill is one which will not in his judgment&mdash;and I think he is entirely right&mdash;raise the marriage rate or the birth rate.  He bases himself entirely on the necessity for helping people with large families.  May I say, Sir, at once, that on the question of <Col N="689" /> whether this particular measure is in accordance with Catholic teaching, I have always found it very difficult to make the argument that a particular measure is or is not in accordance with Catholic teaching.  Catholic teaching after all lays down certain principles and, as Senator Colgan has said, it is true that the Pope has laid down that there should be a proper family wage, but presumably that wage in the nature of things can be no more than a wage for the average family.  What this Bill purports to do is to help families which are above the average.  Statistically the Minister told us that the average family of children under 16 is about two.  On that basis he proceeds to help by money allowances people who have more than two children under 16 years of age.  That is a pretty logical basis, but one has doubts on the whole matter.  One the Minister has already referred to, and I, too, would have dealt with it had I an opportunity on the Second Stage, that is, whether we should take any pride in social services because the extension of social services implies, in fact, a failure of the ordinary realms of production.  Now the Minister&mdash;let us give him due credit&mdash;recognises that, and the Beveridge Report about which there is so much talk, recognises that, too.  It suggests certain increases in social services in England and boasts of the possibility of complete employment for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country our position is that we sometimes boast of keeping step with England, or other places, with regard to social services, but we also must keep step with those countries in production.  For example, the British in this war have made an enormous improvement in their agricultural economy.  We have not kept pace with them, and unless we can keep pace with them and bring our agriculture on a scientific basis up to a greater degree of productivity, then inevitably our social services must decline.  I think that is a thing the Minister made allusion to himself.  It is a thing which we should have in our minds always when agreeing, as we are agreeing in this particular case, to an increase in the social services.  It is easy to take <Col N="690" /> the view of the robust conservative and say that, after all, we know cases where families of eight, ten, 12 and 14 were raised, and there was no old age pension and no social service of any kind. That, of course, is quite true, although I think it is only a partial statement of the case to say that they were well reared.</P>
    <P>But, whatever one may think of that, we are now living in an era when it is recognised that large families are an asset to the State and ought to get assistance.  What one wonders is, whether the getting of a certain amount of money, whether it be 2/6 or 5/- a week for one child or two children is, in fact, going to be of very great use to them.  I do not want to enter into an autobiographical competition with Senator Colgan, but I do know something about the working-class citizens of Dublin, and something about the country, too.  I have grave doubts whether the mere increase of, say, 2/6, 5/- or 7/6, just handed out, does give you what you want if we cannot improve our production, if we cannot improve our scientific agriculture, and if we cannot change by some method of training the habits of our people: their food habits and, for example, their cooking habits about which our friend, Senator Mrs. Concannon, sometimes tells us.  Unless we can improve the capacity of our people to spend their money more intelligently, and to use the food that is available to them more intelligently, we may, in fact, be spending money and not be getting very much value for it.</P>
    <P>In reading the statistical abstract&mdash; I gather it is the last one that was issued and the Minister may have something to say about it&mdash;I find that transportable goods, for example, have not increased in production since 1937.  That is to say, that over a very considerable range of industrial production, we are at a standstill, and were at a standstill even before the war.  Our emigration is increasing, and it is certainly true of the City of Dublin&mdash;I know acute cases of it myself&mdash;that it was never more difficult for a boy to get an opening than it is to-day.  These are <Col N="691" /> problems that we have to deal with. There is, for example, the problem of the immense growth of Dublin and of the decline in school averages in the country, both of which have relevance, I think, to this particular subject.  We boast that we are now opening in Dublin the largest schools in Europe. It is very debatable whether schools should be so large at all or not.  But, while we are doing that in Dublin, we are dismissing teachers in the country because school averages are falling.  That shows us a red light: that no matter what sort of measures we have, and no matter what amount of goodwill we have towards solving the problem of poverty, that by merely giving out more money we are not really approaching a solution at all.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say that you want to redistribute wealth.  Since the passing of the Land Acts it is the rough truth to say that there is not any wealth in this country to redistribute. What you are going to do is to redistribute earnings.  You are going to take money from other earners. Senator Tierney referred to the small number of people whose incomes are over a certain figure, to the small wage-earners and the small salary earners.  If I understood the Minister aright, he was quite frank in indicating what he expects will be the arrangement under the Finance Bill, namely, that people who had an allowance for children will have that allowance reduced. They will lose, roughly speaking, £1 per child.  It has also been prophesied, and I take it the prophecy will be fulfilled, that income-tax will be increased.  That means that a very considerable number of people will have their standards of living reduced. It also means, as the Minister pointed out in the other House or perhaps it was here, that an increase in income-tax will mean an increase of the cost of living.  It also means a reduction in the opportunities for employment, so that with the passing of this Bill you are creating other problems as well. Take, for example, one class of the community which is never mentioned. Senator Colgan was quite right when he said that if you went to a public <Col N="692" /> meeting in Dublin or in the country and denounced this Bill, you would not make much profit out of your denunciation, politically.</P>
    <P>There are certain circles in the country, however, in which this measure is regarded with considerable alarm. Take the case of young professional people who have got a job at University College at £250 or £300 a year, and who have the temerity at the age of 26 or 28 to get married.  Is there any class in the community worse off than they are?  After all, they cannot go to work in a muffler.  They have very considerable problems.  Take the Government's attitude, owing to financial stringency if you like, towards the Civil Service.  A civil servant with a salary of over £500 a year gets no increase in the bonus which has been stabilised.  Some of those people are extremely badly off.  Take Government messengers and the lower grades of the Civil Service, in the Post Office and other Departments.  They also are extremely badly off.  Only a comparatively small number of them, not the average by any means, but only the exceptional cases where there are more than two children under 16, will get any relief at all under this Bill, and the relief of 2/6 a week which will be given will hardly, I think, make up for the increase in the cost of living that will come from increased taxation and of reduced standards elsewhere. Unless, therefore, we can solve our problems of agricultural and industrial production at a cost that the ordinary person can pay, and that the agricultural producer can pay, then our social services and our social fabric, indeed, are in for a very difficult time.</P>
    <P>The Minister answered the point made about co-ordination here from his own point of view.  I agree with what has been said that we should endeavour to bring all these social services into one Ministry and under one control if it could be done.  It is very difficult to do that.  I gather that the Minister himself, when he was preparing this Bill, went into this question, and found that it would be impossible.  I am not including unemployment insurance as a social service.  That is an insurance service.  I refer to the other services <Col N="693" /> where money is going out for nothing, and these apparently cannot be co-ordinated. If anybody goes to a place like Crumlin, where there is a big housing area, he will find himself surrounded by Government inspectors looking after all kinds of things&mdash;old age pensions, national health insurance, unemployment assistance and, in addition to these, you will find other people distributing writs of ejectment on unemployed people who have got houses there and cannot pay for them.  One feels that all these matters are of very great moment, but, in the meantime, if we cannot find any better scheme this may serve.</P>
    <P>I should like to support what has been said&mdash;I think I am supporting the Minister himself in saying&mdash;that we are doing these things at a cost, and that we must all pay.  Eventually, in a community like ours the recipients themselves must pay.  There is no means of handing out money to certain people and of preventing them from having the pressure come on them ultimately.  I think recent experience proves that there is not any such scheme.  The Minister told us that there must be extra taxation to meet the cost of this measure.  I wonder is there nothing we could do to avert that?  Must we have low production, out-of-date agriculture to a considerable extent, and the trappings of a modern State with an immense Civil Service to supervise its dwindling production, with more men on point duty and less traffic to direct? These social services will mean increased taxation and, in the end, we all must pay and, in spite of what it may be easy to say in certain surroundings, if you do depress the conditions of life in this country, you will find it difficult to hold here the kind of person whose services are essential to the country.  You are not able, owing to your proximity to England and the freedom with which they can go there, to prevent people going.  We have not solved any of our problems and one of the things we cannot do is to depress our standards of remuneration for special services to such a degree that we may lose the specialists themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I agree with what has been said and I do not think I will vote against the measure; but I do think what has been said should be emphasised, and that is that, unless we can increase our production and employment, then this is only a palliative.  It is a palliative which we will not have the money to pay for unless we can increase our production and alter the habits of our people so that they will be better able to cope with their own problems, domestic and otherwise.</P>

      <P>Senator Rowlette was very brief and to the point.  I think he contributed more in usefulness to this debate than anyone who has spoken up to now, including myself. I should like to refer to some of his remarks.  He said he was rather alarmed that no people had taken exception to the possibility of unscrupulous employers taking advantage of children's allowances to depress wages.  That aspect of the matter was referred to by me on the Second Reading.  I told the House I was quite a modern convert to children's allowances.  Hitherto I was opposed to them because of the helplessness of ordinary workers in the country with no trade union protection; there was a feeling that they would be exploited and advantage taken of their income to depress wages. That fear is no longer there.  The people for the most part are largely in a position to resist the rapacious employer.  The only people who will be really subject to that kind of thing will be the agricultural labourers.  Unfortunately, they are unorganised and <Col N="695" /> not in a position to defend themselves as well as they ought to be.</P>

      <P>I agree that that matter should be raised and the need of watching this aspect should be observed by the Government.  All employers are not the model Christian employers we hear so much about any more than are all workers model and Christian workers.  Somebody ought to be there to see that advantage is not taken of the situation by the type of person I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Senator Tierney gave us a good deal of Christian and Catholic philosophy, deplored that we were dealing with this matter in a piecemeal way and called for a national inquiry to co-ordinate all our social services in order that we may get the best possible value from them. With that I am in entire agreement. There is a cancer in our midst, the cancer of unemployment.  We have registered at the employment exchanges some 50,000 or 60,000 people. Surely it is the duty of the State to ensure that these people are not allowed to starve, so far as it is humanly possible to avoid starvation. That is a Christian obligation on the State.  In addition to the 50,000 or 60,000 people registered at the employment exchanges we have exported between 80,000 and 100,000 young, vigorous people to take up employment in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> I mention these facts because it has been stated by the Government that we need not look forward to any advance in our social services in the near future.  I think the Minister ought to clarify that statement.  One imagines the Government are concentrating on post-war planning and, certainly, in any post-war planning they may be contemplating social services should figure very largely.  I sincerely hope the Government statement will be clarified, as it has made a considerable number of people very uneasy. They say that children's allowances will be very welcome, very helpful and very necessary, but we may be paying too big a price in another direction if the Government are to shut down on social services because of the amount of money involved in these allowances.  I hope the Minister will expand that statement, that we need not look to any development in our social services in the near future because of the enormous cost of children's allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who live in a real world and are in close touch with its tragic realities must recognise that some help must be given to large families whose want is increased by the number of children that have to be provided for.  The social lay-out is such that, for the present, something like that is necessary. We all look forward to, and we all should strive soon to reach, the time when we can achieve the increased production which Senator Hayes stresses, the employment for everybody which Senator Baxter puts before us as our chief aim, and such education as will make people employable&mdash;and that is a very important thing&mdash;and make the most of their production.  That is the happy time at which to aim, but we have a long way to go and there are many people who will fall by the wayside if something is not done to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of our social services have come into existence in response to clamant and very urgent calls and possibly that is why they have not been co-ordinated. If we could start from <Col N="697" /> scratch in the ideal world which Senator Tierney seems to think exists, we could have everything planned out in such a way that everybody would be working and producing to the maximum; the country would be giving all it was capable of, and it would not be any great burden on the rest of us to keep the poor and needy people going.  But that is not the position. We have to strive towards that aim, and it was well that, in the speeches we have heard, the aim that should be before us was emphasised. In the meantime, we have to deal with a clamant problem.  We have to deal with poor children some of whose fathers are unemployed, while others are earning such wages as, with the present cost of living, make it impossible to provide such necessaries as clothes and boots.</P>
    <P>There is great need for such a Bill as that which we have before us.  I think that it was the Government's recognition of the urgency of the need that made them, more or less, rush this measure.  That was, probably, one of the reasons why they had not the commission to which Senator Kingsmill Moore referred.  I am quite sure that the Minister would have welcomed such a commission of social workers in touch with the people whom this Bill is intended to benefit and that these social workers could have given valuable help in the framing of the measure.  But I can understand that the position was so urgent that action had to be, more or less, hurried.  And so we have this measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which will help a great many people.  However, I have to recognise that it contains some faults.  One of these is that family need was not made the qualification for the allowance.  There was over-simplification in that respect.  So long as people have the requisite number of children, they can get the allowance though they may not be in need of it.  That, perhaps, simplifies administration.  A certain sum has, however, been fixed-£2,250,000&mdash;as the cost of the measure and, if people who do not need the allowance can obtain it, there is, consequently, less left for the people who really need it.  If possible, I think it <Col N="698" /> would have been well to make need the criterion under the Bill.  That would have involved a means test but I think it would have met the situation in a better way than the method proposed. Another thing which will affect the usefulness of the Bill is the lack of provision to see that the money which will be taken from the pockets of the taxpayers and which will add to the cost of living will be applied to the purpose for which it is intended.  I understand that there are difficulties in securing that. I thought a great deal about it but I could not propose any solution.  At the same time, we all must recognise that this is a flaw in the Bill.  It is a pity to take money from the pockets of earners and pay it to other people without any assurance that it will be spent for the purpose for which it is intended.  When I made this point last night, it was pointed out that we should have to question the old age pensioners as to whether they used portion of the money given them as pension to take a &ldquo;little drop&rdquo;. That is quite a different matter. When you give this family allowance to a man, you give it in trust for another object; there are two parties concerned.  When you give the old age pension to a man, it is for himself and, if he prefers a bottle of stout to a loaf, that is not our concern. It is a pity that we do not seem to have thought out any means of securing that the money to be given to a man to help him to rear his family will be applied as intended.  I think that there was a moral obligation on us to have devised, if possible, some means of securing that.  With those two exceptions, I think the Bill must be welcomed.  It will help a great many poor people with large families. While waiting and striving for the ideal world, we must welcome this measure.</P>

      <P>This Bill is welcome for two reasons.  The first is that it does not contain a means test&mdash;a test that, I think, characterises all our other social legislation.  Secondly, it will be in the nature of a contribution towards the better health of the nation. It is, I believe, quite true, as Senator Hayes said, that this Bill will not <Col N="699" /> stimulate either the marriage rate or the birth rate to any great extent, but there is one thing we can be sure of&mdash; that it will ensure that a great many children in the country in general and in the City of Dublin in particular will be healthier and happier as a result of the additional contribution that will go to necessitous families.  I should like to emphasise the point to which reference has already been made by some of my colleagues&mdash;the necessity for co-ordination of the social services generally.  Even though children's allowances will assist many families, I am afraid that in Dublin, at any rate, people on home assistance may lose somewhat because of deductions from the amount they are at present in receipt of.  If the social services were properly co-ordinated, anomalies of this kind would not be possible, because the aim should be to ensure that the income of a family would be sufficient to secure that each child of that family would have such a standard of living as would assure it good health.  From my point of view, any standard of living that falls short of that is not a good standard.</P>

      <P>As a worker who comes to this House from a rural district, I claim that this Bill is welcome to agricultural workers.  I have had occasion at times to visit the families of agricultural workers.  A short time ago, I went to the family of an agricultural worker to deliver some money from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. He was earning 36/- a week and he had six children huddled in a very bad house without fire, the children being without clothes or footwear. Yet, they were the children of an agricultural worker earning 36/- a week.  His wife told me that she had not the wherewithal to give the six children three substantial meals a day.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on coming to the rescue of the workers in the rural areas.  We may be told by Senator Baxter that there is a wage board in existence.  I admit there is, but Senator Baxter will admit that a wage of 36/- a week for a man with a family <Col N="700" /> of nine or ten to support is altogether inadequate, having regard to the cost of living.  It is one of the best days' work done by the Government.  Those who have to pay income-tax to provide the 2/6 per week in children's allowances thank the Almighty and All-Powerful God for giving them the money to pay that income-tax to relieve the hungry and suffering poor both in Dublin and in the rural areas. I thank the Government 100 times for giving even 2/6 per child, while I believe they could go further, and I hope they will in times to come.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told the Dáil that, when this allowance comes on, there should be no grumbling.  I am sure there will not be grumbling, and that the people who are able to pay for this allowance down the country heartily welcome it in all sections of the community. Even the farming community welcome it.  I contend that the farmers are well off to-day.  There may be some complaining with reason, but the majority of farmers in my county are well-off and never were better off, to my knowledge.  I would be glad to see farmers driving in golden chariots, but at the same time I think they ought to recognise that the Government had reason to introduce such a Bill as this. It is one of the best Bills introduced and I hope it will not be the only one. I hope that better Bills will follow and that, in times to come, the Government will see its way to give something more substantial than 2/6&mdash;say 7/6 per child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what interests most Senators at the moment is the fact that nobody has accepted the Minister's suggestion to offer an alternative form of spending this money.  It is very easy to decry the methods of spending money on social services, but it is very difficult to give constructive solutions or some other method of spending.  It would be well, before people begin to criticise the Bill in any sense, that they themselves should offer constructive alternatives. The Minister suggested that he would be prepared to consider any alternative he thought to be more desirable. So far as the expressions of Senators Tierney and Baxter are concerned, I <Col N="701" /> think the Minister himself would agree with them that the dignity of a man is something that should be preserved and that &ldquo;work for all&rdquo; is a desirable general principle.  The advocacy of &ldquo;work for all&rdquo; by Senator Baxter would be entirely accepted by the Minister or by any sane man.  It is the best and finest solution, but under the system of economics or economists which we have to-day, it is a solution which is quite impracticable.</P>
      <P>While industrialists welcome the Bill from a sociological point of view, there is one reaction that we think it may have on the working classes, through the consequent rise in taxation. The Minister should suggest to his colleague the Minister for Finance that, instead of financing this Bill through indirect taxation, in view of the fact that there has been a colossal increase in deposits in banks, as indicated by the banking returns in the last few weeks, the whole financing should be done through a loan.  I have already pointed out that young industries have suffered radically both in making allowances for depreciation of machinery and in finding it hard to make any dividends at all in some cases, due to the very high taxation imposed on them at the present moment.  Any addition in the form of indirect taxation will have a defeatist effect on another object of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;the creation of a sound industrial position. I just mention that as a suggestion.</P>
      <P>Any of us who can afford to pay income-tax gladly give it to any form of social benefit.  While Senator Honan may have a doubt on this matter, I think we should not break the camel's back.  Certainly, it will not help to develop Irish industries if, at every development, new taxation is placed on them.  Despite the fact that it may to some extent reflect on the dignity of man, as expressed by Senator Tierney himself, it will not solve the economic problem.  Generally, we should welcome this Bill from the broad social point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Fifth Stage of this Bill has covered a wide field and many aspects of social policy <Col N="702" /> were referred to.  I trust the House will not expect me to deal with all the matters to which reference of one kind or another was made.  I propose to confine my remarks to the observations which appear to have very direct and immediate relationship with the proposals before the House.  It is true, of course, that any project for the expansion of the social security services of the State, any proposal to spend more money on those services, must inevitably give rise to those general considerations of policy to which many Senators have referred.</P>
      <P>No doubt, it was that idea which prompted Senator Sir John Keane to suggest we should have a commission of inquiry.  I am not quite sure as to what the terms of reference of that commission would be, but, in my own view, a commission of inquiry into social policy in general would be of very little value, as we could not give that commission the scientific data, the reliable information, which would enable it to add substantially to our store of knowledge.  I mentioned already that we have never carried out a social survey in this country, we have never investigated in a scientific way the social conditions of our people, either in relation to the geographical areas in which they reside or to their occupations.  No doubt, at some time such a survey will be undertaken.  It will be elaborate and, perhaps, even a costly business, but the results might well justify the time and money which will be spent upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have delayed in undertaking such an investigation up to the present, for the simple reason that at no time in recent years have conditions here been such that they could be regarded as stable.  Unless there are stable conditions, an investigation carried out may be of little value when the results derived from it come to be published.  It has been suggested, however, that we should have had a commission of inquiry before we introduced this Bill.  I fail to see what purpose there would be in the establishment of such a commission. So far as the Government knew, every political Party in the State was in <Col N="703" /> favour of the principle of the Bill, while the spokesmen of the churches and of various social organisations had all given expressions of approval to the principle behind it.  There was, therefore, for discussion at such a commission, only the question of the amount of money that we would make available for this service and the manner in which the money would be administered.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Senators will recognise the practical impossibility of getting agreement amongst any body of individuals, representing different political interests, on the amount of money that should be provided for a service of this kind.  I doubt very much if it is the type of body which should approach it at all.  Clearly, the decision as to the amount of money must be taken, in the last resort, by those who have the responsibility of finding the money, that is, by the Government for the time being. The manner in which the money will be spent to achieve the purpose which the Government has in mind, and believe to be desirable, is a question of administration.  In my experience, it is very difficult to get people who have not had practical experience of administration of this kind to understand what is involved in the administrative problems that arise inevitably in connection with it.</P>
    <P>There has also been a suggestion that we should have investigated the desirability of co-ordinating our existing services.  The word &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; is very frequently used to cover vagueness of thought.  It is true, as was said here, that our existing social services have grown up in a somewhat haphazard manner.  The illustration was given of a man at sea in a leaky boat.  I was never at sea in a leaky boat, but, if I were, I do not know what the practical alternative is to stopping the holes as they appear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if you contemplate the situation where you can withdraw from the struggle until effective repairs <Col N="704" /> have been made; but surely that is not the position of a Government which has to deal with problems from day to day.  They have to remain at sea and, while there may be some alternative to stopping the holes as they appear, a very practical consideration is that, if you do not stop the holes as they appear, you are likely not to be long in the boat.</P>
      <P>It is obviously a matter with which the Government must concern itself. The administrative arrangements enforced here are the most efficient and least costly that can be devised. When this Bill came up to be considered in detail by the Government, we did examine the desirability of grouping in one scheme all the children's allowances at present paid under different social services&mdash;the children's allowances that are paid to persons drawing benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Unemployment Assistance Act, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and so forth.  We came to the conclusion&mdash;surprising though it may appear to Senators&mdash;that the cheapest and most efficient method of administering this Bill was to superimpose it on all the other Acts and not attempt any such grouping.</P>
      <P>At some stage, there might be a recasting of Government responsibility between Ministers, and the adoption of the suggestion which was made here that there should be one Minister in charge of all social services.  That suggestion appears desirable on the face of it, but it is not obvious that the advantages which will result will be very substantial.  I doubt if they will. In practice, the existing services are worked very largely through combined staffs and it is only in some less important respects that the danger of overlapping appears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Rowlette appeared to think that, when employers are negotiating rates of wages to be paid to their workers, they take into account the workers' needs.  I am quite sure there are individual employers here and there who do.  They are the employers who are in a position in which they can <Col N="705" /> easily pass on to the public any increase in their labour charges.  The average employer in a competitive industry is concerned with making the best bargain he can for himself.  Our economic system has given rise to the institution of the standard wage. Whether it is or is not true that, in the past, employers had regard to the needs of the workers, or whether it is or is not true that, as Senator Tierney said, the Catholic doctrine requires that wages should be related to the needs of the workers, in practice we have the standard wage and, under the standard wage, the needs of individual workers are not taken into account at all.  In fact, it is true to say that the average worker in this country is best off when he has finished his apprenticeship and is drawing a full journeyman's wages.  He is better off at that time than ever he will be again in the whole of his life.  At a later stage, he contracts matrimony and, after matrimony, he has family responsibilities, but he is drawing all the time for his work the standard wage, whatever that may be, and that is related, not to his own needs or his productivity, but to the practice established in the occupation in which he is employed.</P>
    <P>It is because we have that system of remunerating workers that it is necessary to devise some such service as this, owing to the want that arises in large families through the inadequacy of the standard wage to meet all the requirements of large families.  Nor are these circumstances confined to workers employed for wages.  We have in this country a very high proportion of people working on their own account.  The amount of income they get from their work is not determined by their needs, but by the productivity of their farms, by what they earn on fishing boats, or by what they earn by any skill they have.  In their case, also, responsibility for large families means poverty or hardship unless the income that they can get from the ordinary occupations they are employed in can be supplemented.  It is to effect that supplementing of the income of large families that this Bill is designed.  It seems to me that the need exists irrespective <Col N="706" /> of whether there is an increase of national productivity by economic measures, or whether we achieve the ideal that Senator Baxter referred to, full employment for all workers seeking employment.</P>
    <P>I have been represented as having said that this is the last addition to our social services for a long time.  That is not quite what I said.  I endeavoured to emphasise the relationship that exists between social policy and economic policy.  We cannot allow our social policy to run ahead of our economic development, no more than we should allow our economic policy to develop without regard to the social consequences. The productivity of our country, the extent to which we can add to its wealth by the application of human labour to the national resources available to us determine the national income.  We could possibly increase the productivity of this country substantially by the mechanisation of agriculture, by a reversal of the policy of the Land Commission, by the elimination of small farms, and the concentration of farms into large production units, but whether that would be desirable from the social point of view is at least open to question.  We might gain economically but the cost of that gain and the social hardship that would be caused by putting a number of people off the land might be more than the gain is worth.  The success of our economic policy must determine what our social policy will be.  I want to emphasise that we cannot hope to build up here the full system of social protection which many people regard as desirable unless we can as a prior condition make our plans for economic development more successful and get as a result the resources wherewith to do it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes rightly reminded the Seanad that the Beveridge Plan, which has now been taken as a sort of headline for the social services of all Governments, was made conditional by Sir William Beveridge upon full employment in Great Britain.  We can hope in the post-war years to apply our abilities here to the expansion of our material resources and thereby make possible an improvement in our social services. <Col N="707" /> But, so long as we have to mark time in economic development in this country, as we are marking time at the moment, then the proportion of the national income which we can divert to this purpose is limited.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I want members of the Oireachtas to remember that the provision of £2,250,000 for this service implied a decision to spend money on this service rather than on another, and to recognise that, having decided that the maximum amount that could be provided does not exceed that figure, we were precluding ourselves, under present conditions, from making a permanent improvement in the social services in other directions.  I emphasise permanent improvement. The Government is adjusting the provision being made for the relief of distress to the development of circumstances during the emergency.  Since I spoke last, it has decided, as announced in the Press, to provide a substantial sum of money to increase the provision for old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  That is done, however, as an emergency measure and does not represent any long-term decision.  Any long-term decision will have to be related to a long-term economic policy.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to conclude that the Government introduced this Bill without a means test because it considered there was some virtue in paying these allowances to all persons whether they needed them or not.  That is not altogether the position in fact.  I told the Seanad that the whole scheme of children's allowances would come before them in two parts.  This Bill represents one part.  The other part will come in the Finance Bill, for raising the money to provide the allowances and in the scheme for raising the money there will be provisions to ensure that persons, in the income-tax paying classes would not gain under the scheme at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon appears to have an idea that if we had a means test in the Bill we could provide more money for those who qualified under <Col N="708" /> that test.  I think the reverse might be the case.  What the Government in fact decided was that the additional cost of paying the allowances to everyone without a means test, but subject to the adjustments in the income-tax code to which I referred, would be less than the cost of enforcing the means test.  The enforcement of a means test involves a great deal of expenditure on costly administrative machinery, and we felt that in the interests of getting the best use for the money we could make available, it was more desirable to pay it out in this way without examination of individual means, rather than set up machinery for such an examination.</P>
    <P>I do not want, however, to be taken as expressing a view contrary to that which was referred to in speeches made here, that in the normal course where the Government proposes to raise revenue by taxation for the purpose of relieving need, that there is an obligation on the Government to establish that need does in fact exist.  Nor, do I think it unreasonable to expect that those who are applying to the community for assistance in their need will show that, in fact, they require it.  Let us be clear, however, that need can arise from a number of causes.  I emphasised that in the course of a Second Reading debate, and I want to do it again.</P>
    <P>Full employment may remove need arising from one cause.  We all desire to see all our people fully occupied, and all the resources of the country fully employed, but, even if we achieved that ideal position, there would still be the necessity for social services.  Need can arise through ill-health. The breadwinner of a family may meet with an accident or contract an illness which makes it impossible for him to earn.  Need can arise in a family where the breadwinner dies. Need can arise through old age, and there are a number of circumstances where need can be created, and nobody can say that the need was avoidable by the persons concerned.  There are, of course, persons who are in need through their own fault.  It would be a very wide debate if I were to express <Col N="709" /> views as to the obligations of the community to assist those in need through their own fault, but, even in their cases, there are certain obligations on us to see that they are assisted.</P>
    <P>These obligations are discharged through the public assistance authorities at present, and are also discharged through some of these social services to which I referred.  If a person over 70 years of age applies for an old age pension he does not have to show that he might have been more thrifty in his early days and could have provided for his old age. Similarly, in the cases of widows and orphans, it is possible that they might have been provided for by the breadwinner of the family.  We do not blame the family and deprive them of assistance because the breadwinner did not do that.  Even in the cases where it could be argued that the circumstances which made an appeal for assistance necessary were avoidable in the family, we believe that there rests on the community an obligation to assist the destitute.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are some people who, no matter how much you give them, will become destitute eventually, and for them very little can be done.  I doubt very much if it is desirable that we should carry out an elaborate investigation into the manner in which individual families spend their income.  It may be argued that unearned income is always demoralising, but it can be no more demoralising when the income is derived from public services than from the proceeds of investments.  I am quite certain that a contrary point of view could be put forward.</P>
    <P>In an English journal a week ago, I saw it stated that all great advances in science and culture in that country were inspired largely by people who, because they had unearned income, were protected from any anxiety as to their livelihood.  That may not be true, but I submit that there are results other than demoralisation possible from unearned income.  But, where persons are in want because they are ill, or old, or incapable of work for one reason or another, there is no alternative to giving them <Col N="710" /> unearned income.  In so far as they are in want through unemployment, they are not always unemployed because of their own fault.  If you cannot put them at work, there is no reason why you should not give them unearned assistance.</P>
    <P>That is the general principle, but it has very little relation to this Bill. This particular service will become of more importance to the community, and more people will benefit under it if we get economic progress and, as a result, full employment.  However, it has been demonstrated in the course of the discussion that any particular project of this kind is not a rose without thorns.  There are economic and social reactions from every change of this character.  Some of these we can foresee now; others will become apparent only later on, but, from the examination of the subject which it is possible for us to make, we are satisfied on the whole that the enactment of this measure will have important effects on social conditions.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad invites an explanation from the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures in regard to the attitude adopted towards the censorship of the book entitled <i>The House of Gregory.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find among certain Senators and members of the public who have seen this notice of motion considerable ignorance of what it involves.  That, perhaps, is natural, but I should like to say at the outset that it involves matters of very grave Constitutional import, and I do hope that I shall have the attention and the sympathy of the House in what I have to say.  In that connection, I make an appeal that members of the House will approach this matter more in the spirit of jurymen than from any standpoint of Party allegiance.  I think you <Col N="711" /> will find that those remarks are justified when you hear the case as it develops.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been suggested that I, on account of my rather bad reputation, am about to make another attack upon our moral stronghold.  I can assure you that there is nothing of that kind in this motion.  My case has no more to do with book censorship than&mdash;what shall I say&mdash;the <i>Daily Mail</i> has to do with the Book of Kells. Those of you who have seen the book may say that it is not a work of any great importance, and you may wonder why it is brought forward in this motion at all.  You may fail to see, at first sight, that the issue is of very grave importance.  Well, I hope to show you that, if the author of this book is judged on the treatment he has received, it would justify his name going down to history.  It is as important as that of John Wilkes, who created big constitutional issues in Georgian politics in the 18th century, who made and unmade Governments, if I am, or my history is, correct, and who, largely on account of the notoriety he obtained by his martyrdom, so to speak, and by his treatment, was made Lord Mayor of London.  I think that the issues involved here are so great that the author of this book, Mr. Vere Gregory, may claim to be almost as important as Captain Dreyfus, who, apart from the cause for which he suffered, was a comparatively unimportant officer in the French Army. Captain Dreyfus was a man who, by reason of his race, would not naturally receive much sympathy, but the treatment he received convulsed Europe, one might say, and almost led Europe into international complications.  In the same way, you have the case of John Brown, whose treatment largely led to the American Civil War.</P>
    <P>You may think I am exaggerating in setting up such examples as compared with a small country like this. The country in which these things take place is small, but I think that the principles involved are just as grave and important.  All these men stood for the vital principles of liberty; their names stand inscribed <Col N="712" /> in the roll of famous men, and I feel that Mr. Gregory's name would deserve to be so inscribed.</P>
    <P>Now, what I am setting out to prove is that the treatment that this author has received in reference to this publication is, first of all, a violation of literary freedom; secondly, that it constitutes a gross act of personal injustice, and thirdly, that it also constitutes an inroad into Parliamentary rights, and I suggest that it is a rather serious triple bill which the Minister will have to meet.  I rather welcome that this has come up in a specific form, because it is always difficult to get these matters convincingly stated in the form of generalities.  I understand that we may possibly be having a debate, some time in the future, on the whole general question of Press censorship, and if that follows I feel that this specific case will be a fitting prelude to that general debate because it will show you in detail what is happening, and what has happened in at least one specific case.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the author.  The author served a career in the service of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and when he retired, like many retired men, he felt rather lonely and at a loose end because of the lack of occupation.  Now, I feel that we ought to have sympathy with men who, in their retirement, are looking for something to do.  We have heard about the dangerous age.  That age, in most people's minds, is associated with a climacteric, but in this case, I think, the dangerous age, very often, is when a man becomes out of occupation and feels that he has nothing to do with his leisure.  It is well known that men rapidly deteriorate when they are in that position.  One can easily imagine this man saying to himself: &ldquo;I shall write a book on my experiences, and around my family history, with illustrations of my active life,&rdquo; and he wrote the book which is now in question.  I have no doubt that he said to himself: &ldquo;It will cost me a bit of money to write this book; you cannot expect publishers, in the case of a probably unknown person, to take the risk of publication, and I want to safeguard myself as far as possible against <Col N="713" /> loss.&rdquo;  Accordingly, knowing, or having heard, possibly, of the ways and dangers of censorship in this country, he said: &ldquo;I will safeguard myself, and I will submit this book to the Censor.&rdquo; In due course he did so.  I have not got the date on which the proofs went to the Censor, but I do not think that that is material.  At any rate, they were returned on 29th June, stamped &ldquo;Passed by Censor&rdquo;.  They were recalled by the Censor, for some reason which does not appear, on 22nd July, and were again returned by the Censor on 24th August, without comment.</P>
    <P>Now, put yourself into that position. Would you not imagine that, your book having been censored, you could expect publication without restriction, and that you could more or less safely take at least the commercial risk in the sales and costs involved; and so the author went ahead.  I do not, of course, know what explanation or what defence the Minister will make, although I think that the Minister is on trial in this matter, and I use the word &ldquo;defence&rdquo; advisedly.  He may say that this man departed from the instructions of the Censor, that he put in certain additional matter, and that he also put in certain matter which had been deleted.  Well, on the face of that, one might say that that was an offence, but I will ask you to address yourself to what the matter was.  After all, this thing is not a question of law, but a question of facts.  I agree that if the matter inserted was really obnoxious, it would be all right. I will have to weary you by reading this matter that was deleted by the Censor and inserted by the author. The author was very anxious to place on record the services of his son who was in the British Navy, and, together with a large number of deletions, certain references to the services of his son had been deleted.  They were not really inserted at the same place in the book, but in another place.  In the original manuscript they appeared in connection with certain criticisms of the absence of adequate life-saving appliances on British warships.</P>
    <P>I will concede to the Minister that perhaps it was desirable&mdash;not that I can see that it matters very much now <Col N="714" />&mdash;that the book should not comment on the adequacy of life-saving apparatus, although it took place in the early days of the war.  However, these are the remarks:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My son, Commander Gregory, R.N., was a naval officer on the <i>Royal Oak</i> when she was torpedoed, and would undoubtedly have lost his life along with 800 companions who perished, but for the fact of being a very powerful swimmer.  Fortunately for him, he was still on deck when the first torpedo struck her.  When three more came for her in rapid succession, he knew that she was doomed and would sink in a few minutes.  Accordingly, he stripped to his underwear, and when the ship heeled over he clambered up her side; and so, when she turned turtle, he found himself sitting beside the keel.  Three stoker ratings had followed his example.  One of them at once produced a packet of cigarettes, and another a box of matches, and all four began to smoke. While discussing the novel situation, an ominous movement of the vessel told them that it was time to look for a better hold.  After swimming a short distance they were all picked up by a pinnace already overcrowded. Hardly had they been packed into her when several other men tried to clamber on board on the same side, with the result that she capsized, and nearly all on board were trapped underneath.  Most of these unfortunate men, obeying a natural instinct, just struggled upwards and were caught in the tangled mass inside the upturned boat.</P>
    <P>My son dived down and outwards, and so came up clear, but saw no more of any of his late companions. He was then faced with two alternatives&mdash;to swim for the shore, a matter of about half a mile, or to remain where he was until daybreak, then about four hours' distant.  Most men would have struck out for the shore at once, but my son realised that all the thick oil from the engines was setting that way with the tide, and that he would be choked before getting half-way to land.  Accordingly, he resolved to remain floating <Col N="715" /> around, and after about two hours he thought he heard a boat moving near at hand, and hailed her.  Happily his surmise was correct.  She proved to be a ship's whaler searching for survivors, and he was taken on board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the extent of the deleted matter which reappears in the book. Considering the censorship as a means to protect national security or to secure better relations with friendly Governments, I need hardly say that no one could see how any possible harm or any possible violation of any safeguards could be contained in that reinsertion.  The Minister may say that that is all right, and that there is no harm in that, but that the author has put in certain additional matter which was never submitted to the Censor.  This may weary you, but I must read it, in view of the fact that the matter is important, considering the gravity of the whole case.</P>

      <P>I am very glad because it will save the time of the House.  I think, however, it is necessary, in order to see the background to this whole thing, to go very briefly through the deleted matter, because it is only right in approaching the question that we should have some idea of the class of matter which the censor is deleting&mdash;and it is not only in this book but in many other cases. I will read you certain extracts from the deleted matter.  You may be satisfied with the deletions, but I can see no justification on the grounds of national security or that they might jeopardise our relationships with other Powers that such matter should not be published.  I, personally, do not think that any of this matter that I am going to read should be deleted, but I am giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt in certain criticisms of British politics before the war, and I am only bringing out certain extracts.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="716" />&ldquo;I think it is generally admitted that the winning of the battle for Britain in the summer of 1940 by the Royal Air Force was only rendered possible by the strong patriotic stand by Sir Hugh Trenchard, Marshal of the Royal Air Force, who flatly refused in the years before the war to agree to any sacrifice of quality for quantity in the matter of planes, when the Government were anxious to save their face by showing a substantial increase in the number of planes without a corresponding increase in expenditure.  But for the courageous stand he made, the R.A.F. might have been overwhelmed by the Luftwaffe with disastrous consequences, and it is not too much to say that he saved England from invasion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Censor towards <i>The House of Gregory</i> surely covers the deletions.  I have read a long passage and I am now reading a passage which, if it had not been for the action of the Censor, would have appeared in the book and I am asking the House to be given an indication of how the Censor works, because we are very much puzzled, and we do not get very much opportunity <Col N="717" /> of ascertaining the mysterious manner in which the Censorship operates.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On his retirement&rdquo;&mdash;this is referring to Sir Hugh Trenchard&mdash;&ldquo;at the close of a long and distinguished career spent, not in the interests of a political Party, but in the service of King and Country, he was created a Baron, the lowest rank in the Peerage, and one which after the Great War was usually reserved for beer and newspaper magnates, and similar merchant princes, who were willing in return for such honours to assist in materially replenishing the depleted coffers of the Liberal Party war chest.</P>
      <P>Again, quite recently, the Archbishop of Canterbury retired after a long life spent in the service of his God and his country.  His tenure of office embraced the critical period of the abdication and the successful completion of the steps necessary to give effect to that distressing event was in a great measure due to the Archbishop's personal influence and tact.</P>
      <P>I say this without wishing to detract in any way from the high praise which is undoubtedly due to Lord Baldwin for the efficient and tactful manner in which he discharged his painful duty in the national tragedy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I skip one paragraph so as not to weary the House unduly.  It is all more or less on the same line.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England, Cosmo Lang ranked in precedence next to the princes of the Royal Family and above all the members of the Peerage.  As Baron Lang, he now ranks much lower than an ex-Army Captain, sitting above him in the House of Lords as Viscount Margesson. A strange anomaly not very flattering to either the Church of England or to the Royal Air Force.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not very profound matter. I do not know whether I agree with it, but what right has the Censor to delete that?  In what way does that sort of <Col N="718" /> writing jeopardise our national security or our relations with friendly Powers? Does the Minister think the British are going to take objection to that?  They have many other things to do, but, even if they had not, they would pass it over with a smile and that would be the end of it.  I think the Minister has to tell the House why that was deleted and in what sense our national security is jeopardised by writing of that kind. Otherwise, anything the Minister himself may not approve of as a literary effort, or may not agree with from some political standpoint, will come out and literature will be mutilated and destroyed in an entirely wanton manner.  The country will not know what it is deprived of, and what literary efforts may never come to life.</P>
    <P>I have given samples of the class of deletions which are taking place, and I now come to what is the main indictment of my case: that, having been censored, those deletions having been made and the additional matter having been substituted&mdash;and apparently the Minister does not object&mdash;the next thing the Press and the publishing houses know is that no reviews or advertisements are to be allowed in respect of that book.  One publishing firm submitted an advertisement in its Christmas list and was told &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Two newspapers that I know of had their reviews returned.  I hope the House at this stage is as puzzled as I am as to why the Minister took that action.  We have to try to seek as best we can, and, in making my case, have to try to seek for some explanation of why the Minister acted as he did.  He certainly must have acted as he did because he did not approve of the book. He may say: &ldquo;I did not approve of the book on reconsideration.  After all, what did I do?  What I did was a matter of very trifling importance.  I allowed the book to circulate, and if you go down Grafton Street or along Nassau Street, you can see this book in shop windows.&rdquo;  But does the Minister allege that to deny all reviews and all advertisements of a book is not a grievous injury to the author? Of course it is.  How do people in the country get to know what books are available?  Do they not depend largely <Col N="719" /> on reviews and advertisements?  We cannot all of us flatten our noses at a few shop windows where books are sold in order to know what books are available. A few of the libraries issue notices of their books.  I do not know what view the Minister might have taken if libraries had issued notices of this book, but those reviews and advertisements were stopped.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need labour it any further.  Any man of common sense must know that action of that kind is a grave injury to an author, and doubly grave when he thought he had unrestricted freedom after the censorship. I admit that there might have been a serious oversight, and a mistake might have happened.  It reflects very badly on the whole department of censorship that such a thing should occur, but in the best regulated families mistakes may occur.  I do not deny that something might have got through, because the reader might have nodded, which did grievous injury to our national security or to our relations with friendly States.  Those are the only grounds, apart from the moral censorship, which does not arise here, on which books can be censored.  Let that be perfectly clear.  The Minister has not got under any power full and unrestricted licence to cut out anything he likes, though it rather appears that he claims it, or he acts as if he did.</P>
    <P>I understand&mdash;I need not tell the House how, but the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the portion of the book by which he justifies his extraordinary behaviour is the reference to the incident in Croke Park, and I shall have to read that so that the House may judge of the matter. The House knows that the Croke Park affair followed the unfortunate shootings in Mount Street&mdash;I have to be careful about the words I use because I am speaking in a neutral assembly&mdash;of the courtsmartial officers. This is the passage:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wholesale slaughter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That refers to Bloody Sunday.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; and I do not know what word to use. The elimination&mdash;that is a good word <Col N="720" />&mdash;of these officers is described in those words:</P>
    <P>&mdash;caused absolute consternation in Dublin Castle and it was considered essential that immediate steps should be taken to try and make amenable some of the perpetrators before they left the city.</P>
    <P>That afternoon a Gaelic football match between teams representing the Counties of Tipperary and Dublin was to be held at Croke Park, and as it was considered highly probable that many of those who had taken part in the murders would be present at the match it was decided to send a detachment of Black-and-Tans to the ground to search the spectators for arms or incriminating documents.</P>
    <P>When the first lorry load of Black-and-Tans entered the ground, they alleged that some shots were fired at them.  They then opened fire killing 12 people including Hogan, a stalwart member of the Tipperary team, and wounding about 60 others. A large number of revolvers were picked up on the ground, but no one was caught with a weapon on his person.</P>
    <P>The officer in charge on this occasion subsequently served under me, and I discussed with him the incidents of Bloody Sunday, as I wanted to know what he hoped to achieve by taking a lorry load of men to search a crowd of 10,000 men on a football ground.</P>
    <P>He told me his orders were to search the crowd, and that if any opposition was offered he was to return the fire and to shoot as many of the Tipperary team as possible, and on no account to let Hogan escape.  Accordingly he included in his party a man whom he knew to be a dead shot with the rifle.  He asserted that on arrival at Croke Park some shots were fired at his party as soon as they entered the gates, and he accordingly ordered his men to return the fire.  Hogan was pointed out to the marksman, who put his rifle to his shoulder, pressed the trigger, and Hogan dropped dead.  One of his companions exclaimed: <Col N="721" />&lsquo;What a damned fluke!' &lsquo;Was it?&rsquo;  he replied. &lsquo;Watch the ball.&rsquo; Up till then very few people were aware of the drama which was being enacted before their eyes and the ball was still in play.  As it bounced across the field, the marksman again raised his rifle, fired, and the football collapsed literally like a pricked bladder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think myself that is a rather tall story, but I go on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The crowd now fled in terror across the field, mingling with the players and effectually screening them from the Crown Forces.  Seeing that there were many women and children amongst the spectators, the officer in charge ordered his men to cease fire.</P>
    <P>Even if this story is true I am quite sure that the orders did not emanate from any responsible official, military or civilian, in Dublin Castle.  It may be wondered why Hogan was marked down for special attention.  Some months earlier two policemen had been shot in Tipperary, and as it was suspected that one of their assailants was named Hogan, it was thought possible that the football player of that name might be the wanted man.  It was an unlucky name to bear at that time, for several Hogans were shot &lsquo;unofficially' in the hope that one of them might be the guilty man, but as a matter of fact the real culprit got clean away to America while the going was good and his unfortunate namesakes suffered for his crime.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the passage which I understand &mdash;the Minister may have other passages&mdash;has caused the Minister to act as he has done.  Let me make this point first.  If the desire is to avoid animosity with friendly Powers, they have only got to read the book and their animosity is created.  If the passage is likely to create animosity or to endanger our national security the book is in circulation.  I understand that the Minister says that he will not have an unseemly newspaper controversy provoked by reviews or advertisements of this book.  Examine it.  Is there any reason whatever to assume that any reviewer will necessarily <Col N="722" /> dwell on that passage at all?  There has been one review of the book which the State Censor passed.  That review makes no reference whatever to the Croke Park incident.  Assuming that some other reviews did refer to it, has the Minister not got power straight away to stop an unseemly controversy? Has he not used that power already to delete references to the Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Hugh Trenchard? Surely if he has justification for that, he has justification for censoring what he considers a dangerous newspaper controversy.  My point is that if that is what the Minister is afraid of, he should have waited until the newspaper controversy had arisen and that he should not have done the great injustice he has done to this author by refusing to allow reviews or advertisements of this book to appear.</P>
    <P>I understand further that what the Minister objects to is this suggestion that the British acted in a dastardly manner, as the author suggests, by attacking several people and shooting indiscriminately into the crowd.  I am glad to see that the Minister is concerned for the good name of the British.  Times have moved since the previous censorship debate, when I brought up the question of the deletion of the Royal Arms from the background of a photograph in which he appeared. He said he had been taken in that position, with the Royal Arms behind him, with the purpose of humiliating him. So much to the good, therefore, that he now values the good name of our former rulers, and is prepared to defend it.</P>
    <P>We have also to examine other publications that have been allowed to appear without any restriction whatever. I do not object to that, not for one moment, because I want everything to appear.  I want no censorship of any kind except of pornography or of blatent indecency.  Do not think that I am asking for censorship; I am merely asking the Minister to explain the extraordinary inconsistencies of the censorship department.  I should first like to refer to a rather minor case, that is, to certain passages in <i>Bowenscourt,</i> about the burning of barracks, the actions of Irish troops, <Col N="723" /> and the conflict between different sections of the Irish Army which, to my mind, are just as objectionable from the Minister's standpoint as the passages that I have read out that have been deleted.  There is a rather amusing passage here in reference to the late Mr. Bowen, who came to live in Dublin.  He went to a restaurant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do claim the right to examine the consistency of the censorship department.  I shall not be very long on this, but at least I claim the right to refer to one publication, because the Minister says he wants to prevent the publication of anything provocative or dangerous to the public interest or the national security.  I have here an extraordinary publication called <i>Orange Terror.</i>  I am not going to wade through <i>Orange Terror</i>; the House need not be afraid.  I am going to read only one passage from <i>Orange Terror</i> that is certainly provocative and that is not calculated to make for better relations with a friendly power. Here is the passage:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In other words, Britain&mdash;the contriver and maintainer of a mutilated Ireland&mdash;Britain who utilises astutely the envenomed ascendancy of the settlers as an instrument for holding our Six Counties to serve as a second Gibraltar for her Empire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then later on in the same publication we read this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;How can any amelioration of the Irish Catholic helot's lot in Northern Ireland be secured but by political action?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appeared over the signature of a gentleman called William A. Magennis. The name was familiar to me and then when I looked at the table of contents, I saw that it was Senator William Magennis who made these remarks, and these remarks have been allowed to pass uncensored.  I would have expected at least from a man of his literary eminence and undoubtedly close knowledge of language something <Col N="724" /> a little more temperate than the word &ldquo;helot&rdquo;, which I understand signifies a condition of absolute slavery, as applied to our countrymen across the Border.  There is also a book called the <i>Irish Citizen Army.</i>  I am not going to read from that publication, as the Cathaoirleach has suggested that I should not widen the scope of the motion, but there are references in that book to happenings in 1916 which are every bit as provocative as the description of the Croke Park incident&mdash;remarks about women being armed in the battle line&mdash;and if somebody wanted to raise a newspaper controversy on them, there is ample matter there which would be just as fertile of trouble as a discussion on the Croke Park scenes.</P>
    <P>I reach this conclusion here&mdash;I have to examine it very briefly; others, I hope, will do it in more detail&mdash;as to the question of the Minister's powers.  The Minister has very wide powers, as we know, under the Emergency Act.  More specifically his powers over Press censorship are contained in Order 151.  I will put this briefly, because others will, I hope, do it in more detail, that once a book has passed the Censor&mdash;a publication, which includes a book is the definition&mdash;it cannot be seized.  It does not say reviews and notices cannot be forbidden, but surely, in equity, if passing the Censor exempts from being seized&mdash;and, after all, we do approach these things in the spirit of equity&mdash; exemption should also apply in other directions; there should be freedom to circulate and there should not be any restrictions in the matter of advertisements and reviews.</P>
    <P>Whatever lawyers may say, I consider that the Minister's action in respect of this book is definitely illegal. It might be said, &ldquo;If it is illegal, why not take him to the courts?&rdquo;  Would that be a serious suggestion, that a man like the author, with his financial resources, should take the Government to court, possibly to the Court of Appeal?  This is the court, and I hope it is the court that will give judgment in this whole matter.  If the Minister's action is not illegal, I consider, and I will use the words <Col N="725" /> advisedly, that his action was dishonourable and unjust.</P>
    <P>Having reached this stage, the Minister must have felt that he might be able to get away with it; but worse, in my opinion, is to come.  This matter got talked about a lot; some of us got interested in it.  I made inquiries, and I felt it was certainly a case that should come before the House. Accordingly, I put down a motion in the terms now on the Order Paper. What happened next?  In the case of one paper, at least, that motion was deleted by the Censor.  I suggest that in doing so the Minister has made a flagrant attack on our Parliamentary rights and privileges, and that is the most serious aspect of the whole indictment.</P>
    <P>I understood that this is the first time any notice of motion has been censored.  The Minister and the officials of his Department know more about this than I do, and he may tell me I am wrong.  I understand there was a notice of motion submitted by a former Senator, Mr. MacDermot, dealing with the question of better relations or some understanding with America arising out of our neutral position.  It was a motion bearing on a rather delicate situation, and some of us pressed the Senator not to bring it forward.  For a few days that notice of motion was withheld from publication, but subsequently it appeared.  I am afraid the Minister's use of powers was growing in audacity.  In this case the blue pencil went down and the notice was censored&mdash;in the words of the Press, it was &ldquo;killed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which requires rather closer examination.  When these emergency powers were being taken in the early stages of the war, we all realised that they must be very wide, that our national security must come first, and we could not allow reckless speech or reckless publication and, in these circumstances, the Oireachtas gave the Government very wide powers.  But, whenever any Deputy or Senator stressed the danger of giving wide powers, what were we told?  We were <Col N="726" /> told: &ldquo;You always have the Parliament in the last resort; you can always come back to the fountain-head of power, bring the matter up and get the Government to explain.&rdquo;  Does the Minister suggest that a Parliament without publicity is an adequate safeguard of our public rights, or, otherwise, that we had better meet always in secret session?</P>
    <P>A large portion of the value of Parliament is that the public shall learn fully what has been said in our Legislature. I claim that a member of Parliament, a member of either House, has full right to put down a motion to debate any subject he wishes to bring forward and he has a right to full publicity. I claim the right, if I wished to do so, to put down a motion that we should enter the war or that we should hand over the ports to the Allies, and I claim that the Government has no right to censor that motion.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's new-found friendship, he may have some sympathy with the attitude of the British Parliament in this matter.  I will tell him, but he probably knows it, that the one body that is free from any overhaul or analysis in the matter of censorship is the House of Commons. That was the position in the last war and the position also in this.  However indiscreet may be a statement made by a Member of Parliament there, the Press Censor cannot delete it.  I have no doubt there is the protection of the Members' conscience&mdash;Members of Parliament, patriotic people, do not use dangerous language.  I have no doubt whatever that if statements are made which might benefit the enemy, the Government would go to the newspaper editor, the Press Association, or whatever the body may be, and would say: &ldquo;I think you ought not to publish the statement made by X,&rdquo; and they would say: &ldquo;Certainly, it will not be published.&rdquo;  This is the point I want to make.  If the editor of any paper said: &ldquo;No, I think that ought to be published in the public interest,&rdquo; the Government would have no power to stop it.  That is the way the thing has worked, and is worked still.  A book written on this subject throws an interesting sidelight on that aspect. <Col N="727" /> The indiscretions that occurred in the last war in the British House of Commons&mdash;they were few in number&mdash;were made by Ministers.  They had certain information in their possession and we all know it is very easy in making a speech to give a hint which may appear innocent but which may be of great value to the enemy.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to answer this definite question: does he claim the right to censor notices of Parliamentary business or the debates of Parliament? If he does, the matter is not going to end there.  I would not press this matter and I would not appear to be so emphatic if I did not feel that this was not an isolated case.  This is symptomatic of a lot that is going on in the censorship department to-day. I feel, and it is only natural, that this dictator attitude grows very easily in an unrestricted atmosphere.  The Minister has got these very wide powers little by little. He uses them, and at last the time has come when I feel he has grown intoxicated by the use of power. I feel that it is in the interests of all sections in this House, and especially the Labour section, who may one day find itself under the blue pencil of our rulers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the time has come when the Minister should go back to his political primer and should realise the proper attitude to Parliament. The Minister should realise that Ministers are the servants of Parliament. It is time he was told that its rights cannot be recklessly overridden, and that he cannot use his position to favour his vanity, his <i>amour propre.</i> He has a duty to his office in the nature of a judge, and has got to balance carefully the factors of public security as against personal liberty. Above all, he has got to reflect that he has to pay every respect&mdash;meticulous respect&mdash;to the rights of the representatives of the sovereign people&mdash;that is the Parliament.  Really, it is rather sad that after 25 years of political independence we should now have to emphasise these elementary rights of a <Col N="728" /> free people.  In so far as we have to do it, I feel this debate may have been of advantage, and if it is published I feel that it will show the country that this House, at least, is vigilant in the protection of the rights of a free people.</P>

      <P>I have seconded the motion which has been moved by Senator Sir John Keane.  I should like to say that, owing to circumstances beyond my own control, it will be necessary for me to leave the Chamber almost immediately after I have concluded my speech, and therefore I should like to apologise for the seeming discourtesy to you, Sir, to the Minister, and the House.  I have never met Dr. Vere Gregory, the author of this book, except casually and accidentally in the ante-room of this House, nor have I ever had any correspondence with him; but I have read this book with great interest, and I have had the advantage of seeing the letters which passed between his publishers, Messrs. Browne and Nolan, and the Controller of Censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say at the beginning that this is the kind of book that is altogether to my taste.  It is the sort of book that I have often encouraged other people to write, and have occasionally assisted people to write.  That is to say, it is largely a history of a family that has been domiciled in this country for many generations, and that, in the person of Dr. Vere Gregory, who lives in Donegal, is still here.  He is a cousin of Sir William Gregory, the celebrated husband of the still more celebrated Lady Gregory, who was one of the <Col N="729" /> founders of the Abbey Theatre.  His book contains an account of the Gregory family in Ireland, interspersed with the writer's own reminiscences and comments on current affairs.  The author was a County Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary during the closing years of that force.  Hence, he had personal knowledge of the disturbed and difficult period leading to the Treaty of 1921.  Naturally, in these personal reminiscences, there are a few stories about murders committed by both sides. Now, these are not picked for their sensationalism, but because they came his way or for some particular reason&mdash;for example, the shocking tragedy of Sir Arthur Vicars, of Kilmorna, near Listowel.  Another case, of which he had not personal knowledge, he tells&mdash;and the fact does him great credit&mdash;because he wished to clear the name of Lady Gregory, his kinswoman, of an absurd charge of collusion with certain people that had been made against her.  On this question of atrocity and counter-atrocity, I want to make this point&mdash;it is the kind of thing that is unavoidable in revolution. Arthur Griffith said at a time when such things were beginning to happen&mdash;and these are, I think, very important words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The military mind is the same in every country.  Our military men are as bad as the British.  They think of nothing but their own particular end and cannot be brought to consider the political consequences of their proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An astonishing fact&mdash;but it still is a fact&mdash;is that Dr. Vere Gregory is just as severe on the Black-and-Tans as he is on the Irish Republican Army&mdash;perhaps more severe.  For example, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such methods have failed to achieve their purpose in every country in which they have been employed. They certainly failed in Ireland.  During the Great War, they failed in Belgium.  In the case of Kevin Barry, the only result was to add another name to the roll of Irish martyrs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Including these occasional reminiscences and taking the book as a whole, <Col N="730" /> one might say that it is the book of a man whose heart is overflowing with charity and kindness.  He has no harsh word for any side.  Further, these passages form only a very small part of the book.  Any reviewer concentrating on them to the exclusion of the rest of the book would be writing a grossly unfair review.  I myself have seen no such review.  I doubt if any responsible reviewer in this country would write such a review.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the question of the law on the subject.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned that, but not quite in the way I should like to do, though there was nothing specially inaccurate in what he said.  The law is the Emergency Powers (No. 151) Order, 1942, Statutory Rules and Orders (No. 45), 1942, made by the Government in exercise of the powers conferred on them by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, on the day that Germany attacked Poland&mdash;1st September, 1939. The relevant provisions, in so far as books are concerned, are contained in Articles 4 and 5 of the Order.  I shall read the part of Article 4 which is applicable:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever an authorised person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is to say, the Minister or the Controller of Censorship or any such officer as defined in the Order&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;is of opinion that the publication of any matter contained in any document or the public exhibition of any document would be prejudicial to the public safety or the preservation of the State or the maintenance of public order or would be likely to lead to a breach of the peace or to cause offence to the people of a friendly foreign nation, he may, subject to the provisions of this Order, direct the seizure of such document.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the five causes or grounds for seizure and, in effect, &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; means what we call &ldquo;banning&rdquo;.  Note the five grounds&mdash;public safety, preservation of the State, maintenance of public order, breach of the peace and the causing of offence to people of a friendly nation.  Those are the only grounds.  Otherwise, any seizure&mdash; that is to say, any banning&mdash;of a book. <Col N="731" /> would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Order.  Of course, there is no legal redress for any action taken <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Next I quote Article 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where (a), a person who proposes to print, publish, distribute or sell any publication, submits such publication to an authorised person before so doing, and (b) such authorised person permits such printing, publishing, distributing, selling, no direction shall be given under Article 4 of this Order in respect of such publication.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, if a person submits his manuscript or typescript of a proposed book to the Censor and the Censor permits such printing, then the writer and the publisher can go ahead in the knowledge that, under this Order, the book cannot be banned, because no direction can be given under Article 4 in respect of it.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the actual time-table with regard to Messrs. Browne and Nolan's book, written by Dr. Vere Gregory.  According to the dates given to me, Messrs Browne and Nolan sent the galleys to the Controller of Censorship on the 18th June, 1943. That is to say, they complied with Article 5.  On the 29th June, the proofs were returned, stamped &ldquo;Passed by Censor,&rdquo; with the exception of certain passages marked &ldquo;Stopped by Censor&rdquo;.  I shall not go into the question raised by Senator Sir John Keane as regards certain deletions.  I understood the Minister to say that, so far as he was concerned, they were unimportant.  My friend, Senator Kingsmill Moore, points out to me that, in the concluding paragraph of the letter sent to the Managing Director of Messrs. Browne and Nolan on the 29th June, returning the galleys, the Controller of Censorship said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have delayed dealing with this matter in order that I might have an opportunity of consulting those who are wiser than myself.  This I have now done, and perhaps it was as well because my personal view was that Mr. Gregory's autobiography was too unimportant to matter, and I think that if I had been depending on my <Col N="732" /> private stock of wisdom I would not have bothered to make any changes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When he writes in that way, he is not offering criticism.  What he means is that, from his special point of view as Censor and in view of the number of copies proposed to be published, the question was too unimportant to matter.  But Senators will note that the controller wished to have an opportunity of consulting those who were wiser than himself: Who they might be is rather left to speculation. The proofs having been passed subject to deletion, the book came within Article 5.  That is, any power that might have existed to stop its sale had come to an end.  I am sorry to have to go through some of the points that have already been mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane but this is very necessary and important.  On the 22nd July, the proofs were asked for again.  In the absence of the controller on holiday, a telephone request was received from his deputy that the censored proofs be returned for a few days.  Actually, these few days lengthened into three weeks.  They were returned without any comment on the 14th August.  Now, this strikes me, and must strike any reasonable man, as very odd indeed.  The book had passed through the machinery provided in Article 5.  It had passed the the Censor.  The Censor was <i>functus officio</i> in regard to that book, if words mean anything, and yet it was requested that the galleys be sent back and they were kept for three weeks. I am coming back to that point again. I will leave it there now.</P>
    <P>The book was published on the 20th October.  The Censor's action in passing it under Article 5 having prevented its suppression, all possible steps were taken to prevent its sale.  As Senator Sir John Keane told you, the very mention of it in the publisher's catalogue was deleted.  Advertisements for it were not allowed by the Censor to appear.  So innocent a notice in the December number of <i>The Bell</i> as this: <i>&ldquo;The House of Gregory</i> comes from Browne and Nolan, Limited, at 15/-&rdquo; was blue-pencilled; and the reviews were stopped.  The managing director of Messrs. Browne and Nolan, Limited, <Col N="733" /> very properly, wrote to the Minister on the 3rd December, 1943:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir&mdash;On 20th October, 1943, this firm published on behalf of Dr. Vere Gregory, Laputa, Bally-shannon, County Donegal, a book entitled <i>The House of Gregory</i> at the published price of 15/-, being the story of the Gregory family in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Before publication, we submitted the book in galley proofs formally to the Controller of Censorship, who passed the work for publication, subject to certain suggested amendments all of which were, of course, gratefully accepted and carried out. Mr. Gregory paid the expenses of printing and publication and a limited edition of 1,000 copies of the book was produced.</P>
    <P>We have now learned, to our very great surprise, that certain reviews of the book have been censored, and have been refused publication, and in addition, that even references to the book in advertisements and book lists have been censored.  We are enclosing for your information a proof from the current issue of <i>The Bell</i> which the publishers of that magazine, as a matter of courtesy, have sent to us.  We have also been advised by the Censor that no mention of the book in the public Press will be permitted from now on.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I repeat that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have also been advised by the Censor that no mention of the book in the public Press will be permitted from now on.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for us to understand why publication of the book should be passed by the Censor, while references to it, even in so bald a form as &lsquo;Vere Gregory's autobiographical <i>The House of Gregory</i>, comes from Browne &amp; Nolan at 15/-' have been forbidden.</P>
    <P>Had we been advised by the authorities when the proof pages were submitted that publication was thought to be against the principles of the State, it is unnecessary to say that we would have loyally abided by that decision and not proceeded with publication.  The position now, however, <Col N="734" /> is that Dr. Gregory has incurred an expenditure of between £300 and £400, and, owing to the action of the censorship, as publishers we are unable to give him the service which is due to him to enable him to sell his book.  You will appreciate that a book essentially depends upon advertising and reviews, and to stop this is really to throttle at the source the sales of the book.</P>
    <P>We are enclosing for your information a copy of the book in question, and would with great respect submit that there is nothing in it which is in any way likely to affect the interests of the State.  We would also stress that the edition of 1,000 copies is a limited one.  There will not be a reprint of the book owing to the paper shortage, and in these circumstances we would appreciate if the decision of the authorities could be altered so as to permit the necessary reviews and advertisements.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">For Browne &amp; Nolan, Limited,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) R.A. NOLAN,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Managing Director.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This appallingly drastic action, confessedly, that no mention of the book in the public Press of any kind would be permitted from then on, was taken under the same statutory rule and order, but not under the same article. In the articles referring to newspapers there are no grounds given, but common sense suggests that the grounds are the same five grounds, because they cover everything that could be relevant: the security of the State, public safety, the preservation of the State, the maintenance of public order, a breach of the peace or causing offence to people of a friendly nation.  Though even the bare title was deleted from <i>The Bell,</i> and though the Censor's own ruling was that nothing would be permitted to appear in the papers, even there they are not consistent, because the following review did appear in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 15th November, 1943, that is 12 days later.  I am going to read this because it is a typical review and it has been allowed to be published.  It is a review by an anonymous reviewer of the book.  It <Col N="735" /> says in it nothing at all likely to cause a breach of the peace or at all likely to cause embroilment with the people of a friendly nation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The family of Gregory originated in England.  Members came over and settled in Ireland, where they acquired estates.  One of them took a considerable part in the defence of Derry, and afterwards settled in Kerry, while one of his sons preferred Galway.  The latter was father of Robert Gregory, who became chairman of the East India Company. It is said he left Galway as a stowaway, but he had introductions to prominent persons in India, and through these obtained a writership and clerkship in the company.  He managed to amass a fortune, and when little over 40 he returned to England, and thenceforward lived a life of affluence.  A descendant in the last century who served as Governor of Ceylon, and an English M.P., was the husband of the famous Augusta Lady Gregory who, having survived her husband for several decades, died only a few years ago.  The author of this family memoir was a cousin of Sir William Gregory.  He became a student of Trinity College, and graduated there in Arts and Law, and joined the old R.I.C. as a cadet. He was stationed in North Kerry during part of the &lsquo;Troubles', and subsequently in Antrim.  While in Kerry he had a day's fishing under the protection of an I.R.A. leader.  Unfortunately, he landed not a single fish. If he did, he would have it preserved as a fish poached by a police officer without a licence or the permission of the owner, under the auspices of an I.R.A. man.  In the North he did not find people so accommodating. He was asked by a fly-tying fanatic to secure feathers of a game-cock killed in November.  As a police officer, Mr. Gregory's duty was to put down cock-fighting.  But he could not let the angling friend down.  He made approaches to the proper quarters through the proper channels, but there was nothing doing.  The Northern cock-fighters were not as trustful or obliging as the Kerryman. The book contains grim and <Col N="736" /> humorous reminiscences of troubled times in Ireland, as well as memoirs of the author's ancestors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that reading material like this in a speech is apt to be boring, and I will only do it in so far as it seems to be necessary.  I have given the whole of that review in regard to this book which is regarded with such suspicion by the Censor that he attempts to kill it.  Either I am mad or the people who have censored the reviews of the book are mad.  There is only one clue to the reason for the Minister's action, and that is contained in the corresponence that passed between the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the Censor with reference to the review of <i>The House of Gregory</i> which was written and suppressed.  I propose to read that review and also the correspondence. These will be the last documents I shall read.  I know it is troublesome to hear documents read, but I think it is desirable that I should read these now.  The review in question was held by the Censor on November 9th, six days before the other review was published in the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  If I skip any part of it it might be suggested in good faith that I did so for some purpose.  Therefore, I shall read it all.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Gregory, now in the seventy-third year, joined the Royal Irish Constabulary after he had taken his M.A. and LL.B. degrees at Trinity College, Dublin.  He served as an officer in the force until it was disbanded, and has since spent some of his years of leisure compiling a history of the Gregory family.</P>
    <P>The Gregory tree traces its roots back to medieval Leicestershire and sent some of its branches to Ireland with Oliver Cromwell.  None of the off-shoots made any great mark in history, though a few of them played more than a minor part in affairs at home and abroad.  Perhaps that explains why the present author, having set out to recount the family fortunes, found his pen hampered by lack of material, and decided to fill up the vacant spaces with his own memoirs, and his comments on such things as occurred to him, following no set plan, and little concerned <Col N="737" /> about order or relevancy. One can only regret that he did not give us more of himself and less of his forbears.</P>
    <P>It was a cousin of his, Sir William Gregory, M.P., who in 1861 forced the Royal Dublin Society to open the Botanic Gardens to the public on Sundays.  He secured his object by moving in the House of Commons to strike out the Parliamentary grant for the gardens, thus forcing the Royal Dublin Society to give way.  Two years later he tried to secure the same rights in the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens, but failed, one Protestant clergyman declaring at a meeting of protest against the proposal that it was &lsquo;a painful thing to have the Scotch Sabbath interfered with by the representative of an Irish Papist constituency, one of the most degraded communities in the world.'</P>
    <P>One incredible story in connection with the Croke Park massacre in 1920 shows what a simple-minded man Mr. Gregory is.  He says that the officer in charge of the Black and Tans who raided the ground served under him at a later date.  &lsquo;He told me his orders were to search the crowd, and if any opposition was offered he was to fire and shoot as many of the Tipperary team as possible, and on no account to let Hogan escape.  Accordingly, he included in his party a man whom he knew to be a dead shot with a rifle.  He asserted that on arrival at Croke Park some shots were fired at his party.... Hogan was pointed out to the marksman, who put his rifle to his shoulder, pressed the trigger, and Hogan dropped dead.  One of his companions exclaimed: &ldquo;What a damned fluke!&rdquo;&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo;  he replied. &ldquo;Watch the ball...&rdquo;  The ball was still in play....  The marksman again raised his rifle, fired, and the football collapsed, literally like a pricked bladder.&rsquo; Mr. Gregory has good sense enough not to commit himself to belief in this fantastic story.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gregory, however, does vouch for the truth of the following story: On the eve of his execution, Kevin <Col N="738" /> Barry was taken to the spot where the gallows stood, and told he would get a free pardon if he betrayed the names of his comrades: &lsquo;Whether this offer was officially authorised or not I cannot say.  In any case, Barry is said to have made no reply, but to have continued to examine the gallows.  Then, putting his hand on it, he remarked: &ldquo;It seems strong enough to bear my weight, anyhow.&rdquo; '</P>
    <P>How the poteen traffic provided a quaint industry is related in the author's memoirs.  The local blacksmith made the stills.  At intervals the blacksmith, by way of blackmail, reminded his customers to buy a new still.  They did not dare to refuse. The blacksmith would then conceal the old still on a bog, inform the police, and collect his reward.  Each of the police in turn would then get their reward for the capture of the still.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gregory's pen is steeped in charity.  He writes without any tinge of bitterness of the events during the troubled years, and he is outspoken in his condemnation of the murders and the outrages committed by the Black and Tans.  It is an old-world kind of book, dull in patches, but for the most part readable and even entertaining.  But at 15/- for 200 pages, it is far too dear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was completely obliterated by the blue pencil of the Censor.  The Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, in which the review was due to appear, wrote to the Controller of Censorship on November 15th as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For my guidance, I would be glad to know the reasons for prohibiting the review of the book <i>The House of Gregory,</i> submitted on the 9th inst.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 17th November this reply &mdash;the only one I know of&mdash;was received:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to your letter of the 15th instant, I have to inform you that your review headed &lsquo;R.I.C. Officer's Memories&rsquo; was stopped because its publication would inevitably lead to <Col N="739" /> controversy harmful to national security.  No useful purpose could be served at the moment by stirring up bitter memories of the Black-and-Tan atrocities.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">J.J. PURCELL,</P>
    <P Just="Right">for Controller.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I expect, the Editor rubbed his eyes when he read that.  He replied as follows, on November 18th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir&mdash;I have your letter of the 17th instant.  You have on a former occasion made a ruling that references to the Civil War of 1922-23 would endanger our neutrality.  I note that you have now decided that references to the Black-and-Tan period might also endanger &lsquo;national security'.  For our guidance will you please let me know at what period we are to stop in making references to events in Irish history if we are not to endanger &lsquo;national security'?  May we safely refer to the Land League, the Fenian period or the Insurrection of 1798, without imperilling our neutrality in 1943 or 1944?</P>
    <P>I am, of course, presuming that it was for the same reason, viz., to protect our neutrality that you banned the reference to the opening of the Botanic Gardens in 1861, the reference to the poteen traffic of 50 years ago, and the incident which was cited to show the bravery of Kevin Barry on the eve of his execution 23 years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like further to know why if a few extracts from the book are likely to lead to an invasion of Éire the whole book itself was passed for publication by you, as I presume it was.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">F.J. GEARY,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Editor.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reply and there never has been a reply. Courtesy also demanded a reply to the letter sent by the managing director of Browne and Nolan.  There has been no reply, according to my information, to that letter either.  Another review was written for another paper. <Col N="740" /> The editor was told over the telephone that the review was completely unobjectionable, but that it could not be printed, as all reviews were banned, and there were some words conveying the impression that the book had wrongly been passed by the Censor. Now, that has no evidential value whatever, because this Emergency Powers (No. 151) Order provides that directions by the Censor may be given in writing, verbally, or by telephone.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in writing about that, and so the poor wretches of journalists who have to work under this abominable system cannot follow the sound maxim laid down by Lorelei in <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Always get it in writing&rdquo;.  In that letter I have quoted from the Controller of Censorship to the editor of the <i>Independent</i>, he says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Publication would inevitably lead to controversy harmful to national security.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to examine this in the light of what I have said.  The deletion of the title of this book, which had been passed, from the publisher's catalogue &mdash;how is that harmful to national security?  Or this deletion from <i>The Bell:</i>&ldquo;<i>The House of Gregory</i> comes from Browne and Nolan at 15/-.&rdquo;  How can that be harmful to national security?</P>
      <P>References to the Black-and-Tan period in the book are incidental, and in any review that chose to mention them they would almost certainly be incidental.  References in the banned review in the <i>Independent</i> were incidental&mdash;a mere short bit of the whole review.  Why, then, should not the Censor merely delete those passages from the review and let the rest of it stand?  Surely to goodness, blue pencils are not in short supply in the Censor's department?  Is it not the universal custom to censor a word, to delete a sentence, or even a paragraph? But here, the whole review is deleted, and described as objectionable matter. It does not make sense, and, of course, it is grossly unjust.  He says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Publication would inevitably lead to controversy harmful to national security.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Now, what does that mean?  Does it mean a threat to internal order?  If so, it is quite unnecessary for me to deal with that, because, of course, it is plain nonsense.  Does it mean a threat to good relations with a friendly people, namely, Great Britain?  These are questions I want the Minister to give a reply to, in accordance with the terms of the motion.  Does it mean a threat to good relations with Great Britain? If so, the book itself should have been banned.  The second point is that English people will see English reviews of the book, which the Minister has no power to censor.  English people will not see the Irish reviews.  Therefore, they are unlikely to be affected <i>en masse</i> by any review, however strong, which the Minister might allow to appear in an Irish paper.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not know it, I tell him, out of a lifetime's experience, that the British are a large-minded and tolerant people.  What stopped the Black-and-Tan atrocities?  Public opinion in England&mdash;the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, men like J.L. Hammond. They were the people who finally stopped the atrocities here.  At the moment, public opinion in England is not wholly preoccupied with Irish affairs.  Certain stories in the book, when one considers the Englishman's mentality, might conceivably do good. There is a story in the book&mdash;I am not going to go into the details&mdash;describing an act of gross cruelty by the Black-and-Tans, and the writer leaves us in no doubt as to his opinion of that gross cruelty.  I say that stories like that would influence an Englishman into admitting that we have something to growl about even though it was 25 years ago.  Otherwise, if you start telling an Englishman of things which occurred 25 years ago&mdash;the ordinary kind of Englishman in Liverpool, Manchester or Birmingham&mdash;he would probably answer between his yawns that we had had a bad show but that there is no use in worrying about it now.</P>
    <P>Here is another point.  About five or six weeks ago there was an acrimonious debate in the House of Commons after the release under Article 18 (b), Defence of the Realm Regulations, of Sir Oswald Mosley, the <Col N="742" /><i>soi-disant</i> Leader of the British Fascist movement.  References were made in that debate by Members of Parliament to the tragic end of Terence MacSwiney.  British M.P.s in the House of Commons strongly contrasted the treatment meted out under Article 18 (b) to this millionaire Mosley with his Black Shirt, with the fact that the British Government let Terence MacSwiney die.  Now, Sir, in this free institution, the House of Commons, one of the greatest free institutions in the world, that statement was made. It was quoted in full in the <i>Times</i>, the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> the <i>Birmingham Post</i>, and other strongly conservative and in past years anti-Irish papers.  I heard it myself in the naturally short summary of Parliamentary news given by the B.B.C. at 9 o'clock.  This point about Terence MacSwiney was brought out and stressed by the British themselves. They are able, after an interval of 25 years, to deal with these matters in that way, and we are told childishly that a review of a rather non-controversial book is to go, lest, presumably, England should fall on us. It sounds ridiculous, but that is a fact.</P>
    <P>Sir John Keane referred to a very excellent book on the Citizen Army. I shall say nothing about that except that it does point the contrast.  I will quote another reference&mdash;it is my last quotation&mdash;and it will be very short.  It is a sentence, picked literally at random, from a book published by Messrs. M. H. Gill and Sons in 1942, pages 94 to 95.  This book was not banned and was not censored, so far as I have heard, and it was certainly reviewed without censorship.  I shall give you the name of it&mdash;<i>The Life of Cathal Brugha</i> by Seán Ó Ceallaigh, that is &ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo;.  I think everybody in this House knows who Cathal Brugha was. He was Minister for Defence in the first Dáil Eireann.  He sided with the Party that went against the Treaty in 1921.  He was prominent in the civil war that followed, and he died gallantly in O'Connell Street during the civil war.  Now, that man lived through the troubled period.  His biographer, Seán O Ceallaigh&mdash;&ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo;&mdash;is of his political way of thinking, and, very naturally, his book is bound to be prejudiced against the <Col N="743" /> Black-and-Tans and in favour of the I.R.A.  In that biography, there is no such balance as there is in the book written by Dr. Gregory.  I am afraid that it would be putting too much strain on human nature to expect &ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo; to say a good word for the Black-and-Tans or to say a bad word against the I.R.A.  However, in that connection, I should like to give a quotation from the book written by &ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo;.  It is written in Irish, and I shall quote it in Irish, and give a short translation in English of it afterwards.  The quotation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I dtosach an Abráin dhein an Crón-stoc slighe nuadh dunmharbhtha do nochtadh: tógadh beirt fhear as a leabaidh agus lámhchadh iad i gCondae na Gaillimhe; deineadh amhlaidh le ceathrar i Ros Comáin is le triúr i dTír Eoghain, agus dhein lucht Conganta an Chróin-stoic beirt bhreitheamh de chur i n-a dtost.  Deineadh Tráighlí do shuathadh ó bhonn arís de bhrígh gur lámhchadh feadhmanach de'n Chrón-stoc ann, agus tugadh athshuathadh do Bhéal an Atha fá cheann seachtmhaine.  Deineadh mna do lámhach nó do leónadh go minic, deineadh gruag chailínidhe do bhearradh, is móran daoine do ghabháil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I shall roughly translate that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the beginning of April....</P>
    <P>that would be April of 1921,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the Black-and-Tans devised a new method of murder.  Two men were taken from their beds and shot in County Galway.  The same thing was done with four men in Roscommon and with three in Donegal, and the Auxiliaries silenced two judges. Tralee was thoroughly beaten up again because an officer of the Black-and-Tans was shot there, and a renewal of the beating up, lasting a week, was given to Ballina.  Women were shot or wounded frequently. Girls' hair was cut off, and numbers of people were seized.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is a perfectly straight quotation from a book dealing with that period, and I am sure that you will see <Col N="744" /> the extraordinary contrast between the treatment given by &ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo; to that particular period and that given by Dr. Gregory.  I am coming now, Sir, to a conclusion.  My object in all this was to try to get behind the Minister's mind in regard to his action in this matter.  I am afraid I must say that I am driven to the conclusion, and it is my belief, that after the book had been passed by the Controller of Censorship &mdash;and you will remember that the book was recalled for three weeks and then sent back to the author&mdash;the Minister came on the scene and resented, not references to atrocities committed by the Black and Tans, but those mentioned as having been committed by the other side, and determined with spiteful petulance to prevent the sale of the book by every and any lawful means in his power&mdash;he having estopped himself from banning the book.  I have mentioned both the Black and Tans and the I.R.A., but I should like to say that I did not mention these matters by way of drawing a red herring across the track.  The final verdict must be left to the historian of the future.  It must be left to a time when all of us here have passed beyond these voices, and we must await the charity and the tolerance such as living men are not always prepared to extend to each other, and certainly not prepared to extend to each other in the measure shown by the author of this book.  We may hope, too, for a measure of reconcilement in the whole territory of Ireland at some time in the future, although, perhaps, not in our lifetime, and if we do not get that reconcilement, then, as a student of history, I tell you that there is no hope for unity in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, in conclusion, I am going to ask the Minister certain questions.  Was it at his request that the galley proofs, after having been passed by the Censor, were returned to the Censor on 22nd July and retained for three weeks? Why were the trivial deletions made from <i>The Bell,</i> the catalogue, and so on; and what potential infringement of the rules of censorship was occasioned by the publication of reviews?  That is to say, in connection with the maintenance of public order or the prevention <Col N="745" /> of a breach of the peace or any cause of danger to the people.  On which of these grounds is the Minister electing to stand?  Why were not the objectionable parts of the reviews blue-pencilled, leaving the rest for publication?  In other words, why was not the ordinary day-to-day practice of the censorship followed in this case?</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask whether the debate that has taken place to-day in this House will be censored in to-morrow's newspapers.  Will the gentlemen of the Press behind me in this House be free to publish whatever part they wish to publish of what was said to-day in this allegedly free Assembly in their papers to-morrow? I want an answer to those questions, and I think we are entitled to ask for a reply.  If the Minister's replies are unsatisfactory, or not frank, then I think I am entitled to conclude that the Minister was not acting in his quasi-judicial capacity as the Minister in control of censorship, but that he has retained, though I state it with great regret, the mentality of a former Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army.  In that case the only thing left for me is to apply to him this line from the famous Sixth Satire of Juvenal: &ldquo;<i>Hoc volo, sic jubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas.</i>&rdquo;&ldquo;This I wish; thus I command; let my will stand in place of a reason.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that our proceedings now are far removed from the case that was made by Senator Sir John Keane.  The principle involved here&mdash;that is, the suppression of publications after publication&mdash;is one that greatly interests writers and authors in this country, and, as one who is interested in that matter, I should like to refer to it. Certain organisations of authors and writers, such as the P.E.N. Club, who are very much interested in this matter, have been considering it for some time, and writers and authors are very much afraid of what may happen to publications of any sort if the statements made by Senator Sir John Keane are correct.  Personally, judging by what was deleted from the book in question, I think it would have been wiser if the Minister, on the very <Col N="746" /> first day, had completely censored the whole production.  There are things mentioned in the book which might not be in the best of good taste, because many of us who are still alive were there in Croke Park on that occasion, known as Bloody Sunday, and I think that many of us probably would be disturbed, to say the least of it, by the author's seeming flippancy in dealing with the death of Seán Hogan.  I do not say that he meant to be flippant, but I believe in the same ideal for which Seán Hogan died, and I think that any possible chance of a misinterpretation of that ideal, through any publication of this sort, is a thing that the Minister, as the Minister in charge of censorship, should guard against.</P>
      <P>My trouble about the whole matter is that it would be better probably the first day that the book were never published.  Irish authors had for a very considerable time many difficulties to contend with.  They had censorship in one form or another, on the merits or demerits of which I am not going to dwell, but the position is that literature in this country, whether we think it is good, bad, moral or immoral, has to a certain extent been stifled by the fear that the publication of a work to which a man has given considerable time and effort in the writing of it and in surmounting the difficulties of publication may come under the censorship ban.  If it is true that subsequent to the publication of the book the Minister did suppress in any way reviews on this book, I would say that it is highly undesirable in the interests of Irish literature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I understand also that the Minister has very wide powers in relation to censorship, and if he felt that, on reconsideration of the printed matter, it was not in the national interest that it should be reviewed, I suppose there is a case to be made for him, too.  I am only trying to point out that whatever action he did take is going to have a serious reaction on the production of Irish literature, and I am quite sure, knowing the Minister as I do, that he would have as little desire as I would that any reaction of that sort should <Col N="747" /> take place.  I am in a peculiar position, because Senator Sir John Keane asked us to look upon this matter as jurymen and not from the standpoint of Party allegiance, which to me was a most extraordinary statement coming from an old member of the House who must be aware by this time that there are no Parties in this House.  I will admit that as a young member I had not discovered it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Sir John has that type of mind that I cannot recreate at this late hour of his life. At any rate, he does assume the worst in this matter.  I agree with him that if the Minister did act, as he suggested, after the publication of the book; if he did suppress the reviews and newspaper reports upon it, he did something that I think is undesirable from the point of view of the furtherance of Irish literature, and is going to have severe reaction among Irish writers.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I cannot help relating the fact that possibly even Ministers make mistakes, and that perhaps, realising that he made a mistake in allowing publication in the first instance, that that was the reason that he forbade it.  I am prepared rather to listen to his defence than to convict him as a juryman.  Irish writers are considerably perturbed about this matter. Whether he has a good defence or a bad one, I do not know, but Irish writers are beset by all sorts of difficulties, and if they are now going to face the position that, after publishing a book, reviews can be suppressed and the means of sales stopped, it is going to be a bad day for Irish literature.  I am quite certain, knowing the Minister as I do, and that he is as literary-minded as most men in this Assembly, that he is not one who would stand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather worried as to the way <Col N="748" /> he carried out this form of suppression. I am not so much interested in the matter as in the principle involved.  If it is as Sir John Keane says, it is a violation of literary freedom, and it is, in this case at any rate, a personal injustice.  I would like to hear the Minister because I am of opinion that he may have a good defence, and I am further of that feeling because the very deletions which Sir John mentioned were enough to my mind for the complete suppression of the book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there is still some doubt in the minds of Senators as to the necessity for an explanation of the Minister's action.  I hope I shall be able to clear away that doubt by reminding them of a few salient points.  Mr. Gregory, a man who had retired after a long and active life, has devoted his time, his leisure, his experience and his money to compiling a history of the very remarkable family of which he is proud to be a member.  He has started from the twelfth century, through that Gregory who was the standard bearer of Simon de Montfort who died at Evesham down to the Lady Gregory of our own time, a lady whom some of us were proud to know, her son who inspired three of the noblest poems of the noblest poet the Irish nation has ever produced, down to himself and the last male descendant of the race, his son, now serving in the Royal Navy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a book might have been dull. It might have been a collection of pedigrees and genealogies, but fortunately the Gregorys do not lend themselves to dullness, and so we have a book which is not merely a pious family record but a book which holds out great promise of entertainment to the people of Ireland who read it.  They will read there of cock-fighting and of duelling, of horse races, of fishing and of shooting&mdash;things <Col N="751" /> which the Irishman likes.  They will read of an Irishman who left Ireland as a cabin boy or stowaway and who rose to the position of head of the East India Company.  They will read of an Under-Secretary who kept office for twenty years and of another Gregory who was for twenty-five years a most remarkable member for Irish constituencies. And these are only some of the characters.  I say without hesitation that it is not merely from the point of view of Mr. Gregory that I think the Minister has to make his explanation, but from the point of view of the Irish public who are entitled to know about the past history of Ireland, who are interested in the manners and modes of the people of this country and who are entitled also to know the experiences of people who have lived through portions of history and can testify the truth for themselves.  All that is to be found in this book.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Gregory had finished this book, having expended his time and his labour, and having put down a sum of £500 to publish it, he submitted it to the person whom the Minister has nominated as the judge of whether a book contains anything objectionable or not.  It came back with certain passages deleted, and they were deleted, save for one passage which was transposed to a place where it could not be objectionable, as the Minister admits. The book was sent back to be considered by higher authority, apparently the Minister.  It was returned with no further comments and no objection.  To the labour of the author was added the labour of the publisher and his workmen, and finally the book saw the light, having received from the Minister and his Department not merely the <i>nihil obstat,</i> but the <i>imprimatur.</i>  And then everything is done to garrotte this book.</P>
    <P>What would Senators say if, in an ordinary matter of business, one man were to encourage another in a course of action, knowing that he was spending a considerable amount of money &mdash;perhaps more money than he could afford&mdash;and were to say to him: &ldquo;Go on with your course of action.  If you make a slight modification, you may <Col N="752" /> fear nothing from me&rdquo;; and then when the enterprise is launched, having imposed his conditions upon him, were to say: &ldquo;No; I will step in and do everything I can to kill your enterprise&rdquo;? If that were to be done between ordinary business men, what language would be used by any Senator to describe such a proceeding? I cannot suggest it because such language would be unparliamentary. That, however, is what the Minister has done and that is one of the things of which I call upon the Minister to give an explanation&mdash;encouraging a person to spend money and then trying to prevent him from reaping the fruits of his expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is no good saying, as has already been suggested: &ldquo;But the Minister has not killed the book.&rdquo;  I believe he has not killed it; I hope he has not killed it; and I hope he never will be able to kill a book by such methods.  Although you can censor books or papers, you cannot muzzle the tongue of the people of Ireland, and so long as methods, such as these, so exceptional, so extraordinary, so inexcusable, are used by the Minister, the tongue of the people of Ireland is going to wag, and if there is any man who has any curiosity in his nature he will find out, or try to find out, the reason for such methods.  If there is left in this country one man of an independent character, with a spark of human independence, with the power in him to feel resentful that anybody should interfere with his right to investigate history and to know facts, I hope, and I believe, and I pray to God that such an action will be resented and will be resented by people who will read the book, despite any attempts to ban it.  I owe a certain amount of thanks to the Minister.  But for the action of the Minister, it is most unlikely that I should have heard of the book and still more unlikely that I should have read it.  Now, I have had the pleasure of doing both. It does not matter that the Minister has not been able to kill it&mdash;the important matter is that he has tried. I want an explanation as to why the Minister has tried to kill this book.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which some people <Col N="753" /> may take lightly.  I confess that I do not.  There must be in these matters some principle.  When I first heard that the book was banned, I assumed that the Minister had banned it for a very good reason, and that he could enunciate here some principle upon which he was entitled to ban it.  I got the book and I read it twice.  I could see nothing in the book on which anybody in Ireland or in England&mdash;to quote the old phrase, wet or dry&mdash; could justify its banning; but I, still assumed that, although there might be no reason which was obvious to me or which would be obvious to the normal man, there was a reason which the Minister himself believed to be a good reason.</P>
    <P>Realising that the Minister might have different views from mine, I waited to hear what was his reason which would not commend itself, as I believe, to me, but which might commend itself to the Minister as a good, honest and adequate reason.  I was very much shaken as to the possibility of the Minister believing in his own reason, when I found that the notice of the debate had itself been censored, and that, when it appeared, it was only in a mangled form.  It struck me that, if the Minister believed in his case, he would have been anxious to advertise the fact that this debate was being held, and anxious to avail himself of this opportunity to put forward his reasons for the action he had taken; but when the Minister used his thunder, I began to have suspicions that, in his own heart, the Minister knew he had no case.  I was reminded of a pleasant story by one of the Greeks&mdash;I think it was Lucian&mdash;in which he described how Jove came from the mountain-top down to talk with a countryman.  They discussed about it and about for some considerable time.  Jove admitted that the countryman was often right, and the countryman admitted that Jove was often right, but when it came to a final judgment on some warmly disputed point, the irate Jove turned to the countryman and said: &ldquo;There will be no argument on that or I will use my thunder&rdquo;, whereupon the countryman remarked: &ldquo;When Jove uses his <Col N="754" /> thunder, it is because he knows that he is wrong.&rdquo;  When the Minister censored notice of the fact that there was to be a debate on this question in this House, and allowed it to appear only in a mutilated form, then, remembering the old story, I said to myself: &ldquo;Jove has used his thunder and he has used it because he knows that he is wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, is he going to go further?  Is he going to censor facts which have come out in this debate? Is he going to censor what I am now saying or is he going to give the Press full liberty to publish a report of these proceedings?  Is he going to proceed from excess to excess? Let the Minister who is responsible for censorship, read something of the history of censorship and he will find that it has been a universal experience that censorship proceeds from excess to excess in an attempt to cover up its own blundering faults.  This was a blunder or a mistake made by the Minister.  Is he going to try to cover up that mistake by preventing the publication of the report of this debate?  This much I say without fear of contradiction, that unless censorship is used with the greatest possible caution and the greatest possible discretion, it becomes a monster and turns on those people who are responsible for it&mdash;a Frankenstein monster or, as was suggested to me, a Frank-aikenstein monster.  In all earnestness, as a person who has at heart the liberty of the subject and liberty of speech more than anything else on this earth, I do implore the Minister to use this weapon with prayer and fasting because if he is not careful this monster will turn upon him and entirely devour him.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons why I desire that an explanation should be given; but most of all do I desire that Senators, authors and editors should know what is the principle which governs the Censor in the exercise of his powers.  We are entitled to know it.  If this book and its treatment can be taken as a test, you are not going to find it within the four corners of the Emergency Order.  The only principle which I have been able to ascertain <Col N="755" /> which covers the case of a book which is passed by the chief Censor, passed by the superior authority, whoever that may be, and subsequently subjected to an attempt to strangle it, is the principle which has been enunciated by Senator Donal O'Sullivan: &ldquo;My wish is my command; my caprice is all the justification you can demand or you can get.&rdquo;  That is the only discernible principle which can govern the action of a Department which says at one time &ldquo;You may publish&rdquo; and afterwards tries to prevent the author from getting sale for his book.  That is a very well-known principle and there are a number of people who approve of it.  It is the principle of unlimited autocracy, a theory of government widely held on the Continent, though not so widely held now, perhaps, as a few years ago.  It has also been widely held in the countries of South America, though I observe there have been some defections recently from it.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear what the principle is: you can sanction a thing at one moment and then go back on your decision. That is the principle of unlimited autocracy, tempered neither by reason nor by any popular restraint.  If we want it, let us have it, but let us know where we are.  Let us face the fact that that is what is being nakedly done in this case.  I do not imagine that the Irish people are going to take kindly to a Government of Ministers sitting upon a private Olympus from which they distribute showers of Emergency Orders to fall as a kind of bewildering snowstorm on the heads of the populace. That is what is implied in actions such as this, that the Minister's order by itself is sufficient, and that we are not entitled to call on the Minister for an explanation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  May I on a point of explanation, try to save the <Col N="756" /> Senator from further mistakes?  I desire that the orderly procedure of this House be observed on this occasion as heretofore.  Formerly we had motions of this type, to wit, &ldquo;That the Seanad is of opinion that X is Y&rdquo;, and, when the question was put from the Chair, what was voted on and determined was whether or not the Seanad was of opinion that X was Y, or that the Seanad had the reverse opinion.  Now, owing to the Parliamentary ineptitude of Senator Sir John Keane in drafting this motion, the motion as it stands reads: &ldquo;That the Seanad invites an explanation.&rdquo;  Apart from the merits or the demerits of the case, or any correctness or incorrectness in any speech made, all I ask is that the vote be taken on the question: &ldquo;That the Seanad invites the Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I appreciate at once what has been said.  May I say that I realise that I was guilty of a terminological inexactitude?  The way I put it is this: apparently when all the speeches are over, a vote will be taken in this House as to whether in the opinion of this House an explanation is called for.  All I am suggesting now is that on the facts laid before this House that vote should be unanimous when it is called for.  I am asking this House to say that if it finds a man encouraged to spend his time and money on a tacit, if not expressed, representation, that he will be allowed to reap the fruit of his labours, and if subsequently an effort is made to prevent him doing so, that it at least requires an explanation.  I am asking this House to vote unanimously that if the official Censor puts his stamp &ldquo;Passed by the Censor&rdquo; on a book, save such portions as are subsequently <Col N="757" /> excised, and if the proofs so marked are returned for consideration by a higher authority who makes no further comment, then when that book is published it should be allowed to have the ordinary publicity which every publisher of a book expects.</P>
      <P>If it is the intention of a higher authority when the proofs are submitted for the second time to take an action like this in the future, it would at least be consonant with the principles of elementary fairness to give some indication of it.  I ask further for an explanation how there can be such a divergence of policy.  I ask for an explanation on principle as to why matters are censored.  I ask for an explanation as to how this action can be brought within the framework of this Order, and I ask, in the name of all the people in Ireland who are writing or reading, that we should receive plain simple rules for our guidance.</P>
      <P>We have, in this House to-day, been treated to one classical quotation, and I add to it the words of the dying Ajax: &ldquo;<i>En de phaei kai olesson</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If you are going to destroy us will you give us light as to why you are doing it?&rdquo;  I call again upon the Minister for explanation.  I call upon this House to leave the matter beyond doubt, and to say that this is a thing which on the face of it is inexplicable: that it not merely requires an explanation but unless adequately explained, it redounds to the eternal discredit of those who are responsible for it.</P>
      <P>I do hope that Senators, by their vote, are going to show their sympathy with the ordinary man who is earning his living, and who demands that he should not be unnecessarily interfered with, and their sympathy with the man who wants to write those things which seem good to him, and with the people who are entitled to inform their minds on questions of fact, whether the Minister, or the Minister's representatives, do or do not agree with either their accuracy or the point of view expressed.</P>

      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore gave me a bit of advice&mdash;that the censorship <Col N="758" /> should move with the greatest possible caution.  Well, I think that the censorship moved with the greatest possible caution in this particular case, and that is why we have got into trouble.  There were two things that could have been done when the proofs of this particular book were submitted for censorship: one was to stop it, and the other was to pass it.  I got the impression&mdash;I do not know how it arose, but it has been borne out by some of the things said here to-day&mdash;that this was the reminiscences of a rather old gentleman who wanted to put his family history on record while he was in retirement.  I have sympathy with anybody who wants to do that sort of thing.  I got the impression that this was a book which was for private circulation.  I was wrong there.</P>
      <P>We tried, in dealing with the book, to allow the author to do what it seemed he originally set out to do: that was to tell the story of his own family&mdash;his own history&mdash;and matters of that kind, and we only deleted from it those passages in which the author sought to tell another country how they should run the war, and how they could have won it.  I have no objection to an ex-British civil servant or officer of any kind telling the British Government how they should run their affairs.  But if I had allowed it in this particular case, instead of being criticised for stopping the reviews of this book I would probably have had to face criticism here to-day from exactly the same speakers, as to why we allowed criticisms of the British Government to be published here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not run the censorship, as Senator Sir John Keane indicated here to-day, in the way that he thought we do&mdash;because of what other countries may think of us.  I do not think that actions of other countries are going to be conditioned by what we do here in the line of publication. If other countries wanted to take action here they would base their action on what they would make out would be very good grounds, notwithstanding what was allowed or prohibited publication here by the Censor.  Now, we allowed the book <Col N="759" /> to be published with certain deletions. We have not banned the book as a couple of speakers alleged. The book is not banned, and anybody who is going to pay 15/- for it on the understanding that it is a banned book, well, he will not be getting a banned book.  The book is on sale for anybody who has 15/- to pay for it, and who wants to pay that sum for it. When I heard Senator Kingsmill Moore's enthusiasm about the book, I thought that he was losing his time here, and that it would be well worth his while going over to Hollywood as a good writer-up of publicity puffs for films.  Anybody who wants to pay 15/- for this particular book can go down the city and get it.  It is not banned and it has not been killed.</P>
    <P>But what was done was that, even though we allowed this book to be published, we stopped the reviews which, from the first review that appeared in the censorship office, showed quite clearly that it was going to lead to bitter controversy here, one side holding that the Croke Park massacre was one of the bloodiest items in British Imperial history, deliberate and cruel, and the other side trying to contend that it was, as Mr. Gregory's subordinate made it out, a deliberate murder of a single man in football togs.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a controversy on these lines is going to do anybody any good at the present time.  If we are to have a very hot controversy here on what happened in the Tan war, we may split the unity of our people, and the net result will be that the people will lose their balance on the whole affair, and it is not neutral a lot of them will be.  We, as a neutral people, are prepared to allow the four main contending parties in this war to fight it out among themselves without interference by us.  We do not want to interfere either in their propaganda war, for or against any of them.  I certainly do not want to see our people losing their balance and forgetting that the issues of this war, as stated by any of the belligerents, have not commended themselves to them by the stirring up of bitter memories of the Black and Tan war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> We had one very slight indication here to-night of how some people would regard the callous way in which the story of the Croke Park massacre was told in the book, and how they would regard the author of this particular book consorting with and having this man as a subordinate for some time after he had, as he said himself, told the author he had taken charge of the British guns at Croke Park.  The people of this country feel very bitterly about that, and there were quite a number of people at Croke Park, who fought in the last war, who would be jumping into print to say that the Croke Park massacre was not a single shot fired at a single individual, but was an indiscriminate machine-gunning of all who were there that day, irrespective of whether they fought for freedom and democracy in the 1914-1918 war.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane was very amusing when he tried to sell the idea here to-day that this ex-R.I.C. officer, even though he may be a very estimable gentleman, was a martyr for freedom, something like John Brown&mdash;&ldquo;John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the grave, but his soul goes marching on&rdquo;.  The idea that because we prevent reviews of an ex-R.I.C. man's book here, reviews that might tend to disrupt our unity at the moment, we are in any way making him into a John Brown&mdash;John Brown who was the martyr, whose name was used when Lincoln was fighting to preserve the unity of the country&mdash;could only be put forward by somebody like Senator Sir John Keane, who is completely divorced from and who has a very bad appreciation of both Irish history and American history.</P>

      <P>Now, the American Civil War was fought on the issue whether there was to be union or disunion. Lincoln fought and the Northern troops fought that war for the unity of America with the name of John Brown on their lips and on their banners.  The Senator spoke to-day about the banning of views and news here.  There is no other <Col N="761" /> country in the world at the present time, I maintain, where the people have had a better and a clearer opportunity of getting all the news of this war in an unbiassed manner.  There has not been a single bit of news from the beginning of the war that was worth talking about that has been banned in our papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <P>Does that apply to domestic news?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestic news is not banned unless it cuts across national security.  There has not been a single word uttered by any of the leaders of any country, whether they were Prime Ministers or sovereign heads, that has been banned by the Irish Censor&mdash;not a single one.  I should like to know in what other country have the people an opportunity of reading every word that has been said by these people without the censorship operating. What we have objected to, and what we have stood firmly against, is our people being oppressed by a barrage of propaganda from one side into taking a completely unbalanced view of what is going on in the world.  That is what is objected to, not the censorship.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane reminded me that his mind was conditioned by what he read in Milton.  Milton, so far as I know, was for freedom of the Press and freedom of the individual when he wanted to write an article in favour of divorce after he fell out with his wife; but when he was appointed as Cromwell's secretary, or under-secretary, he was against the freedom of the Press and he became the censor of the Press.  When Cromwell insisted that every clergyman should not only be appointed by the State, by him as head of the State, but that he should obey every State order, his secretary was the great Milton, who was supposed to be the principal champion of freedom.  There are some gentlemen of that type who want to be free to do just what they like, but they do not always exercise their freedom in such a manner as will not oppress the majority of their fellow-beings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we had Senator Sir John <Col N="762" /> Keane talking about <i>Orange Terror.</i> We allowed <i>Orange Terror</i> to be published here and we allowed every comment upon it to be published here. The people who most object to the censorship that was established here in order to keep this country out of the war and in order to defend the country&mdash;the people connected with one of the papers in this part of the country&mdash;are the very people who themselves exercise a censorship. You have only to look at the papers of the other day to see how one important bit of news was censored, when the Under-Secretary of State up in the North thought it was a good job to kick a man out of the Orange Lodge because he went to quench his thirst in a Catholic public house, and he also thought it was a good thing that members of his religion should not employ members of any other religion.  That was cut out, censored by one of our papers here.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of editorial censorship that goes on all the time.  The editorial staff of that paper saw to it that the Irish people would not get the facts in the news.  We have allowed all the news to go through but we stopped the propaganda and we have enabled the Irish people to keep their balance during this disastrous war.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Donnell that the steps we took in this particular case were undesirable from the general point of view.  I explained the reasons why those steps were taken.  We want to have as much freedom for writers as is possible.  In this case, we took it that this was an old gentleman who wanted to record his reminiscences for his relations and we allowed publication of the book.  When the reviews which came in showed that the book was going to cause trouble for us here, we stopped those reviews without withdrawing the book from circulation.  You can have a very violent controversy, leading to trouble, in a paper that is published every day for 2d. or 3d. but you are not likely to have a very violent controversy if people have to publish 15/- books at one another.  We have taken quite a different line with books from that which we have taken with daily papers because of that fundamental <Col N="763" /> difference in their general function.  I can assure Senator O'Donnell that, so far as I am concerned, a similar incident will not arise again.  If we allow a book publication which, we think, is suitable only for circulation at 15/- a time, we shall warn the people concerned, if we think that a controversy on the book may lead to trouble, that release of the book for publication does not necessarily mean that all reviews of the book will be permitted publication.</P>

      <P>If the Senator was so interested in the publishers, it is strange that it was not the publishers' interests he was worried about when he spoke.  I think that I have dealt with virtually all the matters that were raised.  I want to say that, in dealing with this book, as in dealing with a newspaper, we did not act as we did to please anybody outside this country, but so as to give the greatest possible freedom to the citizens of the country, while preventing any bitter controversy arising which would destroy the balanced outlook of the people on the affairs of to-day.  I am sorry that the publishers concerned do not seem to have been fully aware of the law and of the Emergency Orders in this matter.  I am sorry for any inconvenience that has been caused them.  But, in the <Col N="764" /> last analysis, I am afraid that, in some cases, we may have to inconvenience individuals for the general good.  If we can achieve success in these matters, even by inconveniencing individuals, we shall not have done badly.</P>

When Senator Sir John Keane put down a motion on the Order Paper, it was submitted to the censorship by the newspapers and was stopped pending a meeting of this House.  We have prohibited newspapers, generally, from criticising in their editorial columns matter that has been refused publication in their news columns.  We have, generally taken the line that, when censorship is being brought forward for debate in the Dáil or Seanad, we should not allow the matter to be completely misrepresented by prior publication.  I think it was Senator Sir John Keane who made the point that there was no interference with the British Hansard. That is not my information.  Anybody who has been closely watching the matter knows perfectly well that that is not the situation.</P>
