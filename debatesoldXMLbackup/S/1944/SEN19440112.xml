      <P>Before we take up the business on the Order Paper I have a statement to make to the House and a ruling to give on a Bill entitled the Army Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1943, which raises the matter of the powers of the Seanad in regard to Bills known as Money Bills.</P>
      <P>On the 4th September of last year a Bill, entitled as I have described, was handed in to the Office by Senator Mulcahy, who stated it was his intention to introduce the Bill in the Seanad.  The Senator had as sponsors of the Bill two other Senators, a number which fulfilled the requirements of Standing Order No. 68 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business. Upon examination of the Bill an opinion was formed that the Bill came within the definition of a Money Bill set forth in Article 22, Section 1, sub-section (1) of the Constitution, and the Senator was advised that, if that opinion were upheld by the Cathaoirleach, it was considered the Bill could not be initiated in the Seanad.  Subsequently, the matter was referred to me and I agreed with the opinion which had been given to Senator Mulcahy, and directed, as it was the first occasion on which a Bill of that description had been tendered, that the matter should be put down for consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was considered by that Committee at its first meeting on Wednesday, 24th November.  For the purpose of its deliberations the Committee had before it a memorandum setting <Col N="314" /> forth the reasons relied upon for the opinion that the Bill was a Money Bill.  It is unnecessary to detail these reasons as the memorandum on the subject and other relevant documents are included in the minutes of the meeting of the Committee of that date.</P>
    <P>After a very full discussion, the Committee concurred with the opinion that the Army Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1943, was a Money Bill. The Committee was also in agreement:</P>
    <P>(i)  that in view of the provisions of the Constitution, Money Bills should not be accepted for initiation in the Seanad;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that non-Money Bills which, as a result of amendment made either on the Committee or Fourth Stages of a Bill, which brought the Bill within the definition of a Money Bill, should be withdrawn from the House on the Fifth Stage.</P>
    <P>The Committee was further of the view that the foregoing functions in regard to Money Bills should be exercised by the Cathaoirleach, who, however, before taking action, should consult with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>I was in agreement with the Committee on the latter point, and, further, promised the Committee that I would give a ruling on the Bill in the House with a view to having the precedent, and also the conclusions of the Committee, on record in the Official Reports of Debates.</P>
    <P>I now rule that the Army Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1943, is a Bill which comes within the definition of a Money Bill contained in Section 1, sub-section (1) of Article 22 of the Constitution, and cannot, under the provisions of Article 20, Section 2, sub-section (1), and of Article 21, Section 1, sub-section (1), be initiated in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned mainly with extending the time for the making of grants to private persons and public utility societies in respect of the erection of new houses in rural areas and the reconstruction of existing houses by small farmers and agricultural labourers under the system of grants established by Section 5 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes to extend as from the 1st April, 1943, to the 1st April, 1945, the time for the completion of such houses. The houses in question, therefore, must be completed before 1st April, 1945, in order to qualify for a grant under the Act of 1932.</P>
      <P>An extension of time is also proposed in respect of the provision of the Act of 1932 for the acquisition of houses by municipal authorities with the aid of grants under the Act and the improvement and enlargement of such houses by these authorities and philanthropic societies.  The provision whereby grants are made to public utility societies for the erection of houses for letting in urban areas is also proposed to be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause 3 of the Bill defines the term &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act.  The term was not defined in the Principal Act of 1932, or in any of the subsequent Housing Acts.  The <Col N="316" /> Public Accounts Committee of the Dáil, on a recent review of the operation of these Acts, expressed the opinion that the term should be defined. In deference to that opinion, &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; is now being defined as the carrying out of any structural alteration to a house, including the extension or enlargement thereof, or the carrying out of any other work, which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be reasonably necessary for making the house a better habitation. Generally speaking, reconstruction grants have been given for re-roofing, the building of an additional room, the enlargement of existing windows and such like works.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, no special assistance is given to public utility societies in carrying out schemes for the rehousing of persons displaced from slum areas or unfit houses. Special assistance, however, is, on the other hand, offered to municipal authorities who undertake works of this kind and contributions of 66 2/3rds of the cost of such works within the prescribed limits of £500, are payable to local authorities carrying out rehousing schemes, as against grants of one-half that amount in respect of the provision of new houses.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill will enable a local authority to grant assistance to a public utility society carrying out rehousing schemes and the assistance can be given under the terms of the Bill in one or other of the following ways, either by loan, by contribution to annual loan charges, by capital grant, by grant or loan or by the execution of site or other development works.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill transfers the real cost of affording assistance given by the local authority under Section 4 of the Bill from the local authority to the Exchequer and enables the Minister to recoup the local authority in respect of any assistance given by it under Section 4 of the Bill.  The recoupment must be made in accordance with the rules set out in the Schedule to the Bill, and these rules provide that the maximum recoupment which the Minister may make to a local authority must not exceed the value of the assistance <Col N="317" /> given to a local authority if it, itself, carried out the work in the first instance.  Section 6 ensures that houses or flats provided by public utility societies with assistance under Section 4 of the Bill will not be entitled to a remission of rates under the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, as amended.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the making of regulations generally for the purposes of the Act and Section 8 provides for expenses.  The final section is the usual one dealing with the Short Title and Citation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is making provision in this Bill for the continuation of rural housing on the one hand and housing in the city areas on the other.  I take it that he is going to see whether public utility societies can help in the rehousing of people displaced from insanitary dwellings. We would like to avail ourselves of the opportunity of the Minister's presence here to inquire what exactly is happening in the matter of house-building throughout the country?  Section 2 of the Bill indicates that under certain paragraphs of the Principal Act grants will continue to be paid.  Sub-section (a) refers to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Principal Act. The latest information we have about <Col N="318" /> the position of building under these paragraphs is contained, I think, in the Parliamentary Records of the Dáil of February 5th, 1941, which give information up to September 30th, 1940. By the 30th September, 1940, the number of houses built by ordinary agricultural labourers and private persons entitled to the grant of £70, was 614. Of these, 90 had been built in the 15 months previous to September 30th, 1940.  The total number of houses built by persons deriving their living from agriculture with £15 valuation or under was 986, of which 95 had been built in the 15 months referred to.  In respect of persons deriving their living from agriculture with valuations between £15 and £25, the figure for houses built was 297, of which 50 were erected during the 15 months I speak of.  So far as valuations above £25 were concerned, the number of houses built was 6,265, of which 904 were built in the previous 15 months.</P>
      <P>The number of houses built by private persons was 8,162, and of these, 1,139 were built between the 30th June, 1939, and the 30th September, 1940. Up to the 30th September, 1940, there had been built by public utility societies: for agricultural labourers, 2,214 houses; for persons with a valuation of £15 and under, 7,421 houses; and for persons with a valuation of from £15 to £25, 1,494 houses.  The number of these that had been built during the 15 months ending the 30th September, 1940, was as follows:&mdash;410 for agricultural labourers; 1,077 for those with a valuation of £15 and under, and 296 for those with valuations of from £15 to £25; so that 2,922 houses had been built by public utility societies in those 15 months.  In their case the grants totalled £192,190.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are extending the grants, I wonder if the Minister could tell us how many houses have been built since these returns were issued in 1941?  Will he say if there is any substantial number of houses in process of being built at the present time, and what he expects are likely to be the commitments in respect of grants? In regard to the improvement grants, the total number of houses that had <Col N="319" /> been improved at the 30th September, 1940, was 25,906, at a total cost of £994,012.  The total cost in grants in respect of 4,444 of these during the 15 months ending the 30th September, 1940, was £169,000.  It would be interesting to know to what extent that work is being done at the present time, and what employment is being given on it.  Will the Minister say whether there is any serious difficulty in regard to the carrying out of this type of housing in rural districts, particularly in the matter of getting materials?</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister's proposal in Section 4 of the Bill is a new venture. Does he entertain the hope that any substantial number of houses will be built by public utility societies for the rehousing of people in urban districts who have been displaced from insanitary dwellings?  As far as we know, very little is being done in that direction by public bodies at the present time.  It would be interesting to know if public utility societies, by the employment of some kind of ingenuity, are likely to succeed in doing what the local authorities are not doing.  It is indicated in the Bill that a public utility society, carrying on this work, may be given certain assistance, including assistance by way of loans.  Can the Minister say at what rate money will be loaned to public utility societies carrying out such work?  Since the setting up of the Central Bank, certain discussions have taken place and a certain amount of public interest has been aroused in the interest rates charged for money needed for the carrying out of economic work.  We have seen that there have been complete changes in the handling of finance for the carrying on of the war. In the discussions that have taken place about these changes, quite a number of very conservative, very important and very well-informed people have indicated that this is not merely a new war technique, but that it is a new understanding of money in relation to the carrying on of constructive work.</P>
    <P>The man in the street, both from <Col N="320" /> what he infers from the discussions that are going on and from the calculations that he is able to make for himself, has figured it out that money for such work as housing should be made available at a rate of interest substantially less than it has been customary to give it even to local authorities.  It is thought, and may perhaps soon be argued sufficiently to make the man in the street very dogmatic about it, that money can be made available for such purposes as housing at a rate of interest that would be not less than 2 per cent. below what the local authorities have been paying for it in the past.  If money could be obtained at this lower rate, it would mean, in the case of a house costing £400 to build, that the rent could be reduced by 3/-.  It is important that these matters should be thoroughly investigated so that operations carried out on these principles would not shake public confidence in any way.</P>
    <P>The rise in the cost of building has been so great that it is essential that these matters be thoroughly investigated. Advantage might be taken of the modern technique and the modern theory with regard to money before such bodies and public utility societies are induced to engage in work which the local authorities are rather shy about undertaking at the present time. It may be that, due to some kind of ingenuity on the part of the organisers of public utility societies, they may be able to do some of this work.  If so, they ought to be assisted in every possible way so that they will not find themselves saddled with costs in respect to capital charges.  They might be spared all that if a little thought and examination were given to this question now by Parliament and the Government.  As the Minister is here, we would like to hear him say something on these matters.  We would be glad to know if there is a substantial amount of rural housing going on at the present moment.  Can the Minister tell us what relation the grants paid at the present moment bear to those paid pre-war, and how present prices for building in rural areas compare with pre-war prices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate, I think, that our first discussion in the Seanad in the New Year should be on this question of housing because, in my opinion, it is one of the biggest problems that we have to deal with.  It is a problem that the Government have to face.  I am glad that, in doing so, they have decided to look outside the local authorities for some assistance in trying to solve it, particularly in the urban areas.  Those of us who go through the slums in the poorer districts of our cities and towns are well aware of the terrible conditions under which large numbers of our people are housed at the present time.  Much has been done to help to relieve that situation, particularly under the housing programme which the present Government put into operation soon after they came into office.  Still, much more remains to be done.  I welcome the view of the Government that some token of appreciation should be shown to such bodies as public utility societies or other people who may be anxious to come in and help the local authorities to solve this problem.  I fear that the provision at present in the Bill will not encourage such societies very much. A society will have, in the first place, to get approval from the local authority and the local authority will be burdened with the responsibility of financing the scheme put forward by the public utility society even though recoupment come later from the Local Government Department.  I think that mere approval by the local authority of the plans and proposals put forward by a utility society should be sufficient, and that the Local Government Department should supply the funds forthwith, rather than ask the local authority to do so.  If a public utility society is approved of by a local authority, and the local authority wishes to place funds at the disposal of the society, it will have to borrow the necessary money or raise it by way of rate, which it would hesitate to do.  In lending it back to the public utility society, there would be a small increase in the rate of interest, thereby increasing the rate of interest to the members of the utility society.  If mere approval of the project put forward by a public utility <Col N="322" /> society was regarded as a sufficient certificate by the Local Government Department or the Board of Works on which to make funds available, the system would be much more efficient, and the charge on the public utility society would be 1 per cent. or ½ per cent. lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of housing is not one which affects urban areas only.  We have in our rural areas slums as bad as there are in the bigger cities.  At the moment, there are three bodies dealing with houses.  The Land Commission is responsible for building houses in cases where they take over and divide lands.  In the Gaeltacht areas, Gaeltacht Services erect houses for people residing there.  The Local Government Department make grants to people in urban and rural districts to assist in the erection of houses. Then, we have the local authorities and now we are to have the public utility societies.  I suggest to the Government that the time has come when we should set up a national housing board, with powers analogous to those of the bodies entrusted during the emergency with our shipping and similar operations. Provision should now be made for the post-war building that must take place.  Senator Mulcahy has asked for figures in connection with the number of houses at present under construction.  He has also asked for particulars of cost and if the emergency conditions have interfered appreciably with house building.  We all realise that building cannot go on during the emergency as it did before and as we hope it will do when the emergency ceases.  Now is the time to lay our plans.  I suggest that a national housing board, with increased powers and with a really national outlook, be set up by the Government to organise the whole building industry.  The making of grants alone is not sufficient. The placing of money aside for the building of houses is not sufficient.  It is necessary to have qualified men to erect the houses.  If we do not set about making our plans now, I fear that we shall not be able to carry out the necessary work when the war is over.  The supply of raw materials&mdash; timber, steel and other things &mdash; will <Col N="323" /> present a big problem.  This question of housing is one that should get careful consideration.  It is one which would solve 99 per cent. of our employment problems after the war.  We all know that, in addition to the employment provided in building, building gives increased employment in a number of allied trades.  It is for that reason that I think a national housing board should be set up and given power to enter into contracts either immediately or as soon as supplies are available. It should bring in in bulk lots the necessary timber and other materials and organise this industry as it should be organised.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill affords encouragement to public utility societies. That is a very good thing.  We should have more of those public utility societies.  In every industry in which a number of workers are employed, the people interested &mdash; particularly the labour people &mdash; should encourage the establishment of such societies, so as to obtain the benefit of this section of the Bill, and enable houses to be put up for workers in the industry.  It would be a very fine way for trade unions and directors of industry to invest some of their money.  So far as I understand, the section refers only to public utility societies when catering for people removed from slum areas. I should like to see that provision enlarged.  We are about to start a campaign against tuberculosis, and these cases should be given special consideration.  I know of a case in which a father, mother, and seven children &mdash; five of whom were receiving treatment in Galway sanatorium&mdash; could not get a house because they had not the good luck, or the misfortune, of living in a slum area, or of having been evicted from a slum house, while old bachelors and old maids who happen to live in those areas got new houses.  The people concerned had to go in as sub-tenants to them.  I know that it is hard, when making regulations, to provide for the human element in every case, but I think the regulations should be sufficiently elastic to permit of just treatment in cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> There is also to be considered the question of housing under the Land Commission.  The Land Commission are, as it were, landlords of a number of houses and many of these houses are in very bad condition.  The occupants have very small holdings of land and the grant of £80, given in cases in which the valuation is under £15, is not sufficient to enable those people to undertake the heavy responsibility of building new houses.  With their limited incomes and, in almost all cases, very large families, these people cannot proceed to erect a decent house for themselves.  We hear a lot of talk about the flight from the land.  It is no wonder that children brought up in such homes should try, at the first opportunity, to get away from their surroundings.  I put it to the House and the Minister that the Land Commission should be instructed to undertake the improvement of all such houses or the erection of new houses or that they should make available to the tenants facilities for so doing.  Otherwise, it should be delegated to the housing board that I suggest should be set up Public authorities were, in the past, very reluctant to undertake the erection of sufficient houses for people in their districts because to do so meant a certain increase in the rates.  I am very much afraid that under the present system that position will be aggravated if we do not now set up some authority that will have power to compel local authorities to make plans for the erection of sufficient houses.</P>
    <P>If these plans were available much could now be done in the way of development work that would give employment to some of the unemployed. In a number of cases that work will not be undertaken now.  I do not wish to mention the Department or the local authorities that were concerned where money was expended on the development of a site, but &mdash; whether it was the engineering or some other staff was responsible &mdash; instead of the cost decreasing it will be increased, as there will have to be further excavation and development work.  That shows the necessity of organisation and of having available a sufficiency of intelligent <Col N="325" /> workers.  I suggest to the Minister, where the advance of £80 was not sufficient, that he might have discretionary power, where a county medical officer or the engineer appointed by the Department so recommended, to give an increased grant.  There are cases where it is absolutely necessary that that should be done, if the people affected are ever to have facilities to enable them to erect houses for their own use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister so clearly indicated, is narrow and very limited in its scope.  It is not in any sense a general housing Bill and, therefore, precludes any general discussion. It relates only to minor but none the less important aspects of the general question of housing.  It refers solely to the payment of housing grants to private persons in rural areas, and to public utility societies in both urban and rural areas, who provide houses for the working classes, and where such houses are used for the rehousing of persons displaced by the operations under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1931.  It would appear that Sections 4 and 5 empower local authorities to make arrangements with a public utility society to erect houses or flats for rehousing persons who otherwise would have to be provided for by a local authority, such as the Corporation of Dublin.  Such a society might be able to obtain donations or loans free of interest or loans at a nominal rate of interest from philanthropic people for this special purpose, and thus relieve the corporation of even a little of its burden, and, at the same time, evoke the practical, sympathetic and continuing interest of such people in the housing problem.  In such cases the corporation may with the consent of the Minister, and in accordance with the regulations made for the purposes of the Act, make grants to the society, and the Minister may recoup the corporation, subject to the limit line regarding the amount set forth in the Acts and regulations at present in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hitherto, I am informed, the utmost assistance that could be given to a <Col N="326" /> society in these circumstances has been a lump sum grant from the State not exceeding £100 per dwelling making, with £50 grant from the corporation, say a total of £150.  Under the proposals in the Bill the society would be placed, in regard to the State subsidy, in a similar position to that of the corporation itself &mdash; always provided that the corporation is co-operating&mdash; that is, the State would recoup the corporation for the assistance given to the society by paying an annual contribution towards the capital charges up to 66? per cent. on a maximum of £500 per flat or £400 per cottage.  As it stands no date is given as from which these provisions may be applicable, and they would appear to have effect only in respect of dwellings provided subsequent to the Bill becoming law.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point I wish to make, or rather I should say to the appeal I wish to make on behalf of a utility society that has done a splendid piece of housing work.  A similar appeal was made in the Dáil when the Minister was piloting the Bill through that House.  I refer to the Charlemont Public Utility Society.  That society in 1941 and 1942, with the help of the corporation and the Minister for Local Government, erected a block of 13 flats in Charlemont Street.  Apart from the State grant of £100, and the corporation grant of £50, the capital was obtained in large part by donations of about £6,000 from public-spirited citizens, and, in part, by a loan of £3,000 or so from the Local Loans Fund.  To meet this sum, the society raised by way of donations about £465 per flat; by loan from the Local Loans Fund, £225; by grant from the State, £100; and by grant from the Dublin Corporation, £50; making the total of £840 per flat to which I have referred. If the present Bill had been operative at the time these flats were erected, the financial position might have been (per flat): Grant from State, £333 (that is, 66? per cent. on a maximum of £500 per flat); grant from the Dublin Corporation, £50; and, by donations, £457; making the same total of £840 per flat. In this case it will be seen that, if the flats had been erected under the financial provisions of the Bill now before <Col N="327" /> the House, it would not have been necessary to apply for a loan at all from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>It is on behalf of this society that I appeal to the Minister.  The society is a genuinely philanthropic one.  It is made up of public-spirited citizens whose social conscience is shocked at the terrible housing conditions under which so many of our poorer citizens are forced to exist.  The society has not sought, and does not intend to seek, any profits whatever.  Its sole concern is the provision of decent housing accommodation for those who need it; and, in so far as the flats it already has erected are concerned, it is quite prepared to vest them in the Dublin Corporation, simply desiring that they should retain responsibility for administration, and maintaining personal contact with the tenants with a view only to promoting their social welfare.  The society asks that it should be brought into a position in the present Bill that would entitle it to the financial assistance it would have received if it had been in operation at the time of the erection of their flats.  In other words, they ask that the provisions of Section 4 of the present Bill be made retrospective, and that they be afforded the same financial assistance from the Department as the Dublin Corporation receives.  The affording of this financial relief would give a new impetus to the work of their society &mdash; work to which the Minister himself paid handsome tribute in the Dáil, and which he said he greatly valued.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy has already expressed the hope that utility societies would be induced to embark on this class of work.  Here we have a striking example of what a utility society can do in this respect.  The society has obtained from the Dublin Corporation a site for an additional 37 flats.  If the Bill is amended as I have suggested, they would be able to look for additional funds from those public-spirited citizens who helped it before, and they would then be in a position to proceed to make arrangements for the erection of these additional flats at the earliest <Col N="328" /> possible date.  The Minister is concerned, and rightly concerned, at the danger of creating precedents in matters of this kind, and of the undesirable consequences that might ensue from them.  I submit, however, that in this case the danger is negligible, and the amount of money involved is infinitesimal. There is no possibility whatever, I am informed, of any other utility society claiming the assistance asked for by the Charlemont Utility Society, and the amount of money involved in making Section 4 of the Bill retrospective would not amount to more than £3,000, or £4,000 at the outside.</P>
    <P>In that connection, might I suggest that in Section 3 the word &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; is retrospective, and in its application might involve a bigger charge on the Exchequer than the known amount which the application of the retrospective aspect of Section 4 would involve.  In conclusion, therefore, I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to bring forward an amendment on the Committee Stage to make the provisions of Section 4 applicable retrospectively to cover the housing scheme of the Charlemont Utility Society, by inserting a new paragraph (f) in Section 4 as follows: &ldquo;This section shall have and be deemed to have had effect as from the 1st April, 1941.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil expressed in no unequivocal terms his appreciation of the value of the contribution to the solution of the housing problem made by the utility society on whose behalf I am appealing to him.  The Minister also said that he knew the Minister for Finance was very sympathetic in the matter, but that he was up against what was really a fundamental principle, namely, that it was not possible for him to allow people to carry out works on one basis, and then ask the State to give them public moneys which those who had undertaken the works did not envisage when they had embarked on these projects.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Finance was fully aware of the amount of money involved, and of the fact that only one society was concerned in the request being made; <Col N="329" /> but, again, I would appeal to the Minister to use persuasive eloquence with the Minister for Finance.  If he does so, I have little doubt that the Minister's appreciation and the Minister for Finance's proverbial sympathy will be productive of good for the society on whose behalf I speak.  There may be difficulties in the way of creation of precedents and the possibility of other people looking for this amount, but I am very reliably informed that there is no other society on the same basis as this society in regard to applying for a retrospective grant.</P>

      <P>As the other speakers have said, this Bill is a very desirable and useful one and a lot of good work has been done throughout the country by the grants which have been allocated to small farmers and others. There is one little snag which I mentioned here before: I do not know if it has been adjusted yet.  The Minister has mentioned that one of the purposes of the grants is the building of additional rooms but, strange as it may seem, there was a regulation governing this, that where an addition was made to a thatched house the grant was reduced if the additional roof was not composed of slates or tiles.  That seems to be very ridiculous, as a house which is two-thirds thatched and one-third slated or tiled does not look nice.  Such a regulation can have no practical purpose, and I cannot understand why it should have been made.  I hope the Minister will see that, if that regulation still exists, it will be eliminated henceforth from all regulations governing this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it would be digressing slightly to deal with housing in slum areas and towns.  By a recent move we made to have some houses built in my town, I have reason to know that this will be an extremely difficult proposition, as the law exists at present. Some eight or nine years ago, when materials were at normal prices, we built about 60 houses, costing approximately £360 each, for which the Government gave a subsidy of two-thirds remission.  Under that scheme, a house was let at about 5/8 per week, including rates.  We have the estimate <Col N="330" /> of the same engineer for similar houses at present, showing that they would cost £700 per house.  Under the present law, there is remission given only of two-thirds of the first £350 and the second £350 has to be borne in full by the local authority.  To pay back the interest and sinking fund on that money and to recoup it from the tenant, the rent would amount to 11/- per week, plus rates.  On a valuation of £5, the rates may be assumed to be 2/-, which would make the rent 13/- per week.  I do not know how that is going to be got.  The rent might be got from a certain class of people who might require houses, but certainly not from the class of people whom it was intended to house &mdash; people in slum areas, whose houses have been condemned&mdash; and it is the opinion of wise people, as Senator Mulcahy pointed out a few minutes ago, that wherever the financial aid is to come from, or whatever view we may take of finances in this connection, unless there is a remission of two-thirds of the all-in costs of the houses, there can be no remission of the rent of these houses, and it will not be possible to provide housing for those who, at the moment, are compelled to live in the slum areas of the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that it would be well for the Minister to look into such questions, and to bring in a new Bill, dealing particularly with urban and city areas, in view of the fact that the most that the slum dweller in the towns and cities can pay &mdash; the ordinary worker or, if perhaps not the ordinary worker, the casual labourer &mdash; would be about 5/6 a week.  There is no use in building a house for that man, at a rent of 15/- a week, because that would mean 50 per cent. of his entire income. For that reason, I say that this whole matter will have to be considered in a very broad way, and I believe that there will be no real housing provided for the people who are now dwelling in the slum areas of the towns and cities unless a new Bill is brought in which will make provision to the effect that the highest rent to be called for from any poor working man will be 5/6 or 6/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who does not belong to either of the major Parties in this House, I should like to pay a tribute to this Government and the previous Government for the work that both Governments have done for the housing of the people of this country.  In the main, I agree with what Senator Hawkins said, but I deprecate his suggestion that the previous Government had not done its share in this matter of housing.  I think that a tribute should be paid to them for the work they did.  I, personally, had experience of the work they did in connection with Marino, Donnycarney, and other areas in the City of Dublin, and I think a tribute should be paid to them for that work.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that trades unions should invest money in housing has certain difficulties, and I am sure that the Minister could tell the Senator that trades unions are prohibited from investing money in any other than gilt-edged securities.  Whether speculative building would be regarded as a gilt-edged security is another matter, but the fact is that trade unions are only allowed to invest their moneys in gilt-edged securities.  My main purpose, however, in getting up to speak here is to appeal to the Minister to raise the ceiling figure of £500.  Under the 1932 Act the ceiling figure was £500, in connection with flats or houses, and I am quite sure that the Minister will understand that, with the rise in price of various building materials since that time, the new charges would amount to about £800 now.  Senator Honan made a point on which I should like to elaborate to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the case for increasing the grant is obvious, in my opinion, in view of the costs of building materials at the present time.  Speaking as a member of the Dublin Corporation, I can say that we have that difficulty at the present moment, and whether it will be possible to build any houses at all within the next two years is very problematical.  That is the case so far as the corporation is concerned. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get building materials, and it is my impression that, even when the present <Col N="332" /> housing schemes which the corporation has in hands are completed, we will not be in a position to embark on other schemes for a considerable time to come, in view of the difficulties that are almost certain to arise when the present emergency has passed.  Most of us will remember the difficulties that were experienced after the last war, and will recollect that these difficulties did not actually become apparent until the war was over.  Accordingly, I would say that the possibility of any building being undertaken either by public authorities or public utility societies, within the next two years, is very problematical, and I would appeal to the Minister to consider the point I have made to the effect that, although £500 might have been a fair figure in 1932, it is certainly not a fair figure to-day.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan spoke of a rent that would be within the capacity of the people to pay.  Members of the Dublin Corporation have experience of unfortunate people living on the dole, and yet the lowest rent at which the corporation can supply a house at the present time is around about 8/- a week.  Take the case of a man, with a wife or four or five children, living on the dole: no matter what else is paid, the rent must be paid, and the result is that the Dublin rates at the present time are carrying far more than their fair share of the burden of housing these people.  The corporation would be only too anxious to reduce these rents if possible, and for that reason I think that the grant might be increased.  At the present time, the rent that the average family in Dublin can pay &mdash; that is, taking the people whom the corporation try to house: people with families of four or five children who are now living in one room &mdash;would be about 10/-.  Very few of these people are in a position to pay a higher rent than 10/- a week, and it can be appreciated that that is not an economic rent, when you take into consideration the difference between the cost of building the house and the amount that the tenant is able to pay; and that is bound to have its effect on the rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I would certainly say that this will not encourage public utility societies to step in and indulge in further building activities.  Senator Campbell seems to look upon them, in effect, as a kind of charitable organisation, but after all a public utility society is a commercial concern, which wants to make a profit on the building of houses for the working classes, and in view of the present circumstances these public utility societies certainly will not step in to do the work when they see that the public authorities themselves find it impossible to do it.  I think the Minister should seriously consider the question of raising the ceiling figure from £500 to £800.</P>

      <P>The aspect of this housing question that interests me is the one that was raised by Senator Mulcahy, who seemed to deal more or less with the question of costs, and in that connection I should like to say a few words in regard to the question of the price of money &mdash; a question which has been the cause, perhaps, of some unpleasantness on other occasions. Now, there are certain schools of economic thought that have had their conservative views altered by the course of this war.  A colossal structure of machinery of destruction, it appeared, could be created at a very low price, whereas, when it came to the creation of things which would add to the happiness of the human being, such as housing, and so on, money for such purposes could only be got at a very high rate of interest.  Has the Minister considered some of the schemes which, I know, have been advanced by certain schools of economic thought in this connection?  I know that he does not agree with some of them, but would it not be possible to issue money free through the central banks, and finance the building of houses on that basis, and just charge the actual administrative costs?  It can be proved that housing costs and charges are, to a very great extent, added to by the interest charges which fall due during the years of payment, and I think it might be well for the Minister to examine the whole financial structure in regard to this matter, in the <Col N="334" /> same way as Ministers in other countries have had to do.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Mulcahy raised this question, because it is a fundamental one.  I fully agree with Senator Hawkins as to the establishment of a national housing board.  That is a thing which has been needed here for a long time.  As a matter of fact, if there is socialisation in the air, it might be no harm to think of it in terms of housing as well as in other forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the appeal that has been made with reference to increasing the housing grants.  The building position is fairly difficult just now, and I think members of the House will realise that.  Reference has been made to the price of money, but if you had all the money in the Bank of England at the moment for the purpose of erecting houses, I doubt if it would be possible to do much in that direction just now.  There are some of us who have been very closely associated with the housing question in the City of Dublin.  As will be quite easily understood, there are many houses in Dublin that have outlived their span; there are many on the point of collapse.  The inspectors of dangerous buildings in Dublin are daily condemning houses, and they would be prepared to condemn more houses if it were possible to find accommodation for the people who occupy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine this matter of housing.  A great quantity of the material used in building houses can only be procured from abroad. Senator Hawkins, who knows something <Col N="335" /> about the timber business, is aware that timber is a very bulky material and that the timber used in the construction of houses here in other years was imported from the Scandinavian countries &mdash; the greater portion of it.  Every Senator knows that there is very little shipping space available and that there is none for bulky material such as timber, with the result that, so far as timber is concerned, building operations in this country have to be confined to whatever native timber can be obtained.  From the outbreak of the war in 1939, building difficulties gradually became more acute. In the period between 1932 and 1939 the progress made in the erection of houses in this country was very good indeed.  One can easily observe the progress made in Dublin City.  In the central areas as well as in the suburbs and the outlying districts, such as Crumlin and Cabra, some splendid work has been carried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Colgan has referred to the Dublin Corporation.  I may say that the members of the corporation are fully alive to their duties.  Although they cannot get building materials, nevertheless they are busily engaged in preparing for future building operations. Sites have been acquired and cleared, sewers have been laid, roads constructed and everything is ready to proceed with the work of constructing houses.  We are only waiting for the day when it will be possible to issue advertisements in order to get contractors to tender for housing schemes. Owing to the scarcity of houses and the building difficulty, the Dublin Corporation has interested itself in the reconditioning of some of the tenement houses throughout the city, and workmen are engaged in converting them into modern flats.  That task was forced on the corporation because of the difficulty of getting building materials.  The members of the corporation are now endeavouring to meet the housing shortage in this particular way.  Some fine work has been accomplished in tenement houses in Gardiner Street and other streets throughout the city. I am in favour of helping the people who are engaged in building houses.</P>

      <P>I cannot subscribe to the bouquets that have been handed out to the efforts of the last Administration and the present Government in relation to housing.  I submit that both Governments merely caught up on arrears.  They made no adequate effort to clear up the slum problem. That problem is as acute to-day as it was 20 years ago, notwithstanding the schemes that have been introduced. That is my experience, and, because of that, this country is to-day paying the penalty by having a pestilence in our midst, such as tuberculosis.  We are now proposing to spend millions in order to eradicate this awful disease. I say that the disease is largely attributable to slumdom.  Realising that, we cannot truthfully say that the past or the present Government have done enough to meet the requirements of our people in the matter of housing. We must keep that foremost in our minds.</P>
      <P>There are great difficulties with regard to building at the present time, not only for this country, but for every other country in the world.  If we sleep on it and neglect to plan in order to meet our country's requirements, what will our position be immediately after the war, when every other country will be clamouring for materials to rebuild the portions of their cities that have been destroyed?  We will be in competition with them, and what chance will we have against those mighty countries, or countries that were mighty in the past?  I should like to hear from the Minister what steps have been taken with reference to post-war planning, particularly in the matter of housing.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy raised a fundamental matter connected with the housing of the people.  He referred to money, the proper use and exploitation of money, and I think he mentioned that 2 per cent. for housing, would be a normal or natural amount.  I do not think the Senator would be satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>There ought to be some rearrangement with regard to the application of money to housing schemes.  Deputy Hawkins suggests that trade unions might invest their money in housing schemes.  I should like to say that there is no section of the community that would be more willing to invest money in housing schemes than the trade unions, if the Trade Union Act permitted them. They can only invest their money in trustee securities or hand it over to the Government, free of interest, as some of them have done already and would be willing to do again, I am sure, in order to make their contribution towards ridding this country of slumdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>They have done that and with great credit to themselves.  A number of unions have made a substantial contribution to housing in this way.  The next point raised by Senator Hawkins was that there should be a proper, active, live national council established, in order to consider, if necessary, such matters as the utilisation of prefabricated houses.  We know the difficulties of procuring raw materials at present and we may have to depart from the ordinary method of providing houses in future.  Now is the time for our engineers and scientists to get together to see what can be done to surmount the difficulties which will become greater as time goes on.  These are features which occurred to me during <Col N="338" /> the discussion and which indeed have been in my mind for a long time.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to add my appeal to that of Senator Campbell on behalf of the Charlemont Utility Society.  He has said all that can be said on their behalf but I want to say that this is a really philanthropic, keenly interested body of people who have no desire to secure profit or benefit for themselves.  Any money they might get under the retrospective clause in the Bill would be an inducement to them to construct more of these buildings.  Testimony has been already paid to the splendid work they have done.  They were pioneers in this class of building and, like all pioneers, they suffered for it.  If the Minister would use his influence with the Minister for Finance, who I know because of his own experience of slumdom in Dublin is very sympathetic, it would go a long way towards helping a society of this kind.  At any rate, if such an amendment is not inserted, I feel that it is not the Minister for Finance we shall have to blame but the Minister for Local Government and Public Health because I think we would get a much readier response from the Minister for Finance than we are likely to get from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I hope the Minister will deal with this matter when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to intervene for a very few moments in respect to the hopes expressed by Senator Mulcahy and another Senator, whose name I am afraid I did not catch, on the question of cheap money. Money is a vital factor in almost all activities of life and, to my mind, housing is one of the main activities of life.  What I complain of in the observations of these Senators is the lack of any constructive scheme for the provision of this cheap money.  Undoubtedly cheap money, if it could be obtained, would be a great asset in the provision of housing, but how is it to be got?  The money is going to come in either of two ways: either by borrowing from the savings of the people or by the issuing of credits by institutions such as the Central <Col N="339" /> Bank which was mentioned.  Now if the Central Bank is going to issue credits free of interest, what is going to happen?  Firstly, it ceases to make any return to the revenue because it will have no profit on its operations out of which these returns can be made.  In that case the revenue is <i>pro tanto</i> diminished and the deficiency has to be made up out of the pockets of the taxpayers.  Then if it can borrow money at 3 per cent. and lend money at, say, 2 per cent., who is going to pay the difference?  You cannot borrow money at 3 per cent. and lend it at 1 per cent. unless you have somebody to make up the difference. The Government can borrow money in the region of 3 per cent., but if they were to lend that money for housing, free of interest, the interest would have to be found in some way. As far as I can see, you have either got to inflate by issuing credits or you have to call on the taxpayer to make up the difference.  I should like those who make these facile suggestions to tell us how it is going to be done or where it has been done.  I do not know where it has been done outside a fully socialistic system.  Under the present system of ordinary commercial operations I do not know that money has ever been provided for housing or any other activity free of interest except out of the pockets of the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>To help to rescue the debate from the hands of the financial experts, I wish to say a few words from the point of view of a woman who does not know very much about finance at all.  There are two points in the Bill which I think deserve publicity.  One is not new &mdash; the allocation for the reconstruction of rural houses.  I should like in that connection to make a suggestion somewhat similar to that about which the Taoiseach spoke recently in regard to the provision of dower-houses.  That does not mean that you would need separate houses but the provision of such dower buildings would lead to a great deal of harmony in families.  After the son of the house married, a little addition such as a kitchen or bedroom could be made to which the old people could retire.  I think that would be possible under the reconstruction scheme embodied in the Bill.  In this connection I was glad to learn from an answer made by the Minister recently to Deputy Gerald Bartley that if a person has a thatched house, the addition need not be slated.  I think that if that were made a condition, it would be a great drawback and it would prevent a great many people from taking advantage of these reconstruction schemes.  I should be glad to have the assurance of the Minister that, in any <Col N="341" /> case where it is proposed to make additions to a thatched house, the addition will not be the monstrosity of a slated building.  The people should be encouraged to add to their houses for the purposes of which I speak and which the Taoiseach so strongly stressed.</P>
      <P>Another matter about which I should like to speak is the encouragement given to public utility societies by the Bill.  I should be glad if the Minister could find it in his power to provide that the Charlemont Public Utility Society should get the help it deserves. I say &ldquo;the help it deserves&rdquo; because it sets a headline which might be advantageously followed by other bodies.  It seems to me &mdash; and this is one of the reasons for which I rose to speak &mdash; that if, for instance, a section of the St. Vincent de Paul Society formed itself into a public utility society, it could do an immense amount of work, not alone in the matter of the provision of houses and flats, but it would have the advantage of big architects and other people who have studied modern materials and modern methods.  They would bring to the solution of the problems which will arise for everybody in the matter of house building and make available to the poor the newest ideas about materials and construction and it would be a wonderful work for such a body as the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  I mention the St. Vincent de Paul Society for the reason that there are so many public men of great ability connected with it.  If they helped to construct the buildings for the working classes who need houses, it would not only be an act of immediate good, an act of immense importance from both the social and the moral point of view, but it would set a headline from which other builders could learn.</P>

      <P>During the course of the debate, there was no mention whatever of one section of the public which has provided an enormous number of houses for the working class of Dublin. I refer to such companies as the Dublin Artisans' Dwelling Company, Messrs. Guinness, Messrs. Power and other firms of that type.  It would <Col N="342" /> appear that such firms are completely debarred from any benefit under this Bill.  I should like to know from the Minister <i>en passant</i> why such companies are debarred from receiving the privileges accorded to any body which calls itself a public utility society.  I do not see any reason why the Government should discriminate between reputable companies established in this city for generations and newly-formed companies, which are formed in many cases, and in fact in most cases, for the benefit of private speculators who have tons of brains and very little money.</P>
      <P>Every member of the House knows that in areas in Dublin many of the working class houses belong to big firms.  Some of them own hundreds and others thousands of houses.  Why should that type of firm not be included so far as receiving the benefits of the Bill is concerned?  I ask the Minister to include in the Bill a public company or private company; that is, ordinary companies such as are members of the Federation of Irish Industries and which give an enormous amount of work to the people of the city.  There is no reason why they should be debarred, so far as I know.  Any census of house building I ever read always seemed to show that private enterprise built practically as many houses as were built by public bodies, and why should private individuals be debarred from receiving benefits which two or three people can get by coming together and calling themselves a public utility society?  I ask the Minister seriously to consider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators told us about the grand work done for housing by this and the previous Governments.  I do not altogether agree with them.  Within the last few minutes, remembering that in my early days I had occasion to read some Acts of Parliament, I sent down for the 1919 Act which was passed specially for this country.  I find that in that Act the facilities in respect of the building of workmen's houses were infinitely greater than those provided by this or the previous Government.  I ask the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, when <Col N="343" /> they think they are being generous, to refer to the Housing (Town-Planning) Act, 1919, which was applicable to Ireland. There they will find that anybody building a house at that time could by way of loan get 75 per cent. of the cost &mdash; the cost of the land, the cost of laying out, drainage and erection. Of the complete outlay, he could get 75 per cent. and he got it, not when the work was finished, but as it went along, from day to day.</P>
    <P>I think that, viewed by the standard set out in a public statute of 1919, housing legislation in this country has been of a definitely retrograde character.  That legislation has gradually got worse and worse, and it has all tended of late years to throw all house building on to the public utility societies and corporations instead of assisting private enterprise. This Bill with which we are dealing seems to leave out altogether private enterprise, which is the most important thing in the country, when all is said and done.  It would be very interesting for those Senators who are interested in housing to turn up that Act, passed by the British Government in 1919, and to read that anybody building a house could get 75 per cent. of his total outlay, from the buying of the land to the finishing of the house, including legal and other expenses.  That cannot be got to-day.  I ask the Minister and anybody who thinks we have advanced to read that Act and to say whether we have not gone far back instead of forward in the matter of house building and in the matter of legislation governing house building.</P>
    <P>I should like to support what Senator Colgan said about raising the ceiling of £500.  That ceiling is absolutely out of the question to-day because you can get very little done for £500.  I have had a great deal of practical experience and I know that the fixing of a ceiling of £500 does not make sense to-day.  I saw a flat being altered the other day and the lowest estimate for the work was £1,010.  The estimates went up to £1,200 and normally that work could be done for three or four hundred pounds.  I ask the Minister <Col N="344" /> to agree to raise the ceiling from £500 to a much higher figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a Bill to amend in some minor particulars the legislation which has governed the erection of subsidised and subvented houses since 1932.  It would not be appropriate, I think, in a measure of this sort to deal with the situation which will exist in circumstances which are entirely visionary and hypothetical. I refer to the situation which will exist when the European conflict has been brought to an end.  No useful purpose would be served by spending one's time in vain speculations as to what provision will have to be made, not to-day or not to-morrow, but when this war is ended, to ensure that this problem of housing for the people will be properly dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is a well-established principle that when a Bill to amend an Act in a minor particular &mdash; and in this case it is merely a Bill to extend the operation in some respects of the existing statute &mdash; is before an Assembly, the debate should be confined to that narrow ground. As I am a stickler for order in Parliamentary debates, I do not propose to traverse the wide field which Senator Mulcahy has opened and to give a general review of the housing situation in the State.  I am concerned with what is in the Bill.  In that connection, I must say that, so far as the Government are concerned, and so far as those who would be responsible for giving effect to legislative provisions are concerned, at this moment there is no question of revising the main structure of the Act of 1932.  All we propose to do is this: that the Legisture having determined that certain provisions of this Act should lapse on the 1st April, 1943, we are asking them to allow us, as a temporary arrangement, to prolong the currency of these provisions until such time as a comprehensive housing review can be undertaken and a new policy framed to meet the new circumstances which will exist after the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not propose to argue the merits of raising the ceiling, as has been stated, from £500 to £800. <Col N="345" /> Quite obviously, if housing costs are to go up, and if housing difficulties are to increase, new provisions will have to be made for dealing with them.  I do not think that the difficulties at this moment arise from the shortage of money, as some Senators have suggested, but arise, as Senator Colgan and Senator Campbell and Senator Healy pointed out, entirely from a shortage of materials.  You can print all the cheap money you want, but it will not grow one tree, it will not produce one brick, it will not create one new roof-tile.  It is not paper we want; it is not cheap credit we want, but a ready supply of materials which are not forthcoming in present circumstances. Therefore, there is no use in suggesting that the root cause of the problem is a financial one.  In fact, most of us are convinced that it is not a financial one.</P>
    <P>As for this new understanding of money which has been referred to, I should say it is only an old misunderstanding dressed up in a new way: that you can continue to spend to-day without thought for to-morrow and that one day or another you will not have to meet your liabilities.  The fact that people who are engaged in a struggle for national existence are prepared to spend all their substance in order to maintain their freedom is no proof that, if circumstances were normal, it would be possible to continue to put off indefinitely responsibility for meeting the bill when it would fall due.  There is no use in trying to equate abnormal war-time expenditure with the normal expenditure of peace times.  Everybody knows that the belligerents are spending because their one chance of maintaining the possessions they have, of securing the liberties which they have, is in using all their resources, not merely of money but of materials and men, in order to defend them.  If victory should attend their effort, then on the morrow the problem will arise for them as to how they are going to face and how they are going to shoulder the liabilities and the responsibilities which they are incurring to-day.  The question will then have to be faced which had to be faced after the last war: who is going to pay the war-time debt?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> Everybody realises that, whatever may have been the aftermath of the last war, one thing did remain and did cripple productive enterprise all the world over &mdash; the obligations and the financial liabilities which had been contracted during the years 1914 to 1918. I have no doubt that when this sorry story is ended and peace is seen again, the one serious problem which will face those communities which are involved in this war, and who will spend, and rightly spend, every 1d. they have in order to maintain themselves, is, how they are to meet the commitments which they are now incurring?  Then the question will be: are they going to allow the crippling taxation to continue so that commitments in respect of the public debt will be met, or is there going to be repudiation or a capital levy?  One way or another, this borrowing will have to be paid for.</P>
    <P>There is no use in anybody saying that there is a new understanding of money.  There is a new line of propaganda to facilitate the raising of money and it is, of course, entirely related to the financial needs of the belligerents. People who before the war started would have looked at this problem realistically and objectively are now saying that the purchasing power problem is all a matter of Government book-keeping.  It is all a matter of Government book-keeping as long as the war lasts.  But, when the final account has to be presented, it will be found that what is being spent now on armaments and munitions and in waging war will have to be paid for, and paid for by the people in blood and sweat and toil afterwards.  That is the old understanding of money and that is the only one which will prevail in the end as long as man has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.</P>

      <P>Perhaps some farmers and those fortunate enough to have real property may be capitalists. However, I must apologise.  I started off by saying that I have a great regard for order, but I was led into this wide discussion.  Senator Mulcahy asked a number of questions which were relevant to the Bill, and I would be glad to give him the information he wants.  He pointed out that no figures of housing progress have been given since the 31st March, 1940.  In relation to the houses built under the provisions of the Housing Acts to which this measure relates, since 31st March, 1940, 4,168 new houses have been built and 5,395 existing houses reconstructed, making the total number of houses dealt with under the Acts, 9,563.  In addition to that, there are at the present moment 1,460 new houses in course of construction by private individuals and public utility societies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all in rural areas.  In addition, 3,313 existing houses are being reconstructed, making the total 4,773 for houses dealt with under the Acts.  Houses in the course of construction by local authorities in urban areas number 1,353 and in rural areas 217.  Since 1932, 22,589 new houses have been built in rural areas by private persons and public utility societies and 30,026 houses have been reconstructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins, apparently, is under some slight misapprehension as to the effect of Sections 4 and 5.  He seemed to understand that if a local authority made a loan to a public utility society under Section 4, they would not be fully recouped by the Government for the expenses thereby incurred, and that accordingly they would have to charge the public utility society a somewhat higher rate of interest than that at which they themselves were raising the money.  I think that is a misunderstanding of the <Col N="348" /> section of the Act.  Section 5 provides that in accordance with the regulations made for the purposes of the Act, the Minister may recoup the local authority in respect of the assistance so given.  I assume the word &ldquo;recoup&rdquo; means recoup in full to the limits indicated by the rules and the schedule.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to enter into the question whether it is necessary to establish a new housing board or not, because that is a matter which is far outside the scope of the Bill and one on which a great deal might remain to be said.  Senators Campbell, Colgan, Foran and Mrs. Concannon and others have pressed me to make Section 4 of the Bill retrospective.  I am sorry to say that I do not see any hope that we should be able to do that. The Minister for Finance, very much against precedent, has permitted me to include Sections 4 and 5 in this Bill, a Bill which, as I pointed out, was merely to grant an extension of time, and I fear that battle has been fought and lost and there is very little hope for the reasons mentioned in the other House &mdash; reasons very sound and very strongly pressed &mdash; that these provisions of Sections 4 and 5 could be made retrospective.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran is generally very generous in his appreciation of the situation.  I must say I was disappointed &mdash; at least I was disappointed to find he was disappointed at the amount of work done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we are in agreement, I can only say that I am glad that Senator Foran's disappointment was not felt as strongly as he seemed to express it.  On the question of housing and tuberculosis &mdash; I do not want to enter into a long discussion&mdash; but there are some rather remarkable things coming to light in relation to that problem.  One of them is the remarkable figures which have been recorded since the year 1940.  If there <Col N="349" /> is one country in the Western Hemisphere where, at the moment, overcrowding for one reason or another is prevalent, where housing conditions should be highly conducive to the contraction and spread of this terrible disease, I suppose it would be Great Britain.  There, you have all sorts of people who, owing to a number of causes, have to live in highly unhealthy conditions operating in very trying circumstances.  Yet in that country, the rate of mortality from tuberculosis has declined very considerably since the year 1940. On the other hand, I understand there were reports indicating where people moved from overcrowded houses in slum areas to areas where housing conditions are very much better, there has been an actual increase in the disease.  It seems to me that when we are speaking about tuberculosis we should be very careful not to ascribe it to one cause more than another.  There seem to be factors operating in relation to that disease which are not very strictly related to housing conditions.  I am raising that only because I think it is time we tried to look at this problem much more objectively and not in the light of preconceived ideas as to what really is the cause of it.</P>

      <P>Senator Honan referred <Col N="350" /> to the question of the extension of thatched houses.  That question was raised in the Dáil and I told Deputy Bartley that so far as I knew, that there was no regulation which insisted that where a reconstruction grant was being given for the enlargement of a thatched house the extension or alteration should be roofed with slates or tiles.  There is no such regulation and what I am puzzled to know is how the idea that there was such a regulation got about and if Senator Honan or any other member of the House can send me a note or give me some instance where a reconstruction grant was refused specifically on the ground that an addition to a thatched house must be slated or tiled, then I would be very glad indeed to look into it.</P>

      <P>That might be.  Perhaps the cost of reconstruction was not so great in that case, but I would like to have some particulars in relation to that matter.  Senator Maguire referred to the position of companies like the Artisans' Dwellings Company and houses which were erected by commercial undertakings.  I suppose that most of the property built by brewers, distillers and the Artisans' Dwellings Company has been erected for a considerable number of years, certainly before the Act of 1932 came into operation. If it has been erected since, there does not seem to be any great difficulty about these companies putting themselves inside the terms of the Act.  There is nothing simpler than forming a public utility society including as one of its main objects the provision of houses for the working classes.  That provision in the rules or regulations will put the society immediately within the scope of the Act of 1932 and will qualify it on certain conditions for the grants in exactly the same way as other public utility societies.  But, so far as houses erected prior to the Act of 1932 are concerned, they cannot qualify for grants under that Act.  These, I think, are the only points that I have to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending Bill, dealing with a number of matters.  The question of travelling expenses is the first matter dealt with.  Provision for travelling expenses for county councillors was made in the Local Government Act that was passed in 1941.  At that time it was intended that Bills should be brought forward by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education making provision for the payment of travelling expenses to the members of county committees of agriculture and to the members of vocational education committees. Provision is being made in this Bill for the payment of reasonable travelling expenses to members of county committees of agriculture when attending meetings of the committee or meetings of sub-committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point that the Bill deals with is the disqualification of members of county committees of agriculture from the benefit of certain schemes administered by these committees. The position on this matter as it stands is considered to be too rigid.  No member of a county committee of agriculture can benefit by way of bargain or contract from any of the committees' schemes.  I think everybody will agree that it is a good principle, where there is competition for a certain thing, that a committee member should not benefit, such, for example, as in the placing of a premium bull or the placing of a poultry station, for either of which there might be many applicants.  It would be unfair, or at least it would be considered unfair, if in such matters county committee members were to benefit.  On the other hand, where the county committee is distributing something that every farmer can benefit from, such, for example, as lime &mdash; and there is enough lime for everybody &mdash; there is no reason whatever why a member of a county committee of agriculture should not get <Col N="353" /> that benefit.  We are dealing with a position of that kind and providing that certain things may be exempted, to the extent of their being available to the members of the county committee of agriculture if the Minister thinks that is desirable.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with the dissolution of county committees of agriculture. Under the present law, if one of these committees is not doing its duty, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has to take action first by dissolving the county council.  In that way the county committee of agriculture is automatically dissolved.  The Minister for Local Government can reconstitute the county council, leaving the county committee of agriculture dissolved.  There is no reason why that round-about method should have to be employed if a county committee of agriculture has to be dissolved.  Under this Bill, a county committee of agriculture can be dissolved in the same way as a county council or any other public authority.</P>
    <P>We next deal with the staffs of the county committees.  Under this Bill the officers of county committees will attend any conferences that may be called by the Minister for Agriculture, or any educational functions that he may ask them to attend.  Some time ago there was some difference of opinion about this matter between some of the county committees and the Department of Agriculture as to whether a county committee had the right to prevent its officers from attending such functions.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the retiring age of officials, and brings this question of retiring age into line with the legislation already passed dealing with local authorities which are under control of the Department of Local Government. This Bill will enable the Minister for Agriculture to declare a certain age to be the retiring age, so that officials belonging to a particular class must retire at the age declared. Section 9 deals with the suspension of officers, but that is only a reenactment of what has already been the law&mdash;bringing into the code of legislation dealing with the county <Col N="354" /> committees of agriculture what has at all times been in the local government code.  These are the various matters dealt with in this Bill.  As I have said it is an amending Bill.  Its purpose is to bring into line, so far as county committees of agriculture are concerned, all those matters that have already been dealt with by the Minister for Local Government in regard to county councils, and that are at present being dealt with by the Minister for Education so far as vocational education committees are concerned.</P>

      <P>It is not often that I find myself opposing measures introduced by the Minister for Agriculture. He is not quite so gracious to me, because I often find him opposing proposals which I put before the House. That is, probably, an error of judgment on his part and, doubtless, he will grow wiser.  In this measure, the Minister has contrived to introduce quite commendable propositions and very unacceptable ones.  That places the House in a difficulty.  I shall deal, in the first instance, with the part of the Bill to which I take exception. The Minister is taking power to dissolve county committees of agriculture. I am astonished at that decision on the part of a man like the Minister for Agriculture.  Temperamentally and otherwise, he is not the type of Minister one associates with dissolutions of such bodies or suspensions of their officers.  I cannot understand why he seeks power to dissolve county committees of agriculture and I want more information on that point.  What are his reasons?  He indicates to the House that, owing to the legal position, if he wants to dissolve a county committee of agriculture, he has to go to the Minister for Local Government and get him to suspend the county council. It is only in that way that a county committee of agriculture can be dissolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has a county committee of agriculture ever been dissolved for failing to do its work?  Will the Minister, from his own experience or the experience of his Department, tell us of a county committee of agriculture which has failed to do its job?  We have had <Col N="355" /> dissolutions of committees of agriculture in certain counties but those were due to the fact that the county councils had to be dissolved.  The county committees of agriculture, being composed largely of members of the county council, had to be dissolved in those circumstances.  Even where a county council had failed to do its duty, I do not think that any similar charge was levelled against the county committee of agriculture. I have no knowledge of any such failure on the part of a committee and I have been interested in county committees of agriculture for a long time.  I do not know what the Minister is trying to protect himself against in seeking power to dissolve these committees. It is not the proper method of getting done the work that county committees of agriculture are called upon to do. It is true that the function of a county committee of agriculture to-day is mainly administrative.  These committees come together month after month doing rather routine business&mdash;the allocation of the money they get to spend, the number of premiums to be awarded to bulls and boards, the number of poultry stations to be established and the amount to be spent on a line scheme.  The work of a county committee of agriculture and, indeed, the work of the technical head or executive officer of such a committee, is mainly administrative.  I think that the work of the technical officer is too much administrative and that more of his time should be devoted to technical planning and advice, which is his proper function.  Nobody with experience of the work of these committees will be convinced that they have done their work in such an inefficient way as to call for the granting of this power to the Minister.</P>
    <P>My objection to the powers which are sought is that this is the wrong approach to the problem of getting done the work which county committees are required to do.  It is wrong to have inspectors of the Minister's Department visiting the committees every few months to see whether or not they are carrying out their job of work.  I avoided reading the debates <Col N="356" /> on this matter in the other House because I wanted to give expression to my own thoughts.  I have had experience of the work of a number of these committees and I do not think that there is any case for the granting of the powers which are sought.  Even if the Minister got the powers, I should be astonished if he were to use them. If a county committee was not doing the work it was appointed to do, to hold the big stick over them would not serve the Minister's purpose.  It would have the opposite effect.  Instead of the farmers and ratepayers having greater interest in the schemes and more confidence in the administration of the officers, the opposite would be the case.  I cannot contemplate the powers being used even if the Minister be granted them.</P>
    <P>When I look at the reasons why a county committee may be dissolved, I am not at all convinced.  One reason, as set out in the Bill, is that &ldquo;the duties of a committee of agriculture are not being duly and effectively discharged by such committee.&rdquo;  There is no use in pretending that every committee of agriculture is doing its job well.  But if any number of farmers be asked their opinion about the Department of Agriculture, Senators know the opinion that will be expressed. The Minister himself has heard it.  We have all made our contribution in that respect, though some of us have not gone far in that direction.  There may be a difference of opinion between the Minister's Department and a committee of agriculture as to whether or not the work is being efficiently done.  I recollect coming, as a member of a deputation from Cavan County Committee of Agriculture, to the Department some time ago.  That was at the time when grants were first being made for the distribution of lime.  We pleaded that we should be permitted to utilise this money not in the distribution of lime but in the purchase of artificial manures.  We spent the greater part of an hour discussing the matter with the Minister's most representative executive officials but we failed to convince them that we should be permitted to utilise that money for the purchase of <Col N="357" /> artificial manures.  As Cavan farmers, we were convinced that our lands would be the better for the spending of that money on artificial manures, but we failed to convince the executive officers of the Department of Agriculture on the point.  We know now that that money would have been much better spent on artificial manures than on lime not only in Cavan but in every other county of the State.  We knew we were right and that the land would be stronger and in better heart if we were permitted to purchase artificial manures with the money.  You have there a case in point, where I raised a question as to the efficiency of the work being carried on.  I remember that when the committee returned the members were considering whether they would spend the money on lime or not.  They decided to do so, but they were not convinced.  That is one reason why the Minister may dissolve a committee.  Another reason is where:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A committee of agriculture for a county wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order, direction, or regulation of the Minister...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I say is that if we are going to initiate a policy of that kind in an Act of the Oireachtas, and if we are going from Merrion Street to dictate to a county committee what it has to do when it has a different point of view from that of the Department, or if farming is to be conducted from Merrion Street, it is a bad principle, and one that I do not think is going to commend itself to intelligent farmers.  It will not be good for committees of agriculture or for the creation of confidence on the part of the people in decisions of the Department.  When I read that sub-section I wondered if the Minister would be advised by the Department to avail of it.  I have experience of inspectors coming to meetings of committees of agriculture for many years. They were level-headed men who understood the problems of counties in which they were stationed for the time being.  If there are different points of view I feel that the way to get common understanding is by discussion between these inspectors and members of <Col N="358" /> committees, instead of the Minister taking power to dissolve committees because they are not carrying out some Order that may be really nonsensical. That is not a principle that will commend itself to members of committees. I suggest that an Order could be made in the Department that would not suit a county in which it was to operate. That is my experience.  The Minister will not contradict me when I say that decisions of that kind may have been made in the past, and that after some years it was not found easy to stand over them.  Another sub-section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a committee of agriculture for a county fails to comply with any judgment, order, or decree of any court&rdquo;</P>
    <P>it may be dissolved.  I have no recollection of a committee of agriculture being brought into court and judgment being given against it.  It may have happened.  If judgment were given against it, I take it that the members had to pay up.  I do not think that there is any ground for dissolving a committee for having refused to respect the judgment of a court.</P>
    <P>Another sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a committee of agriculture for a county refuses after due notice to allow its accounts to be audited by a local government auditor ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did any committee of agriculture ever do so?  I think that considerable exception is taken to the action of the Minister in asking for this power.  The Minister has given no explanation for asking for it.  He has been a fairly long time in office, and during a really difficult period from the point of view of administration, when there were reasons why committees could be rebellious.  They were rebellious, perhaps more than they demonstrated. Nevertheless, in difficult times they attended meetings, and did their work loyally and with goodwill.  Except he has reasons which he did not disclose to the House, I wish the Minister would reconsider this matter.  I am at a loss to know why the Bill contains such a provision.  He has nonplussed farmers with it.  They are examining their consciences to know what the <Col N="359" /> Minister is getting at, or who has been guilty.  The Minister will have some explaining to do on this Bill.  I object very strongly to that section.  There is not in it the kind of relationship that should be established in an Act of the Oireachtas between the Department and committees of agriculture.  There is no reason why the Minister should ask for these powers, or why he should ever have to exercise them. If a committee was incompetent, negligent, or as bad as it could be, I prefer to leave it to the tender mercies of the people of the county to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Another section deals with the payment of travelling expenses of members of committees.  There was never a more vague and indefinite section in any Bill.  A similar section was introduced into an Act passed recently dealing with vocational education, empowering members of committees to collect travelling expenses.  We are just repeating in this Bill what was in that section.  While I do not know what is happening in other counties in regard to travelling expenses, I am aware of what occurred at a meeting of the vocational committee in Cavan after the passing of the amending Act. A number of members of the vocational committee are also members of the county council, and we contrived to have the meetings of the two bodies on the same day.  As a result of the passing of the new Vocational Education Act travelling expenses that members can claim are actually lower now than in the past.  One member had to cycle 12 miles over bad roads to attend the meetings, and all he could claim was 1½d. a mile.  It was dark before he started to cycle home.  I suggest that when the Minister and I started cycling a great many years ago there was a regulation in another Department fixing the scale of expenses for those who cycled at 1½d. a mile.  It would not be possible to buy many smuggled tyres for a bicycle at the rate of 1½d. a mile now allowed for travelling expenses. If that is the best the Minister for Agriculture is going to do for members of committees, I suggest that the position needs looking into.</P>
    <P>There was considerable discussion at <Col N="360" /> this meeting of the vocational committee about the question of travelling expenses and the members obviously had a considerable grievance.  The Department of Agriculture should have some plan which would enable members of committees to get in by hiring a motor car which would travel a wide circuit and take members in from different districts.  There should be some plan which would enable the members to attend without being put in the invidious position of having to travel considerable distances on bad roads on winter days and then getting only 1½d. per mile as expenses.  I am satisfied that in Section 2 the Minister is doing what he believes will clarify the position and make it more satisfactory for the committees, but I suggest that it needs examination as when some of the members went to the manager to claim their expenses they found they were worse off than they were in the days before the manager determined the amount of travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>I find no fault with the liberty that is extended to certain members to benefit to a certain extent in the distribution of the funds which come under the administration of the committees. It is well to know that they can benefit only to a very limited extent.  Quite clearly, if it were possible for members to claim that they had the right to get a premium bull or a poultry station, the position would be very unsatisfactory.  Perhaps the Minister would even now decide that Sections 4 and 5&mdash;and 5 especially &mdash;should have no place in this Bill at all and that, in his riper judgment, he does not want those powers and would not use them if he had them. He should decide that the reasons he has given for asking for these powers are not reasons which justify the House in passing the Bill in its present form.</P>

      <P>On the question of transport, I understand it is quite in order for members of county committees to travel by motor car and be paid for doing so, provided that there is no other means of public transport. I do not think there is any need to make an Order regarding that, as it is the law at the present moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provisions for the abolition of the county committees, I feel it is better that they should be abolished independently rather than that county councils should be abolished in order to abolish the committees. In the Act of 1934, provision was made to abolish boards of health without abolishing the county councils, so there is nothing very novel in the provisions of this Bill in that respect.  The practice up to the present has been entirely undemocratic as, if it were necessary to get rid of a county committee, one first had to get rid of the county council.  In many cases, the members of the county committee would be almost identical with those of the county council.  It is true that the work of these committees is, in the main, of an administrative character. Once we admit this principle of abolition as being right&mdash;I am not arguing in favour of it, but we have had it in previous legislation in regard to county councils and boards of health&mdash; in regard to a larger body with wider scope, how can we argue it as wrong in the case of a subsidiary body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any case made by the Senator, it is that, whereas county councils, boards of health and other local authorities might be remiss in discharging their duties, in no circumstances would that ever occur in the case of a county committee of agriculture.  I feel that the Senator went to great pains&mdash;to too great pains &mdash;to make a case that it would have been possible to make for county councils and other local authorities. I think it is preferable to retain these provisions rather than have the law stand as it is at present.  I feel that the Bill as submitted to the House <Col N="362" /> is better in its present form and I hope the Minister will not agree to delete these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know much about county committees of agriculture as such, but it seems extraordinary to me that in this Bill, under the payment of travelling expenses, definition is made as to the lesser quantity of miles these committee members may travel, but there is no limit, and nothing to prevent them from coming up to Dublin for a week-end.  I know that that seems frivolous, but it is possible.  I suggest that the radius of the meeting should be circumscribed, as also should be the maximum number of miles, if that is possible.  I know it sounds rather ridiculous to say that a committee might decide to hold its meeting on the day of an all-Ireland football final but that is possible under the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>Section 3, sub-section (3) (a), allows a person to become a member of a committee in certain circumstances. With all respect to the present Minister, I submit that the time may arrive when certain people may be made members of committees even though they hold contracts.  I say that this is a rather dangerous principle to adopt, as the time may arrive when we would not have Ministers in office with the probity of the present Ministers. I can see the danger of people being appointed on public committees dealing with the payment of public funds and utilising them for their private benefit. That would have a dangerous effect on the probity of the State.</P>
      <P>I think that the reference in sub-section (4) of Section 9 is a little bit harsh.  Here is a man on trial, out on bail, suffering a suspensory sentence, and during that time the State says that he may go hungry, as his pay will be withheld.  The sub-section does not say that, if the man is found not guilty, the amount of salary&mdash;assuming that we have a corrupt Minister&mdash;will not be withheld.  That seems to be creating an autocracy of Ministerial omniscience which is against all the fundamental principles of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Section 10 (1) is an extremely dangerous one.  I can envisage&mdash;and I <Col N="363" /> am sure this is not beyond the bounds of imagination of other members&mdash;the Minister saying, because of the political persuasions of a man who is employed in a particular capacity: &ldquo;I will not have that fellow there&rdquo; and simply suspending him.  Such a man does not seem to have any rights under the Bill.  It leaves the individual open to the private vendetta of the Minister. I am not saying that the Ministers will not be of the calibre of the present Minister, but in matters of this sort which have some perpetuity value, we should be careful to insert all safeguards for the individual.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the section to which Senator Baxter referred, where the Minister asks for power to dissolve county committees of agriculture. I am not going to deal with it from the same point of view as Senator Baxter, but Section 5 says that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... if and whenever the Minister is satisfied, after the holding of a local inquiry under Section 24, of the Principal Act, as amended by this Act, that the duties of a committee of agriculture for a county are not being duly and effectively discharged by such committee,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on, he can dissolve it.  Now, I can realise that the argument put forward by Senator Brennan is correct and that it is a very good argument: that where you have obstreperous or unruly members of a committee of agriculture, to such extent as to make the committee unworkable, the Minister would have to dissolve the whole council; but look at the whole principle underlying this whole thing. Mind you, although the principle has been accepted by this House before, as Senator Brennan pointed out, the fact that it has been accepted does not make it right, and I, personally, abhor the whole idea underlying this thing because it may mean that a form of Government might arrive in this country when we might have to base ourselves upon the American model.</P>
    <P>Under the power that is sought for here, we are giving to Ministers powers affecting whole sections of the community, whether committees of agriculture, <Col N="364" /> county councils, civil servants, or any other kind of public officials.  It means that any or all of these people or bodies can be automatically dissolved at the discretion of the Minister, and we may yet reach the stage when all public officials, whether servants of the local authorities or civil servants, will go out with a particular Government or a particular Party, and we may develop, as I have said, along American lines, where certain public officials go out with each Government. That is the principle to which I object.</P>
    <P>As things are at the moment, I am not aware of any reason why the Minister should want this power, any more than Senator Baxter knows.  The Minister probably has a very good reason for asking for this power, but I am against the principle of the thing, because I hold that if it is to be accepted in this case, it can be extended to such a degree that all our so-called democratic institutions and the so-called democratic status of our people will become a mere farce.  That is my objection to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter has had great experience of county committees of agriculture, and I think the Minister would be wise to pay attention to his remarks, and to look into the grievances he put forward.  I know nothing about committees of agriculture, but I understood that the purpose of this Bill was to make better provisions and to remove certain restrictions from members of the committees of agriculture, and to make certain regulations in connection with agricultural instructors.  It would seem, however, from Senator Baxter's remarks, that there are several things in the Bill which are objectionable. I am not competent to discuss those objectionable features to which Senator Baxter referred, but I am sure there must be something in his point of view when he put forward all these objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this country very competent agricultural instructors, but in very many cases there is no possibility of these instructors being able to give lectures or impart their knowledge to agricultural workers or farmers in the country because of the lack of parish <Col N="365" /> halls.  I am not going to discuss that matter further, Sir, because I know that you would rule me out of order, but perhaps you will allow me to make an appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the Government, and particularly with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, with a view to seeing that parish halls are erected in the villages throughout the country where, at the moment, there is no accommodation for giving those lectures.  If the Minister would do that, he would be doing a great service to the country, because it would give us an opportunity of hearing lectures by these agricultural instructors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this matter of the dissolution of the committees of agriculture, I should like to say a few words.  I feel that the farmers of the country owe a deep debt of gratitude to the men who represented them in the troubled times in this country.  These people attended the meetings of the county committees at great risk to themselves during the troubled times, and they discharged their duties remarkably well.  That is a tribute that we should pay to them to-day, and we are proud to know that a good number of them are still alive.  Since our own Government came into office the best men in the country were selected and appointed to sit on these boards and, as Senator Baxter has said, I have not heard of a single case in which they did not discharge their duties faithfully and honestly.  They are the only bodies in the country which, to my mind, should be encouraged because, after all, they represent the farming industry in this country and, as I have said, the farmers are keen enough and wise enough to select the best men, and these men have discharged their duties well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I do not believe for a moment <Col N="366" /> that the Minister has the slightest intention of dissolving a board that is giving fairly good satisfaction, but I do say that it is a terrible reflection on the members of the committees of agriculture that this power should be taken, because they will feel that it means that they are not doing their duty well and that there is no place for them.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and to give to these committees of agriculture at least the honour that is due to them.  I do not want to refer to the question of travelling expenses, because I think it is a disgrace to feel that a man, as Senator Baxter said, travelled for 1½d. a mile to do his duty to the farmers and his neighbours&mdash;often travelling 40 and 50 miles.  I happen to be a member of a committee of agriculture, and I know the distance that some unfortunate people had to travel, and travelled willingly, in order to do their duty and serve their country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I agree entirely with the point made by the last speaker, that the county committees of agriculture, generally, throughout the country will see in this proposal of the Minister something to be resented.  I do not think it is a good thing to make provision to deal with an abuse unless there is some evidence that that abuse has existed or is likely to exist in the near future.  I agree thoroughly with what Senator MacCabe has said in that connection. It will create a bad impression in the country to see the Minister bringing in this regulation, in a time like this especially, when the Government has a lot of much more important things to attend to.  That we should spend time bringing in legislation of this kind to deal with an abuse which we know has not existed and is not likely to exist in the future, will certainly not make a good impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point upon which I should like to be clear.  I think that the Minister, in his opening statement, said that if it should become necessary to suspend a county committee of agriculture, that could only be done by first suspending the county council.  As I understand it, when a county council <Col N="367" /> is suspended its subsidiary bodies are also suspended; they cease to operate after the county council is suspended. Now, the Minister proposes to short circuit the operation and suspend the county committee, if he thinks that is necessary.  Will that cut both ways? Will it mean that, if it becomes necessary for the Minister for Local Government to suspend a county council, the county committee may still continue, if it has not done something for which it could be suspended?  Will that be the effect of the new provision?</P>
    <P>I do not like to give the Minister the powers he proposes to take under Section 8.  They seem to me to be very vague:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may declare any specified age to be the age limit for all offices or for such offices as belong to a specified class, description or grade, or for one or more specified offices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to give very wide power to the Minister with regard to the officials of county committees of agriculture. There ought to be a more definite provision for fixing the age of retirement for public officials of this kind than simply indicating that the Minister may at any time declare any specified age to be the age for retirement.  So far as I can see, that Order may be made without any reference to the Oireachtas, without placing it before the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>As Senator Baxter pointed out, Senators are put in a rather difficult position because one cannot really determine what is the principle of the Bill, or what one is expected to vote for on the Second Reading.  Some of the provisions are quite satisfactory, but there are others rather objectionable and one finds it difficult to make up one's mind how one should vote on the Second Reading, it is so difficult to determine the principle enshrined in the measure.</P>

      <P>I was rather puzzled about Senator Baxter's reference to the 1½d. a mile cycling allowance. The Senator drew a great picture of the hardship involved in having <Col N="368" /> to cycle for 1½d. a mile.  Does he suggest that that is inadequate?  The principle of payment for time is not admitted under the Act.  The principle relates to the amount of travelling expenses and, if that is merely the figure to be determined, I do feel that 1½d. is sufficient for the wear and tear of a cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it desirable to register my opposition to the Bill.  I take much the same line on it as I did with reference to the abolition of county councils.  I regret very much that it has been found necessary to do these things.  I regret that the Government believe that sufficient patriotism cannot be found amongst our people. I regret that our county councils and our county committees are treated in this manner.  I think the Government are ill-advised to take such drastic steps as they have taken all along the line.  They are really ostracising the rural community and are acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State.  That is the view of many thinking people.  They are not giving the rural elements the voice to which they are entitled.  If the Minister asked my opinion, I would suggest that every parish council should have at least two or three representatives on county committees of agriculture, if not on the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House would be unanimous in granting the Minister such power that, when members of a county council or a county committee would gravely misconduct themselves, they would forthwith be debarred from taking part in the local life of the country and a fresh election would be held.  Even so far as colleagues of mine are concerned, taking, for example, a leader of mine such as Senator Mulcahy&mdash;I would speak with affection of anything that would come from him&mdash;if it is put up to me that he and others take this line with reference to the abolition of the county councils, I would differ from him and them with the greatest regret.  As experience has come to me through the operation of various Acts, the difference becomes wider.  I would be almost inclined to join any political Party that would favour the restoration to the people of <Col N="369" /> full local authority, because I believe that responsibility would be the making of the people.  Responsibility thrown on the men who will be elected will, to my mind, produce the highest form of patriotic action.  I believe the abolition of county committees of agriculture will do very great harm.</P>
    <P>I recollect two young Senators spending an hour in Committee elaborating a certain scheme.  I will not mention their names; they belong to very honoured political Parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  They spent an hour one evening elaborating some scheme with reference to the carrying out of a job on a county committee or a county council.  When jobs are to be carried out, they will not be carried out in the county councils or the county committees.  Go higher up and you will get them professionalised. What will a county committee do if it has any idea of patriotism, common sense or common law?  Will it not administer a scheme in the best interests of the people?  If it does not do so, then kick them out and debar them from being elected to any other local authority.  Do not take away the sense of responsibility from the people in the remote country districts.</P>
    <P>It makes no difference to me that I give my opinion to the Government that is now in office.  I will give it to this Government just as earnestly as I would give it to a Government that would be elected as I would like to have it elected.  I think it is a mistake to proceed along the lines of urbanising the entire nation.  The officials who go down the country, fully trained in the ways of the city, whether they be auditors or anything else, will obviously see things through urban eyes, and I suggest that is detrimental to the conduct of affairs in the rural areas.  The words of Ministers, when they are pleading for greater food production, are not treated with all the respect they deserve.  Possibly the reason is that in some instances they take professional advice, they accept the views offered them in the city, and they go against the men who, for many years, <Col N="370" /> have done their best to carry on public administration.  If those men were encouraged, and if more power were given them, I believe the position would be much more satisfactory. Difficulties should not be placed across their path.  If they were properly encouraged, these men would gladly offer themselves for election in the future.  It is perfectly true that the best citizens are not offering themselves for election to public boards, and it is perfectly true that some people do not vote as perhaps they ought to, but that is applicable to more elections than local elections.</P>
    <P>I think every encouragement should be given to parish councils to carry out representative functions in these matters.  I do not want to question anything Senator Baxter has said in regard to expenses, because some poor men will need expenses.  Personally, I have never made a claim for travelling allowances, because I was never entitled to them.  In conclusion, I think the Government should hesitate before completely abolishing local representation in the manner proposed.</P>

      <P>There are only a few remarks I want to make in regard to this Bill, and I shall deal with the various sections upon which I wish to comment as they appear in the Bill. To begin with Section 2, we have had already some discussion on the question of expenses and the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.  The particular phraseology is &ldquo;would reasonably have been incurred by him&rdquo;.  It is not clear from the Bill who is to be the interpreter of what is reasonable and what is not, and I should be glad to have that point cleared up.  So far as Section 3 is concerned, Senator O'Donnell, in discussing the danger of members of committees being interested in contracts, I think, overlooked the fact that committees of agriculture do not engage so much in the ordinary business contracts to which he is accustomed, but more usually carry out larger schemes which are not so much for the benefit of any particular individual as for the benefit of all the <Col N="371" /> farmers in the area.  It would be unfortunate if a member of a committee of agriculture, simply because of that membership, found himself in the position of not being able, for example, to get a load of lime, because, without some such enactment as this, that would be the position.  At the same time, it is, as Senator O'Donnell said, very necessary to ensure the maintenance of public confidence, and that there can be no possible suggestion that any member of a committee is enabled in any shape or form to benefit by any contract given by that committee.  Though I think a general provision is in some shape necessary, I dislike a particular exception.</P>
      <P>I am not certain whether the matter could be provided for in any other way but, if it could, I think it would be better for the Minister to define in the section itself the type of scheme in which a member of a committee of agriculture could engage or, perhaps, to put it the other way round, the type of scheme in which he could not engage. If it is felt that that cannot be done, I do think it necessary to have some such saving exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the real purpose of introducing this Bill, from the discussion at any rate, is contained in Section 5.  From any information that I have been able to gather I cannot find any county committee of agriculture that has failed to carry out its duties.  I have not had much experience myself; it has not been sufficiently long to justify my relying upon it; but I have gone to a good deal of pains to find out what is the position for other members of my own county council in Kildare who have been members for a long time, and none of them can remind me of any clash between the Department and their committee. When one cannot find any such clash and when the Minister does not tell us of specific clashes which render the introduction of such a clause necessary, I think we ought to be very slow to go further in the matter of concentrating the whole local government of the country, as well as the central government, in, as it were, the centre of a net of officials of various Government <Col N="372" /> Departments, because that is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>I think the House is entitled to hear from the Minister why exactly he visualises any committee of agriculture refusing or neglecting to comply, for example, with an order of the court or with any lawful Order, if that Order is reasonable.  As the section stands, so long as the Order is lawful, no matter how daft it may be in relation to a particular area, the county committee must be fired out by the Minister if it refuses to carry out his direction. Surely the members of a county committee know what will suit their area. I think every Senator will agree with me when I say that county committees are probably the best local bodies which exist in local government and it does not seem to me reasonable to expect these powers to be given without dire necessity and without that necessity being explained to us.</P>
    <P>Under Section 9, the officers of a county committee are to be put in a rather invidious position.  They are not to know whether their boss is the committee or the Minister, and I think it would be far more satisfactory if the Minister, instead of taking power himself to suspend an instructor, took power to make the county committee suspend him, so that a particular agricultural instructor in any area would know that he was working under one boss and only one boss.  I should like also to subscribe to the statement&mdash;I forget who it was who mentioned the matter&mdash;that it does seem unfair that where a man is suspended, his pay should automatically cease.  If a man is charged in the District Court and returned for trial to the Circuit Court, his emoluments from any employment do not cease until he is convicted. This, in effect, means that the conviction takes place at the time of suspension and not at the time of removal.</P>
    <P>I also find it difficult to appreciate the necessity for including in the Bill the same point as I referred to on the Appropriation Bill, that is, the changing of the status of any person's employment half way through his contract. In Section 11, the Minister takes <Col N="373" /> power specifically and deliberately to ensure that the powers in the Bill shall apply to existing officers.  I do not think we shall get into the service of the State the type of people the service of the State demands and will benefit from, if we are to continue to set up precedents half way through the period of service of these people, chopping and changing, perhaps to the detriment of these people, the terms of service on which they took up their profession or way of life.  I do not think that will encourage others to enter the service, and the effect of it, in the long run, will be that we shall get a gradually worse type into the service of local authorities as well as into the service of the central Government. I earnestly ask the Minister to consider the position from that angle, and, regardless of what he may do in respect of fixing specific age limits or anything else for any new person coming into the service, leave these people, who came in on specific terms, on a contract of service, to carry out their duties, as I hope, properly&mdash;if not, he can take action&mdash;according to the terms of service under which they were engaged.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully since the discussion on this Bill began, in the hope that I would hear something which would convince me that there is some substance in the objections made against it, but so far I must confess that I have not heard anything which would give me even the slightest idea that there is substance in the objections being made.  The discussion seems to centre mainly around Section 5.  I should like to know in what way that section worsens the position of agricultural committees.  Is it not possible at present to have an agricultural committee dissolved?  The difference between this and the existing legislation is that under existing legislation, a committee could be dissolved only in a very roundabout way, whereas, under Section 5 of this Bill, the procedure is simple and direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objection has been taken to the power of the Minister to stop the payment of salaries and to withhold <Col N="374" /> emoluments in the case of a person who has been suspended.  The only point which occurs to me in that regard is that if a private employer, in the event of one of his servants being summoned for any particular reason, decides to retain the services of that employee until such time as the matter is settled, he is paying out his own money.  He is dealing with money, with property, which is his own and which he is free to dispose of in any way he thinks fit.  There is a very great difference between that and continuing to pay public moneys to a person who has been suspended.  I cannot conceive of any Minister or any Department dreaming of suspending any official without very serious grounds for such suspension, so that I think we are simply raising a bogey in trying to base an objection on either of these two matters, that is, the right of the Minister to dissolve committees and his right to withhold payment of salaries until such time as the cause of suspension has been investigated. I do not think that there is really anything whatever in the objections made this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Two very small points occur to me in regard to this Bill, small in words, but one of them involves, I think, an important principle.  First of all, in Section 2, sub-section (3), the last two lines convey to me no meaning whatsoever. They seem to me a most unmerciful bit of English and a most unmerciful bit of drafting.  The words are: &ldquo;...expenses which would reasonably have been incurred by him in travelling from and to his ordinary place of residence to and from the place of that meeting&rdquo;.  Now, if that means in travelling from his ordinary place of residence to the place of meeting and back again, which would be the ordinary thing you would expect, why not say it?  I cannot understand the English of that.  I believe it to be a nonsensical sentence, and if the interpretation it is meant to have is the interpretation which I would suggest, I would very respectfully suggest that it might be put into plain English <Col N="375" /> and, of course, in translation, into plain Irish.</P>
      <P>The other point arises on Section 9. We are all familiar with the necessity of sometimes giving powers to a Minister which might seem rather arbitrary. There are very grave objections to that, but I do not want to embark on that wide and troubled sea at the present moment.  However, I do wish to call the attention of this House to the wording, which probably gives wider powers to a Minister and committee than have ever been given before.  I do not say there is no precedent for it, but I cannot recall one during comparatively recent months. In respect of any holder of any office&mdash; that is to say, a man who is doing his ordinary work for pay and emoluments&mdash;he would expect to be treated on reasonable lines, know what is charged against him and know who is charging him and have an opportunity of meeting any charge that is made. He is liable to be suspended not merely if his employers or the Minister have reason to believe that he has neglected his duty in some way, not merely if in the opinion of the employer or the Minister he has neglected his duty, but if in the opinion of the Minister there is &ldquo;reason to believe&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There, again, is a combination of English words which produces such a vague and general sentence that it is very difficult to translate them into any clear idea.  If a person has an opinion that he has reason to believe that somebody has done something, is the effect of the sentence.  I do respectfully suggest that if it is considered necessary&mdash;which I deprecate &mdash;some plain phrase should be put in, in respect of the holder of an office, to cover a case where the committee or the Minister considers that he has failed to perform his duties satisfactorily. That is something which we can understand.  It may be right or wrong, but it is intelligible, and if it comes before the court you may be able to give a meaning to it.  But how anyone can get a meaning from the present phrase is a problem which defeats me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> I have a certain liking, in the drafting of an Act, for words which convey a meaning both to the ordinary person and to the lawyer, but these words, I submit, convey no meaning either to the ordinary person or the lawyer, and I suggest that if it is a formula which has been approved in previous Bills, it is one which should be immediately abandoned.  I end my remarks with the proviso that, in conveying them, I should not be taken as accepting the principle that a Minister or anybody else should have this arbitrary power of suspending or dismissing an officer in their employment. Professionally, I have seen much evil come from it.  I have seen people acting with all the best possible intentions, earnestly and honestly, which have turned out to be grossly unfair, and, while confining my remarks to the particular wording, I would like to make it clear that I am not accepting the principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. Ruane Mr. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two small points.  Section 2, sub-section (2), says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall be paid under this section expenses in respect of a meeting held at a place less than five miles by any route from his ordinary place of residence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hold that the wording of that particular sub-section would operate adversely against some of the most useful members of agricultural committees. During my short experience on agricultural committees, I was associated with people who gave very practical assistance but who could not use bicycles.  I believe you will always find such people on progressive committees, and if it is laid down here that a farmer who lives four and a half miles from the place in which the committee meeting is held cannot receive expenses he will, in order to attend the committee, have to incur the expense of hiring a motor car for nine times 1/6 per mile for every meeting he attends.  For the sake of improving the personnel of these committees I think that should be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Minister may declare any specified age to be the age limit for all offices, or for such <Col N="377" /> offices as belong to a specified class, description or grade or for one or more specified offices.  I do not see why the age should not be stated in the Bill instead of the expression &ldquo;any specified age&rdquo;.  In an important matter like this, the figure should be set out&mdash;60 or 65&mdash;as it is in the case of other appointments.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I would like to raise on this Bill.  First of all, what does Section 5 mean?  Why are officers suspended? They are suspended because they do not carry out certain duties and no officer need be afraid of suspension if he does his work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) provides that an inquiry can be held.  Is it proposed to retain a committee that will not do its duty?  Is that what you want?  If a committee is appointed, it is appointed for a certain purpose, and if it does not do its duty, the Minister has the right to dissolve it.  I think we may be perfectly clear that there is very little danger of any committee being dissolved, but what has happened in many committees of agriculture? <Col N="378" /> They have been used for purposes for which they have not been appointed.  We have had snowball resolutions passed time and again by some of these committees for propaganda purposes.  A good many of them have been used in that way.</P>
      <P>As regards the age limit, I agree that there should be one and that it should be rigidly adhered to in order to give the younger men a chance of getting positions.  There are secretaries of county committees of agriculture who have reached the age of 65, and some 70 years, still holding on to their jobs, while at the same time younger men who are qualified for such positions cannot get them.  The only way to make provision for those younger men is to have this age limit rigidly adhered to.</P>
      <P>On the question of travelling expenses, the position in Kilkenny is that no arrangements have been made there for the payment of expenses between the period August, 1942, to June, 1943. That is explained in this way.  The county council was dissolved in 1934, and I understand that prior to that date no arrangements were made for the payment of expenses to the members of the county committee of agriculture. Therefore, the members of that committee will not be entitled to any expenses for the period I have mentioned. If similar cases have arisen elsewhere I would ask the Minister to see that special provision is made for them as well as for the members of the Kilkenny County Committee.  I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHayden" hpid="Mr. Hayden Mr. Hayden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayden</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a county committee of agriculture for 23 years, I claim to have fairly good experience of the work done by those committees.  I want to refer in particular to the amount allowed to the members for travelling expenses.  I have attended practically every committee meeting held in my county during the last 23 years.  In order to do so, I have had to cycle 12 miles to the meeting place and 12 miles home.  I first of all attend a meeting of the vocational committee at 12 o'clock. The meeting of the county committee <Col N="379" /> of agriculture starts at two o'clock on the same day and continues until about five o'clock.  Therefore, I can claim that my whole day is taken up attending those meetings.  If the members of the committee require a meal they have to pay for it out of their own pocket.  I suggest to the Minister that in this Bill he should make provision for the payment of a subsistence allowance as well as of travelling expenses.  I and other members of the committee of agriculture leave home as a rule about 10 o'clock in the morning and do not get home until 6 o'clock, and sometimes 8 o'clock in the evening.  I have known members of the county committee to leave work on their farms&mdash; to leave the harvest field&mdash;to attend a committee meeting.  Therefore, I think there is a good case for the payment of a subsistence allowance.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the payment of a travelling allowance of 2½d. per mile.  I am 60 years of age and, as I have said, I have to cycle 24 miles&mdash; 12 each way&mdash;in order to attend a committee meeting.  I have been doing that for 23 years.  It is a heavy strain on me.  I think that 2½d. a mile is an insignificant sum to allow.  I am a poor working man&mdash;an agricultural worker. I take an interest in the work of these committees.  I confess I had difficulty in finding the necessary sum to buy a bicycle in order to enable me to attend the meetings.  I find a difficulty now in getting tyres for the bicycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience, 2½d. a mile for a bicycle is altogether inadequate.  I am also a member of the county council. In my county we sometimes get a motor car to attend county council meetings; but if I can find any other means of travelling to the meeting I do not go to the expense of hiring a motor car.  I want to attend the meetings as cheaply as I can.  At the county council we were told if we came with a pony we would be allowed 3d. a mile, but that if we brought a horse we would get 4d. a mile.  There was that differentiation made between the horse and the pony.  When I could not <Col N="380" /> get tyres for my bicycle I went to my neighbour and got his horse to travel to the meeting.  During this time of emergency, the horse was worth 10/- a day to that man for hiring.  As we were only allowed 4d. per mile for the horse, all that the owner of it got was 8/- for the day, while at the same time the county council itself was paying 10/- a day for hired horses.  I appeal to the Minister to be a little more generous to the members of the county committees of agriculture.  They are good, genuine men.  In my county they have always given a good reception to the Minister and to his officials.  They are most enthusiastic as regards wheat growing and in carrying out the various schemes promoted by the committee. All that I ask for those members is that they get fair play and justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  I am inclined to agree with the last speaker in what he said about a subsistence allowance for members of county committees of agriculture. Some of them have to cycle ten, 15 and up to 20 miles in order to attend meetings. They suffer a good deal of hardship, especially during the short days, in setting out in the dark in the morning and cycling home on a dark night. The meetings are usually held in the principal town in the county.  A good many of the committee members cannot afford to go into a hotel to buy a meal.  They are already sufficiently out of pocket by reason of having to attend the meeting without incurring that additional expense.  I am sure Senator Hayden will agree that if a subsistence allowance is to be paid to members of county committees of agriculture it will also have to be paid to county councillors.  I think that the House should take this opportunity of expressing an opinion on that subject. I do not know if it is possible for the Minister to make provision for the payment of a subsistence allowance under this Bill.  If it is I support Senator Hayden's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about Section 5.  I cannot see anything tyrannical in it.  I have been a member of a county committee of agriculture for a long number of years.  I am a member of a county council at <Col N="381" /> present.  Do Senators who spoke in opposition to the section realise that it is only &ldquo;if and whenever the Minister finds that certain things have been done&rdquo; that the section will come into operation?  Listening to some of the speeches made on the section one would imagine that some extraordinary power was being taken under it for which there was no precedent.  Do not Senators well know that if and when the Minister for Justice finds a person doing a certain thing, that person is brought before the court, and that if and when a farmer allows weeds to grow over his fences the Minister for Agriculture under his regulations comes down on top of him?  The Minister does the same if a farmer allows a scrub bull, or half a dozen of them, to roam about.  Some Senators seem to see impending disaster for the members of county committees in this section.  I do not see that at all.  On the other hand, I see in it protection for the democratic representatives of the people.  Under the existing legislation, if a county committee of agriculture goes wrong, the only way it can be got rid of is by first getting rid of the county council.  On that point I would like to draw the attention of Senators to the fact that while the members of the county council are the direct elected representatives of the people, the members of a county committee of agriculture may not be such at all.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any misconception, may I say that never at any period during which I was a member of a county committee of agriculture was there occasion for any member to be afraid of that section.  I doubt that any county committee has any fear of the section, but I can visualise a position in which a county council would appoint a county committee of agriculture from which certain members would drop out from time to time and other members would be co-opted in their place.  After a few years, you might have a committee of agriculture completely different from that originally appointed by the county council. It would be hard lines on the county council if, because of the actions of <Col N="382" /> that type of county committee of agriculture, it was itself to be abolished. Because I believe that, I think that this section is absolutely necessary. The number of people who have anything to fear from the section are few, but we can easily imagine a certain group getting into control of a committee of agriculture and doing the things set out in the section.  I challenge any member of the House to say that a county committee doing these things, or not doing the things it is supposed to do, should not be brought under this or some similar provision.  I regard this section as a protection for county councils and the elected representatives of the people against a smaller body which may not be, and in most cases is not, wholly composed of elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman said that a county committee knows best what to do in its own county.  If anybody other than Senator Sweetman suggested that kind of law, I could understand it.  Would he follow that argument out to its logical conclusion and say that the individual farmer knows best what to do?  Would he say that the individual farmer knows what is best for himself and that, therefore, he should take no notice of the county committee of agriculture or the Minister for Agriculture? If that is Senator Sweetman's opinion, then he is suggesting that we go back to the law of the jungle.</P>

Senator Baxter and other Senators suggested that we were going to have the country dictated to from Merrion Street.  Where does he want dictation to come from?

      <P>Some people have done so and you would not be complimented if you heard what was said.  I do not think that there is anything to worry about in Section 5.  As regards Section 3, I know it is a great drawback that a member of a county committee of agriculture cannot benefit by the schemes made available by the committee. I have often found that a drawback myself and I felt sorry for other members of the committee who could not avail of certain schemes. But what is the alternative?  If anybody can suggest an alternative, I shall be 100 per cent. with him.  But I cannot see an alternative which would not be open to abuse if two or three persons&mdash;this is quite improbable but highly possible&mdash;were to agree to avail themselves to the full of the schemes under their own control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two or three points arising out of this Bill came in for special consideration by a number of Senators.  The first point has been fairly fully dealt with by Senator Quirke&mdash;the dissolution of county committees of agriculture.  It is possible to dissolve a committee at the moment but it must be done in a roundabout way.  No Senator will suggest that if a committee was not doing its business as it should do it or was not carrying out the schemes as they should be carried out, for the benefit of the farmers, that state of affairs should be allowed to continue.  A situation like that must be dealt with when it occurs.  If it were to occur now, we should have to deal with it by abolishing the county council.  Then the other body would go with it.  That is a very roundabout method and it would be unfair to a county council which might be properly discharging <Col N="384" /> its duty.  We are not taking any new powers under this Bill.  The powers in the Bill exist already but we are making it easier to abolish a county committee of agriculture.  I agree with Senator Quirke that no county committee resents this provision.  Senator Baxter said that he did not read the Dáil Debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Senator's word but Deputies used the same arguments, with one exception, as Senator Baxter used.  I have been around a number of committees of agriculture since this Bill was introduced and I did not hear a harsh word about it from one of them.  As Senator Quirke pointed out, if you passed a law that a Senator should be imprisoned for assaulting an innocent person, no Senator would be offended because each one would take it that it was not intended for him.  That is how the county committees feel.  They say that the provision is not intended for them because they are doing their duty properly.  Senator Baxter went so far as to say that farmers were wondering what was meant by this section.  I do not think that a dozen farmers have heard of this section or take the slightest interest in it.  I have met a great many farmers recently and not one of them asked me about this section.  If we were to ascertain their opinion, I am sure they would agree that there should be some such provision to deal with a county committee which is not doing its business properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds on which a county committee can be dissolved are set out fairly specifically in the section.  I do not want to cross swords with the lawyers in this House about the wording of certain clauses.  I have found from experience that the draftsmen have, on the whole, done their job well.  Their work has stood the test.  I suppose there can be a difference of opinion among lawyers as among other classes.  The offences, if they may be so described, for which a county committee can be dissolved and the procedure to be adopted are set out in the section. As Senator Quirke pointed out, in the case of dispute between a county committee <Col N="385" /> and the Minister, there must be a local inquiry.  But where a county committee refuses to comply with a legitimate Order or fails to comply with an order of the court or refuses to have its accounts audited, there need not be a local inquiry.  These are specific matters; they are plain to everybody; there can be no dispute whether they did or did not occur and, therefore, no local inquiry is necessary. In the other case, where there is a dispute as to efficiency or neglect of duty, a local inquiry must be held to have the matter properly investigated.  Any reasonable person will agree that it is better to have good administration, even from the point of view of democracy&mdash;I am glad to say we did not hear much about democracy in this House&mdash;if democracy is going to last and to succeed we must make sure that any democratic body is acting properly and efficiently and somebody must have power to abolish local authorities of this kind if they are not carrying out their duties properly.</P>
    <P>I must say that if this Bill had been passed in 1931, instead of 1944, I would never have made use of it in the last 13 years.  That is not to say that it was not necessary.  We are not taking any new powers.  The Minister for Local Government got an Act passed in 1941, but did not include in it several things which might have been included, and made applicable to county committees of agriculture and vocational education committees, because it was the decision arrived at between the three Ministers concerned that we would deal with our own legislation regarding the age of retiral, travelling expenses and other matters. In my Department we took the opportunity to bring in this Bill to deal with this and other questions that were hitherto in local government legislation and not concerned with agricultural committees.  We can in future for practically all purposes rely on our own legislation rather than on local government legislation in our dealings with county committees of agriculture. In my opinion, there is no necessity to make much of this question.  This is a re-enactment of what already was in local government legislation, making <Col N="386" /> it simpler, if you like, to suspend a county committee of agriculture but not going further than that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of travelling expenses, that question has been dealt with already by the Minister for Local Government and by the Minister for Education.  I am now dealing with it in reference to county committees of agriculture.  In this Bill we use the words &ldquo;reasonable travelling expenses&rdquo;, and I am asked to say who is going to interpret these words.  In the first instance the county committee of agriculture. Senators know that the decisions of county committees of agriculture are forwarded to the Department of Agriculture, and that the Minister may disapprove of these decisions when he thinks they are, I will not say wrong, but wrong legally.  I take it that in this sub-section as it stands, the same principle will be adopted, that county committees would give their views on what they thought were &ldquo;reasonable travelling expenses&rdquo; and that the Minister would not disapprove of them unless he came to the conclusion that they were unreasonable.  Instances were mentioned by Senators of the amounts being paid in certain cases, and I certainly feel that they are altogether unreasonable, that they are too low.  I do not think Senators need have any fear that there will be any difficulty about raising the rates mentioned, and giving people what would be considered reasonable expenses.  It is not likely that members of any county committee would vote themselves anything that would be considered unreasonable in that respect.</P>

      <P>Senator Ruane spoke of a lower limit than five miles in regard to mileage.  I feel that any person living within five miles of a principal town in a county, where these meetings are always held, must be in the position that he visits that town fairly <Col N="387" /> frequently.  If he is an active man he must have some means of transport, a pony and car, a horse and car or, if he is a young man, a bicycle.  A person who attends meetings in what is the ordinary market town occasionally, would not need to be paid expenses. Senator Hayden and Senator Quirke referred to subsistence allowances.  I take the view regarding legislation of this kind that the Minister for Local Government, who is dealing with the main local authorities, should be the first Minister to initiate a scheme of that kind.  I am not expressing any opinion against the payment of subsistence allowances.  The question was raised in the Dáil and I mentioned to the Minister for Local Government that I felt he should take the initiative there if he thought it wise to do so. He told me that he would consider the matter, and see if a case could be made for paying subsistence allowance to members of local authorities.  I have to wait to see what will be done.</P>
      <P>Senators will agree that I could hardly bring in a scheme of that kind for members of county committees of agriculture unless other Ministers were going to do the same, because I take it that county council meetings and meetings of vocational committees have more business to transact and last longer than committees of agriculture. Personally, when discussing the matter with the Minister for Local Government I shall keep the views expressed here in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Connell, when speaking about the dissolution of committees, asked if the period was going to be made shorter in which to suspend a county committee.  He wanted to know if that meant that if a county council was suspended, a committee of agriculture would not be suspended.  I am afraid we cannot change conditions in that respect, because if a county council goes, all subsidiary bodies, including county committees of agriculture, must go.  The next point dealt with concerned the retiral age.  Nobody appears to have objected strongly to the principle of fixing a retiral age.  Certain Senators thought the age should be mentioned in the Bill.  I think the principle <Col N="388" /> has been maintained so far, that the question of dealing with the staffs of local authorities has been regarded as an administrative matter, that is, that the Ministers concerned, Local Government, Education and Agriculture, deal with it in an administrative way, having got the necessary powers from the Oireachtas.  The same principle underlies the provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point was that it was unfair to apply this to existing officers.  I should like to point out that existing officers have no privilege whatever.  It is a great mistake to think they have. The existing officers were appointed by the local authorities, and I believe that Senators would absolutely squirm in their seats if they knew all the powers local authorities have over these officers.  It is a pity that Senators were not here in 1931, when this legislation was passed.  I do not think they would ever have let it through. Section 22 (4) of the Agriculture Act passed at that time says: &ldquo;A committee of agriculture may dismiss any servant of such committee and, with the approval of the Minister, remove any officer of such committee.&rdquo;  There is no restriction whatever on that power.  They need not state even the reason why they dismiss a man.  They may dismiss anybody they like for any reason they like. That being so, the officers of local authorities have no privilege or right, so far as I can see at the moment, to remain in their posts.  Through custom, as it were, they get a certain expectation of being left in their posts as long as they like.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were asked some time ago, or rather they got the urge to fix a retiring age for their officials. Here, again, the question of efficiency enters and I am sure every Senator will agree that efficiency is what we want.  There was a feeling that people over a certain age, taking the matter generally, were not fit to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>For instance, there are persons working for county committees, persons who are supposed to visit farms all over the county on bicycles, and <Col N="389" /> some of them are over 70 years of age.  It is hardly possible that these people can carry on efficiently.  So far as I know, they are doing fairly well, but, still, they are getting a bit old for the job.  We all agree there should be some retiring age and I am sure we will all agree that it should be a stated age for everybody.  We should not deal with every individual according to his condition.  Everyone will agree that if persons entering the service are told that there is a definite retiring age, there can be no objection, but some people say that should not be applied to the existing officers.  I think it should.  I submit that we must apply it to the existing officers and we are not taking any right or privilege from these people.  We may be taking them a little bit unawares. It will be the Minister for Local Government who will be dealing with the matter when the county committees decide what pension they will give to the person who is retiring.  They can give up to two-thirds of the retiring salary, if the person retiring has a service covering a certain number of years.  It is for the Minister for Local Government to approve or disapprove.</P>
    <P>In practice, the Minister for Local Government goes on the basis of one-sixtieth for each year of service.  If a man has 40 years' service he gets two-thirds of his salary without question and if he has 30 years' service he gets half his salary.  In practice that is what the Minister for Local Government does.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister and he agrees that if we make an Order of this kind, and if people who are now 64 or 65 years feel strong and hearty and look forward to at least another four or five years, not having made provision for an early retirement, he will be prepared to deal sympathetically with such cases and allow added years in order to give a better pension than he otherwise would give.</P>
    <P>The only other point that was raised was the point mentioned by Senator Walsh about the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture.  This Bill will allow expenses on the basis of the <Col N="390" /> new rate, whatever the county committee agrees is reasonable, to be paid retrospectively to the 30th June, 1943. Senator Walsh asked what rate would be allowed for the previous half-year. It will be the rate applicable before this Bill is passed, a rate the same as the county council rate.  I think it would be 4d. a mile one way, travelling by rail, and up to 5d. a mile travelling by road, according to the mode of travel.  Where the expenses have not been decided upon by county committees that may be waiting for this Bill to go through, the old rates will apply, up to the 30th June; that is, whatever rate may have been decided upon by the county committee.</P>

    <Title>Children's Allowances Bill, 1943&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children's Allowances Bill, as the House probably knows, secured general approval in the Dáil and, so far as could be judged from expressions of opinion appearing in the newspapers, general approval throughout the country.  In fact, so general was the approval given to the Bill in the other House that I felt it necessary to emphasise that the whole of the plan for the payment of children's allowances is not contained in this Bill.  It is not our practice, as the House knows, in Bills designed to forward particular projects, to set out therein the particular tax proposals which will raise the funds to make these projects possible. <Col N="391" /> Tax proposals are brought forward in finance measures and, as a necessary part of the plan for the payment of children's allowances in this State, it will be the duty of the Minister for Finance, at some stage, to propose the imposition of new taxes or the retention for a longer period of existing taxes to raise the money required for the payment of these benefits.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the measure is £2,250,000 per year.  £2,250,000 per year represents a very substantial addition to the expenditure of this State on social services.  It is, in fact, an increase of 25 per cent., and I should like the House to consider this Bill with that figure in mind, because approval of this measure seems to me to convey acceptance of the idea that an increase of 25 per cent. in the total expenditure of the State on social services can best be devoted to the establishment of this new service rather than to any other purpose, either the expansion of the provision now made to deal with unemployment, old age or ill-health, or any other useful social purpose.</P>
      <P>This measure aims to secure the mitigation of one cause of want operating in this community.  There are, as Senators know, many causes of want&mdash; unemployment, ill-health, old age, the death of a bread-winner.  Any one of these causes may produce want in many households and the State has, by various enactments, endeavoured to mitigate or remove want arising from these causes.  Social surveys carried out elsewhere, and our own experience, have shown that there is another cause of want not associated with unemployment, ill-health or old age, and that is, the want which arises amongst large families where the standard wage or the average income capable of providing the necessaries of life for a small family or a family of average size is inadequate to meet the needs of a large family.  It is to remove that cause of want that this Bill is designed.  I will ask Senators to remember that that is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the Dáil, and in various newspapers, that <Col N="392" /> the scope of the Bill should be extended to achieve other purposes, but, apart from the fact that any extension of its scope would react also upon the cost of it, the view of the Government is that we should aim to achieve in this Bill the one purpose that we have in mind, and that is the elimination of want due to the inadequacy of a standard wage or an average income to provide for the needs of a large family.  This Bill is designed to close the gap in the social services of this State which permits want arising from that cause.</P>
    <P>In so far as the principle of the Bill has secured general acceptance, I assume it is not necessary to defend it at any length.  I think the need for the measure has been recognised by everybody.  In fact, most political parties, and a large number of individuals not associated with political parties have been vying with each other in claiming to be the authors of the idea which the Bill represents. It is clear, however, that the implementation of the idea offered, and will offer in the future, many practical difficulties.  After the Government had decided that such a service was desirable and should be set up, we had to consider the subsidiary problems which arose, and the solutions which we devised for these problems are set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are children's allowances schemes of one kind or another operating in many countries.  Some of them are contributory schemes; there are some confined to limited classes of population; in a few cases they are of the kind proposed here&mdash;that is to say, a State service, the entire costs of which are out of State funds.  We considered the possibility of a contributory scheme and a scheme that would be partly contributory and partly non-contributory, such as the widows' and orphans' scheme.  We decided in favour of a non-contributory scheme.  A contributory scheme is one to which people must contribute and there is no practical means by which you can secure contributions regularly from persons other than those who are employed for wages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> As the House probably knows, almost 50 per cent. of our occupied population are not employed for wages; they work on their own as farmers, fishermen, blacksmiths, independent tradesmen, or in some other such capacity. It would be impracticable to devise any method of securing from such persons regular contributions to a service of this kind because, of course, the risk of a large family is not one which the average individual feels inclined to insure himself against, particularly after he passes a certain age and still remains unmarried.  If we had a contributory scheme we would have to secure contributions from every individual, even from those who would never be likely to benefit under the Bill.  On a non-contributory basis we have made the scheme applicable to every family, irrespective of whether the head of the family is a wage earner, an employer or an independent worker of any kind.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for a means test.  It does not follow, of course, that everybody in the community will benefit equally from the enactment of the scheme.  As I informed the Dáil, it is the intention of the Government to modify the allowance permitted under the income-tax code in respect of children of the class covered by this Bill, so that those who come within the income-tax paying class will not, in fact, benefit.  It is not practicable to adjust the income-tax so as to recover the amount which will be paid in benefit in respect of children, no more than and no less than that amount; but, in so far as it can be done, the aim is to secure that these persons within the income-tax paying class will not benefit; they will lose an amount corresponding to the allowance payable under this Bill.</P>
    <P>We decided against a means test for a number of reasons.  I think it is desirable that we should avoid any possibility of making the payment of children's allowances to a family a badge of poverty.  Apart from that, however, there is a practical reason why a means test should be avoided, if at all possible.  It involves, as experience of other legislation teaches us, an inquisition <Col N="394" /> into the income of families which claim to be qualified for the receipt of benefit.</P>
    <P>Under the Old Age Pensions Act or the non-contributory widow's pension scheme, that inquisition is of a limited kind, but if we tried to apply a means test to this scheme we would necessarily have to take into account not merely income from a farm or other property, such as farm animals and the various things that are taken into account under the Old Age Pensions Act, but also income from earnings, and the practical difficulty of securing a precise calculation of income from earnings in respect of a future or past period will be obvious.  The organisation of such an inquiry into the means of a family would involve a vast administrative machine which would be costly to operate.  It is true to say that, taking into account the adjustment in the income-tax code which we contemplate, the additional amount which will have to be paid out in benefit by reason of the adoption of this scheme without a means test would not exceed, except perhaps by a very slight amount, the additional administrative costs that would be necessary if we decided to operate the scheme with the means test applying to it.</P>
    <P>The allowances that will be payable under this Bill will be paid in addition to allowances payable under other social services.  An unemployment assistance applicant, with children, gets a children's allowance at the present time. A widow with children, under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme gets allowances in respect of these children. These allowances will be paid in addition to other allowances.  Some people have objected to that as piecemeal legislation.  I considered the practicability and advisability of combining all the children's allowances, paid under the various social services, in one comprehensive scheme, and I found that the advantages that would be obtained would be slight, while the administrative problems that were involved would be in no way minimised. In fact, the examination which I gave to the matter seemed to indicate that the simplest procedure, one which <Col N="395" /> would involve the least difficulty for individuals applying under any of these schemes and the least amount of administrative reorganisation, as well as the least cost, was to proceed as we are proposing to do here, and to make these allowances payable, supplementary to all other allowances or all other forms of income.</P>
    <P>The rate proposed here is 2/6 per week, payable in respect of each child, under 16 years of age, in excess of two. In various other countries where they have a children's allowances scheme, the practice is to pay the allowances in respect of children in excess of two. In some countries they pay allowances in respect of all children in excess of one, and in a large number of cases they pay them only in respect of children in excess of three.  As, however, the aim of the Bill was to provide an addition to the income of large families, and as the average family in this State consists of a father, mother, and two children, we decided that the allowances should be paid in respect of children in excess of two.  It will be appreciated that the aim of the Government was to make the best use of the total sum of money which is being made available for this service. We could, of course, pay a smaller sum per child to a larger number of children, or a larger sum per child to a smaller number of children; but it was considered that the best method of securing the aim we had in mind, within a limit of £2,250,000, was to make a payment of 2/6 per week in respect of all children, in excess of two, under 16 years of age.  The increase in the cost of the scheme, if the payments were to be made in respect of children in excess of one, would be another £1,250,000, bringing the total cost up to £3,500,000; whereas, if we were to pay the allowance in respect of all children under 16 years of age, the total cost would be £5,250,000.  It will be appreciated that there are very substantial jumps in the cost of the scheme, according as the number of children brought under it is increased, and, of course, in every family where there are children there is the first child, in a large number of families there will be a <Col N="396" /> second child, and in only a small number of families will there be a third child.  So that, the extension to cover children in excess of one, or to cover all children, would add very considerably to the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that payment will be made by means of vouchers which will be given to the head of the family, once in every six months.  We had a discussion in the Dáil as to whether the allowances should be paid to the father or the mother.  It was contended by some Deputies that the allowances should be paid to the mother.  I think myself that the would be an undesirable principle to establish.  We are proposing here to make an addition to the family income. That is the primary purpose of the Bill, and the obvious person to whom to give the allowances is the provider of the family income who, in most cases, is the male parent.  We do, however, arrange in the Bill for the possibility of the male parent nominating the mother as the recipient of the allowances, and there are necessary provisions to deal with cases where the father or the mother might be mentally or otherwise unsuitable for the receipt of the allowance.  Normally the intention is to make the allowance payable to the male parent, if living, and to make it in the form of a book of vouchers representing the payments to which he is entitled over a period of six months.  That involves that the circumstances of each family will be reviewed once in every six months. The intention is that once in every six months the number of qualified children in the family will be ascertained and, on the basis of that determination, the allowances will be paid for a six-monthly period, irrespective of changes which will take place in the family. If a child died in the meantime, or had passed over the age of 16, or had gone to live with some other household, the allowances would still be paid upon the basis determined on the appropriate date.  Similarly, if a new child should be born into the family, or if there should be an addition in some other way to the number of children in the household, the benefit of the increased allowance would not accrue to that household until the next date after <Col N="397" /> the circumstances of the family are ascertained.</P>
    <P>That simplifies the problem of verifying the amount which each household is entitled to receive.  It might be possible to arrange for an immediate variation of the amount payable according as changes in the number of children occur in a household, but the machinery of investigation, and the arrangements for payment which would be necessitated by such a decision, would be very elaborate indeed. Under this system, while admitting the possibility that some people would be getting more for a period than they were entitled to, whereas others might be getting less than they were entitled to during that period, we can nevertheless make payments on a definite basis by a simple administrative arrangement, and we can secure that the family can continue to draw the allowances irrespective of alterations in their circumstances, and without recourse to the administrative machine, during the payment period.  The book of vouchers will be dispatched to the head of the household.  Each voucher will be for the weekly amount, and the persons concerned can draw the money by cashing these vouchers at the money order post offices.  They can, if they wish, allow these vouchers to accumulate for a period not exceeding three months, and can cash them all together.  Halfway through the book there will be a form which the head of the household will have to fill in, in order to receive his allowance, if he is entitled to receive it, during the following six-monthly period.</P>
    <P>So far as the text of the Bill is concerned, may I say that these arrangements do not appear.  The Bill sets out the general scheme to be operated, and leaves to be fixed by regulation these various matters, such as the method of payment, the form of the voucher, the means of checking the accuracy of claims, and so forth.  It will be obvious that in bringing into operation any scheme of this kind it is necessary to have considerable elasticity. We could not now frame a whole series of regulations for covering all these matters and put them in the Bill, hoping that experience would not show <Col N="398" /> that some of them would have to be modified.</P>
    <P>If we had them in the Bill, modification of the regulations would require amending legislation&mdash;a slow procedure which would delay bringing the Bill into operation.  We have, therefore, provided for the making of regulations to cover the details of the scheme and there is in the Bill, as Senators will notice, a general section similar to sections which have appeared in all corresponding measures which gives the Minister in charge of the Bill power, within a period of 12 months after the passing of the Bill, to make regulations modifying it in so far as such modification is necessary to bring it into operation.  The most difficult period in the operation of a scheme of this kind is the beginning.  Once you have got it established it more or less runs itself.  The commencement is the period of possible break-down, and in so far as it is a service of which we have no previous experience, it is not possible to forecast with any accuracy what the problems are likely to be.</P>
    <P>One other matter I should perhaps refer to.  The Bill, as Senators will have noted, provides for the division of the country into regions.  There is no idea behind that regional administration other than simplification of the administrative problem.  I have mentioned that we contemplate a bi-annual review of family circumstances and the issue of payment vouchers to qualified families.  Clearly if we had the same qualifying date for the whole country, a vast amount of administrative work would arise to be done within a very short period and then, during the rest of the period, a very small amount of administrative work would become necessary.  That would make impossible the employment of permanent staffs.  You would have only a small nucleus of permanent staff and a large number of temporary staff employed to do the temporary work.  That would not be a satisfactory arrangement.  We have endeavoured to get out of that difficulty by dividing the country into three regions with the intention of having a different qualifying date for each region, so that one-third of the work will arise from each region at a different period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The division of the country into regions will not affect in any way, except in very unusual cases, the amounts which persons will receive.  We intend to have the same commencement date for the scheme for the whole country. Because of the division of the country into regions, we have to provide in the Bill for the possibility of people changing from one region to another. There may be individual cases, because of people moving from one region to another, where such people will get either a higher rate for a longer period or a lower rate for a shorter period, than they would receive if they had remained in the one region during the whole period; but that problem will only arise in the early stages of the operation of the measure.  Once the scheme is in operation, payment will be made on the basis of their entitlement during every recurring period of six months.  I do not know that there are any other matters which it would be necessary for me to mention at this stage.  I recommend the Bill to the Seanad, and I feel sure that the Seanad, like the Dáil, will welcome the principle of it.  Senators may have some suggestions to make as to its administration, but I would ask them, in making these suggestions, to bear in mind that the total expenditure which the Government contemplates on this measure is the £2,250,000 which I have already mentioned.  While it might be too much to hope for suggestions that would reduce the cost, any suggestions made should aim in that direction rather than in the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two principles in this measure which I welcome wholeheartedly.  One is the non-contributory basis of the scheme, and the other is the universality of the payments.  Certain problems, when faced up to, tend to lead inevitably along revolutionary paths, and when the Minister made up his mind to tackle this question of family allowances, he had also to decide what path he was going to travel in the payment of these allowances and in the administration of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two paths open to him, each of them in its way revolutionary. <Col N="400" /> One was to make the scheme a contributory scheme and to institute a means test, and the other was to make it non-contributory and to have universal payments on a uniform basis.  One would have led to such confusion in administration and such irritation arising out of administration that we would have got one type of revolution.  The smoother path which the Minister has chosen to travel&mdash;a non-contributory scheme and universal payments&mdash;will lead inevitably also to a revolutionary position but a revolutionary position which, I hope, will be a happy one. Because of that I think the Minister has dealt unfairly and unfortunately with the subject generally.  He indicated here that it was a pity that all the implications of this measure could not be discussed now and the particular aspect that he had in mind was, apparently, the fact that the cost of this measure would have to be provided in some way and that, in his opinion, it could only be provided by taxation.  I think everybody will agree that there are more implications in this measure than that.  There is the implication that there is a definite problem to be dealt with.  In fact this is only part of a problem which, in itself, is only part of another problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, rather suggested that this was a small contribution towards the alleviation of the problem that inevitably arises in large families under the social system we have here, where wages are related to the basis of production or supply and demand.  He indicated that the main problem which requires to be dealt with was much bigger.  In fact, we all know from our touch with general conditions and from the impression we have gained of life in other countries, that the family allowances problem, even when adequately dealt with, is only one part of the general problem of providing against the situation in which people find themselves, for one reason or another, of being unable to support themselves, as a result of either youth or age, sickness or unemployment or any other disability. Naturally there are divergent opinions as to how these various matters should be dealt with, different opinions as to the urgency of them and different <Col N="401" /> opinions as to which of them should be tackled first.</P>
    <P>In all these matters, the only sure basis on which you can found a discussion are the figures obtained from statistics.  Therefore, I think it is very unfortunate that the Minister has failed to assist members of the Oireachtas and the public generally on the statistical aspect of the general problem with which we are dealing. Everybody is anxious to give this problem and kindred problems the fullest consideration.  In the information the Minister has given us, he has simply told us that there are 480,000 heads of families and that, of these, 217,000 are not employed.  That is, they are not employed for wages.  They are small farmers or private workers in their own business of one kind or another. That is the position that has led him to the principle of a non-contributory basis, at any rate at the present stage of the measure.  Beyond that he simply tells us that the Government has decided to expend £2,250,000; that if that amount were given in half-crowns, in respect of every child after the second, it would do the job, but that if the allowance were given in respect of all children, there could be only 1/- per child given; and that if, on the other hand, the half-crown were given to every child after the first, it would cost £3,500,000, and, if given to all children, £5,250,000.  Beyond that, we are told nothing of what the problem is.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, and members of the Oireachtas generally were aware, that an inter-departmental committee had examined this whole problem. The Minister has indicated that he turned down its report, that he did not accept the suggestions or recommendations of that committee and that the Government are simply dealing with £2,250,000 in this way.  It is inconceivable that, in examining the situation for the purpose of advising the Government, the inter-departmental committee did not accumulate a big amount of statistical information which is the only way in which the problem can be stated, and I think it very unfortunate that we here and the public generally should be deprived of that information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> I want to urge that, even though this measure goes through without the public and the members of the Oireachtas getting that information, it is a matter of the greatest possible urgency that the problem generally should be stated fully and completely in statistical form at the earliest possible moment, because the putting into operation of this Bill is only going to give an impetus to the expectation of people.  There is a very definite problem to be dealt with. People expect it to be dealt with. They realise the inadequacy of this measure, and I think I am suggesting what is right when I say that when the Minister decides to superimpose these allowances on the allowances given under other Acts, rather than to withdraw the allowances under other Acts and substitute these for them, he does so because he knows that if he substituted these payments for those granted under other Acts, he would expose the inadequacy of these allowances.</P>
    <P>The various aspects of these allowances which require to be examined, so that we may understand the background of these problems, are very many.  As a sample of one social fact, here are figures in respect of 21 families living in the City of Dublin which were examined with regard to the number in family and their earnings, what they were getting from charity and from public sources and what they were spending on food and other items, and on rent.  The average number in family was 6.6 and the average amount spent on food per person 7/7 per week.  There were 133 people concerned in the group of 21 houses and 7/7 was the average amount spent per person on food; but 86 or 64 per cent. of these people spent less than 7/7 on food.  Fifty-seven per cent. spent only 6/- per person and 34 per cent. only 5/- per person, whereas in some of the cases a sum of 12/9½ was spent on food.  A Departmental examination of the position in a certain number of households in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was carried out in 1937, when the cost of living was materially lower than it is <Col N="403" /> now, and the average spent on food was 9/2, so that there you have a wide range of people, some of whom spend only 3/3 per person, some 2/4 and some 12/9 per week on food.  That shows that there is a nutrition problem to be examined first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for this country were arrived at by a group of social workers visiting families and examining income and details of expenditure. There is a nourishment side; there is an income side; and there is the working out of a figure as to the normal amount we would expect to be necessary to maintain the average person and the average family in decent conditions.  It is not because you work this out and arrive at a figure that you are able to provide everybody with that; but it is due to a proper public approach to the situation that a position which can be examined statistically and every other way should be arrived at, so that we would have some central fact and so that we could have some kind of test by which we would challenge our consciences when we came across difficult cases of people living below the subsistence line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious situation here and there is a quickening of the public conscience about it.  There is a quickening of the public conscience at a time when we may not be in a position fully and completely to deal with it by the provision of employment for every person, but the situation can be dealt with by emergency measures of one kind or another. The only thing, however, that will keep our consciences satisfied, or will satisfy the minds of people in want, is that, in a systematic way, the situation is being examined and that Parliament and public representatives generally show that they have deep and quickening interest in the problem and that they are going to avoid no necessary co-operation or co-ordination that will help, by increased production or <Col N="404" /> increased co-ordination of services, to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>This will lead to a quickening of expectancy.  It will do so because of circumstances here, but also because of what is happening outside.  What is happening outside is making the ordinary person in the street, the ordinary person in difficulties, ask why can we not be as energetic about our problems as other people are about theirs?  The determination on the part of our people generally to face up to these problems is no new one.  Next week, we shall be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the declaration by the First Dáil of the democratic programme, on 21st January, 1919, and I take the liberty of repeating here some of the things then set down in that declaration, and relating them to some things that are happening in the world to-day.  In paragraph 2, it said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We declare that we desire our country to be ruled in accordance with the principles of liberty, equality and justice for all, which alone can secure permanence of government in the willing adhesion of the people.</P>
    <P>3.  In return for willing service, we in the name of the Republic, declare the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour.</P>
    <P>4.  It shall be the first duty of the Government to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on: &ldquo;... safeguard the health and the physical as well as the moral well-being&rdquo;, and concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall also devolve upon the National Government to seek co-operation of the Governments of other countries in determining a standard of social and industrial legislation with a view to a general and lasting improvement in the conditions <Col N="405" /> under which the working classes live and labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was 25 years ago.  Yesterday in Congress, the President of the United States referred to their hopes for the future&mdash;I quote from the Press this morning:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Referring to the post-war period, President Roosevelt said they had accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights, under which new bases of security and prosperity could be established for all.  Amongst these were:</P>
    <P>The right to a useful and remunerative job; the right to earn enough to provide adequate food, clothing and education; the right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which would give him and his family a decent living; the right of every businessman to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition; the right of every family to a decent home; the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; the right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment; and the right to a good education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is on the other side of the Atlantic.  The developments that have taken place in Great Britain are leading, so far as broad general discussion indicates, to proposals that there should be a national minimum payment for everybody, raised out of income-tax, so that everybody who is unable to maintain himself or herself as a result of youth or age or sickness would be given a minimum standard of subsistence.  That is the kind of world we are moving into, and these plans and declarations from people responsibly placed, like the President of the United States, show that out of the faith and courage they have engendered by their work, they have been able to evoke these ideals in the midst of warlike activities and to hold out hopes to their people for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The spirit of these hopes will inevitably flame up in our young people.  They will look back at the <Col N="406" /> ideals on which the State was founded, and will ask what became of our democratic programme.  They will not delay too much to find out the reasons why we have not advanced very far, but they will be very insistent that, in so far as we are public representatives taking an interest in the public life of our people and the development of our economic well-being, we are quick and active and intelligent in sizing up our problems generally, and demonstrating that we are trying to deal with them.</P>
    <P>On the proposal the Minister has in front of us, I do not suppose that anybody will be able to argue with him that £2,250,000 should be increased, because, in fact, we have not the basis upon which we can make our arguments. There are just one or two suggestions I would like the Minister to consider.  It has been emphasised that very often the earlier children are the more costly children.  It has also been argued that when the children come to 16, under our conditions they do not always get employment.  A very large number of young people in the City of Dublin, and the country generally, are not able to get employment, so that both on the beginning side of the family and at the end there are important needs for which the Minister does not provide.  I would like to make one suggestion so far as the beginning side of the family is concerned. I can see reasons why, with the limited amount of money, the allowances for children are to be paid after the second child, but I think that if that £2,250,000 were raised to £2,500,000, the extra £250,000 could be paid out in marriage bonuses.  This would provide a bonus of a very useful and constructive kind on one hand, and it could be said to meet, to some extent at any rate, the objections of people who say that the early years of married life are very often the most costly.</P>
    <P>The average number of marriages in the country is about 15,000, and a bonus of £20 per marriage, universally applied, would cost £250,000 or £300,000.  I think, in this first approach to dealing with the problem, that a marriage bonus of £20 paid universally would improve the Bill at one side.  At <Col N="407" /> the other side, I would like to be able to propose an amendment that when there were five children under 16 years of age, the allowance should be paid for four children, and not for three as the Bill provides, and that when the family consisted of seven children under 16 years of age, the allowance should be paid for all.</P>
    <P>We do not know, and perhaps the Minister could not say, readily, how much it would add to the cost of the measure if the allowance was paid after the first child where the family ran to five under 16 years of age, and for all children where the family ran to seven, but an addition to the terms of the Bill along these lines would do something to mitigate the very severe hardship that falls on large families when the children grow up, because if the first child is an expensive child in a certain way, and the other children reach the age of 15, 16, 17 and 18, very often without getting employment, they are a very heavy drain on the resources of the family.</P>
    <P>I do not know what plan the Minister is preparing to deal with the income-tax question, but while the proposals are in their present form and on the present scale, I would suggest it should be sufficient that when a person was making an income-tax return to give a certificate to the effect that no allowances were being claimed or received under this Act, in order to get the full allowances that are made at the present moment to people with children who are paying income-tax.</P>
    <P>These are the remarks I would like to make to the Minister, but as I say the Bill deals only with one aspect of a problem that is a big one.  It deals with it in a way which opens up a revolutionary approach to social <Col N="408" /> services.  You cannot stop here, and it is absolutely urgent and essential that nothing that can be done from State resources should be left undone to set out the problem clearly and fully in statistical terms, so that public opinion may be guided, and the public will exercised to face the problem, because we cannot deal with this matter fully and completely without more effectively organising the productive power of the country.  At the present moment, so far as we can see from statistics, the productive power is going down under emergency circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think, with production in its present position, that the whole cost of this measure could be raised out of taxation, but that is a matter for another day.  We do really want to know what the size of the problem is. It is only in that way that we will get complete harmony and understanding, and that the national mind can be brought to agree on the most effective way of dealing with it.  That applies not only to persons engaged in public life but to every person in the country, because every person in the country is interested in this and is prepared to take an intelligent interest in it.  But it is only the information that is at the Government's disposal, or that can be gathered and assembled by the Government, that will enlighten our people.  I press on the Minister to see that that work is approached in a most earnest and urgent way.</P>
