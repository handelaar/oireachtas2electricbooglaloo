    <Title>Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Bill, 1944 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh):</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not part of the ordinary procedure of the Oireachtas in relation to financial matters.  It is necessitated by the occurrence of a general election during the period in which financial matters were being discussed in Dáil Éireann.  The House is aware of the circumstances and probably I need not go into any lengthy explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four of the Resolutions passed by the Dáil in Committee on Finance on the 3rd May last were given statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act as from the 6th April last, i.e., as from <Col N="1421" /> the commencement of the current income-tax year.  That Act, however, provides that Financial Resolutions to which statutory effect is thus given shall cease to have statutory effect on a dissolution of the Dáil.  A gap, therefore, came into existence which if not bridged would result in a position of confusion and uncertainly, affecting not only the revenue, but also thousands of persons throughout the country, e.g., in relation to deduction of income-tax from payments of ground rent, mortgage interest, dividends, etc. The Bill is designed to put an end to any such uncertainty and to restore the position to what it would have been if the Budget Resolutions in question had continued to have the force of law up to the date of the passing of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the Bill gives to the Resolutions a purely temporary life.  All the Resolutions with which the Bill deals were introduced afresh in the Dáil prior to the introduction of the Finance Bill, which contains clauses to the same effect as the Resolutions.  As the Finance Bill, however, could not become law for some time it was essential that the state of uncertainly to which I have referred should not prevail in the meantime&mdash;hence the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, has accurately described the circumstances in which this Bill becomes necessary.  It arises because at a certain stage of financial business in the other House, a general election was declared, and whatever we think about the taxes that are being imposed, I take it that we are all in agreement that they must be collected when they have been properly imposed.  Therefore, I think we should pass not only the Second Stage of this Bill but all stages of it now.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to,</P>
      <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages now.</P>
      <P>Bill passed through Committee without recommendation, and reported.</P>

      <Col N="1422" /> Question: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House decides to proceed with this Bill, I should like to make a statement which might be regarded as something in the nature of a personal statement.  Since this Bill was introduced, statements have appeared in the Press&mdash;I think that one was issued by the Bureau of Information&mdash;to the effect that the Government proposes to legislate in this matter, and to embody the principle of appeal in such legislation. That being so, I do not feel that any purpose will be served by proceeding with this Bill now, and having a debate, which might be a very lengthy debate, on the subject.  Therefore, with the permission of the House, I ask leave to withdraw the Bill pending the introduction of the proposed legislation. I may bring it in again if I see fit, when I see the form which the Government legislation will take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely in favour of the motion that leave be given to withdraw the Bill but, as a member of the Seanad, without regard to my views on censorship or any other matter, I dislike anything which would prevent a Minister from making a statement if the Seanad desires him to make it.  I am not saying that the Seanad does want the Minister to make such a statement, but I think that Senator Foran was perfectly entitled to ask the question which he has asked.  It seems to me, with all possible respect to you, A Chathaoirligh, that, if the Minister is willing to make a statement, it need not necessarily lead to a debate.  I think that we are perfectly entitled to have a statement from the Minister to the effect that he proposes to bring in legislation of a particular character.  I do not think that any such statement would necessarily lead to a debate, which is, perhaps, what some Senators fear.  I think that talk about the Bill being withdrawn conditionally or unconditionally has no meaning.  The Bill is withdrawn&mdash;full stop.</P>

      <P>I do not want to seem to be difficult in this matter.  I happen to be in opposition to the Minister but I am speaking as a member of this House and I submit that, for the general purposes of this House, we should not impose restrictions on ourselves.  If the Minister chooses to give us information at this particular moment, I do not think that we ought to be the channel through which objection would be lodged to his giving us that information.  I am speaking without regard to my views on the Minister's proposals.  I may be entirely against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Senator Hayes is overlooking the fact that this is not simply a request to the Minister to make a statement. It is a request to the Minister to make a statement following on the statement made by Senator Sir John Keane that he understands the Bill is to embody such and such.  I submit, Sir, that your ruling should be maintained and that it would be an act of disorder on the part of the Minister to make such a statement.  To press him to be guilty of an act of disorder is not to be entertained.</P>

      <P>I should hate to have the Minister for Justice disorderly, but nobody intends to offend against your ruling.  What I submit, with the greatest possible respect, is that no rule should be made which would restrict our right to hear statements from Ministers.  The statement to be made now has nothing whatever to do with Senator Sir John Keane's frame of mind when he withdrew the Bill.  He withdrew the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I expected that the Second Reading of this Bill would be moved to-day.  When the Bill was introduced, I appreciated that I should have to come here and give my views on it.  As a matter of courtesy, I informed the Censorship Board that I intended to oppose the Bill and that, when I got an opportunity, I intended to bring in an amending Bill.  The position, so far as I have seen it since I became Minister for Justice, has been most unsatisfactory. I do not think that it is right that the Minister should be the person who bans a publication.  That is my personal view.  I have always banned books with reluctance, for the simple reason that I felt that I should have read any book that I banned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
