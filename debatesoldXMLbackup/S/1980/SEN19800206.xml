      <P>I have considered a request from Senator Mary Robinson to raise, on the motion for the Adjournment this evening, the following matter:</P>
      <P>The amendment of the Members' contributory pension scheme to provide equality of treatment for male and female Members in the provision of benefits to dependants, following the Labour Court determination of 7 May 1979.</P>
      <P>I rule that this matter is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that it would involve amending legislation.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in that order.  It is proposed, in the event of No. 3 not being concluded by 5.30, that the debate on that Bill be adjourned at that stage and that we proceed to No. 4.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, since both Houses of the Oireachtas have been in recess there have been a great many dramatic developments outside this country which have a great deal to do with Ireland.  I consider that the circumstances in which this country finds itself <i>vis-a-vis</i> foreign policy at present are very special. Therefore, I would ask that item No. 21, which is a motion in the names of myself and Senator Murphy calling on the Government to make a clear statement <Col N="958" /> of Ireland's foreign policy in the light of recent events in Iran and Afghanistan be added to the Order of Business, not be substituted, because there are such special circumstances occasioned by the fact that neither House has been sitting for some time that we seem to have some doubts about our foreign policy.  I would ask the Leader of the House if it were possible, despite the absence abroad of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to have a statement on Irish foreign policy, and that this motion be added to the Order of Business even if it means sitting tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Hussey very strongly. However we differ on the present nature of the international crisis and how it may be alleviated, there can be no doubting its gravity.  The other House is not convening until the 20 February which happens to be the day of President Carter's ultimatum.  On that occasion I take it that House will be far too busy discussing the budget and economic policy.  As Senator Hussey has said, the Government's response to the grave events that are happening in the world is less than clear.  Today's session of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the substance of the matter.  I am simply giving additional reasons why Senator Hussey's motion should be carefully considered.  Today's session of the Seanad is a most opportune occasion for airing the views of this body and eliciting a Government response.  I would suggest that Senator Hussey's proposal is given greater urgency by yesterday's meeting of the nine Foreign Ministers, which ended inconclusively and at which it seemed that Ireland was under some pressure as a result of its non-NATO membership.  Yesterday's meeting, the Franco-German Summit, which was clearly at attempt to put pressure on the minor partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude, I would suggest that, in view of the threat to our own precarious military neutrality, the shreds of our independent foreign policy, this is a matter of great urgency.  In fact there is a Minister at hand to deal with the matter who was in Brussels yesterday, Minister of State, Deputy Raphael Burke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the request for an early debate on this subject.  I do not necessarily press for that debate to be held today, but I do think it should be held very quickly indeed. The matter is obviously serious.  I do not wish to rush into a rebuke by the Chair, so I will not develop any view on the matter.  But it does seem to be a matter on which, if we are going to have a pertinent debate, it should be held at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support the request by Senators Hussey and Murphy to have this motion taken at the first opportunity.  I appreciate, as I am sure everybody on this side of the House does, the fact that there is a Fine Gael motion listed to be taken this afternoon and that there is an arrangement to try to have one motion taken each month that the House is sitting, and indeed that the present Leader of the House has taken steps to ensure that this practice is adhered to.  While appreciating that this should also allow for the possibility of motions to be taken apart from the monthly motion, when the matter is of urgency, when, as has been pointed out, the other House is not sitting and when it is in the interests of the Irish people that there be a clear Government statement on our foreign policy.  Therefore, I would like to support this.  I certainly would be prepared to see the House sitting tomorrow, or indeed next week, in order to have this motion considered.  I would ask the Leader of the House to make an exception so that an opportunity could be provided to <Col N="960" /> Members of this House to comment on the extremely serious and rapidly changing situation in the world, particularly arising from the events in Iran and Afghanistan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those who have asked to have the motion added to the Order Paper.  One aspect that strikes me as being significant with regard to the ordering of the business of the Seanad down through the years is that the Seanad has very rarely discussed foreign policy.  It seems to me that a Chamber like this is peculiarly well adapted for doing it.  Indeed, a motion like this, which is really the result of a very urgent international situation, is one which could easily be added to the Order Paper.  In a sense it would be useful to the Government in general and to the people in general to have an airing of views on this subject, because there is an intense interest in the media and in the country at large in relation to it.  There is much diversity of views here which could be usefully and fruitfully aired.  Therefore, I would like to support that plea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by those who seek this debate on Motion No. 21 in the names of Senators Hussey and Murphy.  A great deal has happened in the area of international politics since we last sat.  I take the view that there is a need for solidarity in the free world on an issue such as this.  Our country, small as it is, should have a view to express.  Recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in which he really opted out to the extent of suggesting that it would be an initiative on the part of the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than of this country individually.  There is certainly the need for a debate.  Clearly there is disquiet around the country on this issue. Let me say finally that while I support the views expressed, it is possibly unrealistic to expect a debate this week <Col N="961" /> because there is an order which had been previously agreed so that if we had a debate on this issue this week it might be of a very confined nature.  Therefore, would you consider an arrangement under which Seanad Éireann would meet next week and have as its principal item on the agenda, this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said regarding the point raised by Senator Hussey but I should like also to ask the Leader of the House when it would be possible to make time for items Nos. 6 and 7 on the Order Paper.  Successive Governments have given an undertaking to afford the House reasonably adequate opportunities for discussing developments in the Community. This year in particular when there is a big problem <i>vis-a-vis</i> the budget of the Communities and the implications it is having on various aspects of life and the economy in this country, I would ask that the House be given the opportunity to discuss items Nos. 6 and 7 as early as possible.  It is a shame that these two items should be on together. We were told in 1973 that we would have an opportunity twice yearly, every six months, for a discussion on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Nos. 6 and 7, they will certainly be taken together and we will try to arrange for them to be taken as soon as possible.  With regard to motion No. 21, it would be impossible to deal with it this week, partly because we have already agreed to take another motion and partly because the Minister concerned is abroad.  I appreciate the feeling of many Members of the House that this is a matter which could appropriately be discussed by the Seanad and I shall consider whether it may be possible to take it in the near future.</P>

      <P>That, in the period ending 31 December 1980, notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders and unless the Seanad shall otherwise order, if the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities lays before the Seanad a report containing a request for a debate thereon in the Seanad, one hour and a half shall be set aside for debate on a motion, That, the Seanad take note of such report, on the first day on which the Seanad shall sit after</P>
      <P>(a)  six clear days have elapsed since the report was laid before the Seanad, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment briefly and welcome this motion.  I <Col N="963" /> have chosen to comment briefly because I have recently been very critical of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of their powers.  It is worth noting that the renewal of this motion does significantly improve the possibility of the Seanad playing a useful role in the scrutiny and examination of European Community draft proposals.  This motion will renew for 1980 the amendment of the Standing Orders of the Seanad so that if the Joint Committee request in one of their reports on EEC legislation that there be a debate, and a motion to that effect is tabled, then after six clear days this is a mandatory provision that time be allocated to the Seanad for the debate of that motion.  We have had some important examples of that, where motions noting reports of the Joint Committee on Youth Employment in the European Community, on the European Monetary System, on the teaching of languages in the Community and other such motions.</P>
      <P>It is an example where there has been a willingness by the Seanad&mdash;I would like to pay tribute to the Leader of the House in this regard&mdash;to extend the possibility of giving an additional function to the Seanad not on an optional basis requiring that time be given if there is no Government business or if it is decided to allow for time in the way that time is allowed for Opposition Motions, but providing time on a mandatory basis so that when the House is sitting, an hour and a half must be allocated for a discussion of the motion and for consideration of the report of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is going to be of increasing importance as European Community proposals and policies impinge more and more on the economic and social life of citizens in this country.  We know that there are possible changes envisaged in the common agricultural policy, developments in the regional development fund and such areas, and it is most desirable and welcome that this House have a facility which operates in a mandatory way to debate and discuss the reports of the Joint Committee and the implications of those reports.  I welcome the <Col N="964" /> continuation of this facility and note it as one of the most constructive and greatest potential developments the House has seen in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Robinson said.  This is a very helpful way of harnessing the Seanad to make meaningful contributions to the analysis of EEC legislation.  I would point out&mdash;because it was raised earlier on the Order of Business&mdash;that this motion enables the House to examine in greater depth the reports of and developments in the European Community. The committee will be able to consider the facts and any contrary views expressed before a debate in this House.  The report, which will be available to the Seanad, will enable them to take a distinctively Irish view of particular issues.</P>
      <P>I would like to support this motion and note in public how important a move it is.  I was concerned about what seems to be a trend toward Government by the Supreme Court.  One of the things the Joint EEC Committee are capable of doing is that they can analyse the issues with the help of people who are other than lawyers.  I get great solace and encouragement from the fact that, when we are looking at some of these issues, around the table there are technologists, lawyers, architects, administrators, doctors of medicine, all bringing their particular expertise to bear on them.</P>

      <P>Is Bille tábhachtach é seo agus is céim eile é de pholasaí an Rialtais i leith cosaint do thomaltoirí.</P>
      <P>The measure now before the House is intended not only to bring up to date the law relating to the sale of goods but to extend its provisions also to the supply of services.  It also proposes certain significant changes in the law relating to hire purchase and it makes special provision for abuses such as demands for payments for unsolicited goods and for entries in directories.  Thus it represents a major change in the law relating to consumer protection in this country.</P>
      <P>In a number of respects it complements the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which was designed to ensure that the consumer would have protection from misleading advertising and misleading descriptions of goods and services. However, the present Bill is a more far-reaching measure than the Act of 1978.  Both these measures, however, had their genesis in the report &ldquo;Consumer Protection Law in America, Canada and Europe&rdquo; prepared for the National Prices Commission in 1972 by Professor M.H. Whincup of the University of Keele.  This report in turn provided the basis for the recommendations as to changes in consumer protection law made to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce by the National Consumer Advisory Council in December 1974.  Between them, the Consumer Information Act, 1978 and the present measure account for almost all the recommendations regarding changes in consumer protection law urged by the National Consumer Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>Before going on to deal with the provisions in the Bill, their purpose and their effects, I think I should endeavour to describe briefly, but I hope with reasonable accuracy, the principal features of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and the &ldquo;implied&rdquo; terms which are a feature of that Act and which are central to the revisions of the law in favour of the consumer now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the law stands at present, the <Col N="966" /> buyer of goods in a retail sale has certain &ldquo;implied&rdquo; rights by virtue of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.  These rights are &ldquo;implied&rdquo; in that they do not have to be specifically claimed by the buyer, either orally or in writing, whenever goods are bought.  These implied terms are described in the Act either as &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; or &ldquo;warranties&rdquo;.  Breach of a condition entitles the injured party to repudiate his obligations and at the same time claim damages.  Breach of &ldquo;warranty&rdquo; on the other hand entitles him only to claim damages for any loss incurred; the injured party has to fulfil his side of the contract.  The legal meaning of the term &ldquo;warranty&rdquo; in this context is different from its common use as a synonym for guarantee.</P>
    <P>The Sale of Goods Act is a carefully drafted codification of the law as it had developed by the end of the 19th century, and reflects the market philosophy of that time.  Thus it recognises the freedom of both parties&mdash;the buyer and the seller&mdash;to make whatever agreement they wished, and, as the Whincup Report pointed out, the Act was intended to regulate the relationship of buyers and sellers only where they failed to make express provision themselves for such regulation.  In short, the &ldquo;implied&rdquo; terms were intended to supplement, for the purpose of contractual arrangements, the agreement between the parties.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the philosophy of the time, the Act presumed a general equality of bargaining power as between buyer and seller.  Furthermore, the Act also provided under section 55 a means by which an economically stronger party may relieve himself of all liability for breach of contract.</P>
    <P>As is well recognised both inside this House and outside, the 19th century commerical pragmatism which permeates the 1893 Act is, for several reasons, inappropriate in modern circumstances. For example, one aspect of the 1893 Act which has led to an erosion of the buyer's position is the regular use by many suppliers of the provision in <Col N="967" /> section 55 of that Act whereby the seller can exclude his contractual liabilities to the buyer.  I am sure that every Member of this House has, at one time or another, experienced the device of the exclusion clause.  Its purpose and effects have been to trim or undermine entirely the implied rights of buyers.  I propose in this Bill to curtail the use of such devices.</P>
    <P>Another commonplace feature is the use of guarantees offered by manufacturers or traders, often in substitution for the legal rights which buyers would have had under the provisions of the 1893 Act.  I propose to ensure that the basic provisions of this Bill cannot be whittled away; traders may offer better terms, but they will not get away with anything less favourable to the consumer.</P>
    <P>From the background to and the need for the Bill I turn now to its general aims. These are:</P>
    <P>(1)  to bring up-to-date and improve the important provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 which set out the implied rights of buyers and conversely, the implied duties of sellers in a sale of goods;</P>
    <P>(2)  to remove certain anomalies in contract law which had operated adversely against the buyer, and allowed the seller to evade his proper responsibilities and to refuse to remedy faults;</P>
    <P>(3)  except in the case of title, to give to persons acquiring goods under hire purchase agreements the same legal rights&mdash;as to merchantable quality, fitness for purpose and others&mdash;now being made available to cash buyers; the logic of this approach is that hire-purchase is in substance&mdash;if not in form&mdash;a purchase;</P>
    <P>(4)  to extend to the buyer and the supplier of services, implied rights and duties somewhat analogous to those for goods;</P>
    <P>(5)  to improve the relief accorded by the law in the case of misrepresentation primarily by regulating the use of clauses excluding or restricting liability arising from misrepresentation; and</P>
    <P>(6)  to provide greater protection for persons who receive unsolicited goods, <Col N="968" /> through the post or otherwise, and to regulate the methods by which entries in certain directories are collected.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been structured so that associated provisions are grouped together to make it easier to identify those relating to specific areas namely: the amendment of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893; hire-purchase and services.</P>
    <P>Part 1 brings together the basic provisions necessary in all statutes and sometimes dispersed throughout the text. Part II deals with the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 and contracts for the sale of goods and sets out the changes regarded as necessary to bring the law up-to-date. Part III sets out, in a self-contained way, the hire purchase provisions.  All of these have been brought together in this part, even though some element of repetition of the text may appear to be involved.</P>
    <P>Contracts for the supply of services are dealt with in Part IV and the question of misrepresentation in Part V.  New provisions dealing with unsolicited goods and directory entries are dealt with in Part VI along with some remaining miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the Bill complements the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which is a criminal law measure of a generally preventive or regulatory kind, concerned to ensure that buyers are provided with reasonable and accurate information with which they can assess the options open to them when purchasing goods or services. Although there is a place for the general public in the task of enforcing the Consumer Information Act, such enforcement is primarily a matter for the Minister and for the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The present Bill, on the other hand, is essentially a civil law measure designed to strengthen the position of the consumer in contract law, and thus is mainly a measure to be operated by the general public.  There are, however, certain provisions which involve public authorities notably the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Sections 11 to 13 and 46 to 54 of the Bill contain these provisions.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I expressed the view that this <Col N="969" /> was a complex and technical legal measure.  Because of that, and in the interests of the fullest discussion on this Second Stage, I feel that it is necessary now to elaborate on the provisions in the Bill in a manner that, in another Bill, might be regarded as more appropriate to the Committee Stage.  In doing this I will concentrate mainly on Parts II&mdash; sale of goods&mdash;and Part V&mdash;mis-representation. Parts III and IV&mdash;dealing with hire purchase and services respectively&mdash;are also very important but the changes in the law on sale of goods proposed in Part II are being extended in Part III to hire purchase and in Part IV to services.  In that way Part II lays the groundwork and sets the style for Parts III and IV.</P>
    <P>In general, Part II is concerned with improving the buyer's lot under the Sale of Goods Act and in certain areas of contract law.  In the Sale of Goods Act the areas where change is necessary and is proposed are: sections 11 to 14, dealing with implied terms in contracts which are the heart of the matter; section 35, relating to acceptance of goods; section 53, relating to remedies for breach of contract; and section 55, relating to exclusion clauses.</P>
    <P>As Senators will have noted, the Bill has been so structured that the amendments to the Sale of Goods Act are set out in the appropriate sections of the Bill in the form of tables which contain not just the revisions but the particular sections complete with revisions.  This structure has the advantage that the revisions now being proposed in the Sale of Goods Act, can be seen in context.  In that way the danger of what is termed &ldquo;legislation by reference&rdquo; is avoided.  The fact that section 10 of the Bill deals with amendments to sections 11 to 14 of the 1893 Act does create some possibilities for confusion of reference, but as I mentioned in the other House the printers have, I think, succeeded in laying out the text in a way that reduces the possibility for such confusion.</P>
    <P>Beginning with section 11 of the 1893 Act and with the question of acceptance, it has been held that injustice can arise <Col N="970" /> for a buyer under section 11 subsection (1) (c) which provides that once the buyer has accepted specific goods, a breach of any condition which the seller should have fulfilled can only be treated as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for rejecting the goods.  This seems to mean that a buyer loses his rights to reject defective goods at the moment of purchase.  In accordance with the recommendations of the report of the NCAC, section 10 of the Bill proposes to change the basis for such an obvious injustice.</P>
    <P>It is also desirable to ensure that acceptance, as defined in section 35 of the 1893 Act, is subject to the buyer's right to examine goods already provided at section 34 of that Act.  Section 20 of the Bill contains the provision necessary to this end.  A further aspect in regard to unsatisfactory goods and contractual commitment is dealt with in section 21 of the Bill.  This amends section 53 of the 1893 Act in such a way that a purchaser who is a bona fide consumer will be able to reject faulty goods in circumstances where, under section 53 as it stands, he could only look for damages.</P>
    <P>On the very important question of implied terms several amendments to the 1893 Act have been necessary.  Section 12 of that Act, which deals with implied conditions and warranties as to title to goods is being amended to clarify the position in sales of limited title where a third party may have an interest.  The benefits of section 13 of the 1893 Act, which provides for the implied condition that goods being sold by description must correspond with the description, are being extended so as to apply to goods selected off the shelf in a shop.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the 1893 Act introduced in statute form the concepts of &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo; and &ldquo;fitness for purpose&rdquo; as implied conditions to protect the buyer, but the Act did not attempt to define &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo; and did not extend to those who might be acting as agents, rather than dealers in goods.  These weaknesses in the 1893 Act are being remedied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 22 adds several important <Col N="971" /> new provisions to section 55 of the 1893 Act which is the section regulating exclusion clauses.  The essence of the proposed new provisions is that the improved implied rights as set out in section 10 of the Bill cannot be, in any way, voided in the case of consumer sales by the use of exclusion clauses.  Complete prohibition of exclusion clauses will apply in the case of consumer sales, but in the case of sales between business people there is provision in section 22 for a test of reasonableness to be determined by the courts in respect of exclusion clauses. This, I think, strikes a fair balance between the need, on the one hand, to guard against exploitation of the small man by economically stronger and more resourceful groups and, on the other, the need to allow reasonable freedom to strong groups to bargain with each other on whatever terms they please.</P>
    <P>In making the various implied terms inescapable in contracts, it is also necessary to ensure that the provisions to that effect cannot be evaded in any other way and that, in particular, sellers cannot even claim or pretend to withhold them by notices or advertisements.  I am sure that most Senators are familiar with the practice of some shops which display notices saying &ldquo;goods not exchanged&rdquo; or &ldquo;no refunds&rdquo;.  Section 11 of the Bill makes it an offence to put up such notices in shops.  To make the provision in this section effective, it is proposed that breaches of it will be an offence. Section 14 of the Bill is intended to plug a loophole which at present sometimes leaves credit purchasers without any recourse where goods are faulty.  The seller has been paid in full by the finance house and the latter have no interest except to recover the amount lent to the purchaser.  Under this section the consumer will no longer be left in a vacuum between the two as both the seller and finance house will have joint and several liability.</P>
    <P>Another important new area covered is that of guarantees which in recent years have played a prominent part in selling and which are badly in need of rationalisation.  Any seller of goods now <Col N="972" /> giving a guarantee will have to provide for the matters set out in section 16 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the Whincup and NCAC Reports, special provision is being proposed in regard to the safety of motor vehicles.  Unlike other goods provided for consumers, faults in motor vehicles may affect persons other than the purchaser&mdash;if, for instance, they cause an accident.</P>
    <P>The need, therefore, for a high level of mechanical efficiency and road-worthiness in all motor vehicles sold for ordinary road use is vital.  In addition to the safety angle, there is the consideration that, unless the buyer has some protection under a guarantee, the remedying of defects in a car following purchase can be very expensive indeed for the buyer.</P>
    <P>The implied conditions and warranties provided in section 10 of the Bill as to merchantable quality, fitness for purpose and so on, will, of course, apply equally to sales of motor vehicles for ordinary road use.  Under section 13, however, there will be an extra implied condition in such contracts to the effect that the vehicle is free from dangerous defects.  If this does not prove to be the case, an aggrieved buyer will have an action against the seller for breach of contract.</P>
    <P>In addition to this civil measure, section 13 also imposes a requirement that a motor vehicle dealer must give a written certificate to the effect that the vehicle is free from dangerous defect.  The Minister will be empowered to specify the form of the certificate.  This requirement should present no great difficulties to and indeed should facilitate the business of, reputable car dealers.  It will, moreover, provide the buyer with much needed protection from the hazards he faces when tempted to buy from certain other kinds of car dealer.</P>
    <P>Another innovation provided for under section 13 (6) is the extension of the right of civil action against the seller, to any person using the car with the owner's consent.  There are those who might argue that this represents a serious <Col N="973" /> stretching of the concept of privity of contract but, whatever the theoretical considerations involved, a pragmatic approach is called for when dealing with a product which, if defective, can constitute a grave personal and public hazard.</P>
    <P>Senators will doubtless be aware that section 13 was the subject of extensive debate on all Stages of the Bill's passage through the Dáil.  While I am satisfied that the section as amended in the Dáil represents a fair degree of consensus as to how the section should be, I, nevertheless, appreciate the concern of the industry and have received many representations regarding the scope of the section.  I am, of course, anxious that the activities of any sector should not be jeopardised by this or any other provision of the Bill.  Accordingly, I am arranging for further consultation with the motor industry before Committee Stage on the scope of the section as a whole.  I shall be meeting the FIMI, together with some of my officials.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance, too, to car owners and buyers, as well, of course, as buyers of other so-called &ldquo;consumer durables&rdquo;, are the provisions in section 12, under which any undertakings given by a seller as to future supply of spare parts and availability of servicing&mdash;sometimes given lightly as a seller device&mdash;may now be given the status of a warranty and can, therefore, be actively pursued in the civil courts by an aggrieved purchaser.</P>
    <P>The new provisions contained in Part II in relation to the sale of goods are applied also, as appropriate, to hire purchase transactions in Part III of the Bill.  The reason is that hire purchase transactions, although not sales in the legal sense, are a means by which consumer goods are acquired by consumers who are just as much entitled to protection as direct purchasers.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Part IV extends the new provisions into the area of services where the consumer needs protection just as if he were buying goods.  Nowadays, however, there is no reasonable basis on <Col N="974" /> which suppliers of services should be exempt from implied terms as to the quality of the service.  Indeed, one could argue that the need for adequate protection for a consumer is all the greater in the case of a service, because in a sale of goods the buyer can at least see and examine a given product.  This is not generally the case with a service, however.  Where the latter is involved, a buyer may well be purchasing an expertise about which he may know very little unless he happens to have a degree of technical or specialist knowledge that the average person does not have.  The quality of services is more difficult to define than that of goods, but I think sections 37 and 38 go as far as possible in this regard.  These provisions apply to all suppliers of services in their contractual relationships.  In other words, the term &ldquo;services&rdquo; in this context extends to all those areas in which the consumer today spends much of his disposable income&mdash;leisure, holidays, personal requisites, house repairs and so forth.</P>
    <P>As to Part V of the Bill, common law contains many mysteries for the ordinary person in the area of misrepresentation. I shall not go into the details of this here except to confirm that the purposes of sections 40 to 43 of the Bill are, firstly, to provide for the rights of a buyer where he has been led into accepting a contract by misrepresentation even if it was negligent or innocent and, secondly, in the interests of equity to enable the courts to maintain a contract, instead of setting it aside, and award damages, keeping in mind the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused to the parties by upholding or setting aside the contract.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with various ancillary matters which could not readily be classified with the other parts.  The provisions about unsolicited goods and directory entries are very necessary.  My Department has been receiving a good many complaints over the last year or two about firms soliciting payments for entries in directories which do not seem to exist.  I will not go into the need for the <Col N="975" /> other provisions in this part as they speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it might be said that this Bill is about restoring people's rights in the market place, rights which, since the enactment of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, have correspondingly diminished, as the market place itself has expanded in form, scale, complexity and sophistication.  Its progress through the Dáil was marked by a spirit of genuine interest and co-operation on all sides and a number of amendments were made as a result of the discussions in that House. Even so, I recognise that there may be possibilities for further improvements and refinement as the discussion in this House proceeds.</P>
    <P>I regard the measure as one where there is considerable agreement on all sides as to its need, its scope and its general provisions.  Thus I look to our consideration of the Bill as a cooperative exercise designed to achieve the best possible text for what I have already described as a complex and technical measure in the legal sense.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an Seanad fáilte roimh an Bhille seo, agus go mbeidh toradh fiúntach ar an scrúdú a ndéanfaimid air.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister.  Unlike the debate that took place in the Dáil, there has not been any claim by any party to parentage of this Bill.  The history of this Bill goes back through more than one administration.  It is very important when discussing this Bill to take it as far away from the field of party political differences as possible because it is a Bill that all political parties subscribe to in the sense that we agree with and are anxious to ensure that our consumer protection legislation is improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, this Bill presents the Seanad with a great responsibility and opportunity to assert itself as a very useful Chamber in our legislative system. I regret to say that this Bill did not receive the consideration it should have received in the Dáil.  I hope that we in this House will be able to examine more <Col N="976" /> closely some of the provisions of this Bill which, in their overall apparent intent, are to be welcomed but have a kick-back or a sting which I submit might be very dangerous.  I say that, and I say particularly that it is non-politically partisan because some of these provisions were in the Bill that the Coalition Government introduced in 1977.  So, when we suggest to the Minister, as we will be suggesting to him, that this Bill should be referred to a select committee, he will, as we unfold our arguments as to why that should be done, appreciate why and he will also, I hope, appreciate the spirit in which I offer these few opening remarks.</P>
    <P>Apart from the parentage of the Bill so far as political parties are concerned, there is the history to it that the Minister has mentioned.  In 1972 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce referred the whole question of our consumer protection law to the National Prices Commission. This was followed by the Whincup appointment and a subsequent report and then the National Consumer Advisory Council report.  This report ultimately led to the legislation that we have before us today.  That is the Irish history of it.</P>
    <P>There is another history of it that comes from three English statutes, the Misrepresentation Act of 1967, the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act of 1973 and the Unfair Contract Terms Act of 1977.  The greater part of the Bill is comprised in these three English statutes.  There are some important differences. The supply of services aspect which is incorporated in our legislation does not appear in the English legislation. Similarly some portions of the English legislation go a good deal further than our own legislation proposes to do, particularly the Misrepresentation Act of 1967.  We will have some points to make on the part of this Bill that deals with misrepresentation when we come to Committee Stage, but I want to say at this stage that it is a pity that the whole question of misrepresentation was raised in this Bill at all.  It is a matter which certainly needs to be looked at and in respect of which our law needs to be <Col N="977" /> updated.  It would have been far better if it were the subject of an entirely separate Act.  There is going to be some confusion because of the way in which misrepresentation, so far as it relates to the sale of goods and supply of services and hire purchase agreements, is in one piece of legislation whilst the general law of misrepresentation, which properly belongs to contract law, will be thrown out amongst other pieces of legislation in our common law.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the Minister has said, reflects the change that has taken place in society since the first legislation in this area, the Sale of Goods Act of 1893, became law about one hundred years ago.  Before the Sale of Goods Act itself the golden rule was <i>caveat emptor</i>, let the buyer beware.  In other words, the parties could make up their own minds.  I do not believe that it was as free and easy as that.  But certainly developments that have occurred since then have created the necessity for active participation by the State in helping the consumer. This is made necessary by the sales techniques that we have today, from simple advertising to downright psychological gimmicks such as the layout of goods in a supermarket&mdash;there was an interesting television snippet on that recently&mdash;to things like subliminal advertising which we have all heard of.</P>
    <P>All those things are legitimate but there are other things that are quite illegal; sometimes, because the world is now such a small place, some countries can be the recipient of goods, for example from the United States, that have been rejected by their consumer protection people.  One famous example was the Ford Pinto car of which I am sure everybody at this stage has heard something.  When finally the consumer protection authorities in the United States rejected that, any cars that were there in stock were dumped in another country.  So the Americans managed to export their problem.</P>
    <P>We will obviously have to come to the stage where our international law is far more effective so far as consumer protection is concerned.  In that sense I know it is often said that we should not <Col N="978" /> copy English statutes for the sake of it and I agree with that.  But it is a good idea that in so far as it is practical and sensible it is a useful thing that our laws should approximate to their laws. Already in the EEC there is a trend in that direction and it is something that is generally to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a technically oriented Bill, a Bill that will require thorough examination on Committee Stage whether by Select Committee or a Committee of the House in the ordinary sense of the word. I sympathise very strongly with those Senators who have not the benefit of legal training and who are interested in this Bill because it is almost impossible to read it and understand it.  I must candidly admit, although having legal training, I found it extremely difficult to read and to understand and appreciate all the nuances of the Bill and its likely ramifications.  I was concerned as a lawyer not just with the position of the consumer, a position I would sympathise with, but also with what is to happen to our laws, our legal system, because this Bill does some very dramatic things.  It flies right in the face of fundamental legal doctrines that have existed not just since the passing of the Sale of Goods Acts, but for centuries, doctrines like that of privacy of contract, which is very fundamental to our original common law system and to our legal system, which now is being torn to shreds in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not object to that <i>per se.</i>  Indeed, many of our legal doctrines should be torn to shreds, but I wonder whether we appreciate the consequences of some of the provisions of this Bill as far as that is concerned.  With the ignorance of somebody who will make that submission when I come to deal with it, in one respect in this Bill we will breach that doctrine of privacy, but I will for the moment advocate an extension of this breach, but there are other areas where I think it will be reprehensible in the sense that it will make the job of business people almost impossible: I agree consumers must be protected, but we must look at the business efficacy of some of our proposals as well, and we have to bear in <Col N="979" /> mind this balance.  If I may say so on behalf of lawyers, it will cause great headaches for lawyers, and judges as well, because it will be so difficult to interpret the intention behind some sections in the Bill.  I want to say this, and I will be referring specifically to it later&mdash;I do not like saying it&mdash;anybody who read the Dáil debate carefully will agree some Deputies showed an abominable ignorance of what they were discussing. I say that without disrespect for them because they do not have the resources, any more than we do, to discuss many aspects of this Bill.  In one particular section I will be mentioning, the Minister who was then in the Dáil said something that on my reading of the Bill was complete and utter nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that I have ever once heard a discussion in this House about any Bill without reference being made to the Dáil debate, and I will fix that position strongly because I want to refer specifically to the Dáil debate in the interest of the legislation we are discussing, and the worth of it.  Whatever the convention of the House in the past, I can only speak for the past two-and-a-half years, and for that time, which is the period I have been here, there never has been a problem about this.  Therefore, I would ask the Chair's indulgence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is our first session since the Fine Gael policy document by Deputy Bruton was published in which he highlighted some of the deficiencies of the Dáil where Deputies do not have the resources and it is almost impossible for Members, even front bench Members, to have the resources to understand fully what Bills like this are all about.  It seems, because Bills are becoming technical and complex and because our society may be becoming so complex, that the people who now make legislation in this country are the civil servants, and there it stops because they have the <Col N="980" /> resources to look into it and our legislators do not.  This is a classical example of the necessity to give to Deputies and Senators the resources to enable them to understand what they are doing and to enable them to bring in and to pass legislation that is worthwhile and not legislation that is defective.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from that point, I should like to pay a special word of thanks to somebody who helped me in dealing with this Bill, and I have never met the man. He is G.M. Golding, a lecturer in business law at University College, Dublin.  He published a very excellent series of articles in <i>The Irish Law Times and The Solicitors' Journal.</i>  It was of marvellous benefit to me because I would have required six to eight months' notice of this debate to absorb what one would have to absorb by way of background law, by way of just what was in this legislation, by way of everything one would need just to consider the legal implications of it.</P>
    <P>Even now I know I am inadequate in what I want to say.  I am quite sure that many Members of this House will feel the same way about it.  Mr. G.M. Golding published ariticles that I will be relying on heavily.  He did a great day's work when he published those articles because he brought together all the areas of law we are concerned with here, that made the job of people like us in this House a lot easier when approaching the subject matter of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to voice a criticism.  Maybe there is a reason for it, but the Minister referred in his opening remarks to the way in which this Bill has been laid out, in Parts.  As far as that went that was a good idea, but why not repeal the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1893 altogether, and the Hire Purchase Acts&mdash;this Bill will affect the basic principles in those Acts&mdash;and bring in one solid codifying statute bringing everything together to make it easy for people to read?  In this day and age we should be encouraging consumers to get the statutes themselves and read them.  If the Acts were in one volume, with section following after section, people <Col N="981" /> would have some hope, but to have to refer back, as we must, to legislation of 1893 and Hire Purchase Acts here and there, and substitute for sections 12, 13 and 14 Table A in section 10 of the 1980 or 1981 Act, or whatever, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, makes it almost impossible not just for ordinary consumers but for lawyers.  It makes their lives very difficult, and even though it changes the law, and all we are about is to change the law, we should bear in mind the ease with which business people, consumers and legal practitioners should be able to consult this legislation in the future.</P>
    <P>So I regret that the opportunity was not taken, because this is a fairly broad Bill and it is affecting changes in all the items of legislation I have mentioned, here to put it all together.  This is a trend, it seems, of modern life and I think it is to be very much regretted.  I do not know whether it is because the Dáil and Seanad are inadequate that we allow this to happen, or is it because we do not have the resources to draft proper legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then we have been at cross-purposes.  To move on to the contents of this Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, the Minister in his opening remarks mentioned the terms that this legislation will imply in future contracts between sellers and purchasers, or hirers or consumers, or whoever these people may be.  The main implied terms under the 1893 Sale of Goods Act and subsequent Hire Purchase Acts related to title to sell the goods, the quality of the goods and the fitness for purpose of the goods. I shall not bore the House by reciting those.  There are some new implied terms proposed in this Bill.  I would like briefly to list the major ones.  I shall be reverting to some of them later on.  We should <Col N="983" /> clearly fix it in our minds what this Bill is all about.</P>
      <P>In relation to the difficult section 13, where a purchaser buys a car, there will be an implied condition of freedom from defect that might cause a danger or that would render the vehicle a danger to the public if that defect exists at the time of delivery.  This is a new implied term. Section 12 relates to spare parts or availability of spare parts.  There is a new implied term, an implied warranty, as to the availability of spare parts and service for a period in such circumstances as the seller indicated in the offer.  I want to make one point in relation to that section. It seems to me the section is quite clear.  If a company or a seller makes an offer to, say, Senator Murphy for the sale of a television to him and says &ldquo;We guarantee this set for two years, both as to service and to spare parts&rdquo;, the effect of this section will be to imply a term in the contract to that effect if when the offer was made to Senator Murphy that was part of the offer and there is no written contract, just a verbal contract.  If it was made in the offer, this Bill says that there will be in the agreement, or in the contract between the seller and Senator Murphy, an implied condition or warranty that spare parts and services will be available for the period mentioned. That is all it does.  In my view the section does nothing at all where there is no reference in the offer to spare parts or availability of service afterwards.  During the Dáil debates&mdash;Volume 316, No. 6, column 1039 of the Dáil Official Report&mdash;the question was put to the Minister whether, if there was no time limit mentioned, if there was no reference to a period of six months during which spare parts would be available what would be the position.  The reply was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the manufacturer specifies that spare parts will be available he will have to stand over that and have them available.  In the case where a manufacturer does not specify any period, that is his hard luck.  If he does not specify a period you may take it that there would be an unlimited supply <Col N="984" /> of spare parts.  The manufacturer will have to stand over that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked:</P>
    <P>If he indicates that spare parts will be available will he be obliged to provide the spare parts?</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn answered:</P>
    <P>No.  If the manufacturer does not mention the period for which the spare parts will be available; if he does not specify the time during which they will be available, two years, one year or six months, it can be taken that that means an unlimited period of time.  If he specifies that spare parts will be available for a two-year period then he must have them available for two years and the Minister must insist on this.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that that in any way reflects what is in the section of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister here to clarify that position because it has caused considerable disquiet.  As I understand it, it is only where, in the offer, a period is mentioned, where in the offer, the supplier says there will be spare parts available for this piece of equipment, service will be available for 12 months. Then there is implied in the purchase contract a warranty to that effect and, if it is breached, one can sue for damages. The Bill goes further in other respects, but more of that later.</P>
    <P>The Minister either misread or misunderstood the section.  I would ask for clarification on this.  It is an example of a technical area that could cause great problems in the future.  It is another reason why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee.</P>
    <P>The other large area in which there are new implied terms is that of supply of services.  This does not exist in any of the English statutes to which I have referred.  Therefore, it is novel here.  I agree with the Minister: there is a case to be made for this.  The supply of services is an integral part of the stuff on which a consumer loses, spends, wastes or whatever his money.  The terms that will be implied here now, in respect of a supplier <Col N="985" /> of services, are that the supplier has the necessary skills to supply the service; that he will supply the service with due skill, care and diligence and, where he uses materials, that the materials used will be sound and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty with the 1893 Act was that the implied terms applied only where the parties did not otherwise indicate.  As the Minister said, we had come to the stage where, when one bought a car, television, washing machine or whatever, one got a guarantee with it.  The effect of the guarantee was to reduce one's right enormously, to whittle them away.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is to have teeth the Administration decided rightly that one must ensure that these implied terms cannot always be overruled by one or other of the parties providing in the contract, what is called an exclusion clause. In this section there is no question of exclusion clauses.  It becomes technical difficult to follow because there are various categories of people involved apart from the buyer and the hirer.  For example there is this new being called a consumer, or a buyer or a hirer who deals as consumer.</P>
    <P>The buyer or hirer who deals as consumer is given certain rights.  The ordinary buyer or the ordinary hirer is given other rights.  For example, in relation to the implied term as to title to sell goods, any attempt to exclude that, whether you are dealing with a consumer or a buyer, will always be void.  Where a buyer deals as consumer any attempt to exclude the implied terms under sections 13, 14 or 15, which relate to quality and fitness and sale by description, sale by sample, will be completely and utterly void.  The same applies in relation to hire purchase contracts.  But in other instances, where the buyer or hirer does not deal as consumer, the exclusion clause will prevail only where it is seen to be reasonable and fair.  I cannot quibble with that so far as it goes.  I wonder whether in relation to other rights given to the consumer we should question the definition, because it is a fairly narrowly drawn one.  We should give great consideration&mdash;and <Col N="986" /> this is a Committee Stage matter&mdash;to the distinction we draw between the ordinary buyer and the consumer.  However, the Schedule to the Bill sets out the matters to which a court must have reference in considering whether an exclusion clause is fair or reasonable.  It seems reasonably comprehensive. We will give it more thought on Committee Stage.  Overall, the general approach in relation to exclusion clauses is not entirely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the buyer dealing as consumer.  The consumer is given certain very specific rights apart from the seller's inability to put in any form of exclusion clause even where that might be fair and reasonable when he is dealing with a consumer.  If a seller, for example, purports to limit a buyer's rights by advertisements in relation to most of the implied terms, the seller will commit a criminal offence. Most Senators will have seen this in the Bill.  This Bill creates a great number of criminal offences.  This is regrettable since basically it is legislation that is designed to help the consumer.</P>
    <P>I question the sense of doing that.  I wonder whether we should not keep our criminal law and our civil law separate so far as possible.  We should have one piece of legislation here instead of several pieces.  We should be trying to simplify our law, but by putting so much in together, we are doing the opposite.</P>
    <P>There is one specific aspect that is of very great importance to the new consumer and it relates to a situation where a buyer dealing as consumer purchases an item with a finance house financing the arrangement.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure that where a consumer buys goods and is financed by a finance house, that the finance house becomes just as responsible as is the seller of the goods.  I must get this right, because there is a difference between a hire purchase company and a finance house but in the instance of a sale, if I go in as a consumer and buy a television set and use a finance house to help me pay for the transaction, what actually happens is that the seller or the television salesman <Col N="987" /> sells his television to the finance company, gets his money from the finance company and the finance agreement provides for repayments by me to the finance house itself.  The difficulty has arisen in the past that where a television purchased in this way breaks down, the television man having got his money is not too concerned but the liability for the repayments still falls on the consumer. Consumers have become very annoyed over this in the past when they realised that they must continue to make repayments though they have no service at all from their television sets.</P>
    <P>I listened recently to a consumer programme on radio during which there was great concern expressed by finance houses as to their possible liability as a result of this legislation.  They feared that their rates would have to soar and that they would be put in jeopardy in certain instances.  I can understand their problem in some sense though I do not have great sympathy for them.  I say that without a knowledge of their problem but again this is another reason why this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee, so that people could be brought in and witnesses examined on this issue.</P>
    <P>I find myself in a position where I cannot make an independent judgment about what should be done.  I have seen many instances of people being caught in that terrible situation and where they must pay back £30 a month even though the motor bike, the television or the fridge is not working.  I wonder why the finance houses should not be regarded as people who are involved in a very lucrative market.  They are in the business of buying and selling money and are doing very well out of it, charging very high interest rates.  They are never introduced by the buyer but always by the seller.  They are an inducement to a sale.  If someone is walking down the street and sees something that costs £100 and if he does not have £100, that is the end of the matter.  However, if he sees that he can buy it at £2 a week or £2 a month over so many months, he <Col N="988" /> feels he can buy it.  The seller of the goods will say there is no problem.  The buyer has never met the finance company. He does not know who they are and is caught in the position of thinking that the service is being provided by the vendor of the goods.  One has to sympathise with his plight when he is caught like this.  My sympathy is with the consumer, with the buyer of goods in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I do not have here the information I would need to say whether it is just and proper that this provision should become law, and even if I had I am not in a position to cross-examine the finance houses and ascertain whether their side of the story would stand up to examination.  If we are going to consider making finance houses liable, why draw a distinction between buyers?  Section 3 of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>...a party to a contract is said to deal as consumer in relation to another party if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he neither makes the contract in the course of a business nor holds himself out as doing so, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the other party does make the contract in the course of a business, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the goods or services supplied under or in pursuance of the contract are of a type ordinarily supplied for private use or consumption.</P>
    <P>Basically, it is a private person who does a deal with a business person about goods that are supplied for private use or consumption.  If a housewife goes out to buy a washing machine for her house, she deals as consumer but if a taxi driver goes out to buy a car he does not deal as consumer.  If a child goes out to buy a saddle for his pony he deals as consumer but a jockey who goes out to buy a saddle for his racehorse does not deal as consumer though the same jockey who goes out to the same saddler and buys the same saddle with the intention of using it on his hunter rather than on his racehorse would be dealing as consumer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> If I went out and purchased goods to re-decorate my home, I would be dealing as consumer, but if I bought the same goods from the same supplier for use in my office, I would not be dealing as consumer. The definition is difficult to word. It is almost impossible to draw a distinction like that.  If I wished to decorate my office, I would not be in a position to say whether any materials I might purchase for this purpose would be likely to prove inferior.  I am not in that business but if I were in that business I would say that I am not a consumer because I am in that business.</P>
    <P>If a bookmaker in a betting shop wished to provide a television so that his clients could see races being run, he would be denied the benefit of being a consumer.  I do not see that this distinction is of any benefit.  Therefore, it is something that should be looked at again.  I say that particularly in relation to the finance house question.</P>
    <P>In relation to the implied terms and exclusion clauses, the difference is important but not as great.  Finance houses will not be liable, for example, to the young chap from the country who decides to start off as an agricultural contractor, goes out and buys a piece of equipment and is financed by a finance house.  If the finance house happen to give the money to a very disreputable dealer, there is no responsibility on the finance house to make sure that the person they give their money to will provide a service afterwards.  That new agricultural contractor will not be dealing as a consumer.  He will have no rights whatever against the finance house.  That is a genuine difficulty for that person.  If it is right to bring the finance house in as a party liable to a consumer, that very same argument must stand to the buyer who is not a business person in the type of goods you are dealing with.  If this legislation is to be sensible in respect of the finance house proposal, it should be changed and I would ask that it would be changed.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being discussed in the Dáil, Deputies were throwing out such questions as whether combine harvesters would be covered.  I cannot imagine <Col N="990" /> how a combine harvester could be considered in the sense of being domestic but the Minister denies this.  He did not say that it will not cover combine harvesters. What is the position regarding combine harvesters?  The implication in the Dáil debates is that the Minister found no objection to combine harvesters being included.  Brendan Grace's song about a combine harvester might lead one to see harvesters in some sort of romantic role and to that extent being domestic, but I cannot see them being described as &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to mention a major flaw in this Bill to which many people, particularly Mr. Golding, referred, that is, that the leasing of goods does not appear to be covered by the Bill.  Sale of goods and hire purchase agreements in relation to goods are covered, but the leasing of goods, which has become a very popular and very widespread operation here, does not in any way seem to be covered.  This is a massive flaw in the Bill, because I know what is going to happen.  Once the business people&mdash;I will not say all, but certainly some&mdash;who will not want to be caught within the provisions of this Bill see this, they are going to stop selling goods and will lease goods.  Buyers and consumers will adopt that practice and they will accept it&mdash;just like the standard form contracts were accepted, just like these silly guarantees were accepted, they will accept it&mdash;because they will not be any the wiser.</P>
    <P>Anybody involved in any sort of business realises that an awful lot of office equipment is leased.  I would love to know the amount of office equipment that is leased.  Expensive office equipment, cars, all sorts of business equipment and household equipment can be leased.  Those leases will continue to operate with their exclusion clauses which are, to say the least of them, widespread and very comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I snitched out of one original lease of a well-known and reputable leasing company, Hamilton Leasing (Ireland) Limited, a clause setting out one's rights under the Sale of Goods Act <Col N="991" /> which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Lessee shall not rely upon any representation as to the quality of the Equipment or as to its fitness for any particular purpose unless the same shall have been made by the Lessor in writing.</P>
    <P>This is the written contract one is getting:</P>
    <P>No condition or warranty whatsoever of any kind has been or is given or made by or on behalf of the Lessor in relation to the quality of the Equipment of its fitness for any particular purpose, and all conditions and warranties, whether statutory or otherwise, whether express or implied, whether collateral or antecedent hereto or otherwise and whether in relation to the fitness of the Equipment for any particular purpose or the description, state, quality or condition of the Equipment on delivery or at any other time are hereby expressly excluded and extinguished.  The Lessor shall be under no liability for any loss or damage whatsoever (including delay in delivery) in respect of or arising from or in connection with the Equipment or any part thereof howsoever caused.</P>
    <P>In fairness there is another section which provides for very minimal maintenance and inspection of equipment, but these are the rights one has in relation to that piece of equipment.  If an expensive photocopying machine costing £3,000, is on lease and it breaks down eight or ten months later, you are caught. You have no right of comeback good, bad or indifferent.  The purpose of this Bill is to stop that type of situation.  It will not be stopped if leasing of goods is not brought within its scope.  I would ask that the matter be looked at and an immediate amendment be prepared.</P>
    <P>I understand some people believe that leasing might be regarded as a service which is covered by the Bill.  I do not accept that and if the Minister feels that the part of the Bill which provides for supply <Col N="992" /> of services includes leasing, I do not accept that and I ask him to sell the idea to me, or at least lease the idea to me.</P>
    <P>I want to move to a very serious part of the Bill the Minister referred to quite extensively, that is, section 13 which covers motor dealers.  The Bill effectively does two things.  First it implies a condition that at the time of delivery a vehicle is free from defects which would render the vehicle a danger to the public.  That in itself is a protective measure that enhances the consumers' position.  People might quibble with it, but it is not unreasonable. The section goes on, however, to provide that at the time of sale or delivery the motor dealer will provide a certificate to the purchaser that the vehicle is free from the defects I mentioned.  If there is a failure either to deliver the certificate or if the certificate is false, and &ldquo;false&rdquo; is fairly broadly spelled out in the Bill, there is a criminal offence committed by the motor dealer. This is not what was recommended by the National Consumers' Advisory Council.  This, it appears, came from the depths of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned what I regard as the very undesirable state of affairs of introducing criminal sanctions into legislation like this, where they can be avoided, but I wonder what this particular criminal offence, or the existence of it in the statute, will do for the consumer. On the other hand, I wonder what it will do to people in the motor trade.  I can think of one glaring instance where a very highly reputable motor dealer, who is anxious to please in every way he can, could be caught very quickly.  We are not talking about a civil liability.  The civil liability exists either under the contract or under subsection (1) which implies the terms mentioned in the contract.  We are talking here about a motor dealer becoming a criminal&mdash;because this is going to be a serious criminal offence.  Take the case of a motor dealer who takes the trade-in of a car and he tells the mechanic to examine it, to strip it down and see what is in it, to see if it is all right.  If the <Col N="993" /> mechanic negligently or maliciously, fails to discover a defect which ought on reasonable examination to have been discovered, and reports to the seller of that car that everything is all right and the motor dealer delivers the certificate which is false, because there is a defect that should have been seen on reasonable examination, that motor dealer becomes a criminal.</P>
    <P>That is unfair, to say the least of it, but what is serious is this.  This section applies to motor dealers.  It does not apply to a person who makes a private sale.  Given that a motor dealer has a problem and does not have scruples, he will engage in a practice that is already shockingly prevalent in this country&mdash;instead of selling it in his shop window the unscrupulous dealer will put an advertisement in the paper and sell it by way of a private deal and nobody is in a position to show otherwise.  It is well known that there are a lot of cars being sold like this in this country at the moment. This could do nothing but encourage more of it.  The reputable motor dealer has his civil liability.  To avoid the provisions of the Bill people at the lower end of this market will sell their cars privately.  This is a double-edged sword that is going to fly back and cut the face of legislators who try to impose such a silly criminal liability.  It is silly because it does not enhance the position of the consumer. If what we are on about here is to enhance his position, we are not doing one iota for him by imposing this criminal sanction on somebody involved in such a transaction.  It does not matter if he was innocently involved or otherwise.  The crime will nevertheless have been committed.  What are we doing to the consumer?  We are doing absolutely nothing for him.  This, it appears, is a shoddy attempt to overcome a system that exists in most European countries, and certainly in the United Kingdom, where there is an authority established by the State to examine vehicles of a certain age to ensure that they are roadworthy.  It may cost money to do it, but if that is what we want to do, and it appears that it is, let us do it.  We are not going to do anything at all by <Col N="994" /> putting in this reprehensible section.  It does nothing for the consumer except cause him damage because it is going to cause those unscrupulous motor dealers who do not give a hang about the safety of the vehicles, to sell them apparently by private means.  I am delighted the Minister has agreed to an examination of this before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I know that many Members of this House received representations from the society concerned about this.  They are worried about it.  They are a responsible association.  They are anxious to ensure that cars are roadworthy.  They will support the idea of an authority to examine vehicles.  They have no objection to being civilly liable themselves but they object to the criminal sanction being imposed. It should be changed.  We should have a Select Committee of legislators, not just civil servants.  I do not mean to say anything against civil servants but legislators do not have the opportunity to interview these people.  If we get representations, by post or otherwise, we have to take them at face value.  We cannot question them.  We should be able to talk to these people and see what they have to say, see if they can sell their idea subject to argument and cross-examination. This Bill would greatly benefit if it were sent to a Select Committee.</P>
    <P>In the last subsection of that section there is another proposed breach of the doctrine of privity.  It could cause difficulty. The provision simply says that a person, lawfully using the motor vehicle, who suffers loss as a result of a breach of the condition implied by subsection (2) may maintain an action for damages against the seller in respect of the breach as if he were the buyer.  It is proposed there, that if A goes along and buys a car from a garage and sells it to B and B sells it to C and C sells it to D and while D is using the car he suffers an injury or suffers a loss, he has the right to sue the garage.  He must prove in his case that the defect was there at the time of delivery.  It is a very difficult proof to produce.  The vast majority of judges in this country, when they are faced with a <Col N="995" /> case of a consumer or a car owner versus a garage, are very sympathetic to the cause of the consumer or the car owner. Judges recognise that the car owner is not an expert and that the garage has all the resources.  I would not like to see sympathy like that floating around with a section like this because anybody could go in and claim the defect was there when he got it.  There could be great uncertainty as to whether or not it was there at the time of delivery.  What is the garage proprietor meant to do?  Is he meant to keep a detailed record of every nut and bolt in every car and, if he is, for how long?  Is he meant to do this so that he will be in a position, when challenged with this case a year or two years later, to debate it?  This particular proposed breach of the doctrine of privity is an unwise one and should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to this Bill that will certainly take a lot of time on Committee Stage.  I simply want to welcome the proposals regarding directory entries.  That is timely and necessary; I regret to say necessary but certainly it appears to be that way.  In relation to guarantees the Minister says that they will have to be in a specific form.  There is another breach of the doctrine of privity here.  It is not the purchaser of the goods who will merely have the right to sue under the guarantee but subsequent purchasers.  That is a slightly different situation from the situation with the motor dealer and the secondhand car.  I do not think I would object to that particular breach of the doctrine of privity.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see section 44, which relates to unsolicited goods.  If I have any disagreement with that it is that it does not go far enough.  Where somebody takes a chance and decides to post out goods to somebody in the hope that the person might buy them they should lose the right to those goods the minute they go through the recipient's letterbox.  If a businessman wants to take a risk like that let him take it.  Charitable organisations do it.  It is an invasion of privacy to <Col N="996" /> post Christmas cards, magazines, or boxes of chocolates, like this.  As soon as something like that goes through the recipient's letterbox the owner's rights disappear.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with consumer law in a very particular respect and I should like to refer to a favourite topic of mine.  You can provide for rights and give all the protection you can but it is not much use unless the consumer can gain ready access to justice and thereby ensure that his right and his remedy is achieved quickly.</P>
    <P>There are lots of things in consumer law that we could consider and use. There was one great thing that went into law because of a decision of the Supreme Court, what they call the piggyback claim, where you piggyback a civil claim on a criminal action.  In other words, when somebody commits a criminal offence and the consumer is prosecuted, the consumer is entitled to appear at those proceedings and the judge is entitled to impose a fine on the provider of the goods.  In imposing the fine for the crime he can also impose a compensatory fine in the amount of the loss suffered by the consumer.  That was in a Road Traffic Act and it was in the Consumer Information Act but it was abandoned because of fears about its constitutionality. Provided the jurisdiction of the court is provided for correctly it is quite constitutional; it is a very good idea and should be used.  There is also a case to be made for consumer courts. Consumers should not have to go to solicitors at all, particularly for small claims.  We should try to devolve some system where there would be some form of informal court they could go to to argue the case for themselves.  Their case would be dealt with more quickly. Solicitors and lawyers do not have time to deal with them.  They do not want to deal with them but they provide a service in dealing with them and it does not pay them.  We could save the time of the court.  Any argument over a small consumer claim can last a couple of hours just the same as a big claim can.  It is nonsense to see the court's time wasted on things like that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> There are other ideas that we should consider in legislation like this.  If a consumer commits an offence and a sanction is imposed there should be room for multiple damages if there are a lot of people affected by it, something like the class action they have in the United States.  The recently appointed Director of Consumer Affairs may have thoughts on this subject.  It is in the Minister's area of responsibility and I ask him to consider the broad changes that one could make in our business system, in our legal system, to provide ready access for consumers so that they can gain quick access to justice and thereby vindicate their rights.  We would do a good day's work if we could advance our legal system in that particular respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill as a step forward in the enactment of legislation to help the consumer.  Speaking as a layman, after my first reading of the Bill, and indeed after my second and third readings of some sections of it, I am still not too clear as to what it is all about.  I could understand things and approve of them but I was not too clear about many others and probably will not be even when this Bill has passed through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on his speech which cleared the air for me on the general principles involved. I do not think that you can provide for everything through legislation. You can make provisions, in so far as it is legally possible, to prevent total dishonesty and misrepresentation but when you start getting into the fine print you may find yourself getting into deeper water and perhaps damaging different interests.  We know that there are people who could sell anything to anybody. Fortunately, perhaps, they are the exceptions but no slick salesman will be stopped by any legislation because he will have covered himself; he will have talked gullible people into buying something that they did not want.  On the other hand, we all have experiences where the producer, the retailer, has had to give way, in spurious claims, to a form of blackmail&mdash;&ldquo;If you do not replace it, or <Col N="998" /> give me back my money, even though there were no defects I am going to take you to court&rdquo;, and quite frequently practical business people have to decide that the publicity attendant on that court action is far less desirable than the few pounds or whatever it is that getting out of this difficulty may cost them.  It is, in a sense, deplorable, but firms&mdash;and sometimes industries&mdash;have to protect their good name from misunderstanding and misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>However, by and large, I welcome the Bill.  I certainly welcome the updating of provisions and I particularly welcome and compliment the Minister on what, to me, is an innovation&mdash;the changing of legislation should be seen in full rather than by reference back to sections in Acts that were passed many years ago. It certainly makes it a little bit easier, from the point of view of the Legislature to understand what is the intention of the Bill.  I welcome also the similar protection for those who buy on HP as for those who buy for cash.</P>
    <P>Section 13, to which the previous speaker referred, is causing some unease. As he said, most of us have received representations of one kind or another. On the practical side, from the consumer point of view it does seem that there is merit in the idea of having some sort of certificate, not just to protect the buyer of the secondhand car but to protect the public in the event of there being any defect in it.  The question has been fairly posed as to how you are to frame the certificate, what that certificate will contain. If there is no practical means of having some sort of a roadworthiness certificate available to a dealer, he will be in difficulty.  That form of certificate which the Minister proposes to specify would also need to have some time limit on it.  I am sure everybody in this House has seen or experienced the different ways in which people use and drive cars. You could see one car at the end of 12 months looking almost perfect and another one almost a total wreck.  There must be some protection for a dealer, whether by way of mileage, with no defect occurring, or by way of a time <Col N="999" /> limit.  The Minister should consider that aspect of it.  It is not alone the purchaser but the <i>bona fide</i> retail dealer, who is, I have no doubt, providing a very good service in this country in capital goods so far as the community is concerned, who may need some degree of protection.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the points made by the previous speaker, who is qualified to make them, about the difference between civil law and criminal law&mdash;I will merely approach the whole question generally.  Regarding the special committee which he has suggested, I do not see how any special committee from this House could be very effective unless they had expertise at their disposal, unless they had not alone legal people but people expert in the drafting of legislation and so on to explain the difference to them.  It might be a desirable thing, which might take some time.</P>
    <P>I understand that a Bill has to be drafted in the draftsman's office; having gone from the Minister's office, having been drafted conscientiously and carefully by civil servants, by the time it has gone through the printer and reached me&mdash;or any of us, possibly barring Senator FitzGerald who has considerable experience in phraseology and legal detail&mdash;it has gone beyond the stage where one is able to grasp entirely what is meant by a particular clause or paragraph.  In relation to section 13, I am very glad that the Minister has agreed to meet the representatives of the motor industry retailers.  That is a commendable step and may help considerably to get over some of the difficulties about which these people have been writing to me.  I support the general idea of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to join in welcoming this Bill.  It takes a number of big steps forward, although it contains some weaknesses.  I have a particular interest in it as I feel, in a sense, that it is my child.  I was a member of the original National Consumer Advisory <Col N="1000" /> Council which set this whole business in train and it is very satisfactory to see both the Consumer Information Act and this Bill emerging from the deliberations of that committee.  It is also nice to see that after 60 years of independence, we at last have our own Sale of Goods Bill, although I would agree with Senator Molony that it might have been simpler for lawyers and, above all, for ordinary consumers if we had taken the opportunity to produce a whole new Bill rather than going through a series of still fairly complex amendments of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the way in which the Bill has been laid out and I appreciate that it makes it easier that it is set out in the form of tables rather than in the usual reference amendments, nevertheless, we must remember that on Committee Stage in the Dáil there was a certain amount of confusion about which section was being referred to and so on, and if our legislators are going to be confused, how much more are our ordinary consumers going to be confused by this kind of thing?  It is a pity that the opportunity was lost of drafting a whole new Sale of Goods Bill, I feel sure that I will have to continue to use my extremely well thumbed and well underlined copy of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, to complement this new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the new provisions on exclusion clauses and on the so-called guarantees and warranties that are issued to consumers.  We must all realise that the ordinary consumers do not read these things properly, or if they do, they do not understand them.  In other areas of law we have seen the terrible difficulties that can arise from people&mdash;for instance, under the Adoption Acts&mdash;being unable to understand the kind of forms that they are supposed to fill in. Lengthy Supreme Court actions can result and certainly the ordinary consumer has no idea that by signing these guarantees or warranty forms he or she is handing away rights under the Sale of Goods Act and common law rights.  Any of us who have dealt with the kind of secondhand car cases in the courts that <Col N="1001" /> Senator Molony referred to will know perfectly well that some of these guarantees and warranty forms so reduce the consumer's rights that they are almost equivalent to fraud.  It is also of vital importance that the supply of services should be brought into this area so that the Consumer should also be protected in that area.</P>
    <P>There are a few general points I would like to make here in criticism of the Bill, while welcoming its main intentions. There are other more detailed things which will arise on Committee Stage.  In the meantime, on the general part of the Bill, there are some things that I would like the Minister to take another look at. First is a matter which was also mentioned by Senator Molony but which I would like to develop a little further: the fact that the Bill applies to the sale of goods, and hire purchase agreements&mdash;and that is very welcome&mdash;but does not apply to leasing, which is a very important and large question both in regard to office equipment and to motor cars of which there is a great deal of leasing at the moment.  In addition to leasing, as far as I understand, it will not apply to bailments.  Contracts of bailment arise very considerably in areas where one leaves in something for repair or for cleaning, and so on.  This is a matter which affects consumers quite considerably. It would be better if something was brought in in the area of bailment as well as in the area of leasing.  Also, general hiring may or may not be covered in some of the areas.  It is possible that these things may come within the ambit of the supply of services.  I am not too sure, on reading the Bill, whether the supply of services provisions would apply in these areas.  Even if they did, they would only apply in a rather limited fashion.  The general sale of goods provisions should also apply to these sort of contracts.</P>
    <P>I agree that the misrepresentation provisions would perhaps be better included in a whole new Misrepresentation Act which is something very badly needed in our law.  In the Bill they would apply to sale of goods and hire purchase agreements and supply of services, but <Col N="1002" /> there are these other contracts such as leasing and bailment which would fall outside these provisions altogether.</P>
    <P>Section 21, which amends section 53 of the 1893 Act, is a very important improvement in that it improves the position of the consumer in regard to the distinction between the conditions in warranties.  It is a very important distinction in law in that a warranty, if it is a warranty, will give the consumer only right to damages rather than any right to repudiate the contract or give back the goods.  Though it is important in law and lawyers always look for it, for an ordinary consumer it is a rather meaningless kind of distinction and the word &ldquo;warranty&rdquo; in ordinary usage has not at all the same meaning as the word &ldquo;warranty&rdquo; in legal terminology. Therefore, people get confused.  I would like to see this distinction, which is weakened and rather improved by the Bill, carried even further so that fewer cases would arise where damages would be the only remedy for the consumer.</P>
    <P>In practical experience I have too often seen defaulting vendors hiding behind provisions that allow them to say that it is only a warranty and therefore the position of purchasers is that they can only get damages, very often through a court case which the ordinary person who is not particularly well-off is, in the absence of any civil legal aid, unlikely to undertake unless he is very sure of the outcome; at District Court level it is not going to cost people that much but to take it even into the Circuit Court can cost quite an amount in legal fees before they can consider taking an action of this sort.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions on the supply of services, I presume that the subsection excluding electricity supply and international transport is framed so as to exclude the Electricity Supply Board and Aer Lingus International specifically. Other statutory exemptions are mentioned in section 4 (2) of the Bill.  I presume that these statutory exclusions would include that inimitable supplier of non-services, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and also, perhaps, Córas <Col N="1003" /> Iompair Éireann.  I can see that in the position of such State and semi-State services there may be difficulties but we should understand that these are areas where the ordinary consumer in the street and in the home really suffers when services are interrupted or when services are badly looked after.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this area and see if there is anything that can be done to provide some sort of remedy for the ordinary consumer against these monolithic bodies which withdraw their services at a moment's notice or provide services which are so defective as to be practically useless.  Some sort of remedy might make them take a harder look at their own practices.  This is an area where it seems that there is none of the desirable checks and balances of democracy, that all the power is on one side&mdash;literally so in the case of the ESB&mdash;and none of the power is on the side of the consumer.  This Bill is trying to give the consumer more power.  Let it try to give him some in that area.</P>
    <P>Section 38 (5) (b), while it is framed to deal with Aer Lingus, might also be held to exclude some of the activities of travel agents, apart from package holidays, because they include more than just transport of persons and transport of goods.  Some areas where travel agents operate might be excluded by this subsection and we should be careful about this because this is an area in which again there is a great deal of consumer complaint and a great deal of litigation at the moment.</P>
    <P>In section 38 (6) the provisions applying to transport contracts cannot be brought into effect without the permission of another Minister.  One rather wonders why this should be so.  My experience of legislation hitherto has been that this kind of provision can be almost infinitely delayed if it has to be by the order of another Minister; quite often it can be years before the actual provisions are brought in.  I mention, as an example, the Marriages Act of 1963 where it took some ten years to bring in some of the <Col N="1004" /> provisions because that had to be done by ministerial order of this kind.  This area of transport contracts is an important area.  It would cover things like taxis, private buses, haulage contracts. furniture removal and so on as they affect the consumer.  If it is just a matter of one Department not treading on the toes of another Department, this could be got over rather more easily than by putting in a special provision in the Bill about it.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see that the Bill as a whole appears to apply to banks, though there are some exceptions as to orders regarding banks contained in section 53. I was particularly glad of this because the Consumer Information Act does not seem to apply to banks and I wondered, reading through that Act, what was so special about banks that they should be exempt from things that happened to other businesses just because they dealt in money rather than actual tangible goods.  I am pleased to see that this Bill applies to banks but I do not see why we should have the exceptions that are contained in section 53.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I particularly want to raise here and that is in connection with the Director of Consumer Affairs who is envisaged in this Bill, under section 52 in particular, with finance provided under section 8, as having functions in putting the Bill into practice, in actually making these things happen. First of all, I do not understand why a ministerial order is necessary to give him these functions under section 52.  In the Consumer Information Act he was simply directly given the functions and I see no reason why it should not be so here.  These powers can be very readily conferred directly on the Director of Consumer Affairs as he is intended to be an independent officer of the State and not an integral part of the Department.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the general position of the Director, and I would ask the Minister how can the Director of Consumer Affairs be expected to enforce the provisions of this Act when, after hearing others, it appears to me that he has not got sufficient resources, particularly in regard to staff, finance and so on, to <Col N="1005" /> enforce properly the Act he has already tried to enforce, the Consumer Information Act?  For instance, in regard to his independence, from the point of view of the public he would appear much more independent if he had separate offices as, for instance, the Director of Public Prosecutions, rather than having his offices as an integral part of the Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to staff, is there not a possibility that the Director, in order to emphasise his independence, should be allowed to select his own staff or at the least that he should be assured that whatever staff he gets out of the Labour Exchange or the civil service should stay in his office for a period of, say, three years?  I understand that at present the position is that no guarantee can be offered that anyone will stay for longer than 18 months.  The net result of this is bound to be that any good staff will move on after 18 months whereas anyone who turns out to be perhaps less than supremely successful may be left there for years and years, making a nuisance of himself or herself rather than otherwise.</P>
    <P>As regards his budget, I am not <i>au fait</i> with the way in which his money is administered.  I feel that a grant-in-aid and an independent budget would be far more satisfactory than the position revealed in answer to a parliamentary question.  I understand that some time ago his budget was simply part of the Department's budget.  I cannot see that he can be seen to be independent while he is put in this position.  Working within the Department&mdash;I do not want to hurt the feelings of any civil servants who happen to be present or listening&mdash;brings the Director into the ambit of a certain type of civil service procedure which may be very necessary for the Department but not for his office.  I have in my garden a plant called the Russian Vine which grows extremely fast and twirls its tendrills arouund everything in sight.  I have a feeling that some of the procedures in the civil service are like that.  You can put persons into an office and however good they may be some of these procedures, even procedures as <Col N="1006" /> regards getting a letter typed or getting a letter that has been typed corrected, become like the Russian Vine&mdash;they stretch out and eventually they strangle. It is a pity to strangle both a good man and a good office in this way.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any point in our appointing a consumer watchdog and giving him more functions under this Bill if all we are giving him is rubber teeth. The Minister should take a look at this area.  He is new in his Department.  He can come in as a new broom and I hope he sweeps clean and sets up this office as a genuinely independent office which can be seen by consumers to be acting independently on their behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving a partial welcome to the Bill, we must have a general look at consumer legislation as it has evolved in the past 25 to 30 years.  In his opening remarks, Senator Molony made reference to the fact that he found it hard as a legal person to read the Bill.  I as a non-legal person find all Bills hard to read.  The English I use normally is not the English that lawyers use in drafting Bills.  Perhaps there is a peculiar reason for this but I have yet to find out what it is.  I am glad he got help from G. M. Golding in his effort to go through the ramifications of the Bill because when I went to look for the Act of 1893 in the Library, either he had got it or somebody else had got it, but it is not available in the Library.  It is very hard to have a look at legislation to see from where it evolved if you cannot even get in the Dáil Library the statutes being referred to.  An amending Bill of 1973 is available but that is not of much use because it does not give you the details necessary when you are dealing with a Bill of this particular nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at consumer legislation in general, one often wonders where the inpetus is coming from for consumer legislation.  Is it genuinely coming from the consumer or, as people have said, is it coming from the tendrils of the civil service?  I often wonder what value is it to the consumer to have a small shopkeeper down the country fined £50 <Col N="1007" /> for charging a halfpenny extra on a bale of briquettes inadvertently.  The consumer definitely does not benefit.  If there had been over a number of months or over a long period consistent overpricing, definitely in that case there might be a case for prosecuting.</P>
    <P>Consumer legislation generally has created absolute offences.  We have been talking here in terms, in particular section 13 of this Act&mdash;this has been mentioned by all speakers so far&mdash;of bringing into consumer legislation a criminal element.  A motor trader may be dealing, as has been said, in a responsible way in his business and if he were not dealing in a responsible way he would not stay in business because the competition would force him out.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection at present is creating criminal offences but the consumer does not benefit.  What benefit is it to a consumer if a criminal case is brought against a motor trader?  There is absolutely no benefit to the consumer in that.</P>
    <P>Another problem with consumer legislation is that it creates in the minds of the public an illusion that they are being protected.  They do not have as in the past the feeling &ldquo;Let the buyer beware&rdquo;. They go in and they buy and they say, &ldquo;I am being protected.  Therefore, I must be getting something which is good and which has complied with the legislation&rdquo;. In the recent past, Michael Shine, Chairman of the National Consumer Council, wrote,</P>
    <P>It is true that consumers cannot expect to be mollycoddled.  But they are beginning to expect it.  It has something to be said for it as a principle that too much legislation can be counter-productive or ineffective and that consumer protection is not cost free.</P>
    <P>He raised a very important question when he said that consumer protection is not cost free.  He went on:</P>
    <P>It is estimated in the States at present that the cost of consumer legislation <Col N="1008" /> is in the region of $80 billion per annum, or 3.6 per cent of the GNP of the States.</P>
    <P>That is a frightening figure.  When one looks at it, what do the consumers in the States get for that?  They get the dearest medical service in the world; they get the dearest this and the dearest that because the cost of their protection has made certain that the very items they want to purchase have gone out of their reach.  <i>The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit recently did a survey in England on behalf of a major group of companies and the publicity that was given to that has created many problems for consumers in England.  It has been proved that in 1978 the assessible cost to the consumer of protection legislation in England was £150 million.  We have as yet not have had an indication in this country of the cost to the consumer of consumer legislation.  The product has to be packaged and presented in a certain way but whatever is inside the package still remains the same whether it is in a cardboard box or a gold-plated container. We should be talking about the product that is inside the box.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 13. As has been said, there are two separate parts to this section.  The motor industry is not objecting to all of section 13.  They realise that there is a civil liability involved in anything they sell but they are concerned about the provision in the section relating to a criminal offence with regard to the issue of a certificate.  It was amended in the Bill that went through the Dáil to state that the certificate will be as worded by the Minister.  The problem about this is that there is not an MOT test here.  There is not a standard by which we can go.  It will require, in all cases, that every nut and bolt will have to be minutely examined.  What will be the result?  The result will be that motor vehicles will become more expensive or, as has been pointed out by Senator Molony, the reputable garage owner may decide that he will no longer deal in second hand cars.  That will be to the detriment of the public because then the cowboys will get involved&mdash;the boys <Col N="1009" /> who advertise under box numbers and telephone numbers in the back pages of the <i>Evening Press</i> and the <i>Evening Herald.</i>  Nobody wants them involved in the motor trade.  The trade do not want them and the customers do not want them because they are not getting a service from these people.</P>
    <P>As a result of the survey that <i>The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit did, there has been a suggestion that a voluntary code of conduct for each individual industry would be a better protection for the consumer rather than legislation.  The voluntary code of conduct proposition has been tried in other countries and it has been found to work.  It has been proved that only where there has been a failure on the part of the organisation which has this voluntary code of conduct that then legislation should be brought in.</P>
    <P>The motor industry has been looking at the problem of the consumer for many years.  It was not because of this particular Bill that it started to get interested. The motor industry has to protect itself and protect the consumer. It is a highly capital intensive industry and if it does not regulate its business properly it will become a very disreputable type of industry in the public mind.  I regret we should be talking about the cost to the consumer.  Certainly we must regulate standards.  We must regulate procedures under which anything is sold.  There was mention of hire purchase and finance houses.  How many people know the real rate at which they are being charged for goods they purchase on hire purchase or that they lease from companies?  They do not know the actual rate.  More and more people nowadays have to go to lease companies.  The very high rates which they are being charged is something that should be looked into in this type of legislation also.</P>
    <P>The major thing we could do in this exercise of dealing with consumer legislation is to try and find out how cost effective it is.  I do not think that it is cost effective.  When the Committee Stage is <Col N="1010" /> reached I presume we will be able to go into detail on each section.  There are many sections which need to be looked at in detail.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is goin gto meet the motor industry because not alone is it in the interest of the motor industry but also in the interest of the consumer that he does so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit report is something that should be read by anybody who is interested in this type of legislation.  An interesting point in the report is that at present the EEC are looking at consumer legislation and they will be presenting consumer legislation Bills in the EEC.  The OECD are now producing reports on consumer legislation as are the Economic and Social Research Institute.  It could well be that the piece of legislation we are talking about might be overruled by some piece of legislation that comes from the EEC in the near future.  There is a motion here to discuss a Bill on the EEC and possibly by the time we get to discuss that motion we will be discussing EEC legislation which will have a bearing on what we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>In case anyone thinks I am talking very much in favour of the motor industry I should point out that I am part of the motor industry and what I am saying has to be coloured by that very fact.  I do not think that it makes any difference. It is up to people who are involved in a particular business to discuss it here.  It is up to people within the motor industry to express to the public their fears on this Bill and if there is lobbying going on it is not the only Bill on which there has been lobbying.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Bill contains many good points but there are fears and they have been expressed by speakers other than I.  We will have to leave the complex legal aspects of the Bill to the legal eagles but we can express the hope that the consumer will get the benefit of the legislation and that the lawyers and the barristers will not be the only people who will benefit.  In the past too much of the benefit has gone to the legal profession and too little to the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems an appropriate moment for me to stand up and to continue, not too long I hope.  My own reaction to the Bill is that I would not have to say very much on Second Stage as it is very definitely a Committee Stage measure.  It occurred to me that there were a few questions of principle which ought to be referred to on Second Stage and about which the Minister should think more before Committee Stage.  All of the questions have already been referred to and I will add my voice to those who have already spoken on these particular points.  Before doing that I would like to say in relation to this legislation that I do not feel I am concerned with the consumer, nor am I concerned with the supplier or with the manufacturer.  I understand that we are engaged in the business of introducing legislation as to what would be a just relationship between these people engaged in these transactions.  I do not think we are concerned to tilt it in one direction or another, though we have to have regard to economic reality.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's introductory statement it did seem to be possible to infer that he understood that the Sale of Goods Act of 1893&mdash;when it was introduced to set forth these implied terms and to set forth the provisions which were set forth in it with regard to exclusion clauses&mdash;was, as it were, enacting something, imposing something favourable on one party as against another.  It is worth reminding ourselves that in 1893 what was being done was codifying what were in fact the findings of the courts as to what was just between parties, where, in relation to particular matters, the parties had been silent, where there was no express provision with regard to fitness for purpose, where there was no express provision with regard to merchantable quality, where there was no express provision as to the quiet possession, title and so on.  The Act simply said what the courts found, when the parties were silent, was in fact the law at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now of course the situation has changed and this may explain the <Col N="1012" /> problem to which Senator Lanigan referred.  The whole economic and commercial situation has changed.  We must take cognisance of the fact, as Senator McGuinness said, that these guarantees which have been permitted to exist in this country for so long and for too long were in fact an exploitation of the defect in our law because that Act of Parliament was not amended to deal with the changed economic situation where you went into a shop and bought, as we know people now buy.  It is of great importance to us to realise though, that when we get down to the details of these sections, we are concerned not to favour a consumer, who may be a very rich consumer, as against a supplier, who may be a very poor supplier, or who may be in very great difficulties in his business.  We should not get hung up about lobbies.  We should not be talking about large groups, strong groups and small groups.  We should be asking ourselves: what is the proper and just law to have at present with regard to the sale of goods and supply of services?  That should be the overriding test that we should apply.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have&mdash;and it is right that we should have&mdash;the kind of implied terms proposed in this Bill, with one or two other comments that will arise on Committee Stage as to the language in particular cases, and if we are going to have like terms in hire purchase transactions, I would like to be told by the Minister&mdash;and the Minister should really be asked to say this in his reply&mdash;why leases are excluded when hire purchase contracts are included? Why are bailments, whether short-term or long-term, to which Senator McGuinness referred, excluded?  Why is the position with regard to these totally <i>caveat emptor</i>, whether the transactions are fair and reasonable or not: whether the terms of exclusion, for example, are fair and reasonable to have in the leasing contracts or in the bailment contracts; whether they are fair and reasonable or not?  There may be&mdash;I am not saying there are not, I just do not know&mdash;reasons for this exclusion, the <Col N="1013" /> exclusion of leases, the exclusion of bailments.</P>
    <P>Failure to provide for these implied terms and for the restriction on the exclusion, save in the case where the exclusion is fair and reasonable, in the case where the purchaser is not a consumer, the absence of these provisions in relation to leases simply favours the companies that have developed a leasing business as against the companies that have not developed a leasing business and that have developed a hire purchase business.  It seems to me that there will be an economic distortion, an economic consequence and a similar financial consequence arising therefrom.  What it may be I do not know.  We ought to know about it and we ought to be able to make an assessment with regard to it.</P>
    <P>That is the first question of principle and the first issue on which we should be given some explanation by the Minister. This has been pointed out before.  This point was made long before we gathered together here today.  There has been silence on the matter from the Minister's side.  That silence ought to be broken; we ought to be told why.  Maybe there is a very good reason: fine, then we will agree, perhaps.  But if there is not a good reason there will be a distortion resulting from this which ought to be removed. On the other hand, my view at this stage&mdash;and I can develop it on Committee Stage&mdash;is that the exposure of the hire purchase companies is excessive; it has been increased to an excessive extent. My view, according to the information and the understanding I have at present, is that it is going to reduce the availability of hire purchase finance. Taking Senator Lanigan's point, the effect of that may be to add to the consumer's cost, to the consumer who is perhaps the least able to afford it.</P>
    <P>Just to make a simple comparison of the UK position with ours, there is provision in the United Kingdom for a right of indemnification.  In section 74 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1974 there is provision for the joining of the supplier as the joint party in any proceedings.  There is an exclusion in the case of minimal claims of £30, or transactions of £30, <Col N="1014" /> and where the finance involved is in excess of £10,000.  All of that applies only where there is in fact an association of a kind between the hire purchase company and the supplier, which I doubt exists as a counterpart in this country. There is a matter here provided for by this Bill rendering the dealer the agent of the hire purchase company which has been, according to the judicial findings so far&mdash;and at which I would have thought we should leave the matter&mdash;a matter of fact in each case as to whether or not the dealer was the agent of the hire purchase company.  I think it should be left as a matter of fact because each case differs, and every dealer should not be deemed, as I understand this Bill will deem him, to be the agent of the hire purchase company, with all of those consequences for the hire purchase company.</P>
    <P>A third point&mdash;again a question mentioned by Senator Molony, amongst others&mdash;is the question of the definition of the consumer.  This is extremely important. The original definition has been amended since the Bill was initiated.  The amendment is not adequate.  For example under the UK code sales at auction the buyer is never a consumer.  Under this Bill it is only sales of goods that the Minister shall specify which will render the buyer not to be a consumer.  I would like to ask the Minister how he proposes to deal with, for instance, the case of the administration of an estate where there is a lot of furniture or stock or mixed goods to be sold.  How is the personal representative ever going to distribute the proceeds of the sale if he is to have a contingent liability on implied conditions which result from his having sold these goods at auction?  The same applies to people selling companies that are being liquidated.  If they cannot sell by auction they will be subject to liability under this Bill by reason of the implied conditions which will attach to all the goods they have for sale.  What will be the position of the receiver?</P>
    <P>Senator Molony has mentioned the case of the jockey buying the saddle. There are countless other cases of different people buying different things.  At <Col N="1015" /> least consumer should be limited to an individual.  It should be limited&mdash;taking the language of the EEC&mdash;to a &ldquo;natural person&rdquo;.  I cannot see that any corporation should be treated as a consumer and get the benefits of that situation.  Let <i>caveat emptor</i> apply in his case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the misrepresentation, I have just one question, and it is rather important to me to have an answer.  In general the part of the Bill that applies to misrepresentation is limited to sales of goods.  Section 40 sets forth the limitation in that respect but&mdash;and I should like to have the answer to this before the Bill reaches Committee Stage&mdash;is there any other reason for so limiting that part than that it is part of a Bill dealing with the sale of goods and supply of services? The argument on the whole has run that this misrepresentation chapter should apply to everything.  I am inclined to go on the side of that argument but I would like to know whether the Minister is convinced that this misrepresentation part should only attach to goods.  I should like if possible to have references on that. The matter is not without argument.  The argument has not been engaged in in this country but it has been argued elsewhere and I would like to know what is the Minister's thought on it.  In effect we have taken the Misrepresentation Act of 1967 and put it into this part, and fair dues to the Department for doing this. May I say straight away that in this field of substantial law the Government are right in following as closely as possible statutory language which is being used in the UK, particularly when moving into this whole trading area because we get a free ride.  We get the overhead cost of discovering what our language means. That cost is borne by the British.  We get very good judicial opinion as to the meaning of particular phrases.  Consequently, we would be totally mad to use different language if the language of a UK Act has gone through the UK courts.  For any one action we will have they will have 100 and well thought out actions too with good judgments on them.  It would be very foolish not to <Col N="1016" /> take note of these.  We would be equally foolish to use the language of their legislation if it is found in some cases to be defective and the sections not as good as they should be.  I think this may be true of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. When we get down to that I think we may have to suggest changes on it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important single point I want to make is that there must be introduced rapidly, in case somebody would forget it, a section into this Bill providing that it does not come into operation for a period of time sufficiently long to give all those who are engaged in the business of selling in Ireland an opportunity to get all their documents right.  Because their documents are all drafted on the basis of the existing law, it is entirely unwise to assume that it is fair dealing to business people who have prepared conditions of sale and terms of agreement in their guarantees and so on on the basis that that is the law.  It cannot be assumed that they are following our debates.  They have something more productive to do than to be following our debates while holding their breaths and assuming that we are going to conclude as the Bill has been circulated.  They cannot start the business of replacing their documents until we have completed our business whatever that may be.  There must be a provision&mdash;though perhaps this should be by way of ministerial order&mdash;whereby a sufficient period of time would be specified so as to ensure that they can get their legal people to do whatever they should do to get the documents right and to consider generally the position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motor industry, I am used to every class of lobby operating on me and I have long since made it clear to them all that I shall just try to make up my own mind as best I can in this regard.  I have satisfied myself that the subsection here providing for criminal offence is wrong.  The section seems in general to be right.  The absence in the Bill even of adequate provision for defence almost suggests something not serious about it at the beginning.  We have nothing like the same sort of provisions <Col N="1017" /> for defending proceedings as we have, for example, in the Consumer Information Act.  I hope that this subsection will go.  I very strongly hold the opinion that there ought to be established a system of vehicle testing.  I do not think the Minister can simply deal with this on the basis it is for another Department.  I would like to see all the criminality with regard to this taken out of this Bill.  It is a matter for another Bill.  It belongs in the road traffic law.  We have no provision here for rendering people criminal who provide machinery that slaughters people in factories or that leads to miseries in mines.  There are all sorts of other things that do damages apart from defective motor cars and they should be in the appropriate legislation dealing with such matters.  But the need for such legislation is very great.</P>
    <P>In a press release dated 6 December last the Dublin Road Safety Council said that car tests showed a terrifying figure. Of the 786 vehicles checked 99.6 per cent had a fault of some sort.  It went on to say that excessive fuel consumption resulting in incorrect exhaust emission is also a matter of concern from three points of view&mdash;health, environmental damage and uneconomic use of imported fuels.  It said that 43 per cent of vehicles checked fell into the above category.  An Foras Forbartha calculated that defective vehicles were involved in between 5 and 10 per cent of road accidents.</P>
    <P>If we stand by and allow these things to happen and do nothing about them, we are really guilty.  There ought to be a proper system, such as exists in England and elsewhere.  The British Ministry of Transport have been operating a system which started in 1960.  It was extended in 1968, in 1969 and 1977.  Under this system any car over three years has to be tested annually.  Here we are going to have a system of a certifier&mdash;not necessarily competent&mdash;issuing a certificate at any age, but only on sale and only if the person who is selling happens to be in the business of selling cars.  This is not merely cosmetics; it is cosmetics the lady should not put on.  We would be better without what is proposed in this <Col N="1018" /> Bill and with the bare look we were born with.  All we are going to do in regard to this is to expose a lot of reputable people to possible criminal charges.  That is very wrong of us to do without providing an adequate system.</P>
    <P>Jorrock's <i>Jaunts and Jollities</i> is a book I used to enjoy.  Mr. Jorrocks was very interested in hunting.  Somebody asked him would he warrant a horse sound.  He replied: &ldquo;Warrant the horse sound?  I would not warrant he were a horse&rdquo;.  If I were a motor dealer I would not issue a certificate under any circumstances. That would be my own personal view.  I would go out of the business of acting in such a way that, through some defective arrangements in my own work organisation, I could be rendered criminally liable or prosecutable, as the man who got off with Judge Adams saying: &ldquo;You leave this court with no other stain on your character than that you have been found not guilty by a Limerick jury&rdquo;.  I would not like that to be my fate.</P>
    <P>We should not light-heartedly create criminal offences.  I do not like the tinge of criminality around this.  That is all right for people who engage in these kind of fraudulent things about directors, soliciting goods and so on, but there should be some separate piece of commercial criminal law dealing with all of that and not getting it mixed up with ordinary decent trading.  We should be setting out what is the law between parties, what they can agree on and what they cannot agree on.  Let that pass.  It would take a long time to persuade Senators of the virtue of that.  This is very serious.  No reputable trader is going to put up a notice about his conditions and exemption clauses.  He is not going to send out invoices.  He is not going to do the other things in the Bill.  He is in business, is under pressure about sales and wants to keep his turnover up.  He may be lazy, or drunk and his business may not be as organised as it should be.  He may find himself responsible for certificates issued on his behalf. He should be responsible to the person who has acquired that car and take all <Col N="1019" /> the civil consequences, but he should not be responsible in the sense of being a possible accused in a criminal prosecution. I feel very strongly about that.  It ought to be changed.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness mentioned the exemptions in section 4.  It would be very helpful to us if we knew what they were and if we could get the statutory exemptions that are there brought together and scheduled in some way.  I do not find any contract being rendered void which is in breach of our trade description Act, that is, the Consumer Information Act, 1978. Perhaps there is a section that I have missed.  If there is not a section and if somebody is selling goods in a manner which is in breach of the criminal provisions of what was a criminal act, that contract should be void.  We ought to so provide in this legislation.</P>
    <P>These are not Committee points. These are points I am drawing the Minister's attention to ahead of Committee Stage where there are questions of principle involved and where the retailer has the right to exempt himself from the guarantee liability.  I wonder should that not be excluded where the retailer is also the importer.  That seems to have a possibly distorting effect economically in a competition for the sale of goods between a home manufacturer and an importing manufacturer.</P>
    <P>Am I correct or am I misreading section 33 of the Bill?  It seems to make the finance house liable in the matter of the supply of spare parts under section 12 and in respect of the guarantee section 17.  Notwithstanding the language of section 14, which was introduced in the original Bill, about paying the supplier direct, it is possible the courts might hold that the section attaches a liability to the finance house when there are concurrent transactions relating to the sale of goods and other lending of money.  Does the Minister understand that there are different conditions in Ireland which would justify the sterner legislation on the hire-purchase side to that existing in the UK?</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House for allowing this motion to be taken at this particular time.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening we have what I would regard as one of the most important motions laid before this House for many a long day.  It is very important in the history of agricultural development at the moment, and in regard to our animal disease position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other EEC states.  As an overall view I want to say that I appreciate the necessity to have this nation cleared of TB and brucellosis. I also appreciate that we are living very dangerously.  We are living from one derogation to the next.  I quite understand that there is an impatience on the part of our European counterparts that we must get down to the problem of <Col N="1021" /> cleaning up our animal disease problem. Furthermore, I appreciate the need to safeguard the most important export commodity we have&mdash;I understand it is valued at around £600 million at the moment. By doing so, we safeguard the standard of thousands of farming families living on the land and indeed thousands of others who are working in related industries.  I am as conscious as anybody else of the magnitude of the task before us.  The movement of cattle has always been very difficult to control at the best of times and particularly when there are some unscrupulous characters who would sell their neighbour's livelihood down the drain for a few pounds in their own pockets.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture has been far from imaginative with disease control over the years.  Some 20 years and millions of pounds later there are still large areas of black spots in the disease eradication scheme.  Not enough research has been done in the best methods of identifying disease, in particular brucellosis, amongst our female cattle.</P>
    <P>If you take Great Britain and America you will see that the use of their Rose Bengal test for brucellosis has proved very effective.  This is a place test, the results of which can be ascertained quickly, cheaply and reliably; it could be handled by the district veterinary officer in each county.  Will it take the Department of Agriculture another 20 years to latch on to this, or would it be too much to expect that a pilot area be set up to see if the Rose Bengal test is as suitable to Irish conditions as it has been to English and American?</P>
    <P>To further pinpoint the failure of the Department of Agriculture to get the optimum results from the expenditure on the disease eradication programme over the past few decades, let us look at the farcical situation in relation to the tuberculin used to identify tuberculosis in cattle.  For years, and until a few months ago, the vets used what is known as the Weybridge tuberculin, seemingly happy in the knowledge that it was the best available.  However, 20 years later, when most other countries had reduced <Col N="1022" /> the incidence of disease down to an acceptable level, we found that we were using a weak tuberculin that had the effect of not identifying all possible reactors. Now we use a Rotterdam tuberculin with much greater effect.  I count this an unforgivable blunder; obviously the blame rests with several successive Ministers for Agriculture and a plethora of Department officials and vets.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that in most countries the fight against animal disease is being won&mdash;we are delighted to say that&mdash;and 1979 has been a good year as far as disease eradication is concerned.  However, 1979 also saw the introduction of the 30-day test, or the pre-movement test as it is called.  The powers that be in the Department of Agriculture and the former Minister, Mr. Gibbons, saw fit to impose this legislation, on the basis that the EEC authorities had put the gun to our heads, that time was running out on us and that we had been given a very short time to put our house in order.  I have no doubt that that was the reasoning behind it.  I still think&mdash;as do thousands of farmers in Ireland&mdash;that the Minister of the day over-reacted.  This 30-day pre-movement test has caused untold hardship to farmers. It has certainly seriously upset the cattle trade.  Also, because of that, farmers have only, on average, two weeks to sell their cattle.  It has been stated that the results come back from Thorndale much quicker than that but, on the ground, by the time the farmer has the cards in his hand for the animals he wants to sell, he certainly has no more than 13 or 14 days to do so.  Indeed, it would be true to say that many farmers have only seven days because of this delay in getting the blood samples back from Thorndale.  Let us look at the consequences of that on the ground.  The Minister knows all about marts, that even in times of good trade, for some unknown reason, you hit a black spot; as we call it, in the mart world on a particular day at a particular sale, that prices could be depressed for a lot of reasons.  If a farmer happens to be present on that, he has only two choices.  He can take the poor price for his cattle&mdash;there is nothing to stop him from <Col N="1023" /> doing that&mdash;but he will lose a lot of money&mdash;or he can take his cattle home. He will have to wait 42 days&mdash;thanks to the present Minister; it was 60&mdash;before he can test and another 14 days or so before the blood samples are back and he has the cards in his hands and he can sell again.  That makes up a total of about 60 days of a delay.  Anybody remotely involved with farming would know that that is the type of programme that very few farmers can go through, particularly in winter time.  Having extra cattle on the farm for an extra two months makes terrible problems for the farmer concerned and, indeed, I might add, for the trade generally, but we will come to that later.</P>
    <P>This 30-day test law, in itself, has frightened a great number of small cattle producers to take whatever they can get at the mart on the day they are out but, worse still, a number of farmers are beginning to by-pass the marts and to sell on the land.  Nobody can tell me that that type of thing is conductive to a good animal disease control programme.  It is not, and however the laws are tightened up, we must try to guard against it.  It is well to remember, too, the 30-day test is very expensive.  Take cases of farmers testing three cattle or fewer, which would be a fairly reasonable average particularly in the western area, in the small cattle-producing areas.  They will be asked to pay £10 or £12 for that, if not more in some cases.  There is no doubt in the world in my mind that the 30-day test has contributed to the depressed cattle trade and is still doing so.</P>
    <P>The store cattle areas of the west are particularly badly hit.  It is significant that, by and large, the western counties are a free or clearance area.  It is peculiar that the people who did their best over the years in the free and cleareance areas, and did what they were told, are now being penalised more than anybody else.  This is something that I could not stand for.  Those people have done what has been asked of them over the years and they are now being over-penalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> I put it to the Minister that, no matter what Brussels says about our disease status, you cannot over-penalise any particular section of our farming community. The duty is on the Minister to help such people, in so far as he can.  I want to place on record that I understand the position in which we find ourselves, where the people who are paying the piper are certainly beginning to call the tune.  At the same time, I cannot understand why a law would be enacted that would over-penalise people.  Considering, as well, that we have relied on a certain system for over 20 years to clear brucellosis and TB is it not amazing that we decide to screw farmers in such a very difficult way all of a sudden?  It is going from one extreme to another.  Why did the Minister not bring in a 60-day test?  A 60-day test would break the disease cycle much better than the annual test would.  It would catch most of the movement of cattle and this is important because one of our special problems here is that the interchange of cattle per farm is much greater than it is anywhere else on the Continent.  We have a special problem there because cattle shift, on average, four to six times in their lifetime.  The 60-day test would be a reasonable one in that it is not as expensive as a 30-day test.  It would also cut out irregulat dealing because it would give farmers at least four or five weeks to get rid of their cattle inside the law.  At this stage the Minister must give serious consideration to this matter.  A lot of talk and rumours have been emanating from Brussels in the past few weeks that the boot is down and there is nothing that we can do about it.  But 60-day test comes as near as one would want to a 100 per cent effective control without at the same time over-penalising the farmer, particularly the smaller farmer.</P>
    <P>While I have this opportunity, there is another bone of contention.  I cannot understand why suck calves or baby calves from the main dairying areas of the south, some of them coming from TB and brucellosis herds, are allowed to enter the free and clearance areas.  The likelihood of their bringing disease with <Col N="1025" /> them might not be very great but I understand that about 3 per cent of the identified disease problems can be attributed to this type of thing.  From now on until April or May the dealers' lorries in their thousands will be coming from the southern counties into the store-producing areas that are supposed to be clear.  I cannot see how that could be a good control programme.</P>
    <P>At a time when all the blood testing is done at Thorndale in Dublin, I cannot understand why the Minister does not immediately embark on a programme of getting the regional laboratories organised to test the blood at regional level.  If we have to have the 30-day test&mdash;and I hope we have not got to have this&mdash;there is no way in the future that we can trust the post for such a very important function.  Considering that we have regional laboratories geographically very well placed around the country, I cannot see any reason why these would not be immediately equipped and put into operation to do the testing at regional level.  It was very bad forward planning by the Department not to have thought of doing something about regional testing facilities before drafting the legislation to carry out the 30-day test.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree that there is no money to do this 30-day test.  If I have my facts and figures right, over £5.5 million earmarked for brucellosis eradication last year was never actually used for that and in fact was put back into the Exchequer. It is a criminal thing that that happened and I would like to hear the Minister's explanation.  I cannot understand why it was not used to get equipment for regional blood testing.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about disease generally, I cannot understand why the regional laboratories do not concern themselves about this whole question of identifying lead poisoning in calves.  This might seem a very minute problem but in fact it is a very big one.  The laboratory in Athlone, for example, is not in a position to identify certain problems concerning the intake of lead.  A part of the animal in question has to be sent to Dublin and in one case it took at least six <Col N="1026" /> days before it was sent back.  I understand from the veterinary profession that if the type of lead that the calf actually died from could be identified it would be possible to treat the other calves with a reasonable chance of keeping them alive. I also understand that 7 per cent of all calves appearing at the laboratory in Athlone in 1979 had lead poisoning in one degree or another.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that those facilities are down in the country because it is of very little use to us to have facilities in Dublin if we cannot get the necessary information back quickly enough.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, there are cases around the country where the relationship existing between the district veterinary offices and some of the veterinary practitioners is not all that we would like it to be.  I find this very disquieting because one would assume that in this business of disease eradication it would be very important to have a united effort.  I must say that some counties are very good but, to my knowledge some are not so good.  It is very important when there is an outbreak of disease in any county or in a specified area that we would be able to call on all the veterinary advice and all the Departmental assistance that can be given to the farmer concerned and to the adjoining farmers.</P>
    <P>If one has been critical of the Department over the years it is because of the very lackadaisical way that the whole process and method of taking reactors off the farms is carried out and veterinary advice given.  The first man to see a farmer after he has been told he has disease in his herd should be a member of the veterinary profession.  This is a very important factor because there has to be some reason for the disease being there and the sooner everybody knows it the better.  This whole question of identifying the source and trying to do something about it is of vital importance. To this day I am not convinced that the Department of Agriculture are on the ball as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another factor that I cannot understand is why the annual test is not carried <Col N="1027" /> out in time.  Only two nights ago I met farmers who did not have a test for 16, 17 and 18 months.  I cannot understand this because, if we are to be reasonable, while the 30-day test would catch cattle on the move, nevertheless the vast percentage of the cattle of Ireland, particularly the breeding stock, would only be subject to the annual herd test.  I cannot understand why it is not possible, with all the veterinary surgeons that are available, to organise the annual herd test inside the 12 months.  If the Department are serious about stamping out disease at that level no farmer should ever be able to say anything but that he had his herd tested inside 12 months.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are beginning to brace themselves to possibly paying for their herd testing in 1980.  It has taken a longer time than was expected to have it done and it has cost much more because they might have to pay for their herd testing in 1980, and I would like to hear the Minister reassure the House that this will not be the case because they certainly paid enough through the 30-day test and the disease eradication scheme itself without being burdened with this levy as well.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to bring the Minister's attention to the whole question of the cost of the disease eradication scheme itself as far as farmers are concerned. I know there are many people outside farming who will argue that disease control is within the capacity of the farmer himself and that if he happens to have the misfortune to run into a disease he should also have the obligation to get himself out of it.</P>
    <P>It is not nearly as simple as that because what happens is this.  Individual farmers might not in many cases have any control particularly over the incidence of brucellosis in his herd, and if you consider at the moment that most farmers now, with all the aids that are there and payments which we will come to in a minute, are losing between £200 and £300 an animal on their market <Col N="1028" /> value, not to speak of the replacement value.  When the time will come when they will be allowed to buy in, it might be much greater than that and there is no doubt that there are many hundreds of farming families in a very bad state because of the incidence of disease, and because the Government subsidy is not high enough, and because the hardship grants payable in certain cases are also insufficent.</P>
    <P>I will be asking the Minister&mdash;it is a hard time to be asking it from a Minister for Agriculture&mdash;for an increased subvention from the budget.  But I can assure him of one thing: you cannot over-penalise anybody, and I do not have to tell the Minister that any farmer who happens to be hit with bovine disease will never want to see disease again.</P>
    <P>It is fair comment to suggest that there are a number of people abroad who would suggest that farmers have actually made money out of disease.  I have never seen a farmer actually emerge well financially from having disease in his herd, and to my knowledge 99.99 per cent of farmers would not want to see disease of any description in or near their farms.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think seriously about the hardship grant.  I think the initiation of that was a good idea.  It meant that a farmer who was hit severely could have recourse to that scheme.  I ask him, therefore, to hike up the payments and make a greater variety of animals eligible.</P>
    <P>Another fault we find with the hardship grant is that is it quite difficult to get the money: there seems to be a long interval between the time when the disease arrives on the farm and when the hardship grant is paid.  The hardship grant was initially introduced to get people over lean periods.  Some farmers have been through very lean periods while they are waiting for this hardship grant to come.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made on disease eradication.  It is belated, but it is important that progress has come.  I believe that the percentage of brucellosis <Col N="1029" /> in the free clearance areas is now down to 2.53 per cent of herds and 0.31 per cent of all animals.  To give an idea of how bad it is at the other end of the scale, in the pre-intensive areas, which are basically in the south of the country, the percentage is now as high as 22.3 per cent of herds.  That would lead us to believe that there is a tremendous amount of work to be done in the whole eradication scheme.  However, the present progress can be maintained with a revised pre-movement test and a general tightening up of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an important inhibiting factor: wash facilities at marts and factories.  There is no doubt that&mdash;and I speak as somebody who has been very closely involved in the marts business&mdash;that, unless the Department of Agriculture are actually seen to be enforcing the regulations fairly and strictly, the scheme will not be a success.  For some unknown reason many of the regulations are circulated, but they never seem to be enforced.  I ask the Minister to insist that Department officials will make sure that a vehicle arriving at a factory, or a mart for that matter, will be guaranteed to be disinfected on its way out of the yard.  If there is a sure way to spread disease it is through those old trucks.  I am told that there are factories to this day that do a very bad job in cleaning and disinfecting lorries.  There should be very big penalties for that, because, if somebody brings a lorry load of reactors to a factory and 24 hours later that lorry will be carrying a load of cows or incalf heifers, that is criminal. People guilty of such negligence will have to be stopped.</P>
    <P>The regulations and the law governing people who tamper with identity cards, who change ear-tags and so forth have been tightened up.  I notice that there have been a number of convictions and fairly heavy penalties, but one would hope that it would become easier to bring people who are always flouting the law before the courts.  I have always found that the Department officials through lack of evidence, even though everybody knew that a certain section of the community were messing around, <Col N="1030" /> have experienced great difficulty in getting them before the courts.  For that reason there has been a lot of underhand type of activity hard to prove.  I understand that at the moment when a herd owner is about to have his cattle inspected for the ordinary test by a local vet he or she is asked to sign a declaration form.  This has a legal implication; and if it means that all cattle on the farm are tested, well and good, it is a job well done.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is most important for most farmers that that TV advertisement the Department of Agriculture see fit to screen should go into every house in Ireland.  There is no doubt it brings to attention the danger of getting disease into your farm.  However, there are more culprits than the poor farmer with his open mouth, a depressed figure.  I think that the cameras should be swung around to catch a number of other people&mdash;and there are a fair number of them.  I would have a look inside the Department of Agriculture and I would have an odd look at the vets and dealers before I would be finished with it.  I would put the whole lot of them on trial because I think more people than the farmer have been involved in the deeds or misdeeds or sins of omission during the years.  I think it is unfair to nail the farmer with the image that he has been the cause of all his own troubles.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Connaughton and join him in wishing the new Minister for Agriculture success in his office.  We all realise that the Minister for Agriculture holds the most important Cabinet office and that the economic well being of the country to a very large degree depends on the success that might attend his efforts.  It is absolutely necessary to have the goodwill of the farming community and if there are points in the operation of the scheme that annoy them they should be removed if it is safe to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large body of opinion among the farming community and among practising veterinary surgeons that a 60-day test would be equally effective. <Col N="1031" /> If that is not the case it should be clearly stated and nobody should be left in any doubt on that point.  There is a belief in the country at the present time that the measures taken here are not as effective as those adopted in Britain and in the United States, that if we had used the same tuberculin as they are doing we would have had better results before now.  We want a statement on that and a statement as to why it is absolutely necessary that it should be a 30-day test when such a big body of opinion holds that a 60-day test would be sufficiently effective.</P>
    <P>The objections to the 30-day test are those outlined by Senator Connaughton. Because of the delays in returning the blood sample&mdash;postal delays mainly&mdash;the 30 days are very often reduced to 14 days and in some cases even to only seven days.  That is a fact.  If it is unanimously considered by the expert that we cannot extend the 30 days, then measures should be taken to ensure that the results of the test are available in a shorter time.  I do not know if that can best be done by increasing the staff in central laboratories, or whether we should have had laboratories located at different centres throughout the provinces, a suggestion made by Senator Connaughton with which I agree.  If it were efficiently done it would mean that the blood test would be back at a much earlier date and the 30 days would be 30 days instead of 14 days or less.  That is the point that is being made throughout the country.  If the Department showed a desire to meet the wishes of the people by setting up laboratories at strategic centres throughout the country it would clearly indicate goodwill on their part to meet the wishes of the farmers in cutting down the long delay that prevails with regard to the return of the blood test. That is a very important point and one that has led to dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>It is the experience of people with whom I have discussed this matter that very often they are left with a choice of only two marts at which to sell before <Col N="1032" /> the test period expires.  It happens often that there are fluctuations in prices at marts.  Even though prices may be very low a farmer knows that if he does not sell he will be held up for 42 days until the next test.  I should like to join with Senator Connaughton in thanking the Minister for that concession but because of the fee situation, the fact that fodder might be running out and so on, the farmer is forced to accept a price that does not pay him for his trouble and his efforts. That arises because of the very short time he has between getting the test results back and the expiry of the 30 days.  Anything that can be done to help the farming community in this matter would be very welcome.  As I said at the outset, it is important that it be seen by the farming community that every possible effort is being made to meet their wishes.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton has dealt exhaustively with the question of compensation paid to farmers when their cattle fail the test.  There are many farmers all over the country who when things are going well can just manage, but if they are faced with a loss of income as a result of cattle failing the test and if they are also faced with the fact that the grants do not come near meeting the cost of replacement then it is quite natural that they would be less than fully co-operative.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that has given dissatisfaction for a very long time.  It is the cause of annoyance to farmers and in many cases it puts them in a hopeless financial position.  The matter must be attended to.  As I said already, the goodwill of the farming community and 100 per cent co-operation is desirable and indeed necessary if the scheme is to be a success.  Like Senator Connaughton. I agree entirely with the imposition of severe fines on people who try to circumvent the scheme and who use all sorts of dodges to escape.  There would be less of that if the grants were near the replacement cost.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to give the impression that the farming community have been less than responsible.  A farmer <Col N="1033" /> knows as well as anybody else that it is of the greatest importance to him, more so to him than to any other section, that the disease eradication scheme be successful. I believe that certain measures taken by the Minister now could generate much goodwill and thereby improve co-operation right up to 100 per cent.  The scheme has cost so much to date and it is only right that people should objectively examine it to see why it has cost so much and why it has not been completely successful.  If the Department are at fault in the operation of the scheme that should be admitted and an immediate change should be made.  If it can be shown that the grants or payments made to the farming community who incur these losses are not adequate, then whatever the cost they should be increased.  In the long run it would save money.</P>
    <P>We are now at a stage&mdash;the scheme having been in operation for so long, having attained less than the success we anticipated, having cost a huge amount of money&mdash;when there should be an objective examination carried out of how the scheme has been operated with a view to ascertaining means of making it more successful.  Undoubtedly, one way it would gain success is through the whole-hearted co-operation of the farming community who will ensure that every effort is made to have their wishes met, that reasonable cases advanced are examined, ensuring that no one farmer or section be called on to bear an intolerable burden.  I hope what has been said here today will go some way to bringing about that state of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>May I endorse the words of the previous speakers, Senator Connaughton and Senator O'Brien, in congratulating our new Minister for Agriculture on his appointment?  I wish him many years of success in what I regard as a major portfolio, probably the second major portfolio in this country. Like Senator Connaughton, I am glad the Minister comes from an area and background that understands exactly what we in the west mean when we <Col N="1034" /> speak about live exports and store trade in general.  I have no doubt but that the motive for introducing this motion was to appeal for co-operation from farmers generally, to have open discussion in order to alleviate any hardship and indeed eliminate any lack of co-operation from the people involved in the trade.</P>
      <P>The main complaints I have were occasioned by and occurred during the postal strike.  During that period I was very critical of the delays encountered in having brucellosis blood samples returned to the veterinary officer and thence to the farmer, which in turn delayed his period of sale, thus reducing the value of his animals.  With regard to the export trade, if the animal appeared in the ring with at least a fortnight's test in hand, it would increase considerably its price. This set-back was not the fault of the Department or of the farmers.  I remember being a member of a deputation from the animal health committee in Mayo to the then Minister, when we discussed and endeavoured to extend the period of 30 days.  We felt that a happy medium might be reached between the 30 and 60 days.  I am glad the Minister has introduced a regulation to meet what we were requesting, or would have accepted on that occasion, but which we failed to achieve when we met the Minister's predecessor.  On that occasion the veterinary people opposed it bitterly.  The Minister had given them a job to do, had told them to get on with the work and that he would hold them responsible if they did not produce a national animal disease free herd by 1982.  The Minister then was not a veterinary surgeon and had to be guided by the most knowledgable and highly qualified veterinary people in his Department. That was the scheme devised.  I join Senator Connaughton and others in maintaining that there was a great deal of harassment of farmers who were endeavouring to be co-operative under the scheme.  Nevertheless, one must be cruel to be kind.  In the final analysis I think the scheme will prove to be of benefit to the whole of the farming community and of the nation if we can achieve the targets laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Now I should welcome the blood test being returned on the day the vet gives one one's certificate for TB.  That would be a very suitable arrangement, giving the farmer his 30 days free, affording him a re-test within 45 days from the date he received his cards.  Of course, it was unfortunate that there was a breakdown in the TB eradication scheme for a year and a half.  Again, I shall not blame the Minister's predecessor. However, nobody can deny that he had a disagreement with the veterinary association, taking 18 long months to be resolved.  People had to mark time throughout those 18 months when they would have been eradicating disease at a much lower cost than at present. Therefore, we lost 18 valuable months of intensification in the eradication of disease here.  I must compliment the Department and their officials on the way they tackled this matter.  Perhaps the gun was to their heads which, even if it were the case, I am sure will not be revealed now with the change of personnel at top.</P>
    <P>The deadline has been set from Europe.  We should be appealing continuously to everybody in the trade&mdash;whether he be a mart manager, an auctioneer, a factory manager, livestock exporter, farmer, veterinary surgeon or whoever&mdash;to achieve a disease free herd here by 1982.  It may be asking too much.  We in the West have made our contribution.  The incidence of disease in the West now is very low and indeed was at the outset of our major operations many years ago.  We in Mayo were one of the first, with Donegal, Sligo and other counties, to be declared a free TB accredited county.  The Shannon was the greatest boundary we could have had for control at that time.  I do not know why the Department traversed it into Westmeath, Kildare and other areas when they had that natural boundary for control and movement of cattle into the whole western region having a geographical boundary which could have been controlled at the few crossing <Col N="1036" /> points of which we are all aware.  I read recently that some association&mdash;whether it was the Associated Livestock Marts, the IAOS or whatever&mdash;was appealing to the Government to provide grants for washing bays at marts and factories.  I agree with Senator Connaughton that this constitutes a first priority, that we should have plenty of water pressure and a washing bay compulsorily provided. Unless the Minister makes this compulsory regulation no mart or factory will provide a service.</P>
    <P>There are such regulations in every other country.  Anyone who takes a load of cattle to a market in Britain must take his truck to the washing bay before going out for another load, regardless of whether he may be collecting from the same herd and the same farmer.  This is something which only takes a few minutes under a very high pressure hose. There is some controversy as to who should pay for such facilities.  Perhaps the marts and factory operators who are getting good incomes from the sale of cattle and the slaughtering of animals whould provide these washing bays.  This should not present any difficulty assuming that water pressure is good.  I appeal that this be done in the interest of hygiene and of the eradication of disease generally.</P>
    <P>Since 25 January the Minister has made available in Doonally laboratory testing facilities whereby the north-west part of the country will be so serviced for testing in the future.  Since the closing of the exportation market from Sligo, they have not been doing the extensive work that they had been doing up to then.  I welcome the making available of certain staff for the provision of this service at Doonally.</P>
    <P>I should like to see such a service in Athlone, also.  The provision of such facilities in An Foras Talúntais at Creagh in Mayo would service the Galway area and tie in with the one in the south.  Naturally, Senator Connaughton would like such a laboratory in Tuam but I must look after my own people. The Foras Talúntais research station at Creagh would be the ideal situation <Col N="1037" /> from where to synchronise with the Athlone, Sligo and Limerick laboratories.</P>
    <P>It is important for our people that we have immediate brucellosis eradication. It is a very dangerous disease and one that anyone unfortunate enough to contract will suffer from for the remainder of his life.  It is regrettable that many veterinary people and farmers contracted this disease through no fault of their own but simply by being in contact with it in their day-to-day chores.</P>
    <P>When regulations are being made by the Department, the people on the islands off the west coast are always forgotten.  I represent two large islands off the Mayo coast.  These island people must send samples away for testing, have vets in to examine their cattle and have the cattle hauled into boats and at a mart for sale within 30 days as from the beginning of the whole procedure.  In such cases some concessions should be made.  We went a long way in providing facilities in Mayo such as pens and catching crushes at Roonah Pier which services the two islands I have mentioned. The Department should make available some enclosure whereby these animals could be fed for the three days that they would be awaiting confirmation as to whether they are to be cleared for sale.</P>
    <P>There is some difficulty regarding warble fly dressing in these islands as well because of the problems involved in reaching the islands.  If there are three or four vets servicing an island, they are going in at various times.  I suggest that there be some co-operation with the Department's vet and the local vets in this regard with a view to having one vet service each island.  In this way all the herd on an island would be tested at the same time and, consequently, would all be ready for sale at the one time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to everyone concerned to co-operate with the Department in regard to all these matters.  I am confident that the farmers will co-operate as they have cooperated in the past.</P>
    <Col N="1038" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on this motion but, first, I should like to welcome the Minister to his new office.  I have every confidence that he will continue to promote the interests of the livestock trade not only commerically but health-wise.  I am sure that he has as much knowledge of the problems associated with the sale, transport and the health of animals in the west of Ireland as has anybody anywhere in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned the animal health problems that confront the Department, the trade and the producers are national problems and must be tackled on a national basis.  The circumstances associated with the production of animal products such as milk, butter or cheese may be taken individually from the very first stage of production.  Indeed, one might go back to the time of the birth of the animals. Unfortunately, farmers are not always as responsible as they should be in regard to taking the necessary precautions with their herds in relation to the prevention of disease.  In fairness, it must be said that in many cases this is due to circumstances over which the farmer has no control.  Very often he is the owner of an animal in a herd of perhaps ten, 12 or 15 cows.  He knows very well that as soon as one of his cows aborts and the matter is reported to a vet, an inspector will be sent from the Department to test all the animals in that herd.  The farmer knows that if a TB or brucellosis case is found, he is confronted with a problem in that his herd may be locked up.  He fears that circumstance and does not want to face up to it.  The result is, and has been, that he buries the foetus, continues to milk the cow, and forgets about this grave circumstance.  While that is happening, his neighbour's animals are infected.  As far as the herd owner is concerned, this disease is caused more through ignorance and fear than through any deliberate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this at animal health committee meetings and emphasised that a particular parish in County Longford became infected with tuberculosis and <Col N="1039" /> brucellosis.  That had been happening in many areas for a number of years.  The Department sent inspectors to carry out inspections.  I am not quite sure what the results were, but it appeared, for one reason or another, a whole area was allowed to become infected with these diseases and was not checked at any particular time.  That could have been a consequence of the practice by one, two or three farmers of the type to which I referred initially, not having an inspection, not reporting the abortion and TB being allowed to ravage not only one, but several herds.</P>
    <P>The haulage of cattle in trucks and trailers is rife in rural life.  These vehicles help spread TB and brucellosis throughout the country.  It is not unknown for people who have animals suffering from brucellosis to take them into factories.  The truck owner is not expected by law to wash, disinfect or do anything about the truck when he unloads these cattle.  This is another source by which disease is spread.  The truck driver may take healthy cattle to a mart and they may come in contact with infection. These are serious problems.  The incidence of tuberculosis has reduced considerably, and now brucellosis is the greatest infection among herds.  Apparently veterinary surgeons do not have the authority to carry out spot checks on suspected animals.  It is possible that a farmer unknowingly might sell an infected beast.  There are people who buy animals suffering from TB or brucellosis. They advertise in the public press that they are in a position to buy these animals.  It is well known that if those people came to a man's house they could pay him much more than he would get at a factory.  When that happens, what is the farmer to do?</P>
    <P>I am not mentioning this for the first time.  I mentioned it at animal health committee meetings.  As far as the veterinary profession are concerned, they want to stamp out this practice as rapidly as possible.  If the Department tolerate this&mdash;and I have brought this to the notice of the Minister's <Col N="1040" /> predecessor&mdash;how can we expect an immediate or even a distant clearing of brucellosis or TB?  These are the problems the Minister and the nation must tackle.  These are the problems farmers will have to be protected from. Whatever tightening up is done to make our herds free from tuberculosis and brucellosis it will have to ensure that there will be no possibility of somebody being able to buy a diseased animal and letting it out into his field with the possibility of infecting his neighbour's cattle.  This is a serious situation.  This is a matter the Minister should take immediate cognisance of for the purpose of making the country what we want it to be&mdash;that is, free of animal disease.</P>
    <P>There is no use presenting on television a very high-sounding advertisement telling the farmers to be certain lorries are not dirty, not to buy outside marts, and so on, because a man could buy cattle in the mart which had been carried by a lorry which had already carried infected animals.  The Department will have to apply themselves very vigorously to these problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The problem of brucellosis in animals is serious for farmers.  It can hurt not only their pockets but their health.  In certain parts of the country where these tests are carried out and levels of bacteria are found in the milk, this can result in a reduction in the price paid per gallon.  Stronger steps should be taken to stamp out this disease.  Where a person suffers this terrible loss because his herd is put down, he should be compensated financially rather than penalised.  It is well known that the Irish farmer will work more efficiently if he is compensated, but the same cannot be said if he knows he will be penalised.  This is a national issue.  Our greatest industry is at stake.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure as far as possible that the eradication of these diseases takes place as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this first opportunity as Minister for Agriculture to speak to this House.  I want to thank the <Col N="1041" /> Senators who have spoken so far for their very fine contributions to this debate and for their nice words of congratulations to me.  The motion as it reads to me calls on the Government to modify the disease eradication programme to alleviate severe hardship on farmers.  Except for the suggestion of a 60-day test rather than a 30-day test, which I will come to later, there have been no other proposals for modification in the scheme that are not already in train or being carried out.</P>
      <P>It is probably unnecessary to go back on the history of disease eradication in this country.  Suffice it to say that we have been 25 years endeavouring to eradicate bovine TB and we commenced brucellosis eradication in 1965.  The cost to the taxpayer has been roughly £140 million.  This is estimated to be equivalent to well over £300 million in terms of today's values.</P>
      <P>It is universally acknowledged that down through the years we did not get results commensurate with the enormous outlay of money, time and effort that went into the eradication campaign.  This led to a very radical review of the situation after this Government took office. This coincided with renewed anxiety in the European Community about the prevalence of disease, particularly in a few member states where incidence levels were very high.  This, of course, included Ireland.</P>
      <P>The outcome of this review was that we submitted to the EEC and got approval for a revised programme designed to speed up eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis here.  The main features of the programme were the introduction of a 30-day pre-movement testing which was, in fact, insisted upon by the EEC. Therefore, it is time that everybody involved in this business realised that it is pie in the sky to be talking about a 60-day test at present.  It is just not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other conditions were the immediate punching of reactors and their slaughter within 30 days, special attention to areas where the disease incidence was high, increased penalties for breaches of the <Col N="1042" /> regulations, and more rapid extension of the brucellosis eradication campaign.</P>
    <P>Since the accelerated programme commenced significant progress has been made.  In the round of testing completed in May, 1979 the herd incidence of TB was cut almost by half from 7.5 per cent to less than 4 per cent.  The animal incidence was also halved from 0.55 per cent to 0.25 per cent, the lowest figures since eradication began.</P>
    <P>Progress continues to be made in the current round of tests although not at the same dramatic pace.  So far the TB herd incidence is down to 3½ per cent and the animal incidence is also down.  The marginal improvement this year confirms that the final phase of eradicating TB will not be easily achieved.  The most difficult part of the job, getting the present 3 per cent down to the EEC standard of 0.2 per cent, is still ahead of us. There is no getting away from the fact that even now one herd in every 30 of those previously cleared is turning up reactors.  Obviously in this kind of situation there can be no argument whatsoever for a softer approach in this campaign. Indeed, when I met a number of farming bodies recently they were not calling for any relaxation of the present rules and regulations.  On the contrary, they pressed me very very hard for a more stringent and effective application of all the measures now in force.</P>
    <P>On the brucellosis side we are of course, at an earlier stage of the eradication effort.  Compulsory measures now cover 16 counties.  Kerry and Cork were the two most recent additions.  In the compulsory area generally, good progress is being made this year and, leaving out Cork, all counties show a gratifying reduction on last year's levels. Nevertheless, a few counties continue to have unacceptably high levels of brucellosis even after a number of test rounds.  Everything points to the need for more intensive efforts to get on top of the job in those counties.</P>
    <P>In the remaining counties I expect to be ready for full compulsory measures before very long.  The task facing us in those counties is a daunting one since <Col N="1043" /> one herd in every four in them has some degree of brucellosis infection.</P>
    <P>The 30-day test remains an elemental feature in the present eradication programme.  It does, undoubtedly, cause inconvenience at times, but it is certain that its value far outweighs any problems it might cause.  As many as 4,000 reactors altogether have already been turned up on the 30-day test. Without this test all these reactors and several thousand other animals from the same herds could be moving freely and spreading disease among clear herds around the country.</P>
    <P>It has been said before, and it is worth saying again, that for every seller there is a buyer.  Buyers of cattle here are entitled to go into the market secure in the knowledge that what they buy is safe. This is what the 30-day test is all about.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism&mdash;I have to accept that this was justified on occasions&mdash;about the time taken to get the test results back to farmers, but I do not accept that, as has been said by Senators today, that that situation now exists.  These difficulties have now been sorted out as far as the testing service in the laboratories is concerned.  It is my intention to see that herd owners should have adequate time, if possible at least 21 clear days, in which to sell their cattle. As I said publicly on other occasions the Department, and I particularly, want to know of any situation where a farmer has less than that amount of time to sell his cattle.  If such a situation exists we will make every effort to correct it.  The testing facilities have been expanded and will be further extended to ensure a better all-round service.  I have to say, of course, that delays can and do occur elsewhere, rather than at the laboratories.  It has been found, for example, that samples are not always posted on the day they are taken from the animals.  I appeal directly to the veterinary profession to bear in mind the interests of the herd owner who is waiting to sell his cattle.  I ask them to <Col N="1044" /> ensure that all samples are posted promptly, as far as possible on the day they are taken.  One of the things that farming bodies and others are constantly bringing to my attention is the filthy condition of lorries used to transport cattle to factories and marts.  Dirty lorries are a positive menace.  Senator O'Toole and other Senators have already referred to this.  Any Senator can see the risk from the lorry which today carry reactors to a factory and the next day goes unwashed on to farms to collect cattle for the mart. This must stop and I have given clear instructions to the staff concerned in my Department that they are to be totally ruthless in pursuit of the problem.  I say to farmers and mart owners that in their interest they should not allow lorries in that condition near their premises.  It is evident to me that farmers now recognise the real urgency of our disease problem; they realise that we must succeed in eradicating this problem.  If we do not, they know that it is the farming industry which will be the prime loser. Failure would mean exclusion of a lot of our produce from EEC markets.  Our colleagues in the community are only too well aware of our situation; we cannot expect that they will for ever extend the same degree of tolerance towards us as they have in the past.  We cannot afford to put our exports at risk.  We cannot afford to relax the eradication campaign. What we must do is get on with the job and complete it as rapidly as possible.  Then, and only then, can we relax.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made by Senators.  I will do my best to reply briefly to them.  Senator Connaughton raised the question of the Rose Bengal test.  It is not recognised by the EEC for export purposes; neither is it recognised for control of inter-herd movements under the EEC rules.  For those reasons it is not used here in any general way.  It is not a better test for diagnosing brucellosis than the internationally recognised serological test.  It is not a simple test that can be done anywhere, it is meant to be done under laboratory conditions and under very careful measurement and absolutely accurate <Col N="1045" /> timing.  It is very much a subjective test and different people reading it would get different results.  Widespread dispersal of the testing adds to the cost in terms of staff and equipment; its supervision would tie up a lot of veterinary manpower, and veterinary manpower is very scarce.  The Rose Bengal is a very good test for a quick diagnosis in cases where an abortion occurs or some other emergency demands an immediate result.  It is used at present in a number of district veterinary offices for this purpose and its use will be extended.  It is also proposed to try it out on a more general basis in a pilot area, probably in one county, at any rate.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton also referred to the kind of tuberculin that was and is used and said that there was not enough research into this question.  A variety of trials and research have been conducted under EEC auspices.  We had access to the results and, indeed, some of these experiments and trials were done in Ireland.  EEC research did not show that the Weybridge tuberculin was bad; it has succeeded in eradicating TB in Britain. The research did show that the Rotterdam tuberculin is better and it was for that reason that we switched last year to Rotterdam.  The results so far confirm that it is likely to have some advantage over the Weybridge product.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the Senator was the movement of calves.  We acknowledge that the risk from calves moving up the country from the south is a matter for concern to some farmers, but the information available to me suggests that the risk is minimal.  It is very difficult to test and control the movement of all calves; this is probably a refinement that will be desirable when we get diseases down to a much lower level. The minimal risk involved at present would not justify the very considerable amount of time and manpower that would be needed.  The question of annual testing was raised by Senator Connaughton and we agree totally with him that the minimum should be at least one year.  We now have an agreement with <Col N="1046" /> the Irish veterinary union to complete the present round in ten months.  This round started late, because of the months lost during the postal strike.  I was informed, no later than today, that we are on target for completion of this round at the end of April or early May.</P>
    <P>We have the thorny question of com pensation for reactors.  The present rates of compensation were fixed in 1978 and a hardship fund operates to help out those who suffer exceptional losses from disease.  In the case of TB, the present average number of reactors per infected herd is two.  This average conceals much more severe cases and the hardship fund is there to help those.  In areas where brucellosis testing is fairly well advanced, the average number of brucellosis reactors is less than two.  The vast majority of herd owners do not suffer severe losses in that situation; even those who do would obviously have a lot more to lose if the disease went unchecked.  The cost of disease eradication is already very high and farmers are being called on to pay a share of that cost.  In that situation it is difficult to justify increasing the reactor compensations.  Neither do we want to see, Senators have agreed, a situation where people make profit, or seek profit out of disease.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the provisional laboratory facilities in Athlone.  I have already said that, in addition to the announcements that I have made about the improvement in the situation in other areas, we were looking at this possibility; I hope to make some announcements about this in the not too distant future.  The Senator also made a very important point&mdash;and I have taken note of the points he did make&mdash;about the situation on some of our islands.</P>
    <P>Our very serious situation regarding the control and elimination of these two very serious diseases has become generally recognised.  It is the duty of all of us; Deputies, Senators, Government, farmers, vets and all concerned, to ensure every co-operation regarding speedy eradication of these two dreadful diseases.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of supporting this motion.  I welcome the Minister and am pleased to see him take this debate himself. I feel reassured at the points in his statement to the House.  I reiterate my belief in, and support for a disease-free status of our national herd.  I am conscious of the tremendous amount of work that has gone into the successive programmes over the years and sincerely implore all herd owners to co-operate fully not just to work to control or to comply with regulations in order to sell, but to make a determined effort to eradicate bovine TB and brucellosis from the national herd and from our farms once and for all.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the farmers and dealers and, indeed, the marts, indeed to all involved, to play a part and to play that part fully.  Nevertheless, I must express some disappointment at the manner in which the administration of the schemes have been carried out and the, to my mind, unnecessary hardship and inconvenience that many herd owners have been caused.  If we are to invoke the best response, the Minister must decentralise the administration of these schemes even more than he has.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should at least have a district veterinary office in every county.  The Minister gave an undertaking that farmers would have 21 days in which to sell their cattle and that gives them time to exhibit their cattle at marts or at fairs.  This is quite an advancement and I accept the Minister's statement.  Nevertheless, my experience is that in order to get cards out or to have cards corrected one has to go to the veterinary office which is 50 or 60 miles away.  Therefore each county is entitled to that measure of decentralisation.  We must remember that, taking the industry as a whole, many farmers at present are in the higher age bracket and it is a problem even to get to the veterinary office. I am glad that the Minister has made such a determined effort to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But my own last test was in October and I ended up with two days out of the <Col N="1048" /> 30 in which to sell even though I went to Poplar Square twice.  While the staff there are very reasonable and they do a good job, that is just one farmer's personal experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to accept the Minister's undertaking and I will be watching out for the next full herd test which will be due soon as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>Farmers are at present going through a period of great uncertainty.  This has been added to by the oscillation of mart prices in the last few weeks.  There was an announcement a few weeks ago that the prices had gone up a ½p a pound in the midlands.  That does not cheer up a lot of the farmers.  I have heard people say that it is costing up to £18 or £19 to sell a bullock at present.  This is something that we should not lose sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drafting regulations I hope that the Minister and his senior officials will always bear in mind that the vast majority of the farmers are honest and decent people who try to do a good job.  So far as the people who would take shortcuts or deliberately try to defraud the system and to contravene the regulations are concerned, the penalties cannot be high enough and we must tackle this problem once and for all.  Having said that, the greatest hardship that can befall a farmer here at present is to be locked up with the double test and that can now happen so easily.  Finance is costing at least 18 per cent and the national average return on capital invested in agriculture is 2 per cent.  The majority of farmers in this country are small farmers, the highest category being those with under 40 acres, and for them to have their herds locked up and to have to, perhaps, purchase additional feed such as milkstuff or just ordinary bales of hay&mdash;and bales of barley straw were going 70p a bale in the last few weeks&mdash;and also service a loan from the ACC or from the banks at 18 per cent or even more, is a considerable hardship. <Col N="1049" /> Therefore I would like to join with my colleagues, Senators Connaughton and O'Brien, in asking the Minister wherever possible to expedite the payment of all grants, not only in relation to this scheme but across the board.  I know from my own experience that a lot of people are facing a rather difficult time and I am sure that the farmers, for their part will co-operate with the Minister and with the Department.</P>
    <P>I had thought that the Minister would be able to give us an idea of when he would hope that this present campaign would come to a successful conclusion. It would be nice if we could look forward to a successful conclusion in two or three or five years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would encourage people to put that extra bit of work into it.  I wish the Minister success in his undertaking and I am glad that he has attended the House this evening.  It indicates the high priority he is allocating to the whole problem of disease eradication in his administration.  Too many people in the country do not seriously think on the problems that would face us if an important export industry, such as the cattle trade, were to be further handicapped by the lack of disease-free status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the Department's advertising scheme on television. That could be extended a little.  It is difficult to get any message across and this advertising is helpful.  But it could go a little further and it would be money well spent because there are many people who do not think deeply enough on that problem.  When a notice comes asking for a test, perhaps it is the annual test, people look on it as a chore and a problem.  There are considerable numbers of farmers who have staff problems in getting in their cattle and, with the brucellosis.  TB and, possibly, the warble schemes, when it comes to the second or third test each year the cattle can become extremely difficult to handle. <Col N="1050" /> When one considers that the vast majority of farmers are in the higher age bracket and that it is very difficult in some places to get casual labour, it is a problem.  I hope the Minister will leave no stone unturned in looking for new ways of doing the job, perhaps trying new vaccines.  It is possible in the EEC. With the Minister and his senior staff going abroad, they can see and compare procedures and the rate of progress achieved in other countries although they are under different conditions. Nevertheless we should be brave enough to try different ways to ensure that we find the quickest and the best possible way to enhance the value of our national herd through a disease-free status.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and his Department success and I hope he will be able to get the full support of the entire community in doing this job.  It is not just a matter for the farmers and the Minister, it is the work of the nation and I hope people will look on it as being that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish, like my colleagues on both sides of the House, to congratulate the new Minister on his elevation to what, in my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues on both sides of the House on the Agricultural Panel, is the most important Ministry as far as this country is concerned.  I would especially like to wish him well and many years of success in that job.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion before the House, it is the first motion of its type that I have seen here since I became a Senator.  We should have more motions on matters affecting our agricultural industry which after all is the prime industry of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Connaughton, O'Brien and Howard, who put down the motion, did so at a time before the alterations had been made by the Minister with regard to the period between testing and also with regard to the other changes which he made.  I feel that the introduction of the 30-day test provided the farming community with an opportunity to safeguard themselves against the dangers of importing into their herds diseased animals.  Before that, and especially <Col N="1051" /> during the period of non-testing by the veterinary surgeons, farmers were forced to buy at public marts animals which might not have been tested.  I personally had that experience on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The question of hardship is mentioned in the motion but when I look back to those days I think of the hardship imposed on farmers because animals that were purchased for export during that period were detained in the marts and tested by the purchaser at the farmer's expense, because he no doubt deducted during that period the cost of testing and storage for those cattle prior to their being moved from the marts.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton said he objects to on-farm sales of livestock.  He should realise this is one of the surest ways of tracing where an animal has gone if it carries disease with it.  As he is well aware, under the regulations a farmer is not entitled to move cattle from one farm to another without having a 30-day pre-movement test.  If he does so he is infringing the law and is liable to be punished, in my opinion.  The 60-day test as introduced originally was a test to bring about the upgrading of our disease standards.  Our disease standards had been allowed to slip for a number of years.  The fact is that routine testing, which started originally with a pilot scheme in County Tipperary in 1950, had reached the stage where the incidence of TB had been reduced to in the region of 4 to 5 per cent but was coming no lower and had come no lower for a number of years.  To get down to the EEC requirement of 0.2 per cent, the Minister had the courage in conjunction with his veterinary staff in the Department to set about tackling the problem, That they did.  Under the change introduced by the new Minister the waiting period is reduced from 30 days&mdash;you had to wait 30 more days before you could re-test&mdash;to 15 days.  The world standard laid down that the minimum period between testing for TB can only be 42 days.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> Senator Connaughton suggested that a longer period could be allowed and that possibly the extension would mean the validity of the test could be explored. If he looks back to the statement issued by the previous Minister on 1 November with regard to cattle for export from this country he will see that Britain was no longer prepared to accept cattle unless they had a 30-day test prior to export. This, under severe interpretation, is the reason why 30 days should and must be the period between tests.  If the other situation were to be allowed you would have twice as much hardship imposed on farmers because you would have exporters buying cattle and when they check their cards in the office they would immediately refuse to pay for or take the cattle.  The net result would be a telegram to the farmer on the following day to collect his stock.  Something no farmer wants is a telegram the following day to collect something that he feels he has sold.</P>
    <P>With regard to delays I feel the Minister should examine the possibility of having the vets under order to have the tuberculin test report in the veterinary office within 48 hours of testing in cases where cards have to be issued.  If that was done I have no doubt that cards could be back to the farmer, where only TB was involved, within four to five days of the date of the test.</P>
    <P>I have found from my own experience of the veterinary office in Sligo that the staff and the field men there are more than willing to help farmers who wish to sell cattle.  They go to no ends of trouble to see to it that cards are sent to the marts where the farmer is going to sell his cattle.  This I feel is one way to help to get rid of the delays and the hardship being caused to farmers.  There have been cases where vets have not sent in the test report for ten to 14 days.  That is not the Minister's fault nor is it his officials' fault.  The fault lies with the veterinary practitioners who do the test.  I feel that this should be brought to the notice of the vets through the Veterinary Union with a request that they send them in within 48 hours.  I feel that two days is <Col N="1053" /> sufficient to give any vet time to have his returns at least in the post to the district veterinary office.</P>
    <P>With regard to the brucellosis situation, blood from all over the country previously had to come to the Thorndale laboratory in Dublin, but now the Minister has extended the facility to the various areas.  I would especially like to welcome the announcement which he made recently on testing facilities at the veterinary laboratory in Sligo for farmers in the north west.  This is a major step forward and he is to be complimented on it as a way of doing away with the hardship element which had been caused due to blood having to be sent to Dublin and possibly having to await its turn in the queue in the Thorndale laboratory before it was tested.</P>
    <P>This motion is a good one, a motion with which, had it come six or eight weeks ago.  I would have agreed more. The new Minister has a direct interest in the livestock farmers of this country and in the livestock exporters and dealers and has made a determined effort to ease the hardship on farmers and others directly involved in livestock production. No doubt he will be prepared to give us his full commitment for the next two years and say to us that by 1982 we will not be told that our cattle, due to the health qualification, are not suitable for export live.  As far as I am concerned, you must have the competition between both the meat factories and the live exporters to see to it that farmers get the maximum price for their produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a feeling of not inconsiderable trepidation that I rise to speak on this motion.  Given the very full membership from the Agricultural Panel in the Seanad at the moment and the agricultural expertise which is clearly here, I will speak for only a minute or two.  I describe myself as an outsider who has had cause in the past to hear farmers speak of the difficulties that they experienced, and more so as a legal practitioner who has been involved in a couple of cases relating to prosecutions under the Acts and regulations.  I have had <Col N="1054" /> to sit in court and listen to some of the cases that have gone on.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Ellis put his finger on the point when he said there have been times in the past 25 years when the regulations have not been enforced.  It is a hit and miss business.  Department of ficials are under pressure to do something about this and many farmers feel they are being vindictive because the eradication of bovine diseases has not been pursued consistently and because the prosecutions that have been brought appear to have been brought on a selective basis.  I do not say that has been the case but it is the opinion of farmers as a result of the stop/go policy in the Department over 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one remembers that £300 million in present-day money terms has been spent over that period it is appalling that we have not advanced the cause of disease eradication in any significant way.  I have been horrified and appalled listening to court cases where Department officials have had to admit that they ignored regulations.  I recall one case in which my firm were involved where I heard a Department inspector admit in court that in order to re-test beasts in a locked-up herd on an outside farm they brought these cattle to the yard of a neighbour, who was clear, to use the testing facilities that he had, namely a good chute.  That was in the course of prosecuting a farmer who to my knowledge had advanced the scheme in every way he could since its commencement but who over the years had become disillusioned with the stop/go policy of the Department and also with what he felt was the vindictive approach of some Department officials.  I was horrified to hear that.  There is a principle in equity&mdash;Senator Ryan may contradict me if I misquote it&mdash;which says. &ldquo;He who comes to equity must come with clean hands&rdquo;, but on that day Department officials came to the court with &ldquo;filthy hands&rdquo; to prosecute somebody who had committed one alleged misdeed.  That case was very widely publicised at the time in the national and farming papers.  After that <Col N="1055" /> many people came to me and expressed the view that they felt Department officials were sometimes vindictive and that farmers did not trust them.  Given that atmosphere of ill-will, it is easy to understand why £300 million in present-day money terms has been spent without any success.</P>
    <P>The regulations under the Bovine Diseases Eradication Acts are so complex that some Department officials do not understand them.  I heard from a colleague of a case in Birr District Court recently in which the claim was made that two articles of recently passed regulations were contradictory.  The Department prosecuted under one regulation and in fact the defence was put that if another regulation had been followed it would have been quite impossible to comply with the regulation that the particular farmer was being charged with breaking.  Unfortunately I was unable to contact the solicitor who had carriage of that case but I propose to contact him and I will write to the Department about it.  I appreciate that many of these regulations are extremely difficult to draft, that it is a very technical area, but it is important that events like this do not happen.  One sees apparent blunders being made in court by the Department but I do not blame the Department officials because it is a difficult problem.  There is such pressure now to do things right that there is a danger that many prosecutions will be brought to court where the proofs will be inadequate or where Department officials will be seen to have taken shortcuts. If farmers see this&mdash;these cases are headlined in farming papers and in local papers&mdash;they will begin to think that the whole thing is a cod.  They feel when they are prosecuted for some minor breach of regulations that the Department are coming down heavy on them in order to show that they are doing something. This is an area in which the Department need to concentrate very heavily.  They should ask officials to go out of their way to show their bona fides and their interest in co-operating with farmers.  I <Col N="1056" /> know that the Minister is anxious to make his mark in his Department in this particular sphere and it is in a genuine spirit of goodwill that I make what may appear to be very critical remarks.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me join with the other Senators in wishing the Minister a very happy stay in his Department.  I hope it will not be too long a stay but as long as Fianna Fáil stay in Government, I have every faith that he will do a good job there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let this occasion go without raising a point which has bothered me.  I welcome the new Minister for Agriculture to the House and wish him the very best in his new responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I have always had tremendous regard for the work done by the various State institutions working in the agriculture sector, for instance, An Foras Talúntais and, of course, the Department of Agriculture.  Ireland is recognised worldwide as an authority in this area for the technological achievements it has produced in agriculture and in the store of knowledge that exists in this country about agriculture and agricultural development.  We have been hearing in this debate of our difficulty to apply the knowledge in relation to the eradication of diseases in our herds.  This is one of the main arms of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did a simple sum about a year-and-a-half ago and I found a rather interesting fact.  I am always worried that in this country technologists do not seem to get into positions of policy responsibility and it is only in latter years that this has begun to happen.  I am always keeping an eye on the number of technologists working in particular areas as opposed to the number of administrators. Over the years we seem to have rapid expansion of administrative Departments, for instance, the Department of the Public Service.  The sum I did was to add up the total of agricultural type animals, cattle and so on and divide it by the total number of veterinary surgeons in the country and I compared this with other European <Col N="1057" /> countries.  I found that Ireland has a third fewer veterinary surgeons than other countries.  This worries me and I would like the Minister to have a look at it.  It appears we have not a sufficient number of veterinary surgeons and yet we are spending all this money on disease eradication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested some time to hear from the Minister as to whether he agrees with this conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the Minister for his contribution to the debate.  His statement was a bit like the curate's egg, good in spots and bad in spots.  I am delighted to know that the Rose Bengal test is being closely examined. It is obviously going to be applied to a county.  Like the Rotterdam tubercular test, it might have a lot of uses in this country.  We shall all be looking forward to what might happen.  Even if it does not fit the bill, certainly we will have it tried out on a scale that will ensure the end of debate once and for all as to whether it is suitable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind what Senator Ellis had to say about the former Minister&mdash;that he turned down the idea of a reduction in the number of days from 60 to 42&mdash;I make the same point to the present Minister.  I adhere to my view.  The Minister made a very clear announcement that there would be no change in regard to the 30-day test.  He also made the statement that all the farming organisations he had met were adamant that he should stick to his guns.  I want to put on record here that, if there happened to be an IFA man, or any ICMSA man, on the deputation west of the Shannon, he would not be happy about the 30-day test.  Perhaps I am meeting a very different type of farmer or individual who decides to speak only to me against the 30-day test.  However, after this absolute pronouncement by the Minister, I believe nothing can be done about it.  But it should be borne in mind <Col N="1058" /> that I heard the Minister's predecessor say that absolutely nothing could be done about a reduction in the days; yet the present Minister could do so. Perhaps in ensuing months and in the next year it will be found that we are getting on top of this.</P>
    <P>I knew that something different would have to be done, certainly a more fundamental job than was being done on the yearly test,&mdash;but to think that we had to go to such extremes.  It must be recognised that there is a certain section of the community in the midlands and so on buying cattle from the west, and certainly it will suit them that we have a 30-day test.  The point I am making is that the Bill is unfair to our small cattle producers.  I will stand on any platform and contend that that is what the small producers are talking about tonight; whether or not it reaches anybody else's ears, I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Senator should explain to them what disease eradication means.  In all honesty, the Senator should do that.  Nobody likes the inconvenience of it, but it has to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that it is over-penalising a certain section, and there would be many not too far from Sligo who would not like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be delighted to talk to them and explain it at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as the next man and more anxious than most, as my record will show, to ensure that things be done properly.  But this has been the subject of a joke.  The national Exchequer cannot uphold it, and there will be a rebellion against it.  I am disappointed that that is the outcome because obviously it is an absolute official &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any extension of the 30-day test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention one matter of which the Minister might take note and which is of great importance to any farmer it might affect.  Take a case of blood sampling <Col N="1059" /> where the blood clots.  Take the example of a farmer with five heifers.  The blood is sent to Thorndale and it turns out that one of the samples clots.  As far as I am aware that blood has to be retaken and sent back before an absolute decision is given on the other four animals.  Where the herd happened to be clear for a year or two before that, where the other four animals passed the test, I would assume that all that should be missing from the test should be that particular animal, and the Department should allow that farmer sell the remaining four.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I am extremely thankful to the Minister for his view, indeed his guarantee, that farmers will have their tests back allowing them a 21-day selling period.  I have several names of people, admittedly not in the last fortnight or three weeks but before, who would be nowhere near that.  Unless the regionalisation programme continues and is accelerated when there are a lot more cattle in the south being tested, as the pre-intensive campaign continues, my fear is that Thorndale will get jammed. If that happens, and if we encounter any more postal problems, then we will be in great difficulty.  I am very thankful to the Minister for his assurance that he will oversee the situation and that he would like the name <Col N="1060" /> forwarded of any farmer who does not get his results back in a week or nine days.  That is a reasonable commitment on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not particularly agree with the Minister's view on calves from the south. It would be very difficult to police.  I would plead with the Minister in regard to anybody selling calves out of a locked-up herd&mdash;whether the disease be brucellosis or TB in the south&mdash;to ensure that there be some identification on such calves.  If one takes a clear area such as we have now in the west, even if there is only a remote possibility that a calf from an infected herd could bring a very small amount of disease with him, it could constitute the nucleus of a flare-up. Indeed, perhaps that is the reason why some counties clear heretofore experienced such a flare-up in disease.</P>
      <P>This has been a good debate.  A lot of the things that should be said were said. I am very disappointed about the 30-day test, a view I hold firmly.  On other matters I congratulate the Minister on his stand.  I should think that a lot of farmers will feel that much happier tonight, being somewhat more assured as they forge ahead.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
