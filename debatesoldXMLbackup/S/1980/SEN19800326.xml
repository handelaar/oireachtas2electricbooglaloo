      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1980,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was <Col N="1385" /> laid before Seanad Éireann on 19 March 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be recalled that on 29 March 1977, when the Second Stage of the Worker Participation Bill was being moved in Seanad Éireann the House was told that it was not possible at that time to determine, in advance, the sizes of the reconstituted State boards in question. The view was that it would not be appropriate at that stage to prescribe board sizes in the Bill as it could limit the discretion of the Government Ministers concerned.  It was felt to be desirable and appropriate that the Ministers should have discretion in determining the size of the boards to take account of the appointments to the boards of members elected by employees.  The solution adopted was to allow the new board sizes to be prescribed at a later stage by affirmative order.</P>
      <P>For that purpose section 23 of the Act empowers the Minister for Labour, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and other appropriate Ministers, to prescribe by order&mdash;in relation to each of the State bodies designated in the Act&mdash;the number of members or directors of the reconstituted boards, including the number of employees to be appointed following an election by the work force.  Where the total number is a multiple of three, elected representatives must constitute one-third; otherwise the proportion of elected representatives must be rounded upwards to the number which is next above one-third.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of section 4 (4) of the Act, a draft of any order to be made under section 23 requires the prior approval of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution of each House.  The intention behind that provision was to ensure that there would be no diminution of the authority or responsibility of the Oireachtas in determining the appropriate size of the State boards concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present order, which has been laid before the House in draft is designed to <Col N="1386" /> comply with the requirements of section 23 of the Act in so far as two of the seven State bodies are concerned&mdash;Aer Lingus and Córas Iompair Éireann.  The effect of the proposed order is that, as from the date on which it is made, the size of the boards of these bodies will be Fixed at 12 members, of which four&mdash;that is to say, one-third of the total&mdash;will be elected by the workers for appointment under the Act.  This will standardise the increase in the board sizes of all designated bodies as a previous draft order was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in July 1978 in respect of the other Five State companies.</P>
    <P>I have also included in the draft order provision for the similar alteration of the board of Aerlinte as required under section 28 of the Act.  This section, which was incorporated into the Bill on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann on 26 January 1977 stipulates that employees elected to the Aer Lingus Board are to be appointed to the board of Aerlinte also.  This arrangement is necessary because even though Aer Lingus and Aerlinte are two separate legal entities, There is a long-standing procedural arrangement whereby the boards of the two companies meet jointly and operate as one enterprise.  In effect it provides that where, under section 15, the Minister for Transport appoints a successful candidate to the board of Aer Lingus he must at the same time appoint that person to the board of Aerlinte.</P>
    <P>Senators will be pleased to note that with the appointment of the successful candidates in Aer Lingus and CIE following the forthcoming elections, the scheme will be fully implemented in all seven designed State bodies.</P>
    <P>I believe that the introduction of employee directors has brought some positive elements into the operations of those companies where elections have already taken place.  I am continuing to have the operation of the Act and its developments monitored and have arranged, with the active co-operation of both the ICTU and FUE, to have a report from the European Foundation <Col N="1387" /> for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in association with the Irish Productivity Centre, on the impact and effectiveness of the legislation. The information gained from this project will be particularly useful in developing future policy in this area and extending the scope of the Act to other State Bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea and the principle of worker participation in State bodies is something that has long been discussed in this country and it was the subject of many reports and debates before it was finally implemented in 1977.  It is good to see that this scheme now will be implemented in the seven designated bodies as they were introduced to us by the Minister in 1977.</P>
      <P>Greater involvement by workers in industry is a matter which has received much discussion and deliberation in recent years, particularly due to the feeling that a certain remoteness and a drifting apart between employers and employees was something which had to be curbed. There was also the feeling that it was necessary to give a greater sense of fulfilment to employees, that they should be involved to some extent in decision making particularly in very large companies. In welcoming this order which will result in the scheme as originally outlined being implemented in the seven designated State bodies, I would have liked the Minister to have given some indication of the results to date of the experiences of the other five designated State bodies which have had the experience of this worker participation.  I note that a report is to be formulated on the impact and effectiveness of this legislation.  I hope that this will be forthcoming at a very early date.  I am interested to know if work on this report has already commenced, if discussions on it by the various bodies represented in the compilation of that report have commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been felt in very many quarters that worker participation is something which should be extended outside the public sphere into very many of our large private industries.  I believe that we <Col N="1388" /> should first of all see what the experience is in regard to these State bodies before any further extension of the idea is sought.  Worker involvement at decision-making level, on the shop floor level and particularly on the board of directors is something which has become a fact of life in very many other countries.  We are in the infancy stage of the matter and we should find out as much as possible from the limited experience since 1977 of its operation and see whether the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. I know that it is a very difficult matter to break down that remote difference or gulf which may exist between employers and employees.  It may be psychological or it may well be as a result of the structures in very many other large State bodies.  But broken down it will have to be because it is necessary that there should be a greater feeling of worker involvement and participation at all stages of the operations of very large bodies.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this order I look forward to the Minister informing us as to whether the report has already been commenced by the bodies concerned. Perhaps he might give some indication as regards the effectiveness of the particpation which has been experienced to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this order which standardises the number at 12 of the members of all the seven designated bodies of which one-third will be worker-directors.  Secondly, it makes provision for the next step, to apply the Worker Participation Act to Aer Lingus and CIE.</P>
      <P>The Worker Participation Act represents a positive step by the Government in promoting participation by workers in decision-making.  It is a relatively modest but nonetheless important start in this field which should act as a stimulus to the social partners to engage in more extensive participative structures which need to be developed below board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a few remarks on the role of worker-directors.  While certain conflicts may arise because worker-directors are concerned primarily about <Col N="1389" /> their fellow-workers, it can be validly said that this situation is virtually the same as a member of a board who represents a particular group of shareholders. It seems to be both sensible and legitimate that worker-directors should represent worker interests on boards in addition to the range of other functions expected of all directors.  The company of today is made up of several interdependent interest groups.  The role of a board as a representational body deals to some degree with the conflicting interests of employees, shareholders, customers and the community at large. The idea of operating in the company's overall interest, of course, must prevail and all directors should act under that assumption.</P>
    <P>Worker directors, because of their considerable knowledge and practical experience of their organisation have much to contribute to policy making which is a primary function of a board. However, it must be said that major decisions affecting worker conditions are made by management.  While collective bargaining goes a long way towards joint decision-making on pay and conditions, there still remains a compelling need for managements to provide more information to their employees about their organisations.  Therefore, I suggest that it behoves management to take worker representatives, including worker directors, into their confidence on the sharing of relevant information.  In Germany they have many years experience of workers on boards and, I understand, that the worker directors already elected to our five State-sponsored bodies visited Germany last year where the vital importance of reporting back to their fellow workers was stressed.</P>
    <P>An agreed structure for communication between the worker directors and the electorate is clearly a top priority deserving of constant attention.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour in particular have repeatedly made it known that they regard better industrial relations as a top national priority.  The Minister is to be commended for arranging <Col N="1390" /> with the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions a monitoring exercise associated with the Irish Productivity Centre to assess the impact and effectiveness of this legislation. Particapative measures have the potential to reduce conflict and to promote co-operation in industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by expressing the hope that in the longer-term the adoption of more participative structures will lead to improved industrial relations and more commitment by workers to their jobs with consequential improvements in productivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement introducing the motion on this draft order, the Minister referred to the debate which took place in the Seanad on the Bill which then became Worker Participation (State Enterprise) Act, 1977.  That Bill was passed through both Houses in March 1977, three years ago.  I had hoped that the Minister might have some explanation to offer this House of why it has taken three full years for a draft order to come before this House for approval setting out the size of the boards and the number of worker directors who will be elected to them.  I think an explanation is warranted.  I am quite prepared to accept that there may have been a number of difficulties both on the management and on the worker side but we should know what is the Minister's attitude.  I would say, frankly, that if the Minister had been Deputy Michael O'Leary there would have been definite pressure to see that the necessary agreement was reached between both sides of industry and to have the order brought before us at least when a previous order in relation to the other five State-sponsored bodies was brought in July 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was being debated in the Seanad, it is interesting to note that the then leader of the Fianna Fáil group, who is now the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was critical of the Bill as only being a tentative step. I quote from that debate, in Volume 86, column 479 of the Seanad Official <Col N="1391" /> Report where the then Senator Lenihan said:</P>
    <P>I go along fully with the thinking involved in worker participation.  I would suggest only, and I appreciate that this is a start so far as Ireland is concerned, that this not be regarded as the conclusion in the matter, that this is really a very tentative, initial type of Bill, and that much more needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>He went on then to emphasise the need for further development in worker participation, extension to the private sector, development of works councils and so on.  If that were to be a widely shared view, surely more effort would have been made to implement the Act once it had been passed and to get agreement across the board in order that this draft order could have come before us not later than July 1978 when the order was made in relation to the other five enterprises.  I say this because it appears to me from the Minister's brief speech that there is now going to be a further learning experience before any other steps may be taken in the area of worker participation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the operation of the Act and its developments are being monitored.  He said he has arranged for a report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and, like Senator Hillery, I welcome this.  It is very appropriate and useful that that body should monitor it.  The Minister says that this report will look at the impact and effectiveness of the legislation, that the information gained from this project will be particularly useful in developing future policy in this area and extending the scope of the Act to other State bodies.  We have no experiences as yet of two of the seven State enterprises because they have not had a structure so that the worker-directors could be elected to the board.  They are only at the beginning of that process now.</P>
    <P>Apart from seeking more information from the Minister as to why it took three years to bring in this draft order, perhaps he might also tell us when he anticipates <Col N="1392" /> receiving the report of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  Will it now have to wait until these two enterprises, Aer Lingus and CIE, have held elections of the worker-directors to the boards and nominated the other members of the boards?  Will it have to wait until there is then a further year of experience of that, or can we expect that the report of the foundation will be available before that? When the report of the foundation is submitted to the Government, is it the intention to publish and make available to Members of the Oireachtas copies of that report?</P>
    <P>It also would be appropriate to seek from the Minister some broader statement of his own attitude towards worker participation, not only towards a further extension of it in the public sector to further State enterprises, but also to know if it is his intention to introduce legislation seeking to create worker participation in the private sector.  In this context it is extremely important to reflect on the kind of country we are, to reflect on the youth of our workers, and to realise that we need not only greater progress in industrial relations but also the kind of structures which will give to a younger and better educated and perhaps more demanding work force the opportunity to contribute much more actively to the development of the company structures and the enterprises to which they contribute through their labour.  This is not something that can be put on the shelf for a number of years until there is a report from the European Foundation.  It ought to be an active part of Government policy to monitor the experiences of this Act.  Even when it was being debated in the Oireachtas, it was realised that it was only a tentative and limited first step.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that three years later we are still only considering an order for the board structures for two of those State enterprises.  This has been very slow progress indeed and I hope it has been more because of unforeseen and particularly difficult circumstances in getting agreement on the boards and <Col N="1393" /> that it does not show a lack of political will by the Government to press ahead both in the State sector and the private sector with worker participation.  In view of very long time lag I am disappointed that the Minister has not chosen in his opening statement to explain the circumstances. I hope that he will do so in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>No one would quarrel with the basic principle underlying this legislation, the right of workers to participate in decision-making.  But the question is, is this the right way to do it? Worker participation on the board is ineffective if the worker is not already represented at all levels in the structure of the enterprise.  If he is not participating at all levels, then putting him on the board is merely putting him out on a limb in isolation.</P>
      <P>The fact that the trade union members elect the candidates to the boards will not automatically ensure effective worker participation.  It will not have this effect unless we can create conditions which will ensure the best possible leadership at all levels of the trade union structure and also ensure that these leaders will have available to them expert technological assistance and economic, statistical, legal and other data to enable them to discharge their functions in a way that will ensure the greatest benefits, first of all to their members, then to the enterprise or service in which they are employed and, finally and consequentially, to the society in which they function. However, the development of effective worker participation on corporate boards is encouraging, as is the trend towards detailed discussions on social, economic and fiscal policies at the highest level between trade union leaders and members of the Government.  This will increasingly give to the trade union the power they should wield effectively in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it is necessary to monitor and examine the effect of worker participation on the boards of semi-State bodies, in particular to see if it has had any effect <Col N="1394" /> on industrial relations within those companies.  Effective worker participation on the board and at all levels should lead to an improvement in industrial relations.  It should also lead to a basic reappraisal of the role and function of semi-State bodies in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this draft order which in effect merely completes the Government's role for the present in the Worker Participation Act.  The election of worker-directors will add a new dimension to the work and activities of these boards.  It should result in a far greater understanding and co-operation between all interests which would be, of course, to the benefit not only of workers and management but the public at large.</P>
      <P>As the order relates only to the numerical strength of worker-directors, I take it it is not in order at this stage to refer to other provisions of the Principal Act but perhaps I can ask the Minister when he intends to consider the extension of the Worker Participation Act to all State companies.  The extension of the Act to all State companies and semi-State companies would be good for the community at large and for management-labour relations.  In particular, the extension of the Act to the RTE Authority will produce more than normal results.  I do not want to go into this in detail but the impartiality of RTE has been questioned in political quarters from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to say that as a former member of the Authority, I never experienced any partiality or any question of the Government of the day attempting to dictate to RTE.  However, perhaps I am out of order in discussing this.  I would like to hear from the Minister if he intends at an early date to extend the operation of the Act to other State interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of his speech the Minister made reference to the role of the Irish Productivity Centre and <Col N="1395" /> perhaps I am in order in asking for a little information about this aspect of the matter.  The national understanding provided that certain additional moneys would be forthcoming to the Irish Productivity Centre in order to enable them to develop their work and expand their activities in this direction.  It may well be that there is some misunderstanding about the actual terms of the national understanding in this respect but no additional funds have been forthcoming.  I am not asking the Minister to reply to this at the moment because I understand that the centre will be taking it up with him by way of correspondence and otherwise.  I am simply giving notice that the matter is under examination and I would welcome any observations he has to make at a later date if he is unable to reply positively at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally this measure must be welcomed.  Unlike my colleague, I would not quibble too much about the time factor because there has not been any great pressure from the trade union movement to have it extended very rapidly.  Possibly they wanted to see whether a pattern would develop.  To some extent I think that some of the delay is understandable.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, the existing attitude of management and labour towards each other is still very much one of mistrust in many cases.  Therefore, we must encourage any measure that will go towards changing this attitude to one of trust.  Certainly it will not remove the antagonism, the coercion and the resistance that exists on both sides, but it will go a long way towards it.  Mutual confidence, real justice and constructive goodwill can emerge eventually but not just by worker participation at board level alone.  The order will lead to progress, and indeed progress has been made already.  We can look forward to some progress towards changing the militancy of both sides, of the bosses and the workers, because the militancy is there on both sides.  Hopefully this will turn to co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> It is a very good beginning but it is a small step when one thinks of the major tasks ahead with regard to worker participation. We will never get near to solving or dealing with the problems of industrial relations merely by putting a few people on the board of a company because the board is still remote from the shop floor.  The other structures, as Senator Cassidy pointed out, have to be taken care of as well.  Many changes in organisation and so on will have to be considered.  If we want to give industrial relations a real chance of developing, and to develop an in-dwelling spirit everywhere about this matter, it will take a lot more than just a few people from the shop floor participating at board level.  Welcome though the move is, I must make that point very strongly.  I say that because to infuse a new spirit into industry or producers of any kind, all levels will have to participate at shop floor level in an informative, consultative and decision-making way.  There is nothing extraordinary about having somebody at board level if there is not somebody in the decision-making process at management level or if there is not some effective role at middle management level.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of people sounding off about industrial relations.  This is a many sided thing.  It is not as simple a subject as people seem to imagine.  The problems did not grow up easily and they will not go away easily by putting somebody on a board.  If we are to get an intelligent understanding of industrial relations there are a great number of factors to be considered.  They are of great magnitude, and a lot of forces have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We have the Government involved, we have education, opinion, discovery and invention, all of which affect industrial relations.  Placing one or two workers on the boards of State companies will not, even though it is a significant development, bring about the desired effects in industrial relations. However, it is a significant step in recognising that the work force must be <Col N="1397" /> involved in the decision-making process. I hope that the extra appointments now will, in fact, develop a pattern that has been shown by the participation in the ESB and so forth, where they have already been appointed for the past few years.</P>
    <P>I want to say something on a point that Senator Hillery raised.  There may be some confusion about it.  He made the point about the workers on the board taking up workers' interests as well as board interests.  If you are on the board you are on the board and you are dealing with the board's interests and it is a joint function.  I know that is what the Senator meant, but the fact is that it could be misinterpreted.  The reason I say there is a danger of it being misinterpreted is that somebody may say that the only people who have the right to negotiate with the companies are the trade unions and not the people on the board from the trade unions.  It is a small point but nevertheless it can be taken out of context.  I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction.  We have a long, hard road ahead of us but the sooner we get started on it the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this order providing for worker participation on the boards of two State companies.  I imagine it will be three because Aerlínte are involved with Aer Lingus as well.  I believe that it is a positive step in the right direction and time will show that benefits will flow from this arrangement. I accept that it is useful and satisfactory that we have the number standardised at 12 on the boards concerned and that there is a guarantee of one-third of the directors being drawn from the workers through an election machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there will be very many good advantages from having worker participation on the boards of the companies concerned.  The involvement the work force will feel, through having direct representations on the boards, must be beneficial.  There will be a better understanding of the problems that face certain companies and the resolution of <Col N="1398" /> these problems will be shared by a greater body of people.  I hope that it will lead to a smoother arrangement all around and, certainly, a better relationship between all the elements that compose the companies that are involved.</P>
    <P>I hope also that it will lead to a more open attitude by the management of the State bodies concerned, because some of the problems that we have seen arise on various occasions in the past have partly been caused by the failure of management to be more open in relation to situations and problems that affect their companies.  For that reason, I hope that the mistrust and the antagonism that from time to time have arisen will be replaced by a measure of goodwill and that this arrangement will assist in creating that atmosphere of goodwill.</P>
    <P>I hope that this move will be successful and I also sincerely hope that once its success is shown that it will be extended to other companies and to other bodies in the private sector.  I feel that in time, through the workers' participation in the management and directorships of these companies&mdash;I am not referring solely to the companies we are speaking of here, but companies in the private sector as well&mdash;a better understanding will develop and, in fact, that there will be a better development of the opportunities, activities and possibilities that exist for the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to end by expressing one particular hope.  One of the bodies to which this order applies is Aer Lingus.  I hope that the arrival of worker-directors on the board of Aer Lingus will in one particular area bring about a more positive attitude to the future role and the development of Shannon Airport as being the only designated trans-Atlantic airport in this State.</P>

      <P>I would like, briefly, to welcome this order and to welcome the fact that when this motion has been passed we will have seven of our semi-State companies with some members of the boards elected by the workers.  We need a far greater degree of co-operation <Col N="1399" /> between management and workers in the public area.  In this case I hope I am not wrong in saying that already there appears to be a modicum of improvement. I wish we could have some such helpful formula in the case of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council so that perhaps one could look forward to a better atmosphere between management and workers in that area also.  I commend the Minister on the introduction of this order and wish the efforts of the different boards well in bringing about a greater degree of co-operation between the managers and the workers of these companies.</P>

      <P>We are all agreed on the principle of worker participation.  This was clear in the debate in 1977 in which the original Bill was introduced by the Minister's predecessor in the Coalition Government.  There are, however, doubts about the actual mechanics of the way in which the principle is put into effect and some of those doubts were expressed in the debate on the Bill.  Alternative methods of putting workers on boards of companies, particularly in the situation of our State-sponsored bodies, were discussed in that debate and it is disappointing to me that the Minister in introducing this order makes just the bland statement:</P>
      <P>I believe that the introduction of employee directors has brought some positive element into the operation of those companies where elections have already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could be interpreted to mean anything you wanted it to mean, it is so bland.  It is not right that something more concrete has not been said.  We ought to have had some idea of the embryo scheme that has been in operation and I think the Minister is at fault in not giving us even some indication of what has happened so far and the possibility that problems have emerged.  Obviously there are very good reasons for Ministers to play things close to their chests but it is the function of the Opposition and particularly of the Independents, who play <Col N="1400" /> such an important role in the Seanad, to try to elucidate some of this information; to try to get behind the Minister and have a look at the poker hand he has and see what problems there are and see what difficulties may have arisen; to see how the scheme in its operation up to now has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the hopes we expressed when the Worker Participation Bill was before this House in March 1977.  I would join with Senator Robinson in saying that I do not think the Minister has given an adequate presentation of the scheme so far, even though it is an embryo scheme.  I do not say this in a critical way because there are problems when one introduces worker participation.  There may be people who would argue against the principle but nobody did in 1977 in this House and nobody has done so today.  So let us accept the principle and think about some of the problems.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that Senators Harte and Kennedy have welcomed the order because they are people on the ground.  As trade union officials they know the difficulties.  If I were a worker in some semi-State body and one of my colleagues on the floor was elected to the board, we would both be represented by a union, preferably a union which submitted to the ICTU.  We would have a representation which was putting forward our claims and our feelings about working conditions, wages, and so on.  However, I would be somewhat suspicious of the gentleman who had been working side by side with me and who suddenly was made a board member. How would he be working in my interest in the overall picture?  This sort of feeling is bound to emerge.  What are the consequences?  It is a matter that has to be handled with some care.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister has not referred to any of the problems that have arisen and I have no doubt they have arisen.  The sort of idea that Ministers like to give us&mdash;I am not referring to the Minister present&mdash;Ministers from all quarters, from every party holding any portfolio, is that the legislation which has emanated from their Department is perfect <Col N="1401" /> and without flaws.  I think that there may well be flaws in this method of putting workers on State bodies and it might be no harm to wash a little of the dirty linen every now and then.  I am trying to be constructive in my comments, not destructive.  I am certainly not saying the idea is wrong but most certainly there have been problems and it is a pity we do not know more about them.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill I put forward the view that the method of dealing with this problem was not the right one and that there should have been a two-tier structure rather than a single-tier board.  This is the philosophy behind the fifth EEC Directive on the Harmonisation of Company Law, as the Minister will know, and there it is very clearly spelt out.  Companies which are referred to in that EEC directive have two organs, the management body and the supervisory body, an executive or management board responsible for managing the company's affairs and representing the company in negotiating contracts, and a supervisory board responsible for supervising and controlling the management board.  I said at that time that there was a lot to be said for this arrangement.  I thought it was a better set-up than the one we have adopted.</P>
    <P>It would seem to be that there is a problem separating the executive and advisory functions and perhaps the Minister in his reply would refer to the separation of executive and advisory functions in our semi-State bodies.  The definition of the function which board members have to undertake needs to be absolutely clear if it is going to dispel the sort of suspicion which the other members of the work force might have about their colleagues who have been elected to the board.  These functions need to be very carefully defined and delineated.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission is keen to extend this whole principle to a much wider class of industry and I believe that in many of our European partners private companies have worker participation in their management structure as a matter <Col N="1402" /> of course.  Does the Minister foresee, in the future, an extension of our legislation to cover private companies?  Here I would disagree with Senator Robinson that there may well be a good argument for doing this rather slowly.  The Minister has given us a bland statement, and it would be a good idea to find out if the system is really working.</P>

      <P>There is a very clear distinction between the semi-State and the private companies.  Our semi-State bodies which we are discussing in this order play a very distinctive and special role.  They have been absolutely fundamental in the development of the State.  They come in for what I believe to be unfounded criticism on many occasions. One of the hopes we expressed when this Bill was being discussed at the Second Stage was that this sort of move would help to dispel that criticism and that worker participation was important because it helped to improve the company's image among the work force, to, perhaps, give people on the shop floor a wider understanding of how the company operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, this problem is one that could be looked at by the Joint Committee on semi-State Bodies, which have <Col N="1403" /> been doing excellent work and producing some very useful reports.  The Leader of the House is the chairman.  The committee have obviously helped Members of this House to realise the problems which semi-State bodies face.  The problems which are raised by worker participation and, indeed, the benefits which will flow from extending the scheme might well be looked at by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on semi-State Bodies.</P>

      <P>I want to thank those Senators who contributed to the debate. With the exception of two, they were reasonably to the point and generally welcomed the making of the order.  Some questions were posed to me which I will try to answer.  Before doing so, perhaps I could start with what Senator West had to say.  I would like to say to him that the blandness appears to be his.  Obviously he is not over familiar with the situation as it exists.  The order that was made was in respect of the five companies where worker participation is now active.  The longest would be about 15 months and it is less than that in most cases.  Despite his lack of experience of the industrial scene, the Senator will know that at this stage, after one year or so, it would be very difficult to give a positive studied opinion to this House or indeed to any House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows either the Senator's lack of experience of the situation within companies of that nature or perhaps his lack of experience of the work place.  Certainly the experience of one year, particularly the first year, will hardly be a positive indicator and study is very important.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few points on that.  In addition to the monitoring, which I believe is very important, being carried out by the Irish Productivity Centre on behalf of the foundation, my Department too, naturally like to make their own enquiries and keep in touch with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> It has been suggested to us already that there should be improved communications upwards and downwards.  I welcome that in any industry.  It was Senator Harte who referred to industrial relations being a difficult area, subject to many forces, and any help in that direction is worthwhile and useful.  I agree entirely with what he said.</P>
    <P>There appears to be improved communications. Obviously, the employee directors know a lot about the companies and I believe it improves decision-making when persons are involved who are on the shop floor and know, perhaps better than anybody else, where the problems are, where improvements can be effected.  This is some of the playback we are having.  I believe participation on the boards&mdash;this is the information coming through to us&mdash;gives workers the knowledge that their interests also are being looked after by the boards.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte and Senator Hillery made the point that, of course, a board work in the interests of the company which is in the interests of all aspects of the company, including, of course, the workers concerned, the most important resource of the company.  We have some evidence also that this has acted as a stimulus to the development of interunion co-operation.  Sometimes in craft areas we have some difficulties.  All these are positive indicators we have had.  It would be unreal of me at this stage to say to this House that this is a positive result after such a short time.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson was critical, as she normally is when I am in this House.  I should first say to her that obviously she has not studied the situation very clearly. Surely she realises it would have been so much easier for me to bring in an order covering all the seven State boards if I could have done that when I brought in the five in 1978?  It was impossible.  Obviously the delay was not mine.  We did, of course, at my level and at the Department level prompt and keep prompting for results in that area.  In fact, close liaison has been maintained with both companies since 1977 in order to assist the prospects for arranging the elections. <Col N="1405" /> In 1978, when an order was made fixing the other five companies that I referred to, I decided that consultations in Aer Lingus and CIE had not reached the stage where decisions could be taken on the appropriate size.  It is now opportune and obviously is desirable that elections should be held because, I should explain to the House, in the case of Aer Lingus, a worker participation study group, which had been formed by the trade unions, had lapsed in the period since 1978 as a result of industrial unrest.  The study group have been reconvened for some months and are preparing proposals on participation structures appropriate to below board levels.  I agree with those Senators who referred to the importance of that area also.  I believe that the establishment of the board level representation itself tends to encourage structures at other levels.  I agree with those Senators who say that they are, of course, important too.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte made the point about participation or consultative bodies below board level.  I believe in some of these companies there is a tendency. This is something I welcome.  I agree with Senator Hillery.  In some of these companies there is such a tendency which I welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hillery that more information needs to be given to workers.  This is very important and we have indications that there is an improvement in the flow of information and communication.  I will arrange for discussions with the social partners in the near future about the possibility of a draft code of practice on information disclosure.  That whole area is important to the work force today.  They should have access to information in their own interests and in the company's interest as this gives them a greater appreciation of difficulties.</P>
    <P>I and the Department are keeping in touch with the companies, apart from the work of the European foundation.  I can go ahead at any stage with an extension of the Act.  I would point out to Senator West that the seven boards were <Col N="1406" /> in the original Bill and that this is merely making an order establishing the number of directors now on those two bodies.  I could not realistically go ahead with an extension at this point and I do not intend to, when workers have, on average, been on the boards for less than 12 months.  Preliminary studies have already been carried out in the companies where they are operational and we will get interim reports later on this year.  The first year of a new operation would not give, in a study, the complete answers as to whether it is the right way, how successful it has been or if there is room for change.  I cannot go ahead with an extension to the Act because the arrangements within the companies had not been completed.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised a point about training for the employee-directors.  I am pleased that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have developed a close liaison with the directors so as to provide backup facilities for them.  This is very desirable.  I hope at the invitation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to be able to meet some of these worker-directors at a seminar in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Senator West said that I did not want to talk about private companies.  I am sure many Members of the House know that the discussion document on worker participation generally is almost ready. It has been a Government commitment for some time; it was part of the national understanding and I am pleased to inform the Senators now that I will lay that document on worker participation in the private sector before both Houses tomorrow.  When Senator West reads it, I will welcome any comments on it.  Obviously both sides of industry will take a particular interest in it but that does not mean that the community as a whole should not study it, discuss it, and make submissions on it.  We would welcome them in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed. There seemed to be a positive combined approach across the House about the advantages of worker participation and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> Senator Robinson asked about my commitment.  My commitment does not have to be questioned.  If this order has been somewhat longer in coming than the others, it was not my fault.  The fact that a discussion document is coming out tomorrow further indicates the position. This area needs very careful study, discussion on what is the best way forward and what sort of structure would suit us best.  That is all for the future and I thank Senators for the quick and speedy passage of the order through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I made the case for this amendment.  This section makes it an offence for any one to put up a misleading notice in relation to goods, but it is only an offence where the person who is buying the goods is a person who deals as consumer.  It seems senseless to limit the application of the offence to circumstances where the buyer is dealing as consumer.  Whether a person is a buyer dealing in the course of business or a buyer dealing as a consumer where he is purposely subjected to misleading information there is no reason why the criminal offence should not be committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that we had a long discussion on the last occasion about section 5 of the Bill where the activities of directors or managers of companies or members of committees of management attract criminal sanctions. In section 5 (2) the mere neglect of a member of a committee of management in failing to attend to something could attract a criminal liability.  We asked if <Col N="1408" /> that was too easy a way for someone to find himself a convicted criminal, and that reconsideration should be given to it.  Here we have a situation where somebody who positively, with <i>mens rea</i>, with the intention to mislead people, puts up a false or misleading notice, but does not, unless he is dealing with the person who is buying as consumer, attract criminal liability.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment which can be given effect to simply by deleting the words &ldquo;dealing as consumer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I had some time to think about the points made by Senator Molony and I can now see some merit in his amendment to widen the scope of the section.  However, if we took out the reference to &ldquo;dealing as consumer&rdquo; we could be left in the position where all that section 4 would achieve would be a repetition of subsections (1) to (3).  If the Senator is agreeable, I suggest that we leave the matter as it is for the moment on the basis that if we are going to delete &ldquo;dealing as consumer&rdquo; it might be as well to delete all of subsection (4).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get much support here the last day for my objection to introducing this element of criminality into what is essentially a contractual area.  My argument applies particularly to this section where it will be a criminal offence for a person to publish a notice that attempts to exclude or restrict any of the rights conferred by the various sections of the 1893 Act as set out in subsection (1).  The proper consequences if a person attempted to do such a thing would be remedy in damages or remedy at civil law.  It is wrong to introduce the element of criminality into the section so as to make the doing of any such thing <Col N="1409" /> an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment according to the mood of the court or the merits or lack of the case, as the case might be.  Now that the matter is going to Report Stage will the Minister reconsider my point particularly in relation to section 11?  When replying, will the Minister expand on how he sees subsection (3) operating?  Perhaps the Minister has some examples that would make it clear to us.</P>

      <P>I am convinced of a conclusion other than Senator Cooney's except in relation to the delivering of unsolicited goods and the entries in directories which I hope are clearly criminal matters.  With regard to the others, I have difficulty in agreeing with the Minister in his decision.  Like Senator Cooney, I dislike any extension of the criminal law and we should be very careful of it.  If we are having offences arising by virtue of displaying notices of the kind specified in subsection (2) why is it not an offence to display a notice excluding buyers of services from their rights under section 37? Why do we not have as an offence excluding the rights that persons will have under the next succeeding section of this Bill, where the Minister may make an order providing certain things about implied warranties with regard to spare parts and after sales service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is an offence for a shop selling goods to tell customers that they are buying without the implied rights that they cannot have taken away from them, which are given to them under the Act, why is it not an offence for another provider to put up a notice saying that the persons who are taking the goods with the services under section 37 are not going to have the benefit of the implied terms that if I understand section 37 cannot be taken from them?  Why is it an offence to put up a statement telling them that the goods are being sold without the implied terms but because something more, services as well as the goods, are sold it is not an offence to put up such a statement?  Why is it not an offence <Col N="1410" /> in that case, if the Minister makes an order with regard to implied warranties in connection with spare parts and after care, to tell the customers that their rights are being excluded when their rights cannot be excluded?  It seems to require an explanation and a reason for the distinctions being made in the treatment of the different sections conferring the different rights.</P>
    <P>I invite Senators Molony and Cooney to look at the words.  What does &ldquo;to display on any part of any premises a notice that includes any such statement&rdquo; mean?  Does that mean if one puts it up in the kids' lavatory and one got it before the Bill was enacted that is a criminal offence? If one displays it in a television reel of the events of 1980 when this astonishing Bill was enacted, is that an offence?  These are all premises.  If one is a printer and one happens to be showing it to the customer who has ordered it is one not displaying the notice to him?  In &ldquo;any part of any premises&rdquo;&mdash;surely we need a little more circumscription in the definition of the net which will catch people and put them in jail, or whatever will happen to them under the penalties section.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with criminal law and we are amending the civil law in a manner which is not all that wrong, but it is common case among the Senators who have endeavoured to understand what we are doing that it is not easy to understand what we are doing and we cannot understand what we are doing unless we are the fortunate, in my case, borrowers of a little document called The Sale of Goods Act, 1893, which is published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office.  Unless the Minister will tell us what alternative arrangements he is making for the provision on behalf of Her Majesty's Stationery Office of The Sale of Goods Act, 1893, we should at least, where we amend sections in that Act, repeat the sections we are amending, or where we are referring to sections which we are subjecting to amended provisions in this Bill we should repeat those sections.  In this case, we are, for example, referring in our <Col N="1411" /> enactment of the law creating a series of offences to section 15 of the 1893 Act and it is only Her Majesty who will be able to give me an additional supply of copies of section 15.  I am an extremely prudent man and I would not dare to risk making photostat copies of section 15 unless I was sure that I had the necessary permission to do so.</P>
    <P>On section 22, we are all right but we have a little difficulty when we get to section 25 where we immediately have to chase off to section 61.  If we are fortunate enough to be able to borrow a copy of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, section 61(5) informs the commoners of this Republic that nothing in the Act shall prejudice or affect the landlords right of hypothec or sequestration for rent in Scotland.  This might be a subsection that would get dropped out of a reenactment of section 61 which we are, incidentally, amending in section 23 or 24 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment in section 61 somewhere here.  Subsection (6) suddenly pops up in this Bill.  We have to remember where we saw it which, of course, we will not do unless we read it from the beginning to the end.  Then we have to carefully transcribe it into our copy of The Sale of Goods Bill, first striking out subsection (5) as not applicable and having done that we are meant to re-read section 55 which we will have to remember has been changed by this Bill.  This is all very fine, but we are not able to press a button and produce all this stuff.  Meanwhile the taximeter is charging and the customer is wondering why it is so hard to go to the pictures in Dublin.  The reason is that we are not bothering to assist the people in the business of getting the taxi from one place to another, who are in fact the people in the business providing the professional service of telling people what their rights or their wrongs are, and are describing themselves as frightfully exhausted by the endeavour.</P>
    <P>There is a chunk of the Sale of Goods Act that we should shove as much out of the window as we have done in other cases.  I see no great problems.  Why do <Col N="1412" /> we not have section 15 here?  Section 15 also raises this matter that I mentioned the last day about sale by sample and the different language used in connection with such a sale from the language used when it is not a sale, for example.  Why is it an offence to display statements, display notices, publish advertisements and supply goods with containers with statements, but it would not be an offence to do that if we were doing a building job for somebody?  We could put anything we liked on the container with the goods, because this is not specifically provided in the section with regard to the services. The Minister, in relation to supplying goods as part of a contract for the supply of services, should not leave that matter in any doubt because we are dealing with a criminal matter that must be very expressly found in the section creating the criminal offence, particularly when we are dealing with the amendment of a code which only deals with the sale of goods, being the Sale of Goods Act.  When section 11 is to be found in a Part which is related only to the sale of goods, why have it an offence in the one case and not have it expressly an offence in that other case where we are excluding buyers from rights that are given to them in the services section and where we are excluding them from rights that are given to them under the implied warranty section?</P>
    <P>There is need for more careful use of the language with regard to premises. We should get these sections that are referred re-enacted even if we are not amending the very language.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1413" /> Regarding notices, one reason why we did not cover the services area in the range of implied terms is that the range of implied terms that we are providing in Part IV is not as wide-ranging and there is not the same need to make an offence in that case.  However, we do not have any particularly strong reasons not to so provide and I will think about it for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also made a point about sections of the 1893 Act which are referred to throughout the Bill.  I see no problem in having them re-enacted in this legislation if the Senator feels strongly about it.  Under section 10 we can meet the Senators wishes.</P>

I should like the House to allow me to ask the Minister to explain precisely what is meant by, or what his interpretation is of section 12.  If his interpretation is that of his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, when she spoke on Committee Stage in the Dáil, there may be no necessity for my amendment.  I cannot see now her interpretation could stand.  I am not sure because, on first reading, the section may not be what it appears to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the query I want to raise with the Minister and I will discuss the amendment pending his reply.  The difficulty I have with the section is that it seems to me that the Minister may make an order which will have the effect of implying in a contract the term for which a service will be provided, or that spare parts will be available for a period that a seller has stated in an advertisement.  In other words, where one advertises that spare parts will be available for, say, two years, if the Minister has made an appropriate order in relation to that type of goods, it will become an implied term in the contract.  That is my understanding of the section.  On the other hand, if one makes no reference at all to the availability of spare parts, or makes no reference at all to a period during which spare parts will be available, then the provisions of the section do not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, seemed quite explicit that the section was a good deal more wide ranging that that when she said specifically that where the manufacturers specifies that spare parts will be available he will have to stand over that and have them available.  In the case where a manufacturer does not specify any period, that is his hard luck.  If he does not specify a period you may lake it that there would be an unlimited supply of spare parts.  The manufacturer will <Col N="1416" /> have to stand over that.  I cannot see how one could interpret section 12 (1) or (2) to mean that and I should like some clarification on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is correct. There was a misunderstanding in the Dáil.  However, could I say for the benefit of the Senator, before he makes his case for his own amendment, that I will not be in a position to accept his proposed amendment?  There are one or two areas which could, perhaps, be tidied up and which would serve to strengthen this section.</P>
      <P>For example, I am considering the possibility of removing the necessity for the Minister of the day to make an order under ssubsection (1).  The effect of this would be that if a seller made an offer, on being accepted it would immediately form part of the contract.  I am also considering whether to provide that if a seller makes an offer, the onus should be on him to specify the period for which his offer is valid.  This would cover the point already made by Senator Molony about the uncertainty in the section as drafted in relation to the period for which spare parts and services will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the information the Minister has given.  It is a great pity that we do not use this opportunity to deal with this whole problem of after-sales service and spare parts.  With inflation and the costs that are involved for us all, nowadays people are very bitterly disappointed regularly that items of equipment they buy for their house, or their car, or their business, or whatever, have a relatively short life.  They become obsolete because spare parts are not available.  We had some discussion last week about the age of obsolescence in which we are living and we discussed the concept of durability.  Steps could be taken&mdash;and the opportunity lies in section 12&mdash;to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now agree on the interpretation of the section and, as it stands, it is almost meaningless.  I do not see what it does for anybody.  It alters an existing position <Col N="1417" /> but, in terms of strengthening the position of the consumer, it does very little. All it does, in effect, is to say that where somebody says that spare parts will be available for 12 months they will be available for 12 months.  That is all.  I do not think that is any great advance.  Under the Consumer Information Act, if somebody says spare parts will be available for six months and, in doing so, makes a false or misleading statement, he is guilty of a criminal offence.  By any standard, I do not think we are advancing the position of the consumer one iota in any real sense of the word.  This is something we need to attend to.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why there should be an objection to the Minister taking this power.  It will be up to the Minister to judge it.  We are not asking him to impose an obligation on every supplier of every item of goods to ensure availability of spare parts for an unreasonable length of time.  On the contrary, we are leaving the Minister with the power in relation to any item of goods on which he deems it appropriate to take this action that he could say: &ldquo;If you are going to produce washing machines, or if you are going to import into this country, let us call them `Lollipop' washing machines of Italian, or Dutch, or Japanese make, we will give you a licence to do this but, you must ensure that spare parts will be available for that piece of equipment for the next three, four or five years, or six months,&rdquo; or whatever the period is to be.  The Minister can judge it in relation to that. It is something on which the Director for Consumer Affairs will be able to advise him.</P>
    <P>That is what my amendment is seeking to do and no more than that.  We are not making any major advance in doing that here.  All we are doing is giving the Minister the power in the future to do that.  The Minister has indicated already that he cannot meet us on this.  I cannot see why.  It seems to me to be possible and reasonable and at no cost to the State.  It presents no difficulty for manufacturers, or suppliers.  They will have the option of selling these goods. <Col N="1418" /> They can make their case to the Minister.  If the Minister proposes to make an order, all options remain open. We would be taking the right step in giving the Minister the power to do this, and I would urge him to reconsider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Molony in what he said, because his amendment tightens the section.  On the interpretation as put forward by Senator Molony and accepted by the Minister, the section can be pretty meaningless in many situations.  It would be literally a &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; in certain situations. It brings with it the danger of the interpretation which the Minister now tells us was erroneous, but nevertheless was advanced by a colleague.  Who is to say that such an interpretation might not subsequently be the one to be made by the courts?  That would be a grave danger if the courts were to make such an interpretation.</P>
      <P>The courts might be faced with a situation where the type of goods involved were those in respect of which an order had been made but in respect of which the manufacturer had not specified a time limit for a service or for the supply of spare parts and an aggrieved consumer decided to rely on this section because the goods came within the ministerial order and asked the courts to interpret it.  How do we know that the courts might not decide that the Legislature intended that the meaning of the section was as given in the other House?</P>
      <P>The courts cannot come and look at the statements in either House to make up their own mind.  They have to look on the plain words before them and might say that this Bill is designed to help consumers, that here is a consumer looking for relief and that it is not good enough for the seller to say: &ldquo;The order was made in relation to my goods but, because I did not put any time limit on the supply of spare parts, or my service, it does not apply to me at all.&rdquo;  The Minister would be safer to have this section removed, or at least amended, as suggested by Senator Molony.</P>

      <P>I raised this question of the supply of spare parts on Second Stage.  Since then, quite a number of people have spoken to me on the matter.  The stark reality is that people are very apprehensive at the moment about buying anything with movable parts and motors and so on.  It is common experience for people to buy an article in good faith hoping that movable and wearable parts will be in supply for three, four, five or six years.  They are absolutely shocked when after six months or 12 months they cannot get the parts.  The machine is in perfectly good order except for minor parts which are not to be had.  They are told blandly when they go to inquire about them that the machine is obsolete.  People buy these things with great apprehension, that they are going to be &ldquo;had&rdquo;, that they are being manipulated, that in order to make more profit manufacturers will discontinue the making of certain parts with the result that the machine becomes obsolete before a reasonable time.  I would ask the Minister to give this section special attention and, if necessary, to bring in a suitable amendment on Report Stage if that will solve the problem for him.  This matter of the supply of parts over a reasonable period will have to be faced up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a housewife, I would be very happy if the Minister took on himself the power to specify a time limit during which spare parts for household goods should be available.  As Senator Molony said, one buys an Italian washing machine now, not on the basis that it will be reasonably fit for the purpose of dealing with the household laundry, but because any reputable dealer will tell you that the length of time during which it will remain workable or usable is limited to about two years.  Nothing will work after about two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are rather expensive items. They are bought on hire purchase usually over a period of two years and by the time the housewife owns the machine, it is already obsolete.  She cannot get the spare parts for it and, <Col N="1420" /> therefore, it is just useless junk.  Surely the Minister could stop this rather cynical exploitation of a very vulnerable consumer by taking to himself this power in consultation with the manufacturers so that a very fair time could be agreed during which period spare parts should be available.  Two years is too short a period for such expensive items. It should be at least four or five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the points made by Senators on both sides of the House with regard to the availability of spare parts.  However, the market place will determine to a certain extent the case of a particular manufacturer who does not offer to make spare parts available.  He will be at a considerable competitive disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the supplier who does make spare parts available as we envisage in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Obviously what is being spoken about by Senators here is the ultimate form of protection for the consumer.  However, it has far-reaching implications for industry generally and let us be fully aware of what we are talking about.  The economic repercussions would be considerable. First of all, there are the manufacturers carrying full ranges of spare parts.</P>
      <P>If we are mailing orders the rate of technological progress might unintentionally frustrate or interfere with these orders.  Things are changing fast particularly within the domestic appliance field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties might arise in justifying such a provision as contained in Senator Molony's amendment because of the different ways in which goods are sold.  For example, electrical discount stores generally sell at lower than average prices but they do not provide after-sale service.  Furthermore, nowadays many dealers are little more than agents for manufacturers who provide a service and offer it at least initially in accordance with a guarantee.  Another difficulty would be that of determining the quantity of spare parts that would be required to be stocked and whether a retailer should be penalised for non-availability <Col N="1421" /> of parts due to failure of supply by a manufacturer.</P>
    <P>In the face of these considerable problems, the simpler approach described in section 12(2), as drafted, was adopted.  Because of the problems I have outlined&mdash;while my own personal sympathies lie with the line being pursued by Senators&mdash;I regret that I am not in a position to accept Senator Molony's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed to hear what the Minister had to say.  I should like the House to understand that I too appreciate the problems involved.  I accept the problem in relation to the volume of spare parts a manufacturer would have to keep.  I also accept the difficulty that, with the technological advances being made, by the time they hit the shop floor for the first time, some goods may be out of date.</P>
      <P>That is not a good enough reason to say that consumers or purchasers of goods should be denied any protection in this area.  The Minister could take the power we are asking him to take, and consider particular situations that could arise in the future.  If because of particular technological advances a retailer or a manufacturer make representations to him that it is unreasonable in relation to some particular item of produce that he should be expected to keep spare parts, or a certain volume of spare parts, or any spare parts for any period of time, that is something the Minister can consider at that time.  All of those problems exist.  Perhaps they cannot all be dealt with but, where they can be dealt with, at least the Minister should take the power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about the genuinely concerned supplier, the person who is concerned to provide a decent service.  We are concerned primarily about the fast buck merchant.  Let us take the discount electrical warehouses.  I do not say this generally&mdash;I am sure there are very reputable operators in this field&mdash;but there are also some very unscrupulous operators who abuse the <Col N="1422" /> availability of consumers who will buy a television set which would cost them £50 or £75 more in a regular retail outlet. They save £50 or £75 and six months later the tube goes in the television set. They go back and the supplier is gone or it transpires that you cannot get a tube for that particular television set. Literally, a fast one has been pulled on the consumer.  Goods have been dumped, as they have been dumped in the past.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the details of consumer laws in other European countries to say that they have legislation dealing with spare parts, as I propose in the amendment I have tabled. I would almost wager that they have.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the problems the Minister has outlined are not insurmountable. I do not accept that he has to deny himself this power for the reasons he has given.  We could do a lot more.  I accept that problems exist, but we have established an office of Director of Consumer Affairs.  He can deal with the problem and look at it from the point of view of the retailer and the consumer. All we are asking is that the Minister take power to save the consumer from the unscrupulous dealer, not from the reputable dealer.  I do not suggest that the Minister should introduce orders that would interfere with the ordinary efficacy of the business affairs of reputable suppliers of goods.  But, if the Minister accepts this amendment, he and the Director of Consumer Affairs will have power to ensure that people who are disreputable and unscrupulous in this field will be stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Even apart from disrepute and knavery of that kind, do we not have responsibility as legislators positively to inculcate a sense of responsibility in the sellers and suppliers and of durable use goods of the kind referred to?  It seems to me that the Minister ought to have power to prevent people from selling goods if they cannot supply spare parts and after sales service.  They should be so geared as to be able to do whatever is appropriate in relation to the customers they choose to take on.  People  <Col N="1423" /> in any profession are not free to take on patients or clients if they are not able to cope with them.  People should not sell cookers, heaters, washing machines or whatever, if they have not got the necessary capital, the necessary arrangements, to see that an after sales service and an appropriate amount of spare parts will be available.</P>
      <P>It would be a threat to anyone in business if he found himself in the situation where the Minister made an order placing a whole lot of obligations on him which he could not discharge.  Senator Molony is proposing that power should be given to the Minister.  As I understand the section it will convert sales talk and representations into implied terms of contracts, and that is all it will do.  If there are not any sales talks of the kind described, if there are not these kinds of representations, there will not be any resulting effect on the contract between the parties.  Senator Molony is proposing that the Minister should be given a power.  Let him go away from the Seanad and think about what is best from the point of public order in terms of whom he should consult first before he makes any order, before he makes any order, what kind of notices should be given to whoever is in this particular business of selling television sets, and so on.</P>
      <P>I have just come out of a house where the cooker broke down for a few days and perhaps I am more attentive to Senator Molony's amendment as a result.  People should not sell cookers unless they can supply spare parts.  The Minister should be in a position, after due warning, to tell everyone in that business &ldquo;If you go on selling these things you will have to comply with the following requirements&rdquo;.  The Minister should be obliged to inform himself objectively. I take the point about technology, Perhaps there should be provision for the exclusion of warranties in a limited range of goods affected, for example, by the implied warranties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions would arise, for example, under this section.  Say this is enacted and somebody sells goods having advertised <Col N="1424" /> beforehand that he will supply spare parts, under what terms does he provide the spare parts.  Is that a contract for the sale of spare parts?  Are there implied terms about merchantable quality with regard to the spare parts? Does he have to supply fresh spare parts if the spare parts are not good enough? Does the person who gets the spare parts have the right under another section of this Bill to go off and get them repaired by somebody else if they break down?  Is there a contract for sale arising under the Sale of Goods Act with regard to the spare parts which are supplied pursuant to this subsection?</P>
    <P>I support Senator Molony's proposal because, after consideration and consultation with the appropriate people, in appropriate circumstances, the Minister might find it useful in the public interest to make an order and that is all Senator Molony's amendment is proposing to do. The giving of that power does not threaten the livelihood of anyone.  There can be suitable consultation with the appropriate sector engaged in supplying these things.  After all we are talking about a very important element in human living when we are talking about expenditure.  Furnishing your house with all these modern requirements is a very solid, important business.</P>
    <P>The Legislature lays down rules with regard to the way the roads are used and the way cars are driven.  It does not hesitate to make rules with regard to the market place in particular areas.  This is a particular area of the market place with regard at least to consumer items, the things you expect to last a few years, washing machines, dishwashers and the rest of it.  There should be rules of a different character with regard to these kinds of goods and the rules shall be changed if technology changes the position. After all, profit is a reward of risk-taking; maybe this should be one of the risks if technology renders the particular goods uninteresting.  The risk of the business should be taken by someone who is selling and who ought to inform himself.  We should be concerned to protect the individual in his role as a consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the Minister's case in resisting the amendment was to refer to the part that competition would play, the implication being that the people who would not provide the spare parts and the after sales service would suffer in the market place in that the goods would be less attractive than in the case of those who would provide these things.  I think the history of sales of goods in the general consumer durable range does not necessarily support that contention.  In theory it should work like that but in practice I do not think it does work like that, in the sense that any deficiencies in the terms of after sales service are very often not alluded to because the initial cost may be less than the competing goods and a person who is on a tight budget may be tempted to go for the cheaper article without paying sufficient attention to the other matters involved.  Again, too, clever advertising can blunt any competitive disadvantage which that particular type of consumer durable might have over its competitors. So if you have price and clever advertising and if you have a wide range of dealers, people would be constrained to buy them as the particular object more readily available.  I do not know that the Minister is on altogether safe ground in relying on competition and the effects of competition as an argument for resisting this amendment.  It has not worked up to now and there is no guarantee that it will work in the future.</P>

I would like to inform Senator Molony that this situation is causing difficulties right across Europe to all of our partners within the European Community and he is wrong in his assumption that there is a solution in most countries.  There is not.  But we are attempting, together with our other partners in the second consumer programme which is at present under discussion, to come to a satisfactory solution to this whole problem of spare parts.  I hope that in that second consumer programme a satisfactory solution will be arrived at to protect the interests of the consumers in Europe.

While I and other Senators expressed sympathy for some of the problems presented in relation to the spare parts problem generally I do not for one moment want anybody to believe that I regard this as a good reason for the Minister to adopt the stance he is adopting in relation to this amendment.  It was precisely because of those problems that I tabled the amendment so that the Minister would have the power in individual cases to impose such a responsibility and duty on suppliers of goods.  I do not accept the problems the Minister has outlined as a valid reason for not accepting this amendment.  I very much regret the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister.  I think we are losing an excellent opportunity to do something that is positive and worthwhile and of aid to consumers.  We are losing that opportunity and that is something I regret.  Certainly I cannot agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>

Every day we meet problems over everything we touch or think about but we seem to have a fundamental disagreement between us on a matter of policy here.  Let us dispose of it now; let us decide which standard we are going to take.  The section may need to be tightened up; certainly in relation to the interpretation of subsection (2) there may be a question of tidying it up, but I want to know whether the Minister is prepared to take the power to enable him to introduce meaningful orders or <Col N="1428" /> legislation to protect consumers in relation to spare parts.

      <P>This is a very serious situation and I do not think it can be neglected.  In the past three years a certain number of cookers have been dumped on the Irish market.  In my opinion spare parts will not be available.  I retail the cookers and I tell the people that.  If you offer them a more expensive cooker for which spare parts are available they think you are trying to influence them to purchase it.  Maybe they think you have a greater margin of profit on it.  There is another point which cannot be neglected.  A number of these cookers cannot be serviced by a local handyman or mechanic.  One will have to go further than providing spare parts; an aftersales service must be provided.  The Minister and his Department are obliged to do something about this.</P>

      <P>I conducted some inquiries in preparation for this Bill but unfortunately I did not undertake an exhaustive analysis of Irish industry.  We may have people engaged in the production of some of these things in this country. Without drawing too explicitly the benefits to the Irish community, it might be useful to us if the Minister could make an order that Irish producers comply with the requirement to supply spare parts and servicing and people engaged-in the business of selling such goods on the domestic market in competition with Irish producers could be prevented from selling them because they did not have or were not making available a sufficient supply of spare parts and proper arrangements.  In this fashion it seems to me that not merely the consumer but Irish employment might well be assisted. I wonder would the Minister think again on this matter?</P>

I readily admit that I would be prepared to do anything in my power to assist the provision and maintenance of jobs in this country within the rules of GATT and other international agreements with which we are involved.  I am prepared to look at the matter again in the light of the strong case that has been made by both sides of the House but I am not in a position to accept the amendment on Committee Stage.  If Senator Molony insists on putting it I will not be in a position to accept it now.  I promise the Senator and the House that I will give it sympathetic consideration between now and Report Stage.  I am not promising anything except that I will give it sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House that it is not just Ireland that has this particular problem with what on the surface should be a simple question and simple solution. The whole of the Community is involved. The Community is also involved in drafting rules on spare parts under the <Col N="1430" /> second consumer programme which is at present under discussion.  We are involved in that discussion.  I can assure the House that I am very conscious of the points that have been made by the various Senators but I am not in a position to accept here and now the amendment as proposed.</P>

I accept that the Minister will consider this seriously.  He may take it that from our point of view we are very serious about it.  We believe that the legislation would be inadequate without a provision like this.  So far we have certainly found the Minister to be most co-operative in dealing with the Bill.  We are not concerned about party differences or anything like that here; we are concerned to produce the best legislation to help the consumer. There is a basic policy involved in this. The Minister may have come into the House today with his mind set in one way.  I urge him to switch it around the other way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that all the meaty sections in this Bill come one after the other.  I am going to complain again about the procedure we have here.  It is very difficult sometimes to speak to amendments first.  Perhaps it is inexperience but it seems to me to be much easier and <Col N="1431" /> more logical to have a discussion first about the section and come on to the amendments then.  As will be seen from the amendments we tabled, our main concern first of all is in relation to the proposal under the original section 13 to create a new criminal offence, something that occurs on every page of this Bill.  On Second Stage many Senators on all sides of the House expressed concern that the motor trade had been singled out for this type of attention.  It was felt that we were not advancing the cause of the consumer by imposing this new potential criminal liability on motor dealers.  The way in which the section was to operate was that motor dealers would be obliged to furnish a certificate with the car stating that basically it was roadworthy and, if the certificate was not provided or falsely provided, a criminal offence would be committed.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister now proposes to remove the criminal liability altogether and we agree with that.  I am pleased that we have advanced to that position.  However, my main concern in proposing that we also delete subsection (3) was to rid ourselves entirely of this certificate.  I do not know who thought up this idea of a certificate leading to criminal responsibility.  The whole idea was ill conceived.  Given that we are discussing a consumer Bill I do not believe that we are doing a lot for the consumer by introducing certificates at all.  What we do for the consumer is basically being done when under subsection (2) we imply the condition that at the time of delivery of the vehicle under the contract it was free from any defects which would render it dangerous to the public including persons travelling in the vehicle. That is basically what we want to give to the consumer: the right to sue under the contract if the vehicle was defective.</P>
    <P>The certificate was necessary if we were going to have a criminal liability on the motor dealer in respect of a defective vehicle.  Now it is proposed to remove the criminal liability altogether but the Minister in his amendment proposes to retain the certificate, to shift the onus of proof as to the existence of a defect from <Col N="1432" /> the user of the vehicle back to the retailer or the motor dealer himself.  I personally think that to adopt this approach is unfair to say the least, and will present genuine/difficulties so far as court proofs are concerned.  At worst, under the Ministerial amendment proposed, someone could buy a car from a motor dealer and hold on to it for 12 months and subsequently sell it, say, to a farmer living at the top of a mountain.  He could use the car to bring calves in from the fields, to bring milk to the creamery or whatever and then after two years he could say there was a defect in the car; that he did not know the condition of the car when it was purchased originally from the motor dealer because he was a secondhand car buyer.  If he thinks there was a defect in that car and if he can show that no certificate of roadworthiness was given with the car, he can sue and the obligation is on the motor dealer to prove that there was no defect in the car.  The onus of proof shifts completely.  In other words, the minute that this farmer or secondhand car owner issues the summons he is immediately forcing a motor dealer to prove that the car which was sold to someone else a couple of years before was free from all defects.  That will apply if someone for some reason fails to deliver one of these certificates.  It is unfair to approach it that way.  It is confusing and will lead to all kinds of difficulties.</P>
    <P>The motor dealer may decide to be clever and give a false certificate stating there was no defect in the car.  He delivers the certificate to the purchaser who afterwards sells the car to the farmer. Notwithstanding that it was a false certificate that came with the car the farmer will have to go to court and prove his case.  The fact that a certificate existed, even though it was a false certificate, will change the situation around the other way and if someone wishes to bring a case against another person he will have to go into court and prove it.  A certificate does no more or less than to bring about a situation in which the onus of proof is changed.  It is making a nonsense out of the law and out of consumer <Col N="1433" /> legislation to introduce what I would regard as a red herring.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that all cars on the road are roadworthy.  That is a very laudable purpose and something that we should pursue but this is not the place for it.  As the Minister pointed out, it is not his responsibility, it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment. Other countries have established authorities to examine cars to make sure they are roadworthy.  It seems to me that the idea of the certificate emanated from the Department in an effort to deal with this problem and to get over the difficulty of the cost factor involved in establishing such an authority in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to the certificate, I do not see why the motor trade should be singled out.  Why should not producers of items such as electric saws, printing presses and industrial equipment be obliged to Issue certificates? Certainly if one were to be consistent there should be certificates in all of these areas but for some reason the motor trade has been singled out for the application of this new concept of a certificate of worthiness.  I do not see the logic or sense of it.  It came about through the very laudable desire that all cars on the road be roadworthy.  If that was the intent behind it, then we should go about it in the proper and regular way, that is, by setting up an independent authority that could vet vehicles and judge their roadworthiness, independent of a motor dealer or purchaser.</P>
    <P>Even though we propose the deletion of those three subsections, I want to stress that it will in no way affect the position of the consumer.  The consumer is well protected.  If a consumer buys a car there is implied in that contract that the vehicle is free from defect as outlined in subsection (2).  There is also the very important new right that is given to consumers in this legislation in section 21.  It is a section which should be stressed because it will have far-reaching consequences in the whole area of consumer <Col N="1434" /> purchases.  Where a person buys a car, and finds a month later that there is a defect in it he can go back and insist that the defect be put right.  If the defect is not put right he can leave the car with the seller and the whole deal is off.  These are rights that the car purchaser is being given under this legislation.  This whole idea of the certificate and the criminal liability is a red herring.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to make a point which I think is a useful one.  Unless the whole idea of the certificate is removed a criminal liability will still remain quite apart from the fact that the Minister is removing the specific criminal liability being created by this section.  If the certificate remains, the criminal liability will remain because under another Act, the Consumer Information Act, where one produces a certificate that is false or misleading, an offence will be committed.  I say to the Minister if it is his intention and desire to remove the criminal aspect of this section he should remove it fully by removing the liability of the certificate.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make a clear statement of Ireland's foreign policy in the light of recent events in Iran and Afghanistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> I am extremely glad that we are able to take this motion today.  When the motion was first brought to the attention of the House a number of Senators from all sides stressed that they felt the Seanad is a body particularly suitable for a discussion on foreign affairs in a cool, rational and non-party manner.  I very much hope that the debate which we are about to begin will be extremely constructive and will be free from party positions being taken.  The seconder of the motion is Senator Murphy who will speak directly after me, I understand.</P>
    <P>I should like to begin by quoting from a pamphlet called &ldquo;Irish Foreign Policy&rdquo;.  It is a statement by Deputy Garret FitzGerald when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs in May 1973.  At the beginning of that statement, made in the Dáil, he set out the basic objectives of Irish foreign policy in the view of the then Government.  I will not read the basic objectives set out, but it would be worthwhile taking note of one or two of them:</P>
    <P>(a)  to help maintain world peace and reduce tensions between the super-powers, between blocs and between States;</P>
    <P>That was set as the first objective of Irish foreign policy.  The second objective dealt with Northern Ireland, and the fourth one was:</P>
    <P>(d)  to secure Ireland's economic interests abroad, thus facilitating economic and social progress at home, and particularly to secure our interests in the economic, social and regional policies of the EEC;</P>
    <P>A lot of water&mdash;perhaps it would be more suitable to say a lot of oil&mdash;has flowed under a lot of bridges since that statement was made in the relative calm of May 1973.  The world scene has changed totally since then.</P>
    <P>We were quite unaware of the new factor in world affairs which was to influence international politics almost completely in the following year.  That was the sudden and dramatic shift in oil prices and the realisation by oil <Col N="1436" /> producers that they held in their hands not only an economic weapon but a political weapon which has recently taken a new and dramatic twist.  In the light of the events following May 1973 I am quite sure that that fourth aspiration would have probably been placed second&mdash;to secure Ireland's economic interests abroad.  There has been an increasingly new ball game since 1973.</P>
    <P>I have thought about Irish foreign policy recently and anything I will say about it in the course of this speech will be in the form of a series of questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I am very glad to have here.  Many Irish people are slightly confused and always. perhaps have been confused about Irish foreign policy.  We are aware that foreign policy is no longer something rather esoteric which in a small country like Ireland has very little relevance to what might be described as the ordinary life of the people.  In the old days people felt that way and this was reflected in the lack of effort by Governments to educate public opinion on foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The position has changed dramatically.  A modern Minister for Foreign Affairs of this country carries an enormous burden.  That fact should be constantly communicated to the people. The people are well capable of understanding the intricacies of foreign affairs and foreign relations.  I would hope the very welcome willingness of the Minister to come into this House today might be an indication of a trend in that direction.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why foreign policy must be made clear to every man, woman and child in the country is that as well as the arrival of oil as an enormous factor in world politics, there is the new and dreadful situation for this generation, that behind all the spectacle of world politics, the interactions of powers, great and small, there is the terrible threat of nuclear war.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there is not anybody in any country who is a passive bystander in foreign affairs.  That old expression about armchair generals no longer has relevance because there will <Col N="1437" /> not be generals smoking cigars in armchairs sending young men to war because in any future world conflict we will all be involved and in the front line. In the United States recently I heard a slightly academic debate as to whether women should be registered for draft into the US Army, considering that women, men and children will all be in the front line in the event of any conflict requiring that kind of registration or draft.  Therefore, there is a question of what the role of a country like Ireland would be in world affairs.  We have to ask ourselves what could we do on the very large world stage when we are such a very small cipher.</P>
    <P>So soon after St. Patrick's Day, with its usual Irish-American interaction, we are well aware that despite our very small size and our economic weakness we are, in fact, a very well-known country, particularly in the world's largest power.  In my view, Ireland has a voice which could be made a voice that people would listen to.  Being an independent neutral nation which commands some respect in the world means that we must have a voice and that we must use it.  We should use that voice to inform ourselves and the world on foreign affairs.  We should use it where at all possible to mediate in any circumstances where it looks as if Ireland would be an acceptable mediator: we should use any talent and skill we have to mediate and we should be very quick to give credit and praise where they are due.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are fewer and fewer occasions where that seems to arise on the world stage, but we should use that voice to protest meaningfully when countries great or small break all the rules of international behaviour.  It seems to many people, and it seems to me, that Ireland has an uncertainty about the kind of voice we could have in international affairs.  Apart from well-cushioned censure motions in the UN and various other forums, we do not seem to have taken a separate initiative or a particular stance which we might have been qualified to take because of the world standing which I believe was <Col N="1438" /> gained for us over the years by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and, in my view, brought to its height by Deputy FitzGerald when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a matter of pride that we have joined so well with all these various bodies to which we are aligned in condemning recent events in Iran or Afghanistan.  We have certainly enthusastically joind in strong condemnations which have been shown to be ineffectual in this instance.  Perhaps we should look at what we actually have done since the invasion of Afghanistan on 27 or 28 December 1979.  We sent a note to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires on January 4 protesting against this invasion. We issued a joint statement with the nine countries of the EEC.  We voted on the UN Resolution of January 14 condemning the invasion, and we joined in a statement from Foreign Ministers in Brussels on 15 January.  We also have supported the idea of a neutrality status for Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>These do not really amount to actions: they amount to statements&mdash;they are not doing, they are saying.  It has been shown that saying has not cut any ice in this instance.  A great many people in Ireland, and I certainly, are confused as to what Afghanistan was before it was pulled so abruptly behind the iron curtain. It seems to have been a country which for a great number of years was an uncomfortable buffer zone between opposing great powers, a very mountainous country which was self-sufficient in food, poor but not in a desperate condition. It was always considered that the British lion roared at the Russian bear across the intervening zone of Afghanistan.  In recent years, because of its importance as a buffer between the Russians and the oil producing countries, Afghanistan was receiving enthusiastic aid from the US and Moscow, aid which obviously was politically motivated, something that is part of modern politics.</P>
    <P>All sorts of upheavals began in Afghanistan in 1973 with the overthrow of a monarchy but the country really <Col N="1439" /> began to simmer in 1978 and there was a succession of dramatic events one of which was that the US Ambassador was killed there about a year ago.  The upheaval has continued since then.  President Teraki was endorsed in Moscow by the Russians until he was overthrown by a man called Amin.  Amin was not popular with the Afghan people and he was losing ground quite rapidly.  I am quite sure that there were contacts and connections between this man and the United States who were anxious that Afghanistan would not go the way it seemed to be going, which was straight into a Communist regime totally sustained by Russia.  However, Amin faced the same fate as he had bestowed on Teraki and just after Christmas there was yet another upheaval and Amin was killed.  That same day, from Moscow, the Russians flew in to take over the country.</P>
    <P>On 28 December Russian troops arrived and it is estimated that at the moment in Afghanistan there are 105,000 Russian troops.  The reason for such enormous numbers is that in a country like Afghanistan, which does not have any vast, flat plains to send large tanks over, mountain warfare must be resorted to by the invading army, because the Afghan mountain fighters for centuries have been very adept at hiding themselves in the mountains.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Afghanistan invasion compared to what has happened in Hungary and Czechoslovakia is that this was, in fact, the first invasion of what was a neutral country not accepted as part of the Soviet bloc since the second world war.  Such an enormous and blatant invasion obviously had some very important reasons behind it.  The important reasons behind this invasion are the oil fields of the Persian Gulf.  It is important that we realise that if Russia advances any step further in that area she could quite quickly control the supply of oil to the whole of western Europe. If Russia should gain control of Iran and Saudi Arabia&mdash;and Iran being in such a very unstable position at the moment is a <Col N="1440" /> great worry to all countries&mdash;western Europe would lose overnight its own freedom of movement because, as we have seen, oil seems to control the economies of the western world.  A most alarming result of the invasion of Afghanistan by the Russian army is that it completely disrupted progress towards ratification of SALT II which had been proceeding in the American Senate.  The American President had been negotiating and pushing for the Senate to ratify that treaty against quite strong resistance.  It had been scheduled for debate in January for signing in February.  Of course, the fact that this whole movement towards ratification of that treaty, which is absolutely and vitally essential for every one of us trying to put some reason, as it does, on the crazy arms race, has been disrupted is an extremely serious element in this whole thing.  The Russians must have been fully aware that this would happen.</P>
    <P>The debate that has gone on in this country, in the media and so on, over the Afghanistan invasion seems to have concentrated on one area only, sport.  It might be a good thing to look for a moment at what else has been done by the US in her attempt to emphasise to Russia that in the delicate balance of world relations there are things that cannot be done and steps that cannot be taken.  Steps have been taken which fall short of the real military confrontation which is so unthinkable and which must remain unthinkable.  The other steps that were taken were a grain embargo, technology embargo, cultural relations cut off, some movement of ships in the oceans of that area and, lastly, a request by President Carter to have an Olympic boycott.  The idea of an Olympic boycott came from sport writers in the United States, I was told when I was there.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Ireland, instead of talking about it, doing something about it.  Could we talk about why, for example, our Minister for Agriculture urges that we should sell subsidised butter to Russia from the EEC?  Why can we not, for example, call off Córas Tráchtála's planned exhibition of Irish technology in <Col N="1441" /> Russia?  Why do we not call it off totally and say that is why we are calling it off? Why do we not call off cultural exchanges? Finally, why do the Irish Government not take a firm lead on the Olympic Games?  I do not mean that we should do anything like interfering with people's freedom to go if they wish to go. I am talking about taking a strong position and strongly discouraging Irish athletes from going.</P>
    <P>To go to the Olympic Games is a political gesture in itself.  We all are aware that the Olympic Games in Russia are, in fact, a political event. They are not a wonderful festival of young athletes competing against each other in a spirit of freedom.  Unfortunately, it seems to me that the International Olympic Council have allowed the Olympic Games to drift into a situation where they are no longer a sporting festival of freedom, where they have become extremely political.  The Russians have greeted the decision to allow the Olympic Games to be held in Moscow as a tribute to Russia's role in the freedom of the world.  They have claimed it as such.</P>
    <P>I believe an Irish presence, encouraged by an Irish Government, in Moscow is a very dangerous step towards the creation of a situation where Russia begins to feel that you can actually get away with anything, that all those people will draw back as well and will not take any real steps, they will just talk.</P>
    <P>Ireland has an enormous amount to gain from having maximum friendly relations with the United States.  We have entered a period where there has been, apparently, a new and vigorous approach towards the Northern Ireland tragedies, an approach which involves internationalism and talking to people in other countries.  It seems to me that we could, in fact, use the enormous goodwill which exists in the United States to help us to make Britain realise her responsibilities in the whole Northern Ireland area, which would put real pressure on <Col N="1442" /> Great Britain to use the kind of diplomatic initiatives that she is well able to use to begin to cut through the layers of tragedy, history and misunderstanding that keeps Northern Ireland in its thrawn of violence.  We need to have the help of the United States Government in this very important effort. It escapes me, for this reason and for the other reasons I have mentioned, why Ireland seems to teeter on the brink of inarticulateness in its reaction to the Afghanistan crisis.</P>
    <P>I believe that words simply do not mean very much in these circumstances and words should be backed up by actions. I, therefore, would like a firm statement by the Minister on why we have not taken action, only words, on this issue.  I would like a final statement on whether the Irish Government will be passive in the area of the Olympic Games or whether it will take a directing role in this issue, as I believe they should.</P>

      <P>Let me begin by wishing the Minister well in his relatively new office.  Time was when the Foreign Affairs ministry was seen as the most glamorous of Departments relatively immune from the backlash of the electorate. Now it is an increasingly onerous office and highly responsible.  I wish the Minister well.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say how much I admire the people who work in our foreign service.  Many of them I know very well, and they are doing an extremely good job.  Sometimes they are not immune from very bitter criticism to which they cannot respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad, like Senator Hussey, that we have been given the opportunity to debate foreign policy in the context of recent events and I support her plea for a clear articulation of what that policy is. Beyond that however, I must take issue in relation to almost everything else she has said.  On the question of Iran, let me make my position clear.  I regard, as 99 per cent of us do, what happened in Teheran as a monstrous violation not alone of the civilised conventions on which international affairs rest but of <Col N="1443" /> basic humanity itself.  I deeply sympathise with the American Government and people who suffer daily in the anguish of their concern for those unfortunates in the embassy.</P>
    <P>Afghanistan is a very different matter indeed.  One factor which it shares in common with Iran is that Afghanistan has more than its share of mad mullahs&mdash;and the Lord protect us from the excesses of institutionalised religions, east or west.  It also, in addition to mad mullahs, has quite a number of feudal reactionaries who have controlled the destinies of that benighted country up to recently.  There has been Soviet intervention but it is a much less simple issue than representing it as one of a brutal super-power ruthlessly tramping on the rights of a democratic western-style country.  On one level the conflict arises from the attempt to impose marxist style socialism with all its restrictions on personal freedom on a country which has been the very antithesis of socialism.  On another level, the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan is an attempt to recover a lost sphere of influence.</P>
    <P>In this sense it is no more, or no less heinous than the interventions of various imperial powers, with whose descendants we are allied in partnership in Europe, who acted repeatedly in this manner in the nineteenth century.  One of those powers, France, it could be argued, continues to act in this interventionist manner in what she regards as her legitimate spheres of influence in Africa. What has happened in Afghanistan differs no more that in degree, not in principle, from American intervention in South East Asia or Latin America.  Witness the plea of the tragically assassinated figure, Archbishop Romero, only a week or two ago to the United States Secretary of State Mr. Vance, not to support the Government in El Salvador.  What has happened in Afghanistan is no more or no less heinous in principle than what the People's Republic of China did not so long ago in Tibet.</P>
    <P>The mention of China should make us reflect soberly on the improbable allies of the West in the Afghanistan <Col N="1444" /> crisis&mdash;China and Pakistan, no less&mdash;paragons of liberal democracy, indeed. As Senator Kennedy said, it is a gross exaggeration for President Carter to refer to the Afghanistan crisis as the greatest crisis since World War II.  I am reluctant to criticise our American friends.</P>
    <P>To paraphrase Hillaire Belloc, every European has two countries, his own and France.  Every Irishman really has two countries, his own and the United States of America.  It is with great reluctance that I make these criticisms, but it is perhaps the prerogative of kinship.  At least, Ambassador Shannon deemed it so in his criticisms of us in recent months.  In terms of the obscenity of the armaments race, in terms of intervention in other people's affairs, whether to spread an ideology or to maximise economic profits, I see no difference in this respect between the United States of America and the USSR.  I see no difference in terms of super powers between Gog and Magog.</P>
    <P>Afghanistan has become a major crisis only because of a number of contingencies, one being the energy crisis, because the oil hungry West sees the Middle East and the Persian Gulf as its sphere of influence.  Why should it be the western powers' sphere of influence any more than the Soviet Union's sphere of influence?  The first reason why Afghanistan has become inflated as a crisis is the perennial energy question; secondly, the domestic imperatives of the United States Presidential Election.  But there may be some evidence from yesterday's happy results that the good sense of the American people is asserting itself in this regard.  Of course Afghanistan has become an exaggerated crisis because it offered a welcome diversion from the shameful frustrations of the outrage in Teheran.  So Prime Minister Thatcher is permitted, with exquisite indelicacy to threaten the Soviet Union with a repeat of the sufferings of the great patriotic war of 1941-1945, and President Carter is enabled to proclaim himself the champion of freedom on the North West Frontier.  We may well envisage <Col N="1445" /> him uttering in a parody of President Kennedy &ldquo;ich bin ein khyber passer&rdquo;.  Let us remind ourselves also that the present crisis did not really begin with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It began, if we cast our minds back, with the stridency that attended the thirtieth anniversary of the setting up of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Last autumn there was quite a lot of verbal sabre rattling on the part of NATO military and political chiefs and that sabre rattling was accompanied by the placing of new weapons on Western European soil, thus presenting a very dangerous threat to the delicate nuclear balance.</P>
    <P>These are my views on the present crisis.  I share Senator Hussey's anxiety as to what our policy should be.  It obviously has short-term consequences for us, but it has long-term implications as well.  Our foreign policy now any more than in the past is not being clearly presented or sufficiently articulated.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Olympics, the Minister of State, Deputy Tunney, has made it clear that he is very anxious that we should go ahead and participate. What his bosses want is less than clear. It seems to me that what they are saying is &ldquo;Let us wait and see what way the wind is blowing&rdquo;.  The Minister, with respect, calls this pragmatism.  I call it opportunism or expediency.  The results of the recent poll may help to make the Government make up their mind.  I find it very gratifying that the plain people of Ireland&mdash;and not so plain women of Ireland particularly&mdash;have rejected the cold war hysteria which has been so sedulously cultivated over the last few months by a section of the media and by some of our politicians.  Not to direct all the heat to the Minister, some of these politicians on the Opposition side are of course in the great tradition of hysteria dating back to the Spanish Civil War, when it was a question of God or no God in Spain.  We are now saying that it is a question of God or no God in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>The great argument against the <Col N="1446" /> boycott is why in 1974 or 1976, whenever it was, when it was decided to award the next Olympics to Moscow, at a time when the Soviet Union's record on human rights and on intervention in other countries' affairs was well known, did no one then raise the question of principle?  It was because of the accidental combination of contingencies which I described foremost of which is the oil crisis, had not presented itself at that stage.</P>
    <P>The present crisis raises the long-term issue as well.  Do we any longer exercise an independent foreign policy?  When we discussed, maybe a couple of months ago, the possibility of having this debate Senator Ryan said: &ldquo;We will have to wait and see what happens next Tuesday in Rome&rdquo;.  My definition of an independent country is one that does not have to wait until next Tuesday to see what its partners are going to do.  The most important question that arises from all this debate is, is the pursuit of an independent foreign policy at all compatible with the increasing emphasis on a common EEC foreign policy?  The Minister gave some answers to that question yesterday in the Dáil but they do not sufficiently allay the anxieties of those of us who believe that neutrality is a crucially important part of the personality of this country, vindicated by our history, with a long tradition stretching back to the foundation of the State, and by no means confined to the expression of a negative expedient.  Those of us who see neutrality as vital internationally as a just society at home, want a more comprehensive answer from the Minister on this question.  We really should not wait until the French and Germans make up their minds on the boycott, we should take every opportunity to reassert our independent and neutral stance in the presence of our partners.  We should have the moral credibility and stature to be able to say to the French &ldquo;Knock it off in Africa&rdquo; and to the Germans &ldquo;Stop exporting your nuclear and arms technology to South Africa&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we need a clear explanation of the foreign policy we are <Col N="1447" /> pursuing.  It seems to me that whatever foreign policy we had has been grievously modified in recent years.  We are sometimes at a loss to know what our policy is.  We see our delegates at the United Nations sometimes voting in what seems to be a most extraordinary manner.  Why should an Irish delegation vote against a disarmament proposal? Why should an Irish delegation give anything less than unstinted support to anti-apartheid policies?  I suggest to the Minister that that excellent bulletin of his Department&mdash;<i>Ireland Today</i>&mdash;should be more widely distributed and that it might carry a section explaining to the ordinary people the fundamental principles of our foreign policy and why the decisions made in our name are made from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is a question of a statement on Ireland's foreign policy in the light of recent events in Iran and Afghanistan which is, if you like, pinning the matter down in a certain area.  I would like on another occasion to have a fuller discussion on foreign policy.  This motion relates to Irish foreign policy in its aspects related to the events that have just occurred, unfortunately, both in Iran and Afghanistan.  I am very glad to have this opportunity to debate this matter in the Seanad and to get some priorities emphasised.</P>
      <P>First of all, the primary concern of the Government in Ireland's foreign policy is to promote the well-being of our own people.  Allied with that it is important also, of course, that we as a nation standing for certain fundamental principles in international relations try to advance and promote principles as well, so that we have a two-tier approach&mdash;our own interest and the well-being of our own people allied to a moral attitude which we as a small country can take in in regard to serious matters that arise.  In many of these cases throughout the world we do not have a strong vested interest and can take an independent or neutral attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> In my view, once we see our foreign policy along those lines, with two bases&mdash;our own self-interest and at the same time a moral attitude standing for certain basic principles&mdash;we are giving an expression to the basic values and views of the Irish people.  We are working in that way on the ground of what one might call enlightened self-interest.  It is on that basis that a small country like ours can best survive and prosper and seek to ensure a world of peaceful and orderly relations with these states.</P>
    <P>I will outline the broad approach we seek to take in foreign policy matters. We want to do what we can as a small country to make a world where peace and justice and order increasingly prevail in international relations.  That is very basic and fundamental.  We reject relations based on domination by any one group over another.  Instead, let everyone see participation and co-operation take the place of domination in every area of human life.  We believe that this is in accordance with our own national inheritance.  People have the right to self-determination and they should be free to decide for themselves, without outside interference, the political and social structures under which they will live.  We are also committed to what would be a greater measure of justice in international economic relations and the resources of the earth shared more fairly and also properly conserved.</P>
    <P>Our concern and our sense of human solidarity extend not only to states and peoples but to individual humans.  This is, in my view, fairly fundamental, particularly having regard to our own inheritance. We know that views on human rights differ from one country to another.  We believe very strongly that there are certain minimum requirements for human dignity and that men and women everywhere are entitled to these rights.</P>
    <P>This is very important because over a large area of the world at present there is not a sufficient degree of accord given to human rights, or sufficient appreciation of the degree to which human rights are not recognised.  We consider that the <Col N="1449" /> massive build-up of armaments in the world, not only between the super powers but even in the developing world, which is even more horrific, is a major danger and a wasteful diversion of resources from the pressing needs of humanity.  It is important to maintain and develop a framework of law to govern relations and establish justice between nations.  International obligations and commitments freely undertaken should be fully respected.  In the relations between nations we believe that dialogue should replace confrontation. Every effort should be made to ease tensions. The growth of a network of mutually beneficial economic and other relations between states and groups of states can greatly help.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking these are the outlines of what I would regard our foreign policy to be and the lines on which I would hope to see it proceed.  Certainly it may seem idealistic to think along these lines.  I, certainly as a person, have no illusions about its success.  One must set targets and at the same time have a realistic appreciation of the difficulties of achieving targets of this kind, particularly in an age as at present where tensions are growing and the international climate is deteriorating. However, I feel that as a small country we must never cease to emphasise the ideal objectives and the moral objectives.</P>
    <P>On that aspect I must take issue with Senator Murphy in regard to our UN attitudes. Our attitude in disarmament motions and in regard to apartheid is one of giving totally constructive support for resolutions dealing with disarmament and in regard to apartheid and we have resolutely and totally supported and approved all resolutions genuinely put down in a constructive way in this respect.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years, out of about 80 resolutions on disarmament we only voted against one which we regarded as a frivolous resolution.  Frivolous resolutions do arise in all institutions as we know.</P>
    <Col N="1450" />
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we should have abstained on a frivolous motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either abstained or voted against it.  Certainly out of 80 resolutions over two years on disarmament we voted positively in 1979 or 1980 and our record in regard to apartheid is the very same.  I think that there is no doubt in anybody's mind in Ireland and in the world about where we stand on both of these issues.</P>
      <P>One of my predecessors, Mr. Frank Aiken, took a positive lead in the whole area of disarmament leading up to the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty and subsequent to that we have consistently moved positively in this area.  I referred to it in detail yesterday in reply to a question in the Dáil.  Our record stands very high in the whole area of disarmament in all its aspects, both in regard to proliferation, in regard to testing, in regard to the nuclear end, in regard to the proliferation of conventional weapons.  Similarly, our record on apartheid is good.  Again I take issue here with Senator Murphy although it is not strictly in accordance with the motion. I had occasion yesterday to reply to a question in the Dáil on our policy on apartheid, which is essentially a moral stand.  We are opposed to any form of racial discrimination such as exists in South Africa; we will continue to adopt all means that we have at our limited disposal to discourage the continuation of that type of development and to discourage any association with the authorities there that might seem in any way to encourage apartheid or to lead people to believe that apartheid in any form can continue to be a part of what we regard as acceptable.</P>
      <P>I know that I strayed away from the motion but the matter was raised by Senator Murphy.  Even though we are a small State we do have a very positive moral attitude in areas of this kind.  I hope that there will be unanimous consensus in this House and in the other House and within the country at large in support of that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member state of the European <Col N="1451" /> Community, we try to advance this point of view and indeed our militarily neutral position has helped in this respect also in that in a Community of Nine, where we have a contribution to make as a small disinterested country, we can voice our views, without having a vested interest, on many issues and thereby be taken as an honest broker in many areas within the Community.  At present the Community is seeking to evolve a higher degree of political co-operation and this is part of our commitment to membership of the Community, to consult as far as possible and to co-ordinate as far as possible on foreign policy with our partners within the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not decided in 1972?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial majority of our people supported that approach in 1972.  I happened to participate in that particular campaign and at no stage did any people supporting our entry into Europe suggest that we would not participate in political co-operation with the other countries within the Community with whom we wished to join.  We have joined with them since and have participated honourably in political co-operation that does not involve in any way defence commitment <i>vis-a-vis</i> NATO or any other military alliance.</P>
      <P>There is a very positive difference here.  We can do positive good in political co-operation and that is a totally separate matter from the question of membership of a military alliance such as exists between a number of our partners in the Community and North American nations.  It is an entirely separate matter and I want to emphasise again here, as I said yesterday in the Dáil, that there is absolutely no political pressure now, nor has there been any political pressure from any source, on us as a nation to participate in NATO or in any other form of military alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to a point I made some minutes ago, our position is a positive asset within the Community in putting certain points of view and in advocating <Col N="1452" /> certain measures, being outside the NATO involvement, which do involve most major Community partners.  It is a positive asset to them and to us, in enabling us to take a particular type of stance in particular areas, being recognised as not being involved in any military, defence or any other entanglement of that kind.</P>
    <P>I regard our membership of the Community in that respect as far from being a constraint.  That is looking at it rather negatively which I feel people sometimes do.  Senator Murphy did, to some extent. I do not look at this in a negative manner at all.  Our membership of the Community must be looked at in a positive way.</P>
    <P>In political co-operation we can make a positive contribution by influencing negative thinking to come around to a more positive orientation and this is a contribution as far as we are concerned, rather than having a negative approach of staying in our corner and not engaging in fruitful political co-operation talks. It provides us with a significant opportunity to work together with our partners as far as we can to promote the broad aims that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the world has shrunk in many ways.  That I take it is the spirit of the Seanad motion. Problems, even in distant countries affect us almost immediately today. Problems in Iran and Afghanistan have an immediate effect on us here and elsewhere in the world.  That is why the motion is very valid in emphasising this interdependence which I would like to emphasise here.  Senator Murphy referred to an independent foreign policy&mdash;one can pursue a positive policy but it must recognise the fact that we are all interdependent today.</P>
    <P>This is a tiny trading country on the fringe of Europe, within the European Community.  It is a country very involved in this whole process of interdependence. To operate an independent foreign policy <i>per se</i>, irrespective of recognition of the fact that we are part of a very inderdependent world would be a <Col N="1453" /> futile type of exercise.  That is a debating-society type exercise which I certainly do not approve.  We should not automatically project an independent policy for academic self-pleasure or indulgence or merely to project such a policy without regard to the realities of the world in which we live and the realities of the interests of the Irish nation. I regard enlightened self-interest as consistent with having a moral approach. Legitimate self-interest and a moral approach are the two concepts which should form the basis of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>As far as Iran is concerned, there is no question but that there is a chaotic situation in that country.  We have nothing but the height of goodwill for the people of Iran.  We fully accept their right to a Government in which their rights will be recognised and their political and social structures can be properly organised as well as their own religious and cultural traditions.  At the same time, it is important that the respect internationally for the rights of others, which is a fundamental principle governing the relations within nations of people, should be emphasised here.  One of the great principles in this respect is the recognition of the independence of diplomats and citizens of another country residing in a particular country.  This applies across the world and it has been recognised as a precent of international relations for centuries, not just in recent years.</P>
    <P>In holding hostages, American diplomats and other citizens since early November, the people who have occupied the American Embassy in Teheran certainly have not shown respect for these basic rights and their action in that respect must be deplored.  Immunity of diplomats is basic to international relations. International relations involve having people on the ground to carry out the necessary work.  It is more than obvious that international relations, which are tenuous enough at present, would cease to function without basic ground rules which have existed over centuries in <Col N="1454" /> regard to diplomats and their immunity. The Iran situation cannot but be deplored in that respect.  If that sort of treatment of diplomats in embassies becomes a more general way of treatment in revolutionary and quasi-revolutionary situations then, obviously, the whole basis of diplomatic relations will be seriously impaired.  We have made our position quite clear in regard to Iran and the holding of the hostages there.  We fully support all the countries of the world that have deplored that action. However, I would hope that, in Iran, there may be still some hope that the crisis can be resolved without further loss of life or trouble.  The election, by a large majority, of Mr. Bani Sadr as President and his known commitment to establishing the democratic authority of the Presidency and restoring the rule of law are hopeful signs.  It is true that the hopes many had placed in the UN Commission have been disappointed.  It is true also that there have been some other discouraging developments in statements recently.  Nevertheless, if a careful and patient approach is adopted and if the President is allowed to strengthen and reassert his position, we may arrive at a situation where the release of the hostages can be secured.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned, in co-operation with our partners in the European Community, we have tried to promote a peaceful solution and a restoration of respect for international law.  We have had an embassy in Teheran and a Chargé d'Affaires there for some years who during the months of November and December, in particular, as we held the Presidency of the EEC, had to act in a very key role as representing the Community.  The Chargé d'Affaires, during a very difficult period, at the end of last year, conducted these negotiations on behalf of the Community in a very commendable manner. I wish to say that here and pay tribute to him.</P>
    <P>In regard to Afghanistan and the Soviet military intervention there, of course&mdash;and we have expressed this view in statements both on a national basis and on a Community basis&mdash;it is a <Col N="1455" /> completely unacceptable breach of international principle.  It was a naked display of strength and force, not based on any principle whatever, with a total disregard and disrespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the independence of a neighbouring State.  That sort of massive military intervention has been deplored rightly by us and by all sensible nations throughout the world who came together in a very substantial vote within the United Nations to indicate clearly their view of the Soviet action.  However, it is important also that the response from powers throughout the world to that action, deplorable as the action was, should be of a measured and sensible kind.  Within the Community we have supported very strongly the whole idea of a neutral status for Afghanistan and seeking to promote a situation where there would be disengagement by the Soviet forces and the gradual evolution of an Afghanistan on the lines of Austria in the middle of Europe, whose neutrality was respected with the support of the major powers.  It may seem like an idealistic objective but it is one to which we have made a commitment as a nation and to which the Community as a whole have made a commitment and which remains a positive response to the action taken by the Soviets.  So far we await a Soviet response to that action.</P>
    <P>Our position, therefore, in regard to Afghanistan is quite clear.  It is apparent that any deterioration in the situation there could have, to put it very bluntly, disastrous effects on the rest of that part of the world.  One is then into an area of serious tension involving Pakistan, India, the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in general.  So that any further deterioration in Afghanistan&mdash; and, indeed, this applies also to Iran &mdash;could result in a domino situation in the whole Gulf State area in the Middle East which could lead the world into a very, very serious situation.</P>
    <P>That sort of growth of tension is what we have to avoid.  That is why it is important, both in regard to Afghanistan and in regard to Iran, to have cool political leadership.  The European Community <Col N="1456" /> is equipped to give that type of leadership in this situation.  Any further escalation of that situation could lead to a quasi-doomsday position.  There are sufficient sophisticated armaments and thermo-neuclear weapons in the world to cause serious trouble if there is any escalation of the situation in that area. With the sort of matters that are at issue. particularly in regard to oil and energy, the whole situation demands a very cool sophisticated political approach and coming back to something Senator Murphy said earlier, not always declaring one's policy too much.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the world today to some degree foreign policy must continue to be&mdash;and, indeed, to an even greater degree than in the recent past&mdash;and maybe go back to what it used to be, a matter of personal relations, personal exchanges; making progress inch by inch on the basis of personal diplomatic exchanges and personal relations, rather than making statements and declarations as to a particular country's foreign policy or attitudes.  To a greater extent today than ever before, future peace will depend on the interrelations of statesmen, without formal communications, communiques or declarations.  This is one of the purposes behind the European Councils and the Summit meetings.  Meetings of that kind can do far greater good than structured meetings where attitudes are set and tend to be set pieces because countries have set declarations and set policies on foreign policy.</P>
    <P>That type of approach can become self-defeating, nugatory and negative and can lead to a situation where decisions cannot be made.  I say that advisedly because one of my peers at present said that within the European Community, by reason of this lack of sufficient exchange between people, this lack of exchange of views between personalities at the top as Foreign Ministers and as heads of states, there tends to be a freezing of attitudes, an atrophying of the system.  I personally see that that can be very dangerous, if with over-institutionalised systems we over-emphasise <Col N="1457" /> a particular national foreign policy.  It is far more sensible to adopt a pragmatic attitude and a flexible attitude and seek to get solutions as they can be got and to move forward, inch by inch towards any given objective or any given solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases, yes.  This notion of projection of foreign policy and projection of diplomacy and engaging in public in diplomatic and political activity between nations can be very dangerous.  I take that view advisedly and seriously.</P>
      <P>Some other matters were raised.  The question of the Olympic Games is a classical example of what I have just mentioned.  There is absolutely no reason in the world why at this stage we should make any decision as a Government in regard to the Olympic Games.  It is a matter for each national Olympic Committee whether to send or not to send their athletes to Moscow.  This does not arise until 24 May which is the final date for the receipt of entry applications from countries seeking to compete in Moscow.  We as a member of the Community are very keen on participating with other members of the Community in a common attitude to this matter.  In the Community we have decided to reserve our position, and Ireland has taken an attitude in this.  I personally have.  I believe it would be very nonsensical for us to take a public attitude at present in a matter of this kind, because there are many implications involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we would wish naturally to see the Olympic Games take place, we believe in <i>detente.</i>  We believe in peace between East and West and a greater flow of trade and people and information between East and West.  At the same time, the United States of America is a major investor in this country, an important friend of this country.  We feel very strongly that the Community as a whole should take a political view of this matter at the end of the day.  The end of the day does not arise until 24 May.  In the interim <Col N="1458" /> period we are testing out the bona fides of the Soviet Union in regard to its behaviour in Afghanistan.  If the test of the Soviet Union's bona fides show that there are none, if there is no move towards or indication of disengagement on the part of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan between now and 24 May, then there is a strong probability that the Olympic Games in Moscow would be meaningless anyway.  Large numbers of nations will refuse to go there.</P>

That is precisely the situation and we are presenting it in that way.</P>

That is positively a worked out position. We are not alone in that.  It is precisely the same position as has been adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany. We are in good and sensible company in that respect.  Both countries have adopted almost precisely the point of view that I have mentioned and have pushed that point of view within the Community. We are adopting a stance of that kind which is separate from the stance adopted by the British who have tended to be pro-American and the stance adopted by the French which has tended to be the other way.  The stance I have mentioned as being the German and Irish stance that has been precisely our approach. I think it does make sense having <Col N="1459" /> regard to the complexities of the situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey, who proposed the motion, very ably talked about the question of cutting off other trade and cultural links with Soviet Russia.  We have moved in this respect on a Community basis.  All that the United States of America asked the European Community to do was not to substitute for the cutting off of American exports to Soviet Russia.  This applied in particular to grain exports which the United States cut, and the Community said, &ldquo;Right we will not substitute for that; we will not fill the shortfall of American grain exports to Russia&rdquo;.  With regard to other exports in the non-substitution category we and the other Community countries are continuing to export.  Dairy products are continuing to go to Eastern Europe and other exports are continuing from all Community countries.  All the United States of America asked us to do was not to substitute for their cut-off in regard to exports.  That the Community has done, and that is all we are doing. All of this is a delicate balance between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned at any rate, we deplore the action of the Soviet Union.  I believe very strongly anyway that they will learn to deplore it themselves.  It is quite obvious now that they have made a gross error of judgment in the whole matter of Afghanistan. While I deplore that completely and while we should take what actions we can in regard to the matter, at the same time <i>detente</i> is a very important development and the whole <i>detente</i> that has been built up between East and West has led to an expansion of trade and investment <Col N="1460" /> which should not be switched off automatically.  I believe in a series of sophisticated responses in a subtle way to matters of this kind.  We cannot just drift into a world war situation having regard to the hardware that is available to countries at the present time.  The very existence of that hardware, in my view, has led the world into an area of diplomatic responsibility and subtlety and sophistication where responses are now calculated in a sensible way.</P>
      <P>This again comes back to my point of view that this sort of thing cannot be conducted in public either.  Again it depends on a subtle knowledge of what is going on in the other person's mind, what is not going on in the other person's mind, how the response should be made, how diminished should it be, how escalated should it be, up by 1 or 2 per cent, down by 1 or 2 per cent.  That is exactly the way modern diplomacy is being conducted and has to be conducted.</P>
      <P>If we adopt a simplistic approach we are into a crazy area of tension and a crazy area of war of a kind that never before confronted mankind.  The whole effort must be the exercise of human intelligence and ingenuity and contact between people in key areas backed up by crucial advice, utilising the communications that exist in the world to prevent that sort of situation happening.  That is not the type of thing you can prevent out in the open by public debate.  I do not like saying that but that is a fact and it has been my experience in my brief few months in my present position.  I hold very firmly to the way I have described as a practical way to go forward, particularly as far as a small country is concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey spoke about foreign policy being communicated to the people. I have spoken sufficiently on that already.  I believe it should be communicated to the people in broad principle but that the day-to-day decisions and the day-to-day movements and exchanges need not necessarily be communicated and, indeed, should not be in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> The question of oil was raised by Senator Hussey.  Oil and the related energy area are the crucial problems of our time.  This is why the Middle East problem, which is not referred to in the motion, is one which should really be settled, because unless we get stability in the whole Saudi-Gulf-Jordan-lraq, Syria-lsrael-Lebanon area and a negotiated peace settlement in that area, then there is obvious tinder there and the risk of a really serious war.  I regard the two matters in the motion of Afghanistan and Iran as very important matters.  But the one I have just mentioned is as important if not more important still and it is the real flashpoint as far as the survival of the world is concerned, and in particular as far as the survival of Western Europe and the European Economic Community are concerned.</P>
    <P>The European Economic Community is now reaching a very strong consensus on the need to have a negotiated settlement in the Middle East that will recognise the need for a homeland for the Palestinian people and also a guarantee as far as the territorial integrity of Israel is concerned.  There is no incompatibility whatever between the two.  Indeed, it is in Israel's own interest as a small country among a number of Arab nations to have such a guarantee of her frontiers and her territorial integrity with the other Arab nations along with provision for the Palestinian people.  It is in recognition of the fact that there is no incompatibility in this objective.  There is a very strong Community view on this at present and the views I have expressed in this regard are exactly the views of all the other countries within the Community. This is a positive Community attitude that will be formulated into a constructive and detailed policy in the months ahead.  It is a psychological question of convincing the nations in the area that this is the right thing to do from the point of view of all of them, from the point of view of Israel and all of the Arab nations and from the point of view of providing a homeland for the Palestinians.  The right thing to do is to reach a negotiated peace settlement in <Col N="1462" /> the area with positive, permanent guarantees written in by all the major powers concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to make these remarks.  From time to time I strayed from the motion but the points were raised by both Senator Hussey and Senator Murphy.  I am very grateful to them for giving me the opportunity to speak here and I will be glad to hear the views of other Senators.</P>

      <P>I, too, should like to express appreciation to the proposer and seconder of this motion for putting it down and enabling this debate to take place and principally for the opportunity it gave the Minister to tell us what the Government's foreign policy is in relation to the two countries mentioned in the motion and the issues which arise from the events taking place in those two countries.  Up to now we have all generally regarded the world as being divided into a number of power blocs: the Eastern bloc, the Western bloc, and then the non-aligned group of countries. Having listened to the Minister I am afraid I cannot put Ireland into any of those recognised categories.  That may be deliberate but it is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt as to where we should be in these matters of foreign policy.  I have no doubt that, for a number of reasons, we should be aligned clearly and unequivocally with the Western bloc.  We are inclined to forget the true nature of Communism.  We are inclined to forget that the dominating imperative of that philosophy is to spread itself throughout the world.  Any person who values freedom has an obligation to fight against that in whatever way it befalls him.  Senators do not have to take my word for it that that is the motive and aim of the philosophy of Communism. We have only to read the writings of people such as Solzhenitsyn and the other Soviet academics and philosophers who have suffered because of the type and nature of the Communist ideology, the lack of freedom, the slavery imposed on people who have to live within that system.  Every day there are further examples  <Col N="1463" /> of it.  Indeed, it is ironic that this debate could not take place in the Soviet Union.  If by any chance it did, the only person who might have spoken with safety would have been the seconder of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apology for making the case that this country should align itself unequivocally with the Western bloc, and that principally means the United States.  We in this country in particular owe a great debt of gratitude to the United States.  I do not have to recall that the United States provided a home for millions of Irish people who had nowhere else to go.  We are sometimes inclined to forget that the United States, because of its free society, enabled the majority of those people to prosper and permitted them to share their prosperity with us.  America has contributed greatly to the growth and present well-being of this country, such as it is.  The demands and obligations of gratitude fall to be observed by nations as much as by people.  That is one point we have to remember when we are considering where we should align ourselves in international affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country and the other countries of Western Europe seem to forget that a comparatively few years ago this entire Continent was menaced by Fascism. There is no doubt that if it were not for the intervention of the United States Western Europe would have been overrun by Nazi-ism.  We know the horrors of that system.  The cynic may say that America intervened purely so that it could maximise its economic profit later on.  I would prefer to give America credit for intervening to preserve a free society, the type of society that exists in the United States, to preserve the freedom of the western world.  Whatever the reason, we have to remember, and it is appropriate for us to remember with gratitude, that it was American intervention in the Second World War that ensured the forces of democracy and <Col N="1464" /> freedom would come out successful from that struggle.</P>
    <P>In 1945 Europe was a mountain of rubble and the people were destitute and, again, it was American aid that came and revived Europe.  The prosperity of the continent today can be traced back to the American aid and support that was available in those times.  Again, too, it was the American presence, military, financial and economic that ensured that the Russian menace stopped where it did stop.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the conduct of those two blocs, east and west, since those days and decide on which side we want to be.  Do we want to be neutral as against the eastern bloc when we bear in mind the ravages committed in Czechoslovakia, the outrages committed in Hungary, the swallowing up of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia?  Can we consider all that history of communism in action and decide that our position is to be neutral?  As I say, the obligations of gratitude, apart from the obligations of self-interest, demanded that we should align ourselves firmly in the American western camp.  For that reason I am disappointed that the Minister in his speech has been extremely vague, and possibly deliberately vague, as to where this Government stand in regard to what position we want to take in the world today as between the opposing blocs.  It is a matter of great disappointment to me because I have no doubt for the reasons of gratitude I have set out, where we should be.  Self-interest also demands that we should align ourselves publicly and visibly with the western bloc.  We are inclined to forget that the greatest amount of investment in this country, building up our industry and providing jobs for our people, has come from the United States.</P>
    <P>On the other hand if we look at our trading relations with Russia, we can see a serious imbalance that has existed since we commenced trading with that country.  We were under pressure for quite some time to exchange diplomatic representatives with the USSR and eventually, on the implicit promise of <Col N="1465" /> beneficial trading results, embassies were opened in the two countries.  Since that time the trade imbalance has persisted in favour of the Russians.  Bearing in mind that the original motivation for opening diplomatic relations was a trade one, I cannot see much justification for continuing those relationships much longer.</P>
    <P>The other matter that is current at the moment is the question of the Olympic Games and our attitude to it.  I must say I am disappointed that the Government are marking time as to what the official attitude of this country is going to be towards participation in those games. First of all, I go along completely with the Minister when he says that it will be the individual choice of the athletes concerned whether they travel or not.  That is part of their privilege of being free men in a free democracy.  They can go whether the Government want them to go or not to go.  I think the Government have an obligation to indicate to them whether they would like them to go or not.  They felt such an obligation and indicated to rugby players that they should not go to South Africa on the Lions tour. It is the Government's right to say that and it is a line with which many people would sympathise.  Again, it is for the individual rugby player to decide; it is a free choice of his own whether he goes or not.  The Government in that instance made their view clear.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to the Olympics the Government have not given any lead or lines to our athletes.  The Government should, and the line the Government should give our athletes is that they should not participate in the Olympic Games.  The Olympic Games are no mere ordinary athletic contest.  They are an exercise in chauvinism and that is very clear to any spectator who has observed the Olympic Games for the past decade or two.  The league table of nations, the playing of the national anthems, the politicising of the whole event, all go to show that the Olympic Games are no longer merely an athletic contest.  When the Russians stage this year's Olympic Games, it is going to be and will be seen as a political event, particularly <Col N="1466" /> in the light of developments in recent times.</P>
    <P>With that element present, if we are to have a firm policy we will have to indicate to our athletes what they should do.  I firmly believe the indication our Government should give is that they should not go and should give that indication as a gesture of solidarity with the western world and in particular with the United States, a country to which we and the entire western world owe an immense debt.  We owe that debt for what America has done for us.  We owe that debt for reasons of self-interest.  America is our bulwark and our protection against the expansion of communism.  I am well aware that what I am saying is possibly regarded as out-of-date and unfashionable but I am certainly not going to put myself in the position of trying to walk a middle line between east and west because having regard to the ideology of the east there is no middle line for a person to take if he is conscious of freedom and if he wants to see democracy preserved. Consequently, I make no apology for urging the Minister now to align this country quite positively with the western bloc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>With other speakers I welcome this motion.  I fully appreciate Senator Hussey's sentiments that we are a small country but have much influence and that we should use it and let our voice be heard.  Like any other Member of this House I agree with that sentiment but I question whether our voice is best heard by shouting out here in public expressing our views about the attitudes of different nations.  Perhaps we could give a more sane and stable contribution at meetings in the Council of Europe and elsewhere.  That is my view but I accept that others may have different views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Iran which the Minister has dealt with, like others I deplore the holding of diplomats for many months now.  Diplomatic immunity has been a tradition for many, many years, certainly throughout this century.  There seems to me to be some <Col N="1467" /> degree of futility in endeavouring to negotiate with people who themselves are not in control of their own country. The tradegy of the American diplomats is that they were next to being a write-off the day the new elements took over in that country and I cannot see what purpose can be served in hoping to negotiate with people who make demands which everybody knows will not be conceded. The situation in Iran in relation to the American diplomats is similar to the situation that is developing in many other countries where people are being kidnapped and held to ransom either for political motives or for commercial reasons.  It is the same type of gangsterism that seems to be developing and it is a great pity to see how frequently people tend to surrender to this kind of action.</P>
    <P>In the area of our own involvement which is principally in Europe, since we joined the European Community we have been playing a reasonable, sane and constructive role despite the fact that in our own country Ireland's situation within the Community tends to be belittled by some of our own people.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience over a couple of years that in the committees of the European Community the spokesmen of the smaller countries get a hearing.  Probably one of the reasons they get a hearing, possibly out of proportion to their influence or strength in numbers, is that the representatives of the larger countries in Europe are conscious of the fact that they made a mess of their own affairs during this century on several occasions, that they resorted to war when none of the small nations wanted it.  I find that feeling alive in Europe today among the major countries. It is wrong to belittle the influence that Ireland and Irish spokesmen can have in influencing the affairs and the future of Europe because European statesmen even today are conscious of a sense of guilt on both sides that they were not able to avoid catastrophe.</P>
    <P>In the case of Afghanistan, it is useful that the Minister should set out the <Col N="1468" /> Government's attitude.  I tend to deplore the headlines one gets in relation to Afghanistan when one considers small nations that were taken over in the past 40 years by Russia about whom nobody ever hears anything.  How many of the youth of today have ever heard of Es-thonia, Latvia or Lithuania?  As I said earlier, to express frank views about these issues may not necessarily help in the process of developing a sane and constructive policy in Europe and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Afghanistan seems to be in a similar situation to that of the eastern European countries which are still under Soviet influence and of the other small countries that were occupied by Russia in the past 40 years.  There does not seem to be any difference between the policy of Russia today and the policy of Russia under the Tsars.  If any country on the borders of the Russian empire was independent it was seen to be dangerous to Russia and to Russian power and influence.  That is the sad situation.  It is not necessarily a question of communism; it is more a question of power and of the constant fear in the mind of the Russian Government that if they allow anything independent to exist on their borders, they are in danger.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate people of Afghanistan are caught up in a situation which arises out of what Senator Cooney was talking about in terms of future conflict in this world, of a division and of a power struggle.  Any of us can speculate about the motives behind this. It can be the one that I have mentioned, that any danger of any element taking over in Afghanistan that might become independent of Russia would be intolerable to Russia.  It may be that the events in Iran itself causing doubt, fear and possibly suspicion in Russia may have encouraged it or it may be that the long-term objective on the part of Russia of getting into the southern waters was the motive.  All that can be done by peaceful nations and by small States is to set out, as our Minister has done, our view on how wrong it is.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the <Col N="1469" /> question which has already come up a couple of times about our neutrality.  The present neutrality of this small State in the European Community is a benefit to Europe.  I deplore the efforts that are made by elements here to run down the Irish stance in this area.  I agree that we have a good deal for which to be grateful to the United States but I do not think that should involve us in the assumption that the world is going to be torn to bits again by world powers.  There is an onus on us as one of the small countries to try at least to think in terms of something other than world war.  The viewpoint that I have heard expressed by Senator Cooney seems to be based on an assumption that there will be a war and that we should line up in it, whereas the entire policy as I understand it that has been put forward in relation to our membership of the United Nations and the European Community has been one of trying to bring reason and discussion into the international forum.  The worst thing that, even a small country could do, is to start taking open sides on the assumption that war is inevitable, because if all nations did that it would make war inevitable.</P>
    <P>The contribution that has been made since we became a member of the European Community has been worth while. I believe the direction that the Council of Ministers have been taking in international affairs on political issues has been a sane, sensible and mature approach. I support that approach and I believe that we have a part to play in it.  I would encourage the Minister to continue along the lines that he has been following in relation to the Middle East, to Afghanistan and to the role that the European Community can play in maintaining a stable world, in ensuring that if some elements in the world do lose their heads, as happened twice during this century, perhaps it may be possible for Europe to set an example and to remain outside such an appalling conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity provided by this motion to discuss our foreign policy and, in particular, <Col N="1470" /> Ireland's response to the political situation in Iran and Afghanistan.  Before turning more specifically to these two issues, I would like to refer to the contribution made by the Minister.  I think the value of having a motion for debate in this House is to get the opportunity of hearing the Minister outline his approach and the principles on which he bases his approach to foreign policy.  There was a good deal of vague and general comment on this which is perhaps understandable because it is a very general subject.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested and intrigued by his emphasis that his own personal approach was very much on the importance of private, informal contacts. He emphasised the importance of personal relations of a &ldquo;non-talking&rdquo; variety with the emphasis on private meetings.  I wonder what <i>Private Eye</i> might make of that as an approach to external affairs? The sense of what he conveyed was that he places a great deal of importance on private, flexible, informal meetings and in this context he mentioned specifically the European Council and its development. I was certainly surprised at that because, as I understand it, there is a very considerable danger to a small country like Ireland precisely in the development of the European Council as a relatively non-institutionalised forum where, in reality, the larger countries can exert far too much sway.  It has always been my own judgment that Ireland should not view with enthusiasm, and should view with a great deal of concern, that particular development of the European Council.  Now the tendency of the European Commission is to put forward more directly its proposals to the European Council rather than through the in-stitutionalised, sometimes slow, but carefully structured system of the normal Councils of Ministers, thus upsetting that balance which has been very carefully created and which we looked at very deliberately before joining the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been bringing groups of law students in successive years to visit the EEC countries.  I brought a group there this month.  One part of the visit is a <Col N="1471" /> meeting with the Irish permanent representation in Brussels where members of staff of the representation, and very often the Ambassador himself as happened on this occasion, meet with the law students and discuss the issues.</P>
    <P>This year, as in the previous years that I can recall, a good deal of emphasis was placed on a concern precisely about the development of the Community in the more private, political sphere of meetings in the European Council as causing a good deal of worry about safeguarding and protecting the interests of small countries and the balance in the Community.  I feel that it may be possible in that kind of gathering for a small independent country like Ireland to exert some useful pressure and to try to steer other countries in a particular direction but there are also very grave worries particularly in the European Community context of a lack of institutional protection. I continue to view more with concern the development of the European Council and less that it is a good political development at the European Community level.</P>
    <P>The Minister identified the principles underlying his approach to foreign policy.  I do not disagree with any of those.  They are all basically good things, against sin and for self-determination by small countries, for protection of human rights but one has to look through them for a particular emphasis, for a particular focus.  What I hoped to see, because I believe this is the greatest challenge in our foreign policy and indeed the greatest challenge in world relations, was more of an emphasis on the need for a restructuring in the economic order of the world, a restructuring to bring together in an integrated way the north and south.  We have the benefit now of the Brandt Commission Report which is still not freely available in this country but there are some copies in circulation. I had intended to table a motion seeking a debate on the report and recommendations of the Brandt Commission because I think it is one of the most important documents that has come on the world scene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be available at a relatively early date for a debate on that report.  In Ireland we must have a very acute sense of that as the greatest challenge and we must use our resources as a country in the level of our development aid.  Here again I think the level is disappointing, if not shameful, in the light of the kind of commitment that is necessary but we must also use our moral voice and the fact that we are not a member of a military alliance, we are not a member of NATO. I agree with those who emphasised this and who said that in a very positive way we must use the fact that we are nonmembers of NATO, and not be overdefensive about it.  We must have a clear and forward-looking policy on that basis and have a better possibility of a closer relationship with a number of non-aligned and developing countries precisely because we are a non-member of NATO and have not felt it necessary to be a member of NATO.  It is rather disappointing to get the impression from the Spanish negotiations for membership of the Community that they feel that they will have to become a member of NATO.  In discussions in Spain before Christmas, I was impressed with the fact that although nobody had said they must become a member of NATO they appeared to feel that as part of membership of the European Community there was some kind of political obligation on them.  Ireland should use its own experience and commitment as a country to make it clear that there is no requirement to belong to a military bloc, no requirement to become a member of NATO, and that it is possible to fulfil the full obligations of membership, and possibly give a greater contribution in the Committee on Political Co-Operation or the other meetings at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning more directly to the two issues mentioned in the motion, Iran and Afghanistan, they are in many ways different. Each of them is a complex subject. I cannot blame the movers of the motion for grouping them together <Col N="1473" /> because we all too rarely get these opportunities. I think it was right to put them together in a motion for the purposes of clarifying Ireland's foreign policy and response on these issues.  I believe that this needs to be done because a great deal of the public media comment, not so much direct media comment in this country as the kind of comment that comes over the wires&mdash;Reuters and the United Press Agency comment&mdash;is very much conditioned by the American response and the fact that it is an American election year.  This has undoubtedly heightened the tension at one level and has not helped the more mature and considered response to the crisis in both these areas. If I could deal briefly with each of them in that particular framework.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the situation in Iran.  Before the capturing of the hostages in the embassy there was an insensitivity to the situation developing in Iran, which led to an enormous resentment, particularly against the United States, but also against western countries. In that instance, the European Community could have done more to enter into closer links at that time with Iran and to break down this monolith of a capitalist western world which had no sympathy for Iran as a developing country, which had sought to achieve its own autonomy and which was with difficulty establishing its institutional and economic structures.</P>
    <P>This has led to an act which must be condemned unequivocally, namely, the capturing of hostages, of individual innocent victims in the circumstances, and holding them in a way that is extremely serious because of the possible spin-off effect or trigger effect it may have in other countries, because of the deep suffering of the hostages and of their families.  Europe had, before that particular incident and has now to a very, very serious degree, a responsibility to enter into very close contact, not only with Iran but also with other countries in that part of the world so that there will be an avoidance of these chasms of <Col N="1474" /> culture, an avoidance of the kind of outraged response of a people when they feel threatened by a capitalist western bloc.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the response to Afghanistan has been to some extent hypocritical at world level.  There has been a substantial Russian presence in Afghanistan for a very considerable time and the world was not concerned enough in that.  Indeed most people did not know where Afghanistan was on the map. Afghanistan is like a number of other countries where unless there is a very high degree of self interest, as there is, because of the sensitivity of that area of the world, we do not care enough about the situation of the peoples and of their aspirations for government or autonomy.</P>
    <P>We are overreacting now to a certain extent because this has happened during an election year in the United States because for a President in office there is the tendency to make statements on these issues to evoke a general loyalty from the people of the United States; and for political opponents seeking office, whether within his own party or in the opposition party, there is the tendency, indeed the inevitability, that they will simplify the issues, that they will make simple statements on what are extremely complex and extremely difficult issues.</P>
    <P>These factors would lead me to take a very different line from that adopted by Senator Cooney.  Far from seeking to identify ourselves with some very coherent western bloc, as I listened to Senator Cooney it seemed clear to me that the western bloc is the United States full stop.  There was a complete overlap in his approach to the words &ldquo;western bloc&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo;. Far from a simplistic identification with a western bloc in Senator Cooney's sense I believe what is needed is a Europe which from its own maturity, diversity and its closer links with the countries in these sensitive areas, should try to play an important role in lessening world tension, in promoting the need, yes, for the recognition both of individual <Col N="1475" /> human rights and of the collective rights of the peoples of those countries. That should be done in a way which is more likely to achieve not only the objectives of the people there but also the peace and security of the world. There should be polite but Firm resistance to any attempt to heighten world tension because of the electoral situation in the United States or because it is reported in a flashy way, by way of headlines.</P>
    <P>Europe should also take a much more mature and prudent approach to events like the Olympic Games.  It is impossible to calculate what the outcome would be of a general world boycott of the Olympic Games.  We know what the Olympic Games are.  We know the prestige the Soviet Union invests in them.  We know that the concept of amateur sportsmen and women differs very much from country to country and from bloc to bloc within the eastern countries.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a great deal of idealism, of coming together of young people, of very understandable and valuable aspirations of young people.  It would be enough to have registered, as undoubtedly the world has registered, the condemnation, such as in the United Nations Resolution on the Invasion of Afghanistan.  I would certainly agree with the word used by the Minister in his speech on the invasion of Afghanistan.  It has been a very substantial blunder by the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>That does not make it any less dangerous or worrying for the world because it is not so easy sometimes to retrieve a blunder or to stay on a very difficult wicket.  The skill at the moment will be to try to ensure that it is possible to create either a neutral non-aligned Afghanistan or certainly to make it very clear to the Soviet Union that its presence there in a massive number of troops is unacceptable and that they will continue to pay a very high price.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one positive proposal arising out of this opportunity to debate Ireland's foreign policy, that is, that we increasingly need in Ireland an institute of international affairs.  This is <Col N="1476" /> not a new subject.  Three years ago I sat on a committee, which included the late and much lamented Ambassador Paul Keating when he was Secretary of the Department, and some senior members of the Department.  It included representatives of the universities in Dublin, of the Royal Irish Academy and politicians. It ended in a rather unsatisfactory solution that there would be an international committee of the Royal Irish Academy which would hold meetings on issues relating to foreign policy or international affairs.</P>
    <P>That is not adequate.  We need an independent institute with its own library and research facilities, its own capacity not only to examine Ireland's foreign policy in relation to what is happening in other countries but to link into a very, very useful system at the moment of institutes of international affairs.  There is a very close co-operation between Chatham House in London, Karl Kaiser's Institute in Germany, the Norwegian Institute, the Brookings Institute and the Institute of International Affairs in Japan.  They all have the kind of inter-relationship and exchange of papers and of researchers and documents which we lack.</P>
    <P>The fact that we do not have a counterpart here means that our foreign policy is not being evaluated and assessed independently and that our officials do not have this resource and potential library facilities.  I ask the Minister to see if it would be possible to provide this resource even within the present budgetary constraints, preferably by looking for support either from the private sector in Ireland or from the very foundations which have given money to other international institutions because they see the need for this kind of independent evaluation.  If I might end on a rather facetious note, if the Minister's approach is to be this intimate non-talking variety we badly need an institute of international affairs to evaluate that kind of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion, the explanations of the Government policy by the Minister and all the comments <Col N="1477" /> made by my colleagues in the Seanad.  It is very interesting to get this breadth of opinion and knowledge.  I look back.  I am one of the few Members who remember when Neville Chamberlain came back waving his umbrella exclaiming peace in our time and there was much to learn from that instance.</P>
      <P>Do we ever learn?  History repeats itself. In 1938 Neville Chamberlain was about to surrender Czechoslovakia to Hitler.  He described Czechoslovakia in a radio broadcast as a remote country of which we knew little.  If Czechoslovakia was remote in 1938, Afghanistan, without this type of debate, would seem equally remote in 1980.</P>
      <P>I can understand to a great extent the freezing of attitudes but I was pleased to hear the Minister is taking very seriously the strategic reasons why Soviet Russia has made this move.  I do not think it was a blunder, as referred to by Senator Robinson.  It is a well thought out strategic military move.  To balance that we should examine very carefully the strategic moves made by the Americans. After all, they are to a great extent self-sufficient as far as energy is concerned, at least much more so than Europe.  We are in a very difficult position regarding the take-over of the oil fields, referred to as a possibility by Senator Hussey.  I was looking forward to the SALT Treaty being ratified, performing goodwill and a stable relationship to ensure the maintenance of peace in my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Olympics are concerned, obviously too much emphasis has been put on the United States' attitude, concentrating on making a venue and not enough news has been put on the other strategic moves made by the United States.  While on the Olympic Games the time may have come for reappraisal of the whole objective of them.  As Senator Robinson said, the attitudes of the superpowers are different from those of the smaller countries who look upon them as games and still look upon them as something to win from an amateur status point of view.  If something positive comes out of this maybe it could be a <Col N="1478" /> reappraisal of the whole Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>I find the pressure in the agricultural Field by the Americans very interesting because people in the food industry suffered enormously from the great Russian grain robbery in 1973, which caused a world shortage of grain, leading to rapid inflation ahead of the actual energy crisis.  The price of flour rose even more rapidly than the price of energy did later on and had many implications.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that the European countries will not agree to substitute although they could not in any way substitute the amount of grain which had been held back by the Americans.  I believe it is 17 million tons of grain.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this makes a serious loss for the American farmers and one that they have shown themselves willing to accept.  The feeling is very deep in America to give up that potential.</P>
    <P>I am very glad of the positive attitude of the Minister.  Perhaps he cannot encourage the Americans to use the surplus now to bring down the price of grain in Europe and to service the Third World instead of either destroying it or storing it.  We should try and get some positive reactions out of this whole debacle and try to help normalise some of the things that have been aggravated because of the strategic moves by the Americans to try to bring the Russians to some common sense.</P>
    <P>We all know the American technology.  Drilling equipment and advanced electronics are fields in which America leads the world and in which Russia is lagging further and further behind.  Naturally we have encouraged investment in this type of activity by the Americans.  Obviously it would be very unwise, when the IDA have done such a wonderful job in encouraging American investment in Ireland, to defend them by taking any action which would be contrary to both their interests and our own interests in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to the <Col N="1479" /> postponement of the export of technology from this country for that reason.  Another factor is that President Carter has asked Congress for legal authority to register young American women and men for military service.  It would be an interesting study to see how women in America react to registration for military service.  This could provide quite an opportunity for study by other countries who will probably introduce this for both men and women.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Brugha because the prospects of a World War cannot be overlooked.  It must provide another key point regarding the necessity for a united Ireland.  The British Government must see the necessity to cultivate the support of our Government in achieving a solution to Northern Ireland in the context of the prospect of another World War.  We must realise that it would be impossible to remain neutral as Mr. de Valera did ingenuously during the last war.  I hope some positive action may arise out of this debate in keeping on friendly terms with the Americans to maintain their support for a political solution of the Irish question so that we are not torn by civil war if and when the two superpowers clash with each other in military combat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The dramatic events in Iran and Afghanistan have compelled most observers of the world scene to change their views on future development of world policies and their affect on the world balance of power.  The dramatic experience of the Vietnam war shook the United States belief in the efficacy of military power as an instrument of foreign policy.  The United States' attitude to the events in Angola in 1975 and Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa in 1978 hardened American opinion against the use of military force to assist allies in the Middle East and in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all that change, with the occupation of the US Embassy and detaining of the hostages in Teheran, the invasion of <Col N="1480" /> Afghanistan last November by the USSR brought a striking change in the United States' foreign policy and in the attitude of the administration, the Congress and the American people to the utility of military power in foreign policy even in this nuclear age.</P>
    <P>The Soviet Union has always maintained its projection beyond her borders as essential to Soviet foreign policy and long-term political goals.</P>
    <P>The invasion of Afghanistan and the proximity of Soviet forces to the Persian Gulf and the oil supplies vital to the west have changed the geopolitical equation. NATO and the defence of Europe must still be the most important commitment in American foreign policy, but perhaps the United States is beginning to recognise that it is not the only one. Security of energy resources and raw material supplies is now regarded as a high commitment by the whole NATO alliance.  There is a deplorable reluctance by America's partners in the alliance to give the tangible support that the changed world situation demands.  The forestructure of the United States and the European naval and maritime air capability must be adapted to meet this new challenge.</P>
    <P>I believe the cost of maintaining adequate defence forces in the NATO alliance in an era of rapidly advancing weapons technology and rising inflation presents problems more difficult to solve than those which confront the monolithic Soviet bloc.  I believe, having listened to the Minister's opening remarks on self-preservation, that there must be options which we as a small nation can surely take.  We cannot just sit as full partners in the Community, with the possibility of our Minister taking a stand in the United Nations, and see the invasion of a small independent State.</P>
    <P>This is the first time for many years that the Soviet troops have crossed the border of a State outside the Soviet bloc. Therefore, it is a serious threat to world peace.  The options open to us are that we make our voice effectively heard.  We have the tradition over the years since the time of Mr. de Valera and the League of <Col N="1481" /> Nations, and when Mr. Cosgrave led our delegation to the United Nations, and during the Ministry of Mr. Aiken and his tremendous success in spearheading the lead for disarmament and, indeed, in the more recent years of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, whose work evoked such tremendous response.  The Minister has the options and I believe that we must have firm economic, political and peaceful deterrents even in the cultural and propaganda area.  The only other alternative open to the free world is war, or the military deterrent.</P>
    <P>We must support and indeed compliment the measures already taken by the United States.  As the Minister has pointed out, the Community or this country must not sell grain to Russia.  Also, I would suggest we must not sell subsidised butter or beef to Russia.  I hope that the Council of Ministers will take a very firm decision on this.  The US grain ban, as Senator Lambert pointed out, is costing the United States economy a considerable amount of money, having regard to the vast tonnages that were involved. Therefore, I believe that we should show solidarity to the cause of the rights of the small nations.  Pious resolutions are not enough.  We should be prepared to give a back-up because we, as a small nation, have absolutely no defence against aggression of Russia, or any other super-power for that matter.</P>
    <P>We should state very clearly, as a matter of principle, that we will not sell banned goods or technology to the USSR.  Cultural exchanges should be shelved.  We should not send an Irish team to Moscow in July next.  Many people say that we should not mix politics and sport.  What are the alternatives?  Do the people who propagate that view think that we would be better off with conscription and getting involved in a military conflict?  It is all right when one is a couple of thousand miles away from the scene of the action.  These things can come much nearer to home, even by the Russians being able, in a few years' time, to take over the supplies of oil in Iran. That possibly is at the back of their minds and it could be a blow to our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> Afghanistan has been a buffer state for the past 160 years and has always been looked upon as such.  We must not hesitate to register every protest in our power against Russia sending in 105,000 troops to that country.  This Soviet precedent must not be allowed to go unnoticed. I was a little disappointed to read recently that we were the only pro-western State who found it necessary to sign an agreement with Russia, just a few weeks ago.  Surely that could have been deferred?  It is not enough to come out with pious platitudes.  We must be able to take a stand.  In any agreement that is signed with Russia, they have traditionally always got the better deal. There is an unfortunate imbalance in our trade with Russia.</P>
    <P>The scope of the motion is very restrictive but the Minister mentioned the Palestinian problem during the course of his address.  In regard to his now almost famous speech on his last State visit to Bahrain and the Middle East, I was particularly upset about the fact that the Minister was reported as advocating the re-partition of Jerusalem. From an Irish point of view this would imply that partition of this country is acceptable.</P>

It would be deplorable if we did not recognise, at all times, the rights of even a small state like Israel to have autonomy.  We must not be selective.  If we believe in the rights of one small state we must also believe in the right of the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the movers of the motion.  When it was placed on the Order Paper five or six weeks ago, it was quite topical.  The Seanad should have more opportunities for discussing foreign policy because there are many points which Senators can bring up and contribute.   <Col N="1483" /> It is not outside the realms of possibility that they might be helpful to the Minister when he comes to formulate his policy.  Government policies should reflect the views and aspirations of the people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be back very soon after the recess to discuss the six monthly reports&mdash;we are three in arrears now&mdash;on the European Community when we can have, perhaps, a discussion on another aspect of foreign policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving us an opportunity to discuss foreign policy.  Unfortunately, the motion is a bit restrictive in the sense that it mentions specifically Afghanistan and Iran.  Over the last few weeks people were talking about discussing the Afghanistan motion rather than discussing foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Foreign policy here is a two-tiered thing.  As a small country which has evolved from a revolutionary situation, we have a definite influence in world affairs. As a member of the larger grouping in Europe we have a very important part to play.  Our feelings on international policy will get through to some of the bigger countries who in the past were not without fault in regard to the colonisation of a large part of the world. Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and most of the members of the European Community were in a colonising situation at various times during their careers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate, in discussing this motion, that Afghanistan and the Olympics have been very much intertwined. Mention has been made that politics and sport should be or should not be separated.  There is absolutely no doubt but that politics and sport have been involved with each other for many years. It is not just now that politics has come into sport.  Looking at the Olympic Games, if one goes back to 1932, Pat O'Callaghan could not compete for Ireland in the Olympic Games because he was a member of a Thirty-two county organisation.  Today in the Olympic movement we have the analogous situation <Col N="1484" /> whereby if one boxes for Ireland one can compete for a Thirty-two county Ireland and where if one runs for Ireland, it is for a Twenty-six county Ireland.  Sport and politics are obviously very much intermingled.  The Olympic Committee might think that they are a separate body who have nothing to do with politics but they are dictated to by what are called political boundaries so, therefore, they are a politically oriented body.  Looking at some of the anomalies that come up, there is a famous picture of the start of the road race in 1960 in Rome, where a man named Crystal was involved in a little incident with the starters and now he has three sons.</P>

      <P>And a good pupil too. They compete for Ireland in a Thirty-two county situation.</P>
      <P>As to whether or not we go to the Olympic Games, that is a matter for the Olympic Committee in consultation with the Government.  Sports on an international level for many years has become something like the adult games that people play.  For years, all one could buy were kids games, but now the emphasis has changed to adult games, 90 per cent of which games tend to be war games or war situation games.  The Olympic Games have been for many years a war situation game where the major powers can fight each other on the field of endeavour in sport.  At the end it is not the sporting aspect that is remembered, but whether the western side won more gold medals than the eastern side, whether America had more gold medals than Russia and whether East Germany had more gold medals than West Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the starting of the Olympic Games was so that people could compete and mix in friendly competition where winning was not all.  Now winning in the Olympic movement is all. People give up their jobs, their humanity and their lives to fight in the war that is the Olympic Games.  Women take pills to get themselves into a masculine attitude, men take steroids so that they will <Col N="1485" /> put on big muscle and fat so that they can throw weights, emasculating themselves totally.  If that is not the negation of amateur athletics or amateur sport nothing else is.</P>
    <P>We should not equate the Olympic Games with the problem in Afghanistan. The problem in Afghanistan is that a major power invaded a sovereign State. We should condemn that wholeheartedly. If the United States were entering another sovereign State we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unreservedly go against that situation.  The Olympic Games should be left as a separate issue. The British Government are not terribly pleased with the situation in Afghanistan and the only way they are coming out against it in public is by suggesting that a British Olympic team does not go to Moscow.  Britain kept us out of the Olympic Games for many many years. When I say &ldquo;us&rdquo; I mean 32-county organisations.  Now they decide that because Afghanistan was invaded by Russia another country should be kept from the Olympics, or that a number of countries should be kept from the Olympics. In America last month in the artificial snow of Lake Placid there were Russian teams.  East German teams and African teams competing in the winter Olympics which is run by the same group who run the Olympic Games which, hopefully, are going to be held in Moscow.  I did not hear many protests from here or from anywhere else about the participation of Russia in Lake Placid.  When the Russian team arrived at Lake Placid they were there on American visas to compete, in an American situation, in Olympic Games. I cannot see what the difference is between keeping the sporting nations of the world out of Russia for one reason and allowing the whole lot of them into America at the same time.  It is rubbish. The Minister should advise the Government to let our athletes compete in the Olympics in Russia or wherever they are held.</P>

      <P>Hopefully that is what will happen.  In saying that I am not saying that what happened in Afghanistan is to be condoned.  But after all they are two totally separate issues.  People say that Afghanistan is a country of which we know little and which is very, very far away.  I am afraid it is a bit like the telephone, once it is in the house one lives with it.  It is in our house every night and every day when we turn on the radio or the TV set.  Very few people have not seen a map of Afghanistan at this stage on television, or have not seen what is happening in Kabul and various other places.  It is not very far away, nor is the danger of a world war very far away, not alone because of what is happening in Afghanistan but because of what is happening in Iran where, irrespective of the problems that have been created because of the imprisonment of the diplomats, there are still a large number of people being killed daily in that country, where there is a civil war situation to a large degree.  When Lord Mountbatten was killed here, it was Lord Mountbatten all over the papers and the 18 other people who were killed on the same day were very nearly forgotten.  The imprisonment of the hostages in Iran is the one thing that is keeping President Carter to the fore in American politics.  As long as they are there he will be to the fore.  That is why the hostages are being given the publicity.  Very little is being said about the many thousands of people who are being killed in Iran every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker spoke about the Palestinian issue.  The Palestinian issue is one that could be debated in this House. It is not alone the Palestinian issue, but an issue of worldwide compass.  The Palestinian people have every right to a homeland as have the Israelis.  The Middle East will not be a safe area, or an area of economic or political stability until the position of the Palestinian people as a whole is settled.  The Lebanon is a country which is divided into so many camps at this stage that one would not know where to begin or end to describe what is happening there.  In the Lebanon <Col N="1487" /> there are religious factions, military factions, international intervention by the United Nations, a puppet army set up by Major Hadad with Israeli help, the Syrian Army, Palestinian Left Wing rebel groups, and left wing groups from all over the world.  That is an area about which we should have as much concern as we have about Afghanistan, Iran or any other place in the world where there is conflict.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are discussing in a narrow way what is happening in Afghanistan and Iran is relevant.  But we should not forget that the world we live in is small and that the boundaries are getting smaller every day and that the conflict which has occurred in the Middle East and in the Far East might not be too far from our own door if we do not keep working very hard for peace in every place in the world.  Mention has been made of a policy of neutrality.  We should not have a policy of neutrality.  A policy of neutrality means that one sits on the fence all the time.</P>

To be neutral at times is not a bad thing.  But we should not have a policy of neutrality or intervention. What we should do, as has been done by Irish Government's in the past and by Irish Foreign Ministers, is have a policy of trying to persuade Governments and people that small countries have a part to play in international relations and that if they are part of bigger groupings they should use their influence within these bigger groupings to help to arrive at the stage where peace and stability will be available to people all over the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only one or two points.  Senator Murphy said that Afghanistan was ruled by mad mullahs <Col N="1488" /> and businessmen.  Maybe this was so until 1978 when there was a military coup and it was taken over by a Communist clique together with Teraki who was a poet as well as a politician and who was very left wing inclined.  In 1978 it certainly was governed in a left wing manner.  So much so that at the end of 1978 Teraki went to Moscow and was received by President Brezhnev.  On his return he found that his friend Amin&mdash;not Idi&mdash;had taken over control. Amin murdered Teraki on his return and at that stage the Soviets sent in about 8,000 troops.  Now they have sent in 105,000 troops.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I like Senator Lambert, also remember Munich.  I remember countries being taken over one by one. Afghanistan has been taken over now by the Soviets.  Unless we say we disagree and unless we agree with our friends and neighbours, the United States, I can see by the middle of 1980 other little countries being gradually taken over by the Soviets.  Now is the time to stand up and say that we do not approve of 105,000 or 108,000 troops being sent in to a small country like Afghanistan.  The Soviets have a three to one in tank advantage in Europe against the western side and if they go on producing their armaments at this pace, all of us will be in real trouble.</P>
      <P>Neutrality is marvellous on occasions but it is of interest to note that in the Second World War more people from the Republic went to join up to fight against what they thought was wrong, than from the North, who said they were members of the UK.  A great number of the members of the fighting forces came from the Republic.  What will happen when young women are registered for the armed forces?  In Britain in 1942 they were conscripted into the armed forces and they accepted this because they were up against it.  We are all up against it now and I am very worried indeed about what will happen in the eighties unless we, together with Europe and with the United States, which is much more important, take a very, very firm attitude on what is happening in Afghanistan now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the proposer and seconder of this motion for stimulating such an excellent and wide-ranging debate.  It shows the Seanad fulfilling its true role.  Foreign policy is not debated often enough in this Parliament by either House.  The Seanad, particularly, can do this in a low key way. The fact that a highly political motion is put down by Independent university Members means that it will be discussed in a non-party spirit and this greatly contributes to the tenor of the debate.  It has been an excellent debate and I congratulate the Minister, for not just sticking precisely to the terms of the motion, but for widening the scope and for giving us some insight into foreign policy in general.  The fact that the Minister has been a Member of this House gives him an appreciation of the way the Seanad debates such a motion as this and he has taken advantage of that.  It has been an excellent debate and, as a number of speakers have said, we look forward to other similar debates on foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Foreign policy changes as the balance of power changes, as the weapons stock changes, as the world changes and perhaps the time has come to consider that a country such as this can exert maximum political pressure without necessarily breaking off all the links with the country that pressure is being exerted upon.  I particularly talk about cultural and sporting links.  Economics get more closely aligned with politics, but I believe that it may well be advantageous to exert maximum political pressure and yet retain certain important cultural links, that in fact one may be doing more good in that respect than by cutting off all avenues of communication.  We may well be in that situation, at the moment, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have any particular love for Soviet policy, I think that the invasion of Afghanistan is a great crime and the fact that it is equalled by other crimes committed by other nations does not make it any less a crime.  I do not think anybody has attempted to justify the arguments that the Soviets have put forward for taking over Afghanistan.  I think it would <Col N="1490" /> be difficult for someone in this House to do so because it would seem to justify the taking over of small nations everywhere by larger powers and we Irish have a particular interest in this.  I have just been re-reading the history of that most interesting period between 1912 and 1916 and the arguments that were used to deny this country its independence were to a large extent that it would be used as a base for foreign attacks on the mainland of Britain.  That is precisely the argument that is being used by the Russians in the case of Afghanistan.  It was the most utter nonsense in 1912 as applied to this country, as soon became clear, for when a measure of independence was obtained we proved to be one of the best friends that Britain has ever had.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the relationships between this part of the country and Britain seem to be so much better and more straightforward, although, of course, there is an area of disagreement, than those between the North and Britain. Many Senators have made this point, Senator Goulding has just made it, that the sort of argument that is being used to justify the takeover of Afghanistan is the sort of argument which justifies the takeover of small countries everywhere by the major powers, and I think it is something that we have to protest against in the most vigorous way and we have to show our disapproval and disdain. However it may very well be that, in the case of the Soviet Union at the moment, it is worthwhile maintaining the cultural links and maintaining some contacts and communication.  I would not like to see us taking the position which Senator Cooney advocated.  In trying to paraphrase his argument, I hope I am not getting it wrong&mdash;that because of our debt to America we should follow American policy in every line and detail. I think that our independence is worth a great deal and I take the Minister's point when he said that as a member of the European Community we are not as independent as we were heretofore.  But we may in a sense have more influence as a member of that bigger Community. Naturally there are occasions where <Col N="1491" /> diplomacy has to take place in secret. That is a fact of diplomatic life, and it has always been so.  But at the same time I think that the fact that a debate such as this has given rise to very many points of view from all sides and from all quarters, not made on a party basis&mdash;something that can be done in the Seanad and not so easily in the Dáil&mdash;is very important. It is also important for the Minister and for his advisers to get some idea of what people, as a whole think.</P>
    <P>This debate has been of the greatest value.  I do not think that, as I said, we should break off our cultural links with the Soviet Union and since these two situations have already been mentioned side by side my belief is that we should send a team to the Olympic Games in Moscow and we should also send our rugby players on the Lions tour to South Africa.  Neither of these political regimes do I like nor do I like their methods, nor do I like their theory or their practice, but I think that this particular way of showing our disapproval will not be effective and particularly in the case of the Olympics my guess is that the countries which have come out and said that they are going to stop their people going to the Olympics and they are going to ban their teams, they will end up with egg on their faces.  That is not to say that the Olympic Games is not in some sense a travesty of what it should be.</P>
    <P>I would also say that one of the important steps in de-politicising the Olympic Games would be to stop all this movement about and jockeying for position, and to stage them permanently in Greece, their home country and then the problems which arise, whether the proposed site is in Los Angeles, or Moscow or Montreal or west Cork, would not arise.  We should fix the site where the games originally took place and where they originated&mdash;in Greece and then a lot of these problems would disappear.</P>
    <P>To get back to the point of neutrality. I believe that neutrality is something which is precious to us, we fought for independence, it was a long struggle and it does seem to me that we have to some <Col N="1492" /> extent given up rather more than we should in our independent approach to foreign policy.  We obviously had to compromise, to a certain extent, when we joined Europe, but there was an overwhelming desire in this country to join Europe and I do not think that if there was a referendum now there would be anything but an overwhelming desire to stay in Europe.  On the other hand, there was a time when we took a very independent line over world problems and my feeling is that there was a curtailment of our independence because of certain incidents involving our officials in the Congo and it took a long time for us to regain this position.  It is essential that we should clearly and distinctly maintain our independence and, at the same time, as the Minister has said, work closely with our European allies and use our influence in the European situation to affect European policy.  I should not like to underestimate the moral force which this country can exert in those situations, because it is not simply commensurate with our economic power.  It is wrong to equate the moral force a country can exert to its economic power.  We have a vital role to play.  I should like to see a more positive attitude being taken by the Minister.  The more positive he is the better. There are times when we may have to differ from our European colleagues, and I think that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to the votes on disarmament and the fact that on one occasion we voted against a disarmament motion which he regarded as frivolous.  The problem about that was that it did not get the appearance of frivolity in the press.  It was reported as a serious motion on disarmament.  There may have been reasons for frivolity, but it was imcumbent on the Minister and his Department to make the frivolity of the motion clear, because it appeared to me, and to many other people who were distinctly worried, that this was a serious motion, that we were being influenced by one of the power blocs and that we were not playing the role that we traditionally do play.  There was a break-down in public relations there, and it is something <Col N="1493" /> we need to be very careful about, because foreign policy is a two-way thing.  The fact that so many Members have contributed in such a diverse way to this debate has given the Minister and his officials an insight into the very wide-ranging feeling about the situation&mdash; clear detestation of the Afghanistan invasion, a great sympathy for people in Iran, but a desire to see the hostages freed.  The Minister made the right point that it is a principle that diplomatic personnel should be given immunity and should remain in immunity when they are in their diplomatic context. On both of the situations mentioned in the motion basically I would take the position the Minister has taken in his speech.  On the other hand, I should like to see our foreign policy being conducted <Col N="1494" /> at a slightly higher level.  Although, of course, naturally a good deal of it has got to go on behind closed doors, on the other hand the Minister needs to keep the public behind him and so the communication between the Minister and the public has got to be two-way.</P>
