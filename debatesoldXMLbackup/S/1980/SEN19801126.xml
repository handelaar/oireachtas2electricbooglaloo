    <Title>Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This short Bill repeals the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950 and provides that spirits described as Irish whiskey or blended Irish whiskey must comply with certain technical requirements.  It further provides that whiskey and blended whiskey produced either in the State or in Northern Ireland in accordance with these requirements shall be entitled to the descriptions &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; and &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo;.  I am promoting this legislation for four main reasons as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950 protected the name of Irish whiskey solely for the purposes of customs and excise. That Act ensured that only spirits conforming to the definitions of Irish whiskey and Irish pot still whiskey as laid down in the Act could be described as such in permits and certificates issued under the <Col N="236" /> Spirits Act, 1880 accompanying the spirits in transit.  However, the use of these permits and certificates by the Revenue Commissioners has been discontinued for several years.  Accordingly, the purposes for which the 1950 Act was enacted no longer obtain.</P>
    <P>Second, the definitions contained in the 1950 Act are now considered inadequate because they do not make any reference to:</P>
    <P>(a)  a distillation strength limit;</P>
    <P>(b)  the period of maturation;</P>
    <P>(c)  the necessity of having organoleptic &mdash; that is taste and smell &mdash; qualities associated with and derived from the raw materials.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the term &ldquo;Irish pot still whiskey&rdquo; is no longer used in marketing whiskey and there is no definition of blended Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>The third reason relates to the fact that the only whiskey distillery operating in Northern Ireland is a subsidiary of our main distillery group, namely, Irish Distillers Limited.  That subsidiary market their whiskey under the appellations &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; and &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo; though their use of these appellations is not supported by legislation enacted by the Oireachtas or until a very recent enactment, by legislation enacted by the UK Government.</P>
    <P>This point is of importance because of new regulations being proposed by the EEC to govern the movement of spirituous beverages with appellations of origin within the Community.  Under these proposals whiskey produced in Northern Ireland would not be entitled to be described, as it has been for years, as Irish whiskey or blended Irish whiskey, unless the use of these appellations is based on the legislation of a member state or states.</P>
    <P>The problem which the proposed EEC regulations would present was discussed between the British authorities and ourselves and it was considered that the problem could best be overcome by including in our legislation a provision to the effect that whiskey or blended whiskey <Col N="237" /> produced in the South or in the North would be entitled to the appellations &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo; and that similar legislative provision be made by the UK Government.  The necessary legislation was recently enacted on the British side and our Bill now proposes to do likewise.  The enactment of this reciprocal legislation is, I should point out, a concrete example of political and economic co-operation between ourselves and the UK in a matter which concerns the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason why I am anxious to revise our definition of whiskey is that the EEC Commission has had in mind for some time to define whiskey in an EEC context.  The UK Government and ourselves feel that prior to the discussions at EEC level on such a definition the traditional manufacturers of whiskey in the Community, that is to say the Scottish and ourselves, whose production processes are broadly similar, should not only have as strong a definition as possible for whiskey but that both our definitions should be harmonised to the maximum possible extent.  Though Scotch whisky is our main competitor in export markets, it is recognised on both sides that it would be to our mutual advantage to secure a Community definition that is acceptable to us.  I should say that the harmonisation of definitions proposed will not mean that Scotch and Irish whiskies will be identical.  The key essential well known features of whiskey production which are common both to ourselves and the Scottish are being set down but distillation techniques and the mixes of raw materials used are not being specified or harmonised.  Accordingly, the traditional differences in regard to taste and flavour which have existed between Irish and Scotch whiskey should not be disturbed by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is now before the Seanad takes into account the four considerations which I have mentioned and thus the definition of Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey will now be aligned in general terms with the generic definition of whiskey as set out in schedule 7 to the UK Finance Act, 1969, as amended <Col N="238" /> by clause 9 to the UK Finance Act (No. 2) 1980.</P>
    <P>While I do not intend to go into the technical details of the Bill, which I am assured are in order and acceptable to the industry, I would like to draw the attention of Senators to a few points of special general significance.</P>
    <P>I have decided not to provide for a generic definition of whiskey based on the criteria set out in the UK legislation because I am advised that such a definition might be regarded by the European Court of Justice as a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction and thus contrary to Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Although the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950 specifically defined Irish pot still whiskey, I have decided to omit reference to this product in the Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980, as the Irish distilling industry do not at present use this marketing term and do not envisage its use for marketing purposes in future.  It is also relevant that the UK has not legislated for this type of product, and apparently does not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>Section I(1) of the Bill provides that for the purposes of any statute or instrument made under statute, spirits described as Irish whiskey shall not be regarded as corresponding to that description unless those spirits comply with certain requirements.  The objective of this provision is to ensure that Irish whiskey will have an identity, backed by legislation, on both the domestic and export markets for any purpose.  Section 1(2) provides that the expression &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo; shall mean a blend of a number of distillates, each of which separately is entitled to the description &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo;.  The production of blended whiskies is a feature of modern distilleries; such whiskies are so called to distinguish them from straight whiskies, which are produced from one distillation process.</P>
    <P>Section I(3) (a) of the Bill sets out the technical requirements which must be adhered to before a product is entitled to use the appellation &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;blended Irish whiskey&rdquo;.  I wish to assure Senators that these criteria have been <Col N="239" /> settled in agreement and following full consultation with the industry.</P>
    <P>Section I(3)(b) provides that spirits must be matured in wooden casks for at least three years, either in the State or in Northern Ireland or partly in one and partly in the other, before they can be described as Irish whiskey or blended Irish whiskey.  This maturation requirement accords with existing requirements under the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969 which provides that whiskey produced in Ireland must be warehoused for at least three years before it can be delivered for home consumption.</P>
    <P>Up to 1969, the minimum maturation period was five years but, in that year at the request of the Irish distilling industry, the minimum maturation period was reduced from five years to three years in order to facilitate exports.  The request of the industry was a direct result of their recognition that public taste had switched to favour milder types of whiskey which did not require lengthy periods of maturation to maintain its quality.</P>
    <P>The requirements about maturation are now being included in this Bill as it is considered for completeness sake that such requirements should form an integral part of the Irish whiskey legislation. The inclusion of the requirement about maturation in this Bill does not affect the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969 administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  The maturation provision in this Bill will operate completely independently of the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969.  It will, however, have the effect that spirits will not be entitled to the appellation &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;blended Irish Whiskey&rdquo; until they have been matured for a period of at least three years whereas under the Irish Whiskey Act, 1950 spirits were entitled to the appellation &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irish pot still whiskey&rdquo; as they came off the still.</P>
    <P>The Irish whiskey distilling industry is one of the oldest and most valued industries in the country.  It has a tradition stretching back over a thousand years but, in the past decade, it has been given new vitality by Irish Distillers, has grown in importance and has contributed <Col N="240" /> increasingly to our economy and to our export trade.  The Irish Distillers Group, which has grown from the merger in 1966 of John Jameson and Son, John Power and Sons and Cork Distillers Company now employing more than 1,000 people at their various locations including Midleton and Bushmills.  The farming community, through the growing of barley for the production of whiskey, also derives substantial benefits from the industry.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Irish Distillers Group is to make Irish whiskey a force in world markets and their performance in recent years is indicative of their determination. Between 1970 and 1979 whiskey exports increased by 420 per cent to more than one million cases and Irish whiskey is, in fact, now exported to more than 100 countries.  In America, Irish Distillers' largest single export market, Irish whiskey continued during 1979 to maintain a faster rate of growth than the market as a whole.  In the EEC, the group also increased their sales substantially during 1979.</P>
    <P>As the industry considers that its product requires legislative protection so as to give it an identity on both the domestic and international markets, I commend to the House the proposals set out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address myself on behalf of my party to the Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980, and to assure the Minister that there was a consensus in favour of the introduction of the Bill.  The Minister stated that the fact that Bushmills whiskey in Northern Ireland is also involved is a concrete example of a measure of co-operation &mdash;he might have more aptly chosen the words &ldquo;spirited example of co-operation&rdquo;&mdash;in relation to the whiskey industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is basically a simple Bill which relates to compliance with technical requirements, a large part of which has to do with the fact that the Irish Distillers Group now own Bushmills Distillery in Northern Ireland.  It is tremendous to see this co-operation in so far as Irish whiskey is concerned, whether it is north of the <Col N="241" /> Border or south of the Border.  Bushmills is the oldest whiskey distillery in the world.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's speech that he has decided not to follow the United Kingdom legislation.  The view was taken that to conform with EEC legislation a member state or member states should introduce legislation.  Because of the anomaly of Bushmills belonging to Irish Distillers, apparently discussions took place between the Irish and British Governments and as a result it was decided that legislation would need to be introduced in both Parliaments to regularise the position.  The Minister states that he has decided not to provide for a generic definition of whiskey based on the criteria set out in the UK legislation because, and I quote, &ldquo;I am advised that such a definition might be regarded by the European Court of Justice as a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction and thus contrary to Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to clarify this point.  The Minister, in his wisdom may have decided that this generic definition is not necessary.  I am wondering why there is a difference of approach in the UK and this country and whether the fact that the Minister has not introduced this generic definition might in some way have an effect particularly on Bushmills' whiskey, because it is manufactured north of the Border.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with the regularisation and the need to defend the good name Irish whiskey has in this country and on the world markets.  I remember a sad experience in an Irish hotel within the last six months with some visitors from another country when the question of Gaelic coffee arose.  The Gaelic coffee was apparently based on Scotch whiskey. When we called the waitress aside to seek an explanation we were told that in the view of that hotel Gaelic coffee was coffee based on Scotch whiskey and Irish coffee was apparently coffee made with the Irish version.  Simple matters like this are important.  It is important to regularise the issue.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that there is a slight <Col N="242" /> change in the speech the Minister made in this House from the speech made in the Dáil by Deputy Gallagher.  In the Dáil the statement was made by the Minister that the sales of Irish whiskey had risen from £18.8 million in 1970 to £82.3 million in 1979.  My understanding of the position is that sales of Irish whiskey did not rise from £18.8 million in 1970 to £82.3 million in 1979, but rather the overall sales position of the Irish Distillers rose from £18.8 million to £82.3 million.  These also concerned the sales of vodka, gin and other products of that company.  This dramatic sales increase of Irish whiskey was not, in fact, as dramatic as that suggested.  It does not take away from the very significant performance of Irish Distillers in recent years and the welcome change outside this country where Irish whiskey has been getting a significantly greater prominence than it had been doing prior to that.</P>
    <P>Though we agree in general terms with the Bill, we have put down a single amendment to the Bill which relates to section (1) (3) (b) on the question of the maturing of Irish whiskey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was introduced within the last ten minutes.  It is a very simple matter which relates to the question of maturity.  I understand the Irish Licensed Vintners Association have reservations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to give you notice of the fact that an amendment is being put down.  The amendment relates to the question of the maturity of whiskey.  I understand that there is a substantial viewpoint within the Irish licensed trade that Irish whiskey of three year old vintage should not be put on the Irish market.  A different attitude would be adopted in so far as the export market is concerned.  I will not dwell on this point because my colleague, Senator Howard, who apart from his membership of this <Col N="243" /> House is also involved in the licensed trade and is a representative nationally of the Irish licensed trade, will develop on this point with much more profound knowledge than I have of this particular matter.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say any more except to reflect on an anomaly through the lack of legislation in another area of the Irish spirits industry.  Christmas is coming, and at this time traditionally, and no doubt this year as in other years, there will be a substantial amount of a certain spirit on the Irish market which is not covered by any legislation and which indeed is repugnant to legislation.  I am referring to the poteen industry.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that poteen has been very much a part of the Irish tradition, and there is good poteen and bad poteen.  It seems to me to be a matter to which Government might give thought with a view to regularisation.  By regularisation I mean the introduction of legislation which would standardise this commodity, which is part of our history.  We might arrange a method of production with a lesser alcoholic content which would be acceptable and which might rationalise this entire issue, which is in the myths and legends of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely in favour of this Bill, but I should like to ask the Minister a question concerning the form which the legislation has been given.  It seems to postulate that a product has already been manufactured and put on the market which is described as Irish whiskey, and then goes on to say that it should not be regarded as Irish whiskey unless it complies with certain specified requirements.  What I should like to ask is why there is not an attempt to prevent products being put on the market which are wrongly described as Irish whiskey and what sanction there would be if somebody who had already done that persisted in doing it notwithstanding the proposed provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody involved and interested in the licensed trade I do not wish to let the opportunity pass without <Col N="244" /> making a few comments on the Bill before us.  The comments I have to make are being put forward in a constructive and objective manner.  Having said that, I want to add that I do not believe and I do not accept that the Bill now before us will contribute in any way to advancing or improving the quality, the distinctiveness and the character of Irish whiskey as traditionally we have known it.  Indeed, the reverse is true and I believe that time will prove that point to be correct.</P>
      <P>I accept the need for legislation at this time on three separate points.  I accept first of all that there is a need to set technical regulations and to define in law Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey. Second, I accept that it is right that we should anticipate likely EEC decisions in regard to defining whiskey in Community terms and to govern the movement of whiskey within the Community and that we should prepare our ground in anticipation for that situation developing.  I want to say also that I share with the Minister and Senator Staunton the sentiment that it is a nice thing that we can say that the product that will emerge from the Bushmills' distillery in the northern part of this island will henceforth be described as Irish whiskey.</P>
      <P>On these three points I accept the necessity for legislation but I believe that this Bill goes much further.  The fact that it appears to enjoy the support and agreement of the distilling industry in this country does not reassure me of its value. Indeed, it raises a question mark in my mind.  As I say, the Bill goes far beyond what in my opinion is required in relation to defining Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey, and to prepare our ground for likely decisions within the European Community, but it provides, and this is where I take issue with the Minister on it, for a situation, a set of circumstances and a set of definitions the end result of which will be that Irish whiskey will be virtually indistinguishable from Scotch whisky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this Bill was conceived in haste, created by the anxiety of what may happen in relation to EEC directives.  I believe an attempt was made to go for shelter in relation to EEC developments <Col N="245" /> under the umbrella of United Kingdom legislation in relation to Scotch whisky. I believe, as I have always believed, that Irish whiskey as a product is unique, that it has a quality of its own and that it had the capacity, and still has, to stand on its own in relation to the developments some people are worrying about.  We and the United Kingdom authorities could initiate a joint approach in relation to negotiations and discussions within the EEC with regard to the defining of whiskey and its movement within the Community. I do not accept that to resist successively what might be anticipated as inevitable decisions in the EEC it was necessary for us to follow line for line the legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament in relation to Scotch whisky.  If we continue to follow that legislation line for line we will finish up with a product that can be distinguished from Scotch whisky only by the label on the bottle.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to what I regard as another unnecessary step being taken by this Bill.  It will enable Irish Distillers to put whiskey on the market after a three-year maturing period as against a minimum period of five years at present.  How can the case be advanced that this is necessary and that it will be to the advantage of the product?  I have read carefully the discussion that took place in the other House during the passing of this Bill there.  This point was raised, and I gave particular attention to the Minister's reply, but he did not attempt to deal adequately with the risks inherent in this situation.</P>
    <P>I suggest, from the knowledge that is available to me, that there can be two reasons why it was necessary to follow line for line, first of all, the United Kingdom legislation in regard to the defining of Scotch whisky.  First, a decision has been made, perhaps by the industry or by somebody else, that we should harmonise totally with Scotch.  If that is the opinion that is widely held it is one that I do not share.  The other reason that would suggest itself is that by reducing the period of maturing of the product from five years to three years the distilling industry will save substantially.  Indeed, some people <Col N="246" /> might go so far as to say that it could amount to a financial windfall, because a product that now would have to remain for a further two years in the maturing process can be lifted out and the distillers will have available this two-year volume to go on the market.  I may be wrong but I am raising the point to give the Minister an opportunity to show whether I am or not.</P>
    <P>Some mention has been made elsewhere of preserving the special secrets of the Irish distilling industry&mdash;it has not been said here today, but I know it has been said elsewhere.  As far as I am concerned, once we harmonise totally with the Scottish product, we will have few if any secrets left. We may have one, and I will come to it later.  Once our whiskey is permitted to be extracted and put on the market after the three-year period, I fear that that will become the accepted pattern and that the day of the five-year blend, the seven-year blend or the ten-year-old will fast disappear.  Three years, of course, is the absolute minimum period in which the product, if it is to be described as whiskey, can be put on the market, because as I understand it the distilling process needs that three-year period for the different components to mix and blend successfully.  What actually happened afterwards was that the product was allowed to mature so that it would acquire this taste that has been described as mellow and acquire its colouring from the mahogany and oaken casks in which it was kept.</P>
    <P>I am informed that once you draw off the product at three years and then compare it with the whiskey that comes off at five or seven years, it is deficient in two vital aspects, first, its colouring and, second, its taste.  It is a raw product that has not acquired the colour traditionally identified with Irish whiskey.  For that reason one has to provide an additive to produce the colouring and to give it the element of sweetness.</P>
    <P>If one is in the field of additives, one has taken a substantial step from the traditional blend of Irish whiskey and one is moving into the field of the semi-artificial product.  I do not know what the additives <Col N="247" /> will be, but I wonder is this the only remaining secret we are being asked to preserve.  Until now we had a product on the market that was uniquely Irish, perhaps as unique as the shamrock. But we are now moving to a situation where we are going to lose that distinctive character, taste and quality.  We are moving to a product that will be indistinguishable from Scotch whisky.  We have export sales amounting to many millions, a market that has been growing at a remarkable rate.  Therefore, we have a responsibility to preserve this unique product, but I believe we are going in the opposite direction with some of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I want to address four queries to the Minister.  Is the likely EEC decision to define whiskey in an EEC context so serious that our definition of whiskey must be totally similar to that of the United Kingdom?  Will the Minister accept that in this Bill, which is harmonising our definition and our standards totally with the Scottish method of production, we are losing the distinction, character and quality of Irish whiskey?  If we are not, why not?  Will he accept that the standard and quality of the traditional Irish product will not be the same if he permits what I would describe as a semimature product to be sold after three years, a product which will require additives to make it marketable?  Will he tell the House what precise agreements or safeguards were advanced by the Irish distilling industry to persuade him or his Department that it was to the benefit of the Irish product that the maturing period should be reduced from five to three years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  There is a market for Irish whiskey.  The more we can standardise Irish whiskey the better from the point of view for its promotion. I am glad we now have it clear that Bushmills is an Irish whiskey.  I have some questions to ask the Minister on matters about which I am not quite clear.  One is that it has always been a popular belief that at times Irish whiskey has been exported to Scotland, blended with Scotch whisky and has ended on the market <Col N="248" /> as a Scotch whisky blend.  Does the British legislation now prevent that happening?  It has always been a popular belief that when distillers are blending whiskey they will average the ages of the whiskey and come to an average age on that blend.  For example, if you add 50 per cent of four-year old to 50 per cent of ten-year old, it could be advertised as a seven-year old blend.  Can that be done? Could a foreign country, say America, manufacture whiskey and market it as Irish whiskey?  Is there anything to prevent that?  To illustrate the point, for instance, in this country we can manufacture Danish pastry and advertise it as Danish pastry.  It is not made in Denmark, it is made in Ireland, but it has always been known as the type of pastry which is made in Denmark.  That still happens.  As we all know, one of the most important whiskeys in Ireland is &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo;.  It has always been spelt &ldquo;whisky&rdquo;.  Will &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; now have to change that spelling to come under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disturbed by this Bill.  I would like to endorse what Senator Howard said in his very well considered, researched and persuasive speech.  It was a bad day for Ireland when a ten-year-old whiskey was reduced to five; it will be an even worse day when it goes from five years to three years.  I cannot see the logic in this Bill.  It is at odds with any logic I have ever been taught.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the request from the industry was a direct result of the recognition that public taste had switched to favour milder types of whiskey which did not require lengthy periods of maturation to maintain quality.  What kind of nonsense is that?  How does whiskey become milder by its period of maturation becoming shorter?  The rawest and roughest kinds of whiskey are the youngest, the mildest, the most bland, benign and civilised are the oldest.  I cannot understand who wrote that &ldquo;The request of the industry was a direct result of the recognition that public taste had switched to favour milder types of whiskey which did not require lengthy periods of maturation to maintain its quality&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nonsense.  It is dreadful if that type of prose is brought into the House and palmed off as commonsense.  I am very glad I heard Senator Howard's speech.  The Minister's speech is the most extraordinary piece of nonsense I have ever seen.  He said:</P>
      <P>The aim of the Irish Distillers Group is to make Irish whiskey a force in world markets and its performance in recent years is indicative of its determination.  Between 1970 and 1979 whiskey exports increased by 420 per cent to over one million cases and Irish whiskey is, in fact, now exported to 100 countries.  In America, Irish Distillers' largest single export market, Irish whiskey continued during 1979 to maintain a faster rate of growth than the market as a whole.  In the EEC, the group also increased their sales substantially during 1979.</P>
      <P>The logic of that is to change the formula and equate it with Scotch.  In other words, we have had a terrific success rate in the last few years: we are outstripping Scotch and other forms of whisky on the world market and that kind of success has to be followed through with logical action.  Let us change the formula and equate ourselves with Scotch&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to have it explained because I think this is awful. To say you are going to make whisky milder by letting it out two years earlier is nonsense.  If we have a record of increasing success, in other words if we are outstripping our rivals because of the excellence of Irish whiskey, the logical thing is to intensify the things in Irish <Col N="250" /> whiskey that distinguish it from other whiskies so that we continue to outstrip our rivals.  This Bill suggests that you cancel the things that make Irish whiskey unique and successful, you bring it into line with the other whiskies we are outstripping, and then you say you do this in the interests of increasing the excellence of Irish whiskey.  I do not like to be too facetious but I think Irish whiskey is unquestionably a better whiskey than Scotch.  I say this as a man who has actually applied himself to hours of self-sacrifice and research to the whole subject.</P>

      <P>I must confess I am not qualified to speak on this subject.  I agree with Senator Howard.  The main purpose of this Bill is to conform with EEC regulations and we all know that the main purpose of EEC regulations is to bring about the greatest possible measure of harmonisation.  I will not go into that, but if we are seeking harmonisation, do we see uniformity in the spelling of the word &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; itself?  Do the member countries of the EEC introduce legislation about not only Irish whiskey but Spanish onions, Brussels sprouts, Irish stew, Danish pastry?  Are we reduced to that kind of legislation?  Principally, do we do anything to harmonise the price of Irish whiskey in EEC countries?  I am told that the most extravagant prices are charged for Irish whiskey in most EEC countries. While this might place great credit on the quality of Irish whiskey, it does not do a great deal for its sales.  The Minister should tell us to what extent he really intends to go in respect of harmonisation.</P>

      <P>The Senator is being very selective.  If he reads my brief he will see that it says:</P>
      <P>Though Scotch whisky is our main competitor in export markets, it is recognised on both sides that it would be to our mutual advantage to secure a Community definition that is acceptable to us.  I should say that the harmonisation of definitions proposed will not mean that Scotch and Irish whiskies will be identical.  The key essential, well known features of whisky production which are common both to ourselves and the Scottish are being set down but distillation techniques and the mixes of raw materials used are not being specified or harmonised.</P>
      <P>That is what really matters.  It is they, after all, who produce the end product. Are different techniques and mixes not trade secrets?</P>

      <P>In Lloyd George's <Col N="252" /> budget of April 1915 it was felt that the sale of alcohol should be discouraged as this was having a bad effect on munition workers.  In addition to doubling the duty on spirits, he pressed for a proposal in favour of compulsorily maturing spirits in bond before release for sale.  The Mature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1915 was then passed.  Whiskey had to be stored in casks in bond for at least three years.  That was in 1915 and I think our grandfathers were better drinkers than we are.</P>
      <P>In the Act, the period was reduced to two years for the first year of operation. Imported spirits were subjected to the same restrictions.  The Mature Spirits Act, 1969 reduced the maturation period to three years at the request of the distillers.  That change in attitude in the 1969 Act on behalf of the Irish distillers was a direct result of their recognition that the public taste had switched to favour milder types of whiskey which did not require lengthy periods of maturation to maintain this quality.  From the way Senators are speaking one would think that today is the first time it had ever been suggested that the period should be reduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not think so.  This Bill is saying that the whiskey must be in the wood for three years.  Is that not correct?  That does not mean it cannot be in the wood for 15 years, ten years, or eight years; it must be at least three years. Senator Howard will agree that there are whiskies guaranteed 15 years.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We disagree slightly with the British legislation because we were afraid their legislation was contravening the Treaty of Rome.  The UK definition could produce difficulties.  It lays down a distillation strength and the EEC definition does not.  That means different people in the business can manufacture whiskey at different strengths.  The British legislation lays down the strength and you must confine yourself to that when you are processing.  Thus, the EEC legislation does not really define the strength.  I must say this in plain layman's language.  That is what we are trying to comply with here.</P>
      <P>There are many more questions about this.  Like the Senators, I would be greatly worried if we lost our identity as a people who manufacture and export Irish whiskey, or if we damaged the good name of Irish whiskey.  Senator Whitaker was worrying about somebody who brought another whiskey on the market which purported to be Irish whiskey.  He asked what would happen there.  The Irish Consumers Act 1978, covers all those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recently as 15 March 1977 the question of setting up a poteen industry in Ireland was raised in the Dáil.  The Minister for Finance in reply to a parliamentary question said it was open to any person to set up a distillery to make spirits of any kind if he complied with the ordinary requirements of the laws relating to the production and marketing of spirits, in particular the excise laws administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  He went <Col N="254" /> on to say that a drink called poteen was available on the home market&mdash;this is a brand name used by Hibernian Distillation Blenders Limited, Cork, to describe a blend of spirits produced by them.  The company do not distil spirits but purchase them from other concerns for blending.  Somebody raised the question about the quantity of exports.</P>

    <Title>National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous day I was expressing approval of the principle of the Bill.  I had stopped at the point where I said I fully agreed with the Minister's view that the National Council for Educational Awards are the appropriate body to validate the degrees of the <Col N="255" /> National Institute.  That does not mean, of course, that there should not be maximum mobility between students and staff of the non-university institutes and the traditional universities.  The more graduates we have from these now proliferating new institutions the more graduates we have coming on stream, the more imperative it is to ensure that there will be real mobility between the traditional universities and the new institutions.</P>
      <P>There are other things about the institution itself and the Bill which I like and further interesting information was supplied in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in a feature on the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin.  All of us must approve of the fact that 5 per cent to 10 per cent of places are occupied by mature students.  Thus, the institute fulfils the responsibility which must lie on all institutions to give a second chance to adults, which they are frequently denied in youth.  I am glad that the institute is implementing this principle of recurrent adult education.</P>
      <P>The admission procedure strikes me as very sensible.  As the Minister knows, the traditional universities are not terribly happy with the present selection method. People make the point that it is the fairest from the point of view of justice and so on, but we may well query whether the most appropriate people select the proper professions.  I applaud the principle of the aptitude test and regret only that we cannot or we do not, implement it in the universities.</P>
      <P>I must anticipate Senator Hussey by saying that I warmly welcome the fact that according to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday 40 per cent of the students are women, which is a very good statistic indeed.  There are other sections in the Bill, like the one which provides against vested interests or possible corruption by members of the governing body, which again are very welcome.  It is a pity then, that I cannot give the Bill an unqualified welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that because the Limerick legislation had been dealt with &mdash; and he implied had been <Col N="256" /> improved &mdash; he hoped we would not delay unduly on this particular Bill.  The rather clever suggestion was there that we had improved the Limerick Bill and the objections to it had been overcome. I would like to remind the House that all the amendments put forward in the Seanad were either withdrawn or lost, and the Bill, as finally passed, incorporated all the defects to which I and other Senators objected when we discussed it before the summer recess.  That Bill, which passed with all its defects, is almost the exact model for the one before us today.  It cannot be expected in reason that the Bill can pass without some protest.  It is surprising that in the other House no reference was made to what I regard as the central flaw in the Bill, namely, the principle of ministerial, departmental or civil service interference.</P>
    <P>The main objection I have to the Bill is that the principle of ministerial supervision is everywhere, as strong as ever, as unrepentant as ever.  The word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is a misleading word because it does not mean the man of eminent reason, the present incumbent.  It means the Department, the civil service, or it might mean a future Minister who might be much more bloody-minded.</P>
    <P>This excessive and bureaucratic interference is all over the Bill.  It is particularly evident in the manner in which the governing body are to be appointed.  I shall deal with that later on Committee Stage.  Of the 23 ordinary members, according to my calculation, 16 will be, in effect, ministerial nominees, giving the Department a massive majority in the governing body.  The curious thing about this is, that in the Bill which is next to be dealt with in the House today, that dealing with Thomond, the ministerial nominees account for only something like seven or possibly at the most 10, out of 23.  The composition of the governing body here is largely determined by the Minister.  That is very undesirable.</P>
    <P>One would think that having shaped the governing body in his own image and likeness, the Minister would be prepared to leave the running of affairs to that, obviously, docile governing body, but not <Col N="257" /> so.  Having settled the governing body, the Minister goes on to underline in clause after clause his control of the institute.  Why is it that such preponderant departmental influence is required in the case of the National Institutes at Dublin and Limerick?  Why, for example, is it that in the traditional universities the number of Government nominees is a mere handful?  In University College, Dublin, there are only four government nominees out of a governing body of about 34 or 35.  Why is such strong departmental representation considered necessary in the case of the institutes and not in the traditional universities?  Is it envisaged that the composition of the governing body here before us in the Bill is to serve as a model for the university governing bodies as well?</P>
    <P>Non-academics may say &ldquo;But why not, is not the principle of public accountability and ministerial and Government accountability essential when public moneys are being spent?&rdquo; Nobody from the universities or from the institutes would dispute the need for public accountability but that is not the same as ministerial suffocation.  Financial accountability is specifically spelt out in section 14 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is failure here to trust the institutes and their staff and to trust their academic responsibility.  Academic independence does not mean academic eccentricity.  It does not mean ivory tower irresponsibility.  The Minister is not trusting the governing body and the academics in these institutes.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the reason for this neurotic obsession with control over the new institutes is the fear in the Department of Education that there might be what is called &ldquo;academic drift&rdquo; in these essentially technological institutes and it is necessary to write in this measure of control in order to safeguard against academic drift.  If there is something in that argument it would seem to be cancelled out by the fact that Limerick and Dublin have had an <i>ad hoc</i> existence and during that <i>ad hoc</i> existence no one has accused them of having this distemper of academic drift.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> One must reflect once more, looking around the country at other institutes of higher education, on the fact that public moneys are generously bestowed on an institute not 30 or 40 miles from here and that there is no measure whatsoever of public accountability, quite the reverse. Does the Minister propose in his new University Bill to establish the same measure of public accountability in the case of the recognised college at May-nooth?  The Minister also said that the passage of this Bill will help to expedite the legislation for the Thomond one, which is coming up, and for the new universities.  Perhaps he might be a little bit more forthcoming with some information at this stage.  Those of us immediately involved are very anxious to know when we may expect the legislation on the universities.  Obviously our interest in this is rather more than academic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate whether the governance of the new universities is to be recast radically along the lines of a semi-State body, because this is what the national institute in Dublin is? He may say that the people in Dublin are quite happy with the Bill and that they have not protested about it. That may be so, but that is because they know it is a waste of time.  I do not propose to table any amendments because I understand there is no chance of changing anything in this Bill since the Limerick one is already enacted and operating.  It is important, nonetheless, to make these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the attitude of the people in Dublin and Limerick is &ldquo;let us hope for the best and let us hope that the ever-present spectre of ministerial interference will not, in effect, materialise&rdquo;.  My information is that it has already materialised and that the day-to-day running of these institutes is being interfered with by the Department.  There is a specific matter, for example, that when staff are being appointed the institutes have power to appoint their own staff through the usual procedure but when it comes to awarding an increment, then the Department, <Col N="259" /> in effect, are saying what increment should be awarded.  If it is proposed to put a successful candidate above the minimum, immediately massive amounts of information are being looked for by the Department.  In this one respect at least there is already considerable day-to-day interference in the running of the institutes.</P>
    <P>There is another point about the inaability of the governing body to suspend staff without consultation with the Department.  I should like to refer to that again on Committee Stage.  There is a more general principle here which transcends the issue of education.  If you plan to have a considerable amount of supervision from the civil service over an educational institute, there are two possibilities.  To implement this supervision you have to recruit extra staff in the Department.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about an extension of public sector expenditure in an area where it is not wanted and which is in contradiction to the prevailing economic wisdom of cutting back public expenditure.  Alternatively, you do not increase your staff in the Department and that means that the delays then become substantial and the level of bureaucratic interference becomes even greater as the existing staff have to cope with their increased responsibilities.  For all these reasons I object to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I see no justification for the intrusive, all-pervading presence of the Department.  I cannot see how the principle of academic independence and flexibility can be compatible with this extension of ministerial power.  I am sure the Minister will agree that you cannot have one kind of sauce for the academic gander and another for the non-traditional goose.  If there is substantial civil service interference it should apply no less to the traditional universities than it does to the technologically-oriented institutes.  Would the Minister concede the logic of that situation?</P>
    <P>I should like to stress again for the record, though a while ago I said semi-facetiously that we were all very concerned about the future university legislation, <Col N="260" /> that I am concerned for these institutes in Dublin and Limerick for their own sake, not simply because I am afraid of the shadows they are casting ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  The House will recognise from the enthusiastic welcome I gave the Limerick NIHE Bill that I feel the same about Dublin.  The general points I made at that time, which are on the record, still stand in terms of the need for an institute of this kind.</P>
      <P>This institute will present a different strategy in education terms.  We see signs of that already.  We had a visit from the director to Leinster House.  Some of us heard the presentation made by him and his staff.  It was very impressive and encouraging.  I wonder if it is not time to push ahead with linking the extra regional technical colleges into this institute in the Dublin area.  I should like to see some of these colleges appearing in the fast-growing suburban communities in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An explosion in investment has been going or in education over the last decade.  We have had the nine regional technical colleges, the NIHE, Limerick, Thomond&mdash;about which there is a Bill&mdash; and the NIHE, Dublin.  It is a tremendous amount of investment but this part of the natural development of our country, with the population growing so fast, particularly in the younger age groups.  It is natural that this investment would grow at a massive rate.  At the same time, I would like to see the regional technical colleges in Dublin moving faster and perhaps with a somewhat diffeent design in terms of relationship with an institute like the NIHE, Dublin.  This raises the question of the role of the other third level portions of the vocational institutions in <Col N="261" /> Bolton Street, Kevin Street, Rathmines and Parnell Square.  There is a difficulty there which must be tackled.  We are all aware of it.</P>
    <P>The coming into existence of the NIHE, Dublin, is a major step.  It provides another alernative.  I am not certain at this stage what the best format is. It is a tricky one.  I am sure it is occupying the Minister's attention, but it remains a problem.  Some of my familiy are attending these colleges.  I know the situation in them.  Something will have to be done. Normally, in situations like this in the academic world, those who are in power in the various institutions are slow to change.  This is a recognisable principle in sociology and many other kinds of &ldquo;ologies&rdquo;, but it is a problem and it must be tackled.  Maybe the growth of NIHE, Dublin, will give us some of the answers</P>
    <P>Given the fact that we have to develop a more effective industrial base, we need better and more modern industries to give employment to our growing population.  We recognise that the educational system has to encourage students to take courses which will put them in a position to fill the kind of jobs that will be available.  There is a definite improvement there at the moment but the projection of employment in the industrial sector is such that I am worried that there will be a reaction against the acceptance of some grouping of the subjects taken in colleges which are to be technological.  We have got to take some steps to encourage people to go in that direction.</P>
    <P>I made the suggestion in the House a couple of years ago, when we were talking about these matters, that maybe some preferential treatment would be given to students who went in that direction in terms of support.  I did not get much of a reception from the House, the Minister or the media.  I still think something like that may be necessary.  In a recent visit I made to one of the colleges I heard some discussions going on and the students' reaction was &ldquo;why should I work in a factory when I can be a teacher?&rdquo; These are matters which I think will be of concern to us.  At present we are employing 230,000 in manufacturing and by the year 1990 there will be <Col N="262" /> something like 350,000 if we are to have a healthy economy then.  That is why we should encourage people to take technology subjects.</P>
    <P>The question of mobility was raised by Senator Murphy.  The National Council for Educational Awards have a very well worked out scheme which is set up to encourage people to move from one stream to another if the educational requirement or the individual's capacity or motivation warrant it.  There is a very good scheme to encourage mobility between the different streams.  It would be dangerous if colleges wanted to take degrees from universities as opposed to the National Council for Educational Awards.  I see that having the seeds of destruction in it.  If that is what the Senator had in mind I am against it.  If the free movement of students from one stream to another, depending on their development is what he has in mind I support it fully.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of the traditional argument between the acedemic and the practice comes out here periodically.  It is worth while remembering that the environment in which we all live is changing so quickly that the scholars are finding it difficult to catch up and stay with it. When we say that students are reading for engineering or for science, they are reading what is on the shelves.  What is happening in the laboratories of industry is outdistancing what is written on the shelves.</P>
    <P>We cannot just have people who are very good at accepting literature, summarising it, taking some aspect of it and adding their own bit of research to it, which is a traditionally scholarly process but may not be sufficient.  I make that point in defence in new types of institutions.  I had the opportunity recently to take part in a discussion with some students of my own institute who graduated some time back at the M. Sc. level in the practice of management. What some of them had to say about developments in industry and the use of robots was quite frightening.  We cannot sit back and ignore these developments. I know that periodically over the years these kinds of questions have been <Col N="263" /> raised.  I believe that now, because of the development of the microchip, things we feared bin the past are upon us and we have to be ready for them.  I see institutions like NIHE, Limerick and NIHE, Dublin, ensuring that we are ready.</P>
    <P>Another area I am worried about in these institutions is the whole question of thev Irish language.  My position on this is schizophrenic in ways, because on the one hand I would be recognised as somebody who is a great supporter of the development of the Irish language.  As chairman of the Irish language council for five or six years I was very much linked with it.  At the same time I am talking about the development of technology.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that these institutions have the commitment and know that is is national policy to develop a bilingual State in this country.  Anybody who does not accept that should get off the wagon as far as I am concerned.  It does not mean that individuals do not have a democratic right to have their own views, but once they accept the policy within which institutions are run they have to go along with the implications of it.  The implications of a bilingual policy are that all individuals must be able to speak both languages even if they only speak one of them for 5 per cent of the time.  It is an important principle, Bilingualism is not 5 per cent of the people talking Irish and 95 per cent of the people talking English.  Bilingualism means that most of the people in the country, that is in excess of 90 per cent, know both languagres and use them according to some social convention.</P>
    <P>These colleges had better put into line as far as that is concerned, I am not sure how that will happen.  Certainly, responsibility for the Irish language must be placed unequivocally on the shoulders of some individual in these colleges.  The danger, of course, here is that the best staff will have to be hired for the particular technologies being covered and they may not always have Irish.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that these technologies be taught through Irish.  I am talking about the environment, the spirit <Col N="264" /> and the culture of the institutions.  We have a problem here too.  It has to be tackled and we cannot run away from it. It is not something that we can run up the mast on various national occasions and salute for the day and then forget about it for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>In a recent visit to a well know teacher's institution to discuss matters of education I must say I was extremely disappointedand a bit shocked that there was not one contribution from the floor of the hall of that teachers institution through the medium of Irish.  If our teachers do not do we it are in trouble.  I raise that today because we are putting through so much educational legislation at the moment.  I am a just little bit worried that we will forget along the way about the basic cultural objective of the country in which the language clearly is on top of the priority list, if not at the very very top.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the Bill and I assure the Minister of my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome extended to the Bill.  It is on the same lines as the discussion we had here about the NIHE, Limerick, only a matter of months ago, and i do not propose to speak at any great length.  If a person approaches a measure like this without attempting to be critical for the sake of criticism it must be admitted that this Bill will provide third level education for thousands more of our young people and is to be welcomed.  We must be aware of the Bill will provide education for people and turn out people with knowledge and skill in the very things that are wanted most.  That has to be admitted right off the reel.  I read a number of times recently where the chairman or president of the FUE has said a number of times that there are 13 to 14 basic skills in short supply for the development of industry. That has been stated by a person in a position to know and I have not seen it contradicted.  He went on to say that on a number of occasions new industry and development in this industry decided in this country meant that people had to be brought back here who had acquired <Col N="265" /> skills in England or abroad.  It is a very good thing if our industrial development progresses to such a degree that we would be in a position to bring back home people who went abroad to earn a living and, in the process, acquired skills that we required later on.  At the same time it is a sad commentary on our own educational system if we are not geared to turning out people with these skills from the educational machine, to use that rather crude expression.  In so far as this Bill, taken in conjunction with the one that is now an Act, will eliminate these shortcomings, then without any hesitation it must be welcomed, and if there are little criticisms about some things being omitted that we would like to see in or things included that we would like to see out, they should be put in perspective.  We should note that the Bill is before us, what it aims to do and welcome it.</P>
      <P>I believe the Institute in Dublin will help to fill gaps that occured in the past. There was, undoubtedly, too great an emphasis on the academic side for the relatively smallish numbers who were getting third level education in this country in the past.  As a member of a vocational committee, I sit frequently on appointment committees.  When one vacancy comes up to appoint a teacher of, say, english and history we had 120 applicants but for a teacher of mechanical engineering, woodwork or metalwork it often happened that because the number of applicants was so small, as a temporary measure we had to appoint a person who was not fully qualified.  That is a fact, and it happens in County Cavan, the Minister's own county, and I am quite certain that is happening all over the 26 counties.  Furthermore, I need not refer to it at this stage but in the Bill that is to be discussed later with regard to Thomond College it was a fact that, if we wanted to introduce physical education we had to have, in the case of male teachers, somebody trained in England and, very often, we had no applicant at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the next Bill in regard to Thomond College will eliminate that, it is welcome, and in so far as this one here will put committees into the position of <Col N="266" /> being able to qualify fully qualified teachers in these subjects to serve the schools out in remote provincial areas it is very welcome.  I welcome it wholeheartedly because of the benefit I can see it will confer on the pupils in remote provincial areas who have not had the opportunity of a complete second level education because of the difficulties in providing the teachers to teach the subjects that the committee and the parents want.  If this institute in dublin,  in conjunction with the one in Limerick, removes that difficulty, it will have done a great service to education.</P>
    <P>I read with great interest the discussion in the Dáil on this subject by the Minister, by Deputy Collins, the Fine Gael spokesman on education, and the Labour spokesman, Deputy Horgan.  I was impressed by the contributions made by each of the three.  The Minister, in referring to people in this country being in a hurry out of the level of education they were in struck a very important note.  It is on column 934 of the Dáil Official Report for 29 October.  I put it on record before in this House that we are in too much of a hurry out of all our educational institutions, that we are into the third level too quickly and very ambitious to get out at a very young age.  I should like to hear the Minister for Education say that when introducing a Bill on those educational matters, because it is a fact. There is too great a hurry on the part of parents to get children from the primary level into the secondary level.  Having got to the secondary level there is too great a rush to get into the third level, and the end of all that is an appalling failure rate at first year in university examinations.  I am sorry for making this remark but I know it to be true.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for children being taken from primary level to secondary level is, in some degree, attributable to secondary schools.  They are so anxious to build up the number of students in order to entitle them to be rated as a special category that they encourage them to do so at 11, or barely 11, with a tidy plus.  Having done five years at secondary level they enter university at 16 or 17.  Some of them are still too immature. <Col N="267" />  Certainly they have not reached the stage of maturity where they are able to cope with the university environment or be taught by lecturers or professors as distinct from the way they were taught at secondary level by teachers who, because of small classes, had an opportunity to give them individual attention.</P>
    <P>Launching people into a world with which they were not able to cope at an immature age has led to great numbers of failures and then cramming in the summer months to do repeats.  They have no opportunity to enjoy the summer break to which they are entitled.  It contributes to driving people to drugs, alcohol and so on, to break down the tensions they are living through.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the Minister made a statement in the Dáil on 29 October and I hope in so far as he can alter that approach to education, that he will. Another very pleasing feature with regard to the NIHE, Dublin, and a matter to which I have given a good lot of thought over the last number of years, is the introduction of an aptitude test.  I was glad to hear Senator Murphy say that the points system as operated in the university does not meet with complete satisfaction of all people at university level.  It has been in operation long enogh now for people to know it is not a success. The director and staff of the NIHE, Dublin, who indicated to a spokesman of the Seanad and Dáil, when they met in this House some months ago, that they were giving serious consideration to the introduction of an aptitude test, should be complimented.</P>
    <P>Some years ago entry into the national teachers' training colleges depended entirely on the result of an exam in oral Irish, English and singing, and a needlework in the case of a girl.  After a number of year it was found that that was not wholly suitable and now if the candidate qualifies with regard to the number of marks obtained in the leaving certificate, he or she is interviewed.  One hundred per cent academic excellence does not, of itself, mean that a person has the makings or the qualities of a good teacher. The boy or girl who gets perhaps only 70 <Col N="268" /> per cent all around could have the qualities of human kindness and so on to a greater degree than the person who is an egghead and gets 98 or 99 per cent.  Some allowance must be made for that and they think that can be done in the course of these interviews.  I think that is why these interviews were introduced with regard to the recruitment of national teachers. They have been a success.  The very same qualities could be applied to some professions.  Whoever worked out that an honours maths paper is almost an essential to get enough points to qualify for medicine was entirely wrong.  There might be some justification for that with regard to specialists, but what endeared successful GPs to their patients and to the population of the country in general was what was known as a bedside manner.  A person who got honours in englidsh or irish, or domestic science for that matter, would be just as likely, or perhaps more likely, to have this bedside manner that is such a help to suffering people as the hard-headed fellow with his 95 per cent in honours maths.  That system of selection is more likely to turn out people who are not actually suited to the type of profession for which they qualified on the points system.</P>
    <P>In so far as the NIHE, Dublin, is to have an aptitude test which will, as I understand it, be geared to finding out the suitability or the capabilities, be they latent or obvious, of the candidate for the profession he or she is choosing to follow, it will, in the long run, do a good job.  It may not be 100 per cent successful in the initial stages, and I could not reasonably expect that degree of excellence, but I am convinced that eventually it will be.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to amendments with regard to the NIHE, Limerick.  This party put down a number of amendments.  I was the spokesman on that day and I withdrew a number of them because I was satisfied that the answers given by the Minister, when replying to the case made for these amendments, did remove some of the doubts I had with regard to what the Bill contained.  For that reason I withdrew them.  I was not happy about one amendment which was withdrawn and I am still <Col N="269" /> unhappy.  I am not going to develop it at great length today.  I thought that day and I still think it is a mistake to have too much ministerial control over these types of institutions.  On that point I agree with Senator Murphy.  Sixteen out of 23 are too many.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the health boards; although the Minister for Health makes nominations, he does not have the majority on the health boards, and they are operating satisfactorily.  The State, whether it exercises it or not, has power to have a strangehold over education. The Minister is not likely to encourage a strangehold on education, but he will not always be Minister.  I put this suggestion to the Minister, not that it can be acted on now, because the Bill is going through, and perhaps the Minister will take this objection as a relatively minor one, but it struck me when Senator Murphy was speaking about the constitution of the governing body of the university.  The General Council of County Councils nominates five or six of the governing body of the university.  As far as I know, it works reasonably well.  I have not seen any great outcry against it.  The vocational education committees should be given the honour of nominating a specified number of directors to this type of education.</P>
    <P>My objections to the Bill are relatively minor.  In general, I am wholeheartedly in favour of it.  I am glad to see it being introduced.  I compliment the Minister on it.  I wish this development every success because not only it will offer opportunity of third level education to a growing number of people, it will educate them to fill the vacancies that exist.  It will enable education at lower levels to function satisfactorily and efficiently, especially in areas of remote from the capital city where it is often difficult to get trained and professional personnel to take up appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with legislation of fundamental importance.  The setting up of a new third level institution in any circumstances would have far-ranging impact on the community and on the country.  This Bill establishing <Col N="270" /> NIHE, Dublin, is of particular importance and will have far reaching effects on our community in the city, and also throughout the country.  There is a growing demand for places in third level education.  Any public representative is aware of this, not just from individual representations or cases brought to him at certain times of the year but from his entry into the situation and the discussion of the problems of gaining entry to institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with the anxiety, frustration and heartbreak which occur year in, year out, for many talented young people who, through problems of space and other restrictions, cannot pursue a course of studyto get them into their chosen profession.  That is a problem of the greatest magnitude for any young person and, obviously, has a great effect on their whole career and their whole life.  For that reason, the timing of this bill is of fundamental importance.  I do not understand any anxiety which might arise.  We may creating too many places in third level education.  For the reasons I have given, the demand is so great for top quality technological and other third level education that that is the anxiety of possibility of creating too many places.  It is something which would get a very rueful reaction from many of the young people to whom I have referred.  With regard to science, engineering and commerce and with particular reference to the establishment of the college of commerce, the development of the existing commerce degree over recent years has been very marked and of very great benefit to the whole area of commerce.  I am not just referring to the universities but also, from my own experience, both as a student and former member of the council of the college, to the historic role which has been played for many years by the college of commerce in Rathmines.  In paying tribute to the tremendous work of the college of commerce and all third level colleges in Dublin, I am glad the Minister commented on the hight quality of their standards.  It is important that that be acknowledged, because it is important to <Col N="271" /> emphasise the co-responsibilty of all the third level institutes.</P>
    <P>I do not understand criticisms as to potential conflict between the various colleges.  They have a common objective, the provision of the highest quality of third level education.  In the case of NIHE, Dublin, the provision for the inclusion on the governing body of people with a background in the colleges, RTCs, and vocational colleges in the Dublin VEC system, would help promote co-ordination rather than any problems about conflict.  The technological bias to which the Minister referred is particularly important in the context of our industrial and employment situation.  Many of the traditional industries, very often the highly labour intensive industries, for various reasons, are going through difficult times.  That is applicablke not just in Ireland but throughout the western world.  They are meeting competition from the East and from new products. Traditional industries, where they built up a great reservoir of talent and knowhow, can also build problems which confine them in their flexibility and in their ability to change.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons many of the traditional industries which have great employment and were very labour intensive are meeting a type of competition from which it is not easy to see them emerging unscathed.  More and more it is true that future for the western world is in investment in technology and in industries based on advanced technology.  That is the way we are being pushed. In addition to that it is probably the correct way for us to go in any event.  It provides a new opening, new opportunities for management systems, new opportunities for employment, for new skills, without any of the problems of inflexibility which through the course of time attach themselves to traditional industries.</P>
    <P>For that reason, which will have a basic effect on our employment creation in the future, the setting up a third level institution with this technological bias is of the greatest importance and will play a huge role not just in the future of our <Col N="272" /> education but will play a very practical role in the future of our industrial base and in the employment of our young people.  We are all very familiar with the good side of democracy in this country, the rate at which our population is growing and the percentage to which younger people participate in the population.  That presents problems which this Bill is moving to help because it is providing investment in creating new places. It has been said before and it is important to say it over and over again, it also presents not only an equal opportunity but a disproportionate opportunity, because if we provide these education opportunities, provide skills, basic training in new skills, then we would have a comparative advantage over our competitors not just within the European Community where in many cases up to now they have had advantages over us, but throughout the whole highly competitive trading world.  &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo; is a very important famous phrase used probably in the past in a different context but it has a very real application in this context also.  If we do not provide this type of investment, if we do not provide this type of skill training, then we are not going to have the economic freedom which is so essential if we are to preserve our political freedom.</P>
    <P>On the question of admission of students I should like to refer briefly to a point which Senator O'Brien referred to, that is the inclusion of the aptitude test with the points system.  I think this is a very progressive move, one that probably places NIHE Dublin in the forefront. There have been very great problems associated with the points system.  It has produced results which were at times unfair or unreasonable, at times absurd. It has not always worked that way but it did exclude the question of judgment, the question of flexibility, the possibility of taking into account the human factors, people who perhaps maybe for family reasons or for other reasons have a very definite aptitude for a certain career but who because of a certain record at second level or how they were adjudged to have finished in the leaving certificate have not been given the opportunity to enter into <Col N="273" /> a particular course.  The attachment of the aptitude test in the assessment of students for admission perhaps will now give us the best of both worlds.  It is a very progressive and forward looking factor to include in the assessment, and one I welcome very much.</P>
    <P>In connection with students, I want to make the point that as our student population grows there are other requirements to build up around that, outside campus life: the whole question of accommodation is one which costs a great deal of anxiety both for the students, their families and for the community generally.  There are situations in Dublin where students for one reason or another have to put up with accommodation which is not satisfactory because of over-intensification, because of lack of facilities in the particular accommodation they have and in the community in which that accommodation tends to be, adjacent to universities or other third level colleges. At a time like this, with the setting up of the college of commerce and future developments in Ballymun, we are likely to find this type of problem cropping up again, and this is an opportunity to plan on a wider basis for these accommodation problems and to ensure that not only will reasonable facilities be available for the students but they can become part of the communities which they enter as guests for their period of study and can contribute to them.  In that way we would avoid this ramshackle over-intensified, hastily converted accommodation situation.</P>
    <P>While dealing with this subject, it is appropriate to make this point to students.  They will be, no doubt, as students are, well capable of making their own point and campaigning for their own rights, and they are quite correct in doing that and they have a perfect right to do that.  But for the reasons.  I have mentioned, difficulty of selection, lack of space, they should always remember that they are getting opportunities which are not available to other people who may want them and that they will benefit out of the investment that is put into the education in which they are participating during the years they are there.  it is probably <Col N="274" /> right to say, having made the case for their accommodation and other requirements, that in campaigning for their rights they should also remember and acknowledge their responsibilities.  If I was to say that to an older group of people who, depending on one's point of view, are either wiser in the ways of the world or more cynical, I probably would not make it at all because it would be nothing more than a pious hope.  But with the natural enthusiasm of students it is possible, and it frequently happens, that we get this acknowledgement of others people's rights.  In campaigning and in looking for facilities inside and outside third level institutions, it has always to be borne in mind, particularly in times of economic stringency, that what is given in one place cannot be given in a second place, and therefore we have to look at the overall social situation in allocating our scarce resources.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to acknowledge, as someone who has had the honour and the benefit of being on the governing body, the tremendous work the governing body have done since their institution.  A tremendous amount has been achieved and it is right to acknowledge that here&mdash;indeed, the Minister acknowledged it in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>The work of establishing the institute, the planning, the direction, has been done with tremendous dedication by people who have given their time very generously.  The direction by the chairman of the governing body and the previous chairman and the director has been an inspiration to those who know first hand the work they have done and from which the students will now be able to benefit. We have a piece of legislation here of the most fundamental importance.  Its far-ranging, beneficial consequences for this community outweigh many of the Bills that come before us and to which we devote a great deal more time and a great deal of debate.  That, perhaps, is just the way things happen but I am particularly pleased to welcome thois Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators in welcoming this Bill.  I canot see how anybody could not welcome such funda- <Col N="275" /> mental improvements in third level education in Ireland.  Obviously, one fully accepts it is biased towards technology which is a development forced on us and which we should welcome as we are welcoming it with regard to this institute.</P>
      <P>Senator Donnelly spoke about the necessity to provide more places for students to choose their courses.  I believe that that is the basic reason why we are welcoming this Bill.  There obviously may be a crisis in third level education from pressure on places from a rapidly growing population, which places a unique strain on the educational system here compared to what other countries are going through.  The fact that we will not be able to accommodate all the people looking for third level education while this population explosion goes on has enormous implications for the future.  I am sure that that is very much in the Minister's mind and obviously should be in the mind of anybody planning for future education in Ireland.</P>
      <P>How different the situation is today from the time when I was going through second level education.  I was in the fortunate position of being able to decide what I would do, not whether I would be able to go into third level at all.  A disgraceful situation, of course, existed then: if your parents had a few bob you could go to a university.  There were remarks made about the inhabitants of the universities at that time, that they were &ldquo;the cream of the country, rich and thick&rdquo;, because it had to do with the position your parents held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has evolved slowly over the years and now, money or no money, you cannot get into third level education because of sheer numbers.  We have arrived at the extraordinary weeding out process described as the points system.  I find it very sad talking to second level students of 15, 16 and 17 years of age who have enormous worries in their young heads, first about job prospects and now accompanied by the prospect of any kind of third level opportunity.  It was far from that kind of worry that a great many of us were raised and it is very sad to hear bright young people fearing <Col N="276" /> for their prospects and talking about travelling to get their third level education if they could possibly do so.</P>
    <P>I wonder what kind of money investment in bricks and mortar will be necessary even to sustain the demand for third level education, to sustain the way we respond to it now, in ten years time. What are the projections for the entry of second level students into third level education in ten years time?  Will there be more or fewer than the very low level now, the lowest level in the EEC, for entry to third level education?  Even to sustain the present ratio, what kind of investment will be needed?  I have heard the figure £250 million in today's prices being mentioned.  I do not know if that is an accurate figure or not.  I would very much like to know that projection.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to a matter which I had not intended to raise at all, but since he raised it I will raise it &mdash; I am glad he reminded me.  It is the welcome given to the fact that 40 per cent of the intake to the NIHE, Dublin, were women.  Of course, when you consider that a great many more girls than boys do the leaving certificate and a great many more girls than boys do well in the leaving certificate, 40 per cent girls going into this level of education is not at all something to be delighted about.  It is very slow progress towards an ideal situation. There were 151,000 girls &mdash; the figures are taken from the Department of Education for 1978-79 &mdash; studying at secondary level compared with 141,000 boys. The girls achieved better results than the boys in 19 out of 25 subjects studied in common.  At third level education there were 21,000 boys and 15,000 girls.  Something has happened there.  There has been a gap between second and third level education which implies to me a great wastage of a number of bright young women who have opted out of education in far greater numbers than boys.  This is a problem which has been put before the Minister by many more than I and which should be tackled.</P>
    <P>When the NIHE, Dublin, people came to see us in Leinster House and we attended their very interesting talks they had no specific plans to attract women <Col N="277" /> students with high results into the nontraditional areas.  I should like to put on record that I am not satisfied with the 40 per cent intake.  I should like to see it much higher and spread across a wide range of subjects.</P>
    <P>The selection procedure has been mentioned and obviously the introduction of a wider criterion than just a point from the leaving certificate is extremely important.  The term &ldquo;aptitude test&rdquo; raises all sorts of alarm bells in my mind.  Aptitude tests have been less than 100 per cent efficient in forecasting subsequent achievements.  I have in mind a young woman who was given the full range of the might of the psychology department of UCD a few years ago.  Her parents decided that she should be tested to see what could she do, what should she do, and the results after attending on a couple of Saturday mornings and having all sorts of tests done which were going definitively to tell her relations what she could do, came up with the sum that she did not have that much aptitude for anything and she perhaps should consider a career as an air hostess.  She subsequently got an enormous number of honours in her leaving certificate and became a member of the legal profession and is doing very nicely.</P>
    <P>That was supposed to be a real first class aptitude test.  I feel slightly sceptical about aptitude tests.  I am wondering why there has not been reference to the concept of continuous assessment in schools. Speaking to some school principals, I understand more and more employers are asking for the school records, and more and more schools are carrying out continuous assessments on students, more on the American style, which tells a great deal about young persons who have been at the same school for a number of years.  Their overall involvement and participation in different kinds of activities in the school, their relationship with their teachers as well as their straightforward academic achievements are all relevant.</P>
    <P>In a country as small as this we have and will have the great problem &mdash; this is why we have a points system &mdash; of accusations of favouritism, of corruption. <Col N="278" /> That is an enormous stumbling block, and we fall back on the safe method of unanimity and higher points.  The points system is a blunt instrument.  What kind of aptitude test is it?  I hope the NIHE will conduct more research into different ways of selecting students.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald said that among the courses on offer from the NIHE, there is not a course on what he described as &ldquo;government&rdquo;.  There was a riposte to that, that nobody in government had ever done courses in government and still they might be doing all right.  It is a moot point whether they are doing all right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>He actually did not say that.  I was hoping he would, but he did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say it now.  I believe very strongly that with the enormous young population we have we must give them the opportunity to have courses in government, in citizenship in a broad range, in how the country works, how public administration works, how local government works; theories of government from all over the world.  I did a degree which was described as &ldquo;political science&rdquo;.  I knew Fanny Adams about how the country worked but I had a couple of theories of how the country was supposed to work.  In a democracy where we will have such a huge preponderance of young people facing very difficult economic circumstances for some time to come, I would be very happy to think that both in the schools and at some third level institutions they could come out of the education system understanding fully the way the political system works, and if they wish to reject that system or to replace it, they could do so from a position of strength and knowledge rather than a position of ignorance.</P>
      <P>The NIHE, Dublin, is to have a very fine course on communications studies. I believe that that is extremely good. Teaching communications without knowledge of government means we have our priorities slightly wrong: there is too much emphasis on communications and too little on what you are actually saying.</P>

      <Col N="279" /> There is a provision which is very welcome, to have a certain percentage of mature students in NIHE.  I wonder how long, under the considerable pressure there will be from the school leaver to get places in this institution, will the percentage which will be put aside for mature students be sustained.</P>
    <P>I would make a plea for second chance education, call it what you will.  When I was in the United States this year I was extraordinarily struck by the number of people, particularly women between the ages of about 35 and 45, who were going back to school.  They were going to embark on courses of study and they were going to get jobs afterwards.  The situation in the United States is that there is not the kind of pressure on third level, except for some very elite colleges, that there is here.  There are many opportunities for that kind of second class education.  I hope that percentage for mature students in the NIHE will always be a feature, that it will be a feature of institutions, and an increasing feature at that.</P>
    <P>It is also noticeable that &ldquo;the distant study unit&rdquo;, as it is called, will be a feature of NIHE, Dublin.  I believe that because of the pressures on the system, distant study or open university may have to be a major factor in educating people in this country.</P>
    <P>NIHE is starting computer courses, communications studies.  It will liaise with industry on technology.  It will be a major development in the whole area of technology.  I should like to bring out the idea that the NIHE would use this opportunity of having these different disciplines under the one roof to help us to use technology to educate, to develop the whole technology of education so that we may be able to face the demands on education which exist.  The prospectus states:</P>
    <P>The Institute will also make its facilities and staffs available to assist in the solution of industrial and business problems and for advisory purposes.</P>
    <P>I would hope that it will also assist in the solution of political and educational problems which are going to be very pressing.  Of course, I welcome this Bill. <Col N="280" /> I hope we will be able to find the resources to educate a much higher proportion of our young people at third level.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  I should have liked to have come in earlier on the Bill, but unfortunately I could not attend on the last day the Bill was being considered.  I am sorry I should come on this late stage.  Many of the points I might have made have already been covered, and far better perhaps than I could have covered them.  However, there are some things which I cannot help feeling should still be emphasised.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with one of the most crucial areas in relation to the development of this country when we are considering education.  We are dealing with a highly emotive area in which there is a considerable degree of social imbalance and of obscurity as to what are the objectives of our educational system, in particular our third level educational systems. Perhaps this Bill is very welcome in focusing our minds on the various points which Senators have brought up, as to why we are establishing this new type of third level institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, it is for very hard pragmatic reasons.  For the development of the country we need people with a very high degree of technological education.  It must go hand in hand with development by the IDA, and indeed perhaps the only hope we have of maintaining and increasing our material standards and living standards is by ensuring that we have a pool of people with adequate technological training, who are capable of playing a full role in the new industries which we must attract if we are to continue with an export orientated and modernised industry.  This, to some extent, puts the emphasis excessively on the bread and butter aspects.  One could say that third level education has, in its origins, always been closely related to basic occasional needs of society.  Universities in western Europe grew up from the clerical needs at one stage, and then the requirements for professional people in law and medicine, <Col N="281" /> and later the requirements of the various colonial powers for administrators.</P>
    <P>Now we see the need particularly for technological graduates.  It is a pity that so much emphasis is being put on technology as such, because one of the great features of third level education, and in a sense of all education, should be a pursuit of learning for its own sake and, as Senator FitzGerald said, the pursuit of innovation.  At times necessarily the two tend to clash.  One must have somebody with high technological skills, and capable of supervising or taking part in various technological needs, but one must have other people with high technological skills capable of imaginative thinking, of putting forward new ideas and processes.</P>
    <P>I am a little unhappy that in this institute the emphasis over and over again seems to be on the technological side without, in my opinion, sufficient emphasis on other, in the broader sense, cultural aspects which should accompany this.  I say this even though I previously remarked in this chamber that I was unhappy in the past about the undue arts emphasis in our universities.  There is a very considerable part for arts graduates to play, and I join in some of the remarks of Senator Murphy and others regarding arts graduates and fully support them.</P>
    <P>I find myself, surprisingly, in considerable agreement with many of the remarks of Senator Murphy in this debate.  I hope this does not embarrass him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two paragraphs I might not entirely agree with.  Another aspect which should be emphasised is that we are setting up this institute because we need technological graduates.  I hope the Minister can see his way to ensure that there are very close links with industry and the trade unions in relation to this body.  One of the gaps in the United Kingdom has been the lack of integration between university, industry and the trade unions.  This has been <Col N="282" /> a very overlooked feature, but a very important feature, in relation to the deterioration of British industry and their failure to make use of innovations in their universities, in their technological institutes.  These innovations discovered in these academic institutions are often processed in other countries and by other industries, other than British industries.</P>
      <P>In relation to this type of institution it is very important that industry and the trade unions should be closely involved. We hear so much about conflict between industrial, professional bodies, corporate bodies and the trade unions <i>vis-á-vis</i> wage negotiations and so on that we overlook the fact that these bodies may often have both an interest and a worthwhile part to play in training graduates and the development of industry.  It is clearly in the interests both of industry and of the trade unions that technological education is of the best and most appropriate standard in every sense of the word.  I wonder will the institute, for example, consider sandwich courses?</P>
      <P>We have talked a lot about admission to this institute.  We talked about bringing in mature students, and continuing education, but from the point of view of actual practical usage of these graduates and their most appropriate training, one of the best ways to do this is to see that the young people involved in the practical side of the industry in which they are actually working &mdash; for example, an industrial body using computers in the industrial and practical sense &mdash; also spend a reasonable period going into the academic or technological aspects of the computer industry.  I hope the Minister when making nominations will appoint representatives from local industry and the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards external confirmation of the standards in these bodies, it is absolutely essential that there must be a degree of quality.  It is a fact that a great deal of the industry we are attracting is foreign.  They will quite cold-bloodedly consider, among other factors, the actual technical, academic, technological standards of our graduates.  For that purpose, it is essential that we are able to keep up with the best standards elsewhere.  I have no doubt that <Col N="283" /> we will do this.  One of the great features of our third level education has been the high standard we have independently maintained throughout, but this is something which calls for constant vigilance. One has seen, in different areas of the world, in central Europe, the Federal German Republic and southern Asia, where standards have fallen very considerably for very different reasons and have created serious problems.  The question of standards is absolutely essential to these institutes.  I am not sure it has to be validated necessarily by external examiners, it is more a question of emphasising the fact that standards must be maintained, and I am sure they will be.</P>
    <P>The question of research in the institute is not one we have discussed to any great extent.  Subsection (1) (b) talks about engaging in research in such areas as the governing body may deem appropriate.  I am sure the governing body will consider that this must be of a very wide compass and not unduly limiting in any way in the research which they permit to take place.  I hope this will be more than a nominal requirement which the governing body will take upon themselves to exercise with vigour.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which must also be borne in mind is the complete revolution in communications.  We think of this primarily in relation to business matters and the organisation of offices.  We have gone far beyond the stage of the telex, and the telephone.  There are many machines on which information can be very rapidly transferred or displayed.  They are very important in business and are likely to become of increasing importance.  An institute such as this has a major role to play, not just simply in relation to the development of such methods or their usage in industry, but also in relation to education.  I am sure many of the traditional forms of education, from the lecture upwards, will continue and have a certain validity and contribution which will always continue.  Nonetheless, there are totally new methods of transferring information and relating one's understanding of information, not simply in textbooks in which one reads one chapter <Col N="284" /> and then tests one's knowledge by a series of questions.  This method can be superseded totally by machines in which one can constantly test one's degree of advancement of knowledge or understanding of a particular subject.  I would like to think that the institute itself will not merely think of the applications of communications to industry, but will also think of the applications of communications within the whole field of third level or post graduate education.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see this Bill in this House because it is very important and essential for the development of this country.  In many ways it is one of the most important Bills we have had before this House.  It reflects the considerable amount of work the Minister, his Department and those concerned with the institute have been doing.  I look forward with interest to his Bill on the universities because the whole question of third level education is absolutely crucial, not only for our material development but also for our cultural development and our independence of mind.  I fully support the Bill.  I do not think it is necessary that this body should be a university as such, but I wonder have we philosophically thought out what we mean by &ldquo;a university&rdquo; or by &ldquo;university education&rdquo;.  There are a lot of points we should consider and which, hopefully, we will be discussing further when we come to the Bill on universities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to expeditiously pass my compliments on the Bill to the Minister in saying that the NIHE Dublin is a very good idea, that the philosophy behind its creation is good, that the formation of these institutions of higher education throughout the country, parallel and side by side, with university institutions, is a good idea, that the need for technologies in our industries and in our society in general is an obvious need, and that these institutions seem to be admirably adapted to fulfil that need.  I have hardly any reservations about the idea of an institution such as this, or the one in Limerick, or the one that is to follow in the legislation relevant to Thomond.  Having made that clear, I am in favour of what is in the Bill and all right <Col N="285" /> thinking people would support me.</P>
      <P>Having made by bona fides absolutely clear I want to register my very deeply-felt reservation about this Bill, and I hope it will not crop up in the University Bill. it concerns section 9 and the appointment of the governing body.  I had to leave the House for a Parliamentary Committee when Senator Murphy was building up towards the great crescendo of his oration and I felt deprived both for his aesthetic and educational reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not hope to match that kind of performance.  Let us discuss the notion of the governing body.  The governing body of the national institute, as far as I can judge, will be entirely under the control of whoever happens to be Minister for Education at that time. There are gestures made towards students, towards members of junior staff and so on, but by and large it is a governing body which will be under the thunb of the Minister and his Department.  I cannot think of a formula better calculated to please the civil servants than this. A glaring absence from this governing body is the fact that the graduates of the institution cannot elect members to the governing body.  I do not know whether this point has been raised before, Senator Murphy assures me he did not raise it.  If you think of the governing body as an institution, can yo think of any more responsible and committee people, or better informed people, than the graduates of the institution?</P>
      <P>In the universities provision is made for six members to be elected by the graduates to the consistent colleges. These, in the history of the university, have been among the most vigorous, independent and informed of the people serving on those governing bodies.  I am such a person, of course, and I have to declare my interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be a gross defect in the constitution of the governing bodies of these institutions that the graduates will not be included in its membership.  They <Col N="286" /> have been students; they have come through the system; they know its defects; they know its merits; they have a commitment and a loyalty to them but they have informed critical intelligence in regard to their operations.  The absence of graduates from the governing bodies of these institutions is a grave defect.  The preponderance of ministerial nominations on them is also a grave defect and it leaves itself wide open to all kinds of charges.  Depending on the judgment of the Minister in question, it is a jest apt to be rendered, as somebody said in Julius Caesar, that he can appoint his friends to that governing body, that it can be a means of patronage and so on.  It is very serious that none of the past students of that institution has a chance of serving on the government body.  I wish I had sufficient eloquence to ram that point home with maximum force.  I hope it does not cast a shadow forward on the University Bill because in the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be taking certain relish in his private meditations.  I hope he is not exercising a kind of sadistic foresight in the matter.  The only possible answer to that would be that blood would have to be split in a situation like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only refer to section 9 on this stage because I cannot go into in detail. Under section 9 every lecturer, janitor, night watchman, professor, head of department, in the institution will be monitored by the Minister and his Department and possibly the HEA as well.  One way or another, academic freedom within that institution seems to be absolutely negated by section 9.  Whether this casts a shadow forward or not I do not know, but it seems that individual appointments to this institution will be entirely under the thumb of the Minister. I cannot see any other way of reading that section.  Suppose an institution is well motivated, and tries to maintain its academic standards as best it can.  It wants somebody very good and tries to attract somebody from England.  It might <Col N="287" /> get somebody from the University of Manchester or Reading if it offered a decent salary.  This happens all the time. I do not speak as an absolute &ldquo;eejit&rdquo; on this matter.  I sat on the  appointment boards of NIHE, Dublin, Maynooth, Carysfort and every third level institution in Ireland, and added my voice.  I know how difficult it is to get good people.  If I read section 9 directly, the Department will decide the point on the incremental scale everybody will be paid.</P>

      <P>It is bad legislation to put this kind of thing in the hands of Miniister.  It should be in the hands of the institution.  The institution should be in a position to go into the marketplace and say it wants a person.  I am not making any indictment of civil servants because some of my best friends are civil servants, but they intend to be rather pedantic about what point on the scale the man is to come in at.  They say: &ldquo;We are going to bring in a 29-year-old hot shot in education from the University of Sheffield, and offer him £12,000 a year, I am only making £10,000 myself.  No bloody way. &ldquo;That kind of thinking could destroy an educational institution.  That kind of thinking is given <i>carte blanche</i> in section <Col N="288" /> 9.  I do not like section 9.  The institution should have control over the point on the scale at which somebody is appointed.  I prophesy if that is not changed there will be stagnation, frustration and possible homicide as a result.</P>
      <P>With those reservations, may I come back to my opening point.  I think this is an excellent Bill which fulfils a great national need, but the appointment of the governing body and that appointment of personnel need a very severe second look.  If the same points are in the new University Bill I will be oiling my machinegun.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Senators who contributed to this Second Stage debate on the National Institute for Higher Educaation, Dublin, Bill.  I have made careful notes of the various contributions and I will try to deal with the points raised as best as I can.  Senator FitzGerald commented in his wide-ranging speech on the necessity to have a sufficient number of graduate personnel with skills for the various highly sophisticated industries which the IDA have succeeded in attracting to this country.  He went on to give some statistics about the number of new jobs between now and the middle eighties, and emphasised that the creation of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineeing jobs was going ahead apace, and that we would have to cater for them. He, with other Senators, expressed some reservations about concentrating on the jobs, on the idea of having graduates more or less processed to suit industry and the dangers that lie in that kind of attitude.  I am in total agreement with them.  Therefore, it is very important that the courses should be constructed in such a way that the graduates are not simply robots for use by the owners of industrial enterprises.  I would hope that all our education, from the primary, through post primary and on to the third level, whatever <Col N="289" /> type of third level institution the children go to, will have the effect of giving an education which will help the citizen not to become simply somebody trained for a specific purpose and at the use, beck and call and dismissal nod of somebody who developing in indutsry. We hear the <i>cries de guerre</i> nowadays about the lack of skills in specific areas, but I do not think anybody would want that position.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to a possible inflexibility in the existing institutions, but I would like to say that while we are studying this whole position we should realise that in this country, more than in many of the mainland European countries, the universities have tried to cater in the past for the technological area.  Were it not for the engineers, originally mainly civil engineers, turned out by our existing universities we should not have been able to make the progress we made from the establishment of the State.  Indeed, the whole engineering area was developed from civil, electrical, mechanical, industrial, agricultural and so forth in the university context.  We are talking now in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, Bill about an engineering area where there is a greater relationship with industry.  There is more emphasis on the practical end of the profession than has hitherto been the case in the universities that we have.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the developments in the field of electronics which carry certain implications for the future.  He asked if anybody in the country had given any serious consideration to the social implications of these developments.  This was a highly pertinent question in the circumstances.  We are told that the micro-electronic developments will leave many people, who are being trained at the moment for specific jobs in the country, without the jobs. There will&mdash;Senator Hussey will probably be interested in this&mdash;particularly in the secretarial field be fewer jobs in the future and we are training people for those jobs at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas where this will be effective.  I hope that in the <Col N="290" /> National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin and in any other institution, whether it be in the traditional university or elsewhere, where these courses are being developed, there will be a heavy emphasis on the social implications of these developments.  We will have to look to a time when there will be more leisure &mdash;I hope that leisure is the word rather than unemployment&mdash;and there will have to be new thinking on the distribution of wealth and the occupying of time for people who would nowmally be involved nowadays in the commercial or industrial life of the country.  There has been a good deal written about this recently, there have been some very effective books on the whole matter.  The new institutes&mdash;the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin and Limerick&mdash;would be particularly suited for studying the implications of these developments, seeing that they will be ground.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGeralkd welcomed the Bill wholeheartedly.  He said there were many things arising out of the Bill that deserve our consideration, and in that I agree with him.  There is one aspect of it &mdash;I may have referred to it in the House, I certainly referred to it elsewhere&mdash;that interests me and should interest anybody who wants to assess what the future educational scene will be in this country, that is the type of curriculum which we should be putting before our students as of now.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that thee new institutions are ideally situated for addressing themselves to these problems.  For example, the actual learning of skills&mdash;there was great emphasis on that throughout the debate in the Seanad&mdash;may prove a very frustrating exercise if in fact the skill that is acquired is obsolete before the person who has learned it has grown very old in his or her job.  For that reason there must be a great emphasis on the training of the mind and of the personality of each individual so that there will be a fertile field in which new skills are sown and brought to maturity.  In other words, the minds of the pupils will have to be trained in such a way as to have the <Col N="291" /> maximum flexibility and creativity.  Senator Conroy mentioned the place of the imaginative intelligence and that perhaps if we we over-emphasise technology we might be in some way attacking the values of an imaginative intelligence.  I do not think anybody in this House who contributed to the debate, least of all I myself, as Minister, in bringing in this Bill, would like to see that happen.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald and other people mentioned the University Bill.  I suspect that many people who spoke who were ostensibly talking about the National Institution for Higher Education, Dublin Bill, in fact were fearing the University Bill.  Senator Murphy  in changing a quoation said: &ldquo;Ask not for whom the Bill tolls, it tolls for thee&rdquo; and felt that might be something that a university person might think as a result of reading these Bills.  I do not accept the major premise upon which that fear is based.  I might use not a metaphysics poet, but a poet in whom I have a very special interest&mdash;I cannot say he was from Ballyjamesduff, but his forebears were&mdash;Edgar Allen Poe, and I say to Senator Murphy: &ldquo;Fear not the tintinnabulation of my Bills&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker in his contribution came back to fears that he had expressed already about the importance of external participation in the assessment of candidates for senior academic posts.  He referred to the universities when he was making his point.  The university legislation will be created in such a way that, in fact, there will be room for making this provision.  Anybody who read the debates in the Dáil will realise that I have from the very beginning, both in public statements and private correspondence with the National Council for Educational Awards, emphasised that when we want from the National Council for Educational Awards and from the institutes that were being established is a standard in certificate, diploma and degree courses which would stand up in any country, that the standard is one which could not be doubted in any country, by any perspective employer or by any academic or technological institution.  I have no fear that we will not be able to achieve that.  Senator <Col N="292" /> Whitaker has stated and reiterated his belief that we should not leave this just to chance or that it should not be left entirely to good behaviour.  I think that there are sufficient safeguards in the Act that has been passed and in this Bill.   I can assure the Senator that, in so far as the new university legislation is concerned, there will be the possibility of making such provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  That is what I was referring to originally.  My opening remarks referred to the assessment of candidates for senior academic posts. The Senator went on to say that we should provide expressly for an external check on degree standards.  The safeguard he mentioned which exists in the National University of Ireland for 72 years will not be absent from new legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy, welcomed the Bill and refered to the particular development in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, which was mentioned in my opening speech, and which has been commented on during the course of the debate by other Senators, the desirabilty of having this communication studies course in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin. He went on to refer to his own experience as an examiner, which he mentioned in the previous debate, with the Northern Ireland polytechnics.</P>
      <P>Senator Hussey, seemed to think that what Senator Murphy was referring to was simply communication with emphasis on the form of communication rather than on the substance of what is communicated.  The departments do not work out like that in the polytechnics.  I am, sure they will not work out like that in the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy welcomed in particular the fact that I made a decision that the National Council for Education Awards would be the assessment and certificate diploma degree awarding body.  He mentioned that the short period of association <Col N="293" /> between University College, Cork and the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick indicated that the traditional university was not fitted to supervise, or, to quote Senator Murphy, &ldquo;to mother&rdquo; this kind of new institution. University College were not in any way to blame about that debacle.  It was foisted on them as a chore to try to do this.  I did not agree with it as a policy at the time and I do not agree with it now. It was not so much University College, Cork mothering an institution as having a foster child pitched into its lap, with which it could not cope even though it did a great deal of work and made a very sincere effort to do it.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Senator Murphy and others defended the arts graduates.  I have never been able to make up my mind as to why people who take it upon themselves, properly, wisely and in the right place, to promote technological education, should find it necessary also, as a corollary to denigrate an academic or an arts education.  Many of the top commercical people and industrialists are on record as saying that a liberal arts course is one of the best substructures for technical training and commercial training of a high order afterwards.  It is not unrelated to the point I made already of how important it is that the students we have in our various institutions should be trained in such a way that their minds are adaptable, flexible, critical and creative. As Senator FitzGerald said, there is a good deal of discussion and debate necessary in this field.</P>
    <P>One point made by Senator Murphy was that the mobility should be emphasised not merely between the new institutions but between the new institutions and the traditional universities.  There has been some mobility already in this regard, but in the future there will be need for a great deal more from the new institutions to the traditional universities and from the traditional universities to the new institutions.  Senator Murphy quoted from an article that Dublin has stated that it will take special interest in recurrent adult education.  He praised the admission procedures which the National Institute indicated it will <Col N="294" /> employ.  He said the traditional universities are not satisfied with the decision on entrance qualifications.  In fairness to them, they are in a very difficult position. They have great numbers applying and they have had to introduce the points system.  It is a very weak kind of substitute.  When they asked me or somebody else what we suggested as a substitute it is very difficult to say.  The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, in having an aptitude test, at least we have developed admission procedures to cope with the recurrent adult education problem and to cater for mature students.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy and Senator Martin criticised the construction of the governing body and the facilities for what they call &ldquo;civil service intervention in the institution&rdquo;, calling the whole structure excessively bureaucratic and making way for interference.  I suppose we will have discussion in greater detail on that at Committee Stage.  There is not in the construction of the governing body the possibility of the Minister having 16 members.  there are three members who will be appointed by the academic staff of the institute, one from the non-academic staff, two of those members full time students, three appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staff of the colleges of technology managed by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  They are not ministerial appointments.  Two will be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from membr5ers of the teaching staff of regional technical colleges.  They are not ministerial appointments.  Two of those shall be members appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the managerial boards of regional technical colleges&mdash;they are not ministerial appointments.  One will be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, to keep the link between Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    <P>If we go back to section 5(4)(a) we find that nine of those members shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of subsection (5) of this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The freedom of the Minister is severely curtailed by section 5(5) because it reads:</P>
    <P>Before making any recommendation for appointment to the Governing Body of the Institute pursuant to <i>subsection</i> 4(a) of this section, the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which industry...</P>
    <P>The Minister's brief is tied.  He must take cognisance of an industrialist or a trade union worker in industry, agriculture, a farmer, someone who works on a farm or farm related industry, fisheries, commerce, the professions, the staff of the institute or the staff of any college or body referred to in the same subsection. The Minister's freedom to appoint is severely limited and, in fact, the lines laid down in that particular section for the appointment to the governing body indicate the widest possible field of selection, and in my opinion there is no danger of ministerial interference whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I welcome this.  Apart from a concern that is projecting itself forward into the university field I think that both Senator Murphy and Senator Martin may be concerned about this.  I cannot understand how I could pick somebody from industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions who would be docile, bowing to my will, running to find out what my latest thought on the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin was so that he would come in and push it at the governing body.  It would mean that the people who were trained in all those fields in our educational system had abdicated all responsibility to use a critical faculty and were mere puppets or robots, to whom Senator Richard Conroy referred in his contribution, at the beck and call of the Minister.  I do not believe that we are talking in reality at all.  For that reason <Col N="296" /> I am inclined to give more heed to what was in the back of the Senators' minds than what was on their tongues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision precluding in any of those fields gradual representation on the governing body.  Senator Murphy went on to refer to academic drift.  I do not think that there was any idea in the specific construction of the governing body to deal with academic drift.  When turning the sod for the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin I referred in my speech to this problem.  It was a problem that occurred on a large scale, as the Senator knows, in Great Britain, where institutions which were established for a specific purpose, moved away.  Indeed I remember seeing in the higher education supplement in <i>The Times</i> that there was a department of protestology established in one of the colleges of advanced technology.  I am all for a little bit of protestology but I do not think that we would move into these madcap areas in this country.  These are established as technological colleges and it is important that they should stick to their briefs.  I do not think that the composition of the governing body can be related to any fears that I may have &mdash; I have expressed those fears &mdash; of the dangers of academic drift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that it is not my intention, nor is it the intention of the Bill, that there should be any day-to-day interference by the Minister or by the Department of Education in the workings of NIHE.  I could see that a Senator might be concerned with that.  If there were a real danger of that I think there would be justification for the oiling of a gun, which was threatened by Senator Martin.  Senator Murphy said that this would mean more staff for the supervision of the institute.  I cannot see that at all.  The very fact that Limerick is there &mdash; by your fruits you shall know them &mdash; and it is working effectively, is producing graduates and is linking up with industry, it is a going concern, seems to <Col N="297" /> indicate to me that the lines of the Bill, upon which it was established were lines that do not carry these dangers to the extent that was mentioned by the two Senators.  Senator Murphy said there was room for substantial ministerial interference.  That would horrify me if I thought it was true.  I do not think that it is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny this.  We cannot, for example, sanction developments in any institute out of public funds without getting clearance from the Ministers concerned.  I do not think it is fair to say that the public servants who advise Ministers would in any way allow extraneous matters to damage their judgment with regard to the sanctioning of moneys for particular jobs.  One Senator said that a civil servant might look at a post and say: &ldquo;This fellow will have £2,000 per annum more than I have.  I will not sanction it.&rdquo; That is an unworthy remark, I think it was a slip that was not worthy of the Senator.  He knows perfectly well that the possibility of that happening is very remote indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy who, as I said already when we were speaking in the House, played no small part in the setting up of the various structures for the R.T.C.s and for these national institutes, when he acted as chairman of the committee, some years ago asked should the regional technical colleges not be included in this legislation, if I am right in thinking that is the point he made.  As the House knows, there are plans to have more regional technical colleges in the Dublin area.  There are plans to have four such regional technical colleges.  They are relevant on this Bill in that it is our intention that there should be a close link for the type of mobility that was referred to by Senator Murphy with regard to the traditional universities and the new National Institute, that type of horizontal mobility between the regional technical colleges and the National Institute.  That is envisaged.  We hope that will cause the <Col N="298" /> regional technical colleges and the National Institutes to thrive and prosper.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to make.  The vocational education committees as of now are responsible for the regional technical colleges.  They have done this very well.  As of now I have no plans to remove the regional technical colleges from the control of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>If we wanted to bring them more tightly into the compass of the National Institutes for Higher Education then we would have to take them away from the vocational education committees, and we would have to fund them through the Higher Education Authority.  As of now I have no plans to-do that.  There are some people who have advocated this and have been advocating it for some time.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy emphasised the whole idea of mobility as between the new institutes and the traditional universities and between the regional technical colleges and the national institutes, and the more widely known our desire for that mobility is the better.  He touched on the old problem of the clash between technology and what are called the academic disciplines.  I do not think I need say any more about that.  He did make a point about the development of the micro-processors and micro-electronics. I have already referred to that.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of being at the particular function that Senator Mulcahy mentioned where these people had dedicated a number of years of their adult life to study to get this master's degree, and it was a great revelation to me to spend an evening with them.  They are fully conscious of the need in these fields, both the commercial and the industrial fields.  They are rather scared, and this links up with what I said with regard to the social implications of development which was referred to by Senator FitzGerald, development which will put one robot into a factory doing the job of a couple of hundred people.  They are scared about what I mentioned already, the development of the micro-chip, not <Col N="299" /> merely its social implications but its implications for the success of our industry.  This is an area on which we will have to concentrate our attention.  The National Institutes are ideally equipped. So are the universities.  The universities have an obligation in this field also.  The point is that we do not want to drift into a situation where we will be dealing with large numbers of educated people under an antiquated system of distribution of wealth and where we will not have our plans made for a proper evolution in this field.</P>
    <P>Bhi áthas orm gur luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Maolcatha ceist na Gaeilge ins an teicneolaiocht.  Dúirt sé nach raibh sé ag moladh dúinn go mbeadh na hadhbhair sna hinstitiúidí seo á múineadh trí Ghaeilge ach dúirt sé go mba chóir dúinn béim do chur ar an nGaeilge do chuile chathróir sa tir agus nach cóir failli a dhéanamh sa Ghaeilge sna coláistí teicneolaíochta.

Tá an consumption trom go maith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, in a constructive and wide ranging speech, welcomed the Bill in particular because it was making provision for third level education for many thousands more of our young people.  As he comes from the same constituency as I do and as he knows the need in that kind of constituency where we have the highest percentage in Ireland of people involved in agriculture at the small farmer level, I welcome his words in par-, ticular.  He mentioned the survey that was made and the indications that there were 13 or 14 different skills where we lacked qualified people when an assessment was made some time ago.  He was referring to the activities of the manpower committee.  It is true.  We were short and people were encouraged to come back, particularly from Britain, where a publicity campaign was conducted <Col N="300" /> by the Department of Labour, a very successful one, and one that should be pleasing to us in this country because in all the universities in the second last term and sometimes in the last term, we have representatives calling from the multinational companies trying to entice away the very best of our graduates, particularly in the science and engineering field.  This is a feature of the university each year.  We got quite a few of those back.  We got some who were not graduates but who had trained themselves on the floor, so to speak, in industry and they were welcome too.  In a way we are getting back some of our own and they have the additional strength of having had experience in their own field.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned his own experience as an interviewer in making appointments to vocational schools on behalf of the vocational education committee and pointed out that sometimes he had over 100 applicants for jobs teaching history or English and when he was looking for mechanical engineering, woodwork and metal work teachers, often he had nobody at all.  I said in the other House that we hoped &mdash; and this will come up more specifically on the Thomond Bill &mdash; to get enough graduates from Thomond College in metal work and in engineering studies, woodwork and construction studies to provide teachers for all the post-primary schools. That is our long term ambition.  I know it is a long term ambition but it is a worthwhile ambition and one to which we will now dedicate ourselves.  It is not an easy one but it is one we will have to try to achieve.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also referred to something I said in the Dáil about our great hurry to get out of the system.  Parents are not entirely blameless in this, and they do push their children.  Historically, there was an economic basis to the whole problem.  It was necessary to get through the system and get a position as quickly as possible.  This was true.  To a certain extent it is still true but it is not sound educationally.  It is sad that the young boy or girl thinks, because he is not graduating from university at 20 or 21, he is too old, whereas our partners in Europe, <Col N="301" /> in many countries, are not starting until they are 19 or 20.  Senator O'Brien related this to the number of failures and even to problems with drugs and drink afterwards in third level institutions.  He also praised the application of the aptitude test.</P>
    <P>I cannot help the universities.  I do not know if anybody has made a suggestion in this House that would help the universities in the matter of assessment.  The aptitude test is one way.  The aptitude test is good provided we do not look for too much from it.  There is the infallibility syndrome; in this country, when an aptitude test is set up, we are inclined to predicate infallibility off it straight away. Senator Hussey gave an example where this did not obtain.  Developing psychologist gurus and attributing infallibility to them is a mistake, just the same as giving too much weight to honours mathematics or honours in any other subject.  It is a very difficult field.  It is one where it is very difficult to make categorical statements credibly.  I think all the methods should be used but one should always have that little reservation that the aptitude tests are not infallible, the examinations are not infallible; there will be a certain amount of hit and miss no matter what happens.  There is no way of saying this is the best person for a course of medicine, there is an element of chance in the end.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also referred to the question of ministerial control, talked about the appointment of members of the General Council of County Councils to the various university governing bodies and to the Senate of the National University of Ireland, and recommended membership for members of the Irish Vocational Education Association.  I assure the Senator that there will be representation from the Irish Vocational Education Association on the governing body.</P>
    <P>Senator Donnelly made the very strong point of the fundamental importance of what we were doing here.  He talked about the great demand for technological graduates for top level places in the industrial life of the country, and went on to praise the Institute of the College of <Col N="302" /> Commerce in Rathmines, with which he had a personal association.  I should like to emphasise one point very strongly. Senator Donnelly said that there could be no conflict between the existing colleges, College of Commerce, Kevin Street and Bolton Street, and the new National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  I agree with him fully in this.  He has had experience in this field.  It is important that we should emphasise it. The objectives are the same, high level education for commercial and technological graduates.</P>
    <P>The point he made that their demand was so high that there could be no question of making too much provision is also an important one.  We will need all the places that we have in Kevin Street, Bolton Street, College of Commerce and the other colleges under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and all the places that we can develop in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, and in the four new regional technical colleges which we intend to provide in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>He spoke particularly about the gradual wearing down of some traditional industries that were labour intensive and the arrival of new industries which are not labour intensive and very often are capital intensive, which require far fewer workers and very high skills.  It is about that business that we are here.  The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, is important in that field as are the other ones.  He finished by praising the aptitude test, by quoting the old &ldquo;educate that you may be free&rdquo; motto of the last century.  The freedom, as he said, was somewhat different from what we are talking about now.  We were talking in the 19th century about political freedom.  It is true to say that the freedom of the individual or the freedom of choice in his job is a valid interpretation of the word freedom in this context today</P>
    <P>Senator Donnelly also referred to the importance of student accommodation. It is a problem.  I am not necessarily concerned with it today.  If we are concerned with the standards achievable in the institute, we will have to take cognisance of the fact that there are difficulties about <Col N="303" /> accommodation.  He said that these difficulties, which exist very heavily on the south side and in the environs of the various institutions and universities now, are going to move to the north side of the city of Dublin as the result of the establishment of this institute.</P>
    <P>He referred to student protests and emphasised that the students had their right to protest and also have every right to make their views known.  He went on to say that they had a privileged position, that there was pressure for places and that they had the places and the rights of others should not go without acknowledgement from them.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey welcomed the Bill and said that by its nature it would have to have a technological bias.  She said that the demand was great, would increase and must be planned for.  She indicated also the social changes that had taken place since she was at the university, and talked of a projection for ten years time, for 1990.  That projection has been made, is available and will be published in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey talked about Ireland having the lowest level of participation in third level education in the European Economic Community.  We have already touched on one aspect of that, that we are in too much of a hurry into and out of our third level institutions.  Very often the statistics with regard to Europe are not relevant to our situation at all.  The statistics are often given by age groups &mdash; number at age 18, number at age 19, number at age 20 &mdash; in fact in continental universities, very often they are starting at 19 or 20 and their course goes on for five to six years.  I visited Eindhoven in Holland which is a technological university and there I was told that the course is a five year course, 20 was the average age of intake and that six-and-a-half years is the average for graduation from it. When you compare Irish statistics with those statistics you are not comparing like with like.  I am not making a case for our participation rate, but, to get a proper view of who has the lowest and who has the highest rate of participation, we should be comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> The point she made of 21,000 males and 15,000 females in third level education seems to indicate that there was a drop-out of about 6,000 women students who should be in third level education. Having already made the point that the girls did better in 19 out of 23 subjects in the leaving certificate, perhaps the fact that the technological field had been almost entirely male hitherto may explain this, in part at least.</P>
    <P>It is also true that in the commercial field very often the preponderance is one of women.  Recently, there was an international apprentice competition held in Cork There were female participants in the competition, in particular one Japanese girl who competed in the plumbing section.  She was very small.  All the tools of her trade were in proportion.  The box of plumber's tools was made to suit either herself or a small man in Japan.  I regret very much that I did not have the privilege of giving her first prize in her area. She did not win a prize, but the fact that she was there excited some interest among the women students in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey referred to &mdash; and I think I have covered it already &mdash; the aptitude test, and pointed out that she had practical experience of the failure of the psychological test to indicate what would be the best profession for an individual student who took those tests.  I know of other examples of this.  The psychologist is useful, the aptitude test is useful but, to repeat what I have said already, we have a tendency to adopt a procedure and then attribute infallibility to it.  We cannot do that with any of the tests.  We know that the Leaving Certificate is not an infallible test.  I agree with Senator O'Brien on that.  We know that the psychological tests are not infallible. We have no consensus on what is a good test, because there is the difficulty if you leave it to some subjective criteria that you can be accused of favouritism and, as one of the Senators said, you could be accused of corrupt practices.  A solid study was done on this recently by Mrs. Nevin.  She came to a very strange conclusion, to people who had been castigating the leaving certificate, that the <Col N="305" /> rate of success in the science faculty in University College, Dublin, over a certain period could be correlated to the successes in the leaving certificate. Again, for what it is worth, it indicates that the leaving certificate is not a totally stultifying operation as some people would seem to indicate.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey was hopeful for what NIHE will do for mature students and was impressed by the facilities available in the United States.  I suppose it is true to say that the whole idea of working and studying has always been very strong in the United States, and many an emigrant on the eastern coast won his spurs with pride at night school, who did not have very much of an opportunity in whatever country he emigrated from.  We are relating the education of these full-time students to industrial and commercial activities outside.  It is not quite real in the sense that it is real in the United States. Nevertheless, we know that this practical bent is highly welcomed by people who had experience, for example, in the engineering faculties of the traditional university.  That is a tribute worth listening to.</P>
    <P>A different study unit was also referred to and I have some ideas on that.  I refer to one particular point Senator Conroy made, notably the danger of emphasising the technological aspect too much.  He was agreeing with Senator Alexis FitzGerald in saying that we should not in any way minimise the importance of the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. He also emphasised the importance of innovation.  From primary school, we are trying to construct courses in such a way that the minds of our young students and citizens will be flexible, creative and innovative.  Senator Conroy asked if it was envisaged that there would be sandwich courses available in the institute.  I am not quite sure of the definition of a sandwich course, but I think what he has in mind will be available in the new institute.  He, too, with Senator Whitaker, emphasised the importance of standards. There is general agreement on that and also that the standards would coincide with the standards outside this country.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this should be <Col N="306" /> so, in that we are coming late to industrial development and that we might think, if we were relying on our own judgment and experiences, that our standards were as high as they are elsewhere.  Countries which have been a long time in the technological field are places where we can get the objective assessment of standards.  I do not think that will be neglected in our national institutes in Dublin, Limerick or in our regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy referred also to the provision for research.  He said it was not dwelt on very much in the course of the debate, but in the Bill provision is made for that.  I apologise for having interrupted Senator Martin's contribution. His shadows are either falling forward or falling backward with regard to the university legislation.  I am aware of university personnel having already voiced fears about this.  I do not know what the source of the fears is or whether they are trying to pre-empt the situation or whether they think I have some kind of designs, such as a famous spider had on a famous fly. I can tell the Senator that there are no grounds for his fear nor are there any grounds for his fear in relation to this Bill.  We will have a further opportunity to consider it, but I can assure him that it is not the intention of the Minister or of the Department to exercise any kind of stranglehold or to put a half-Nelson on development in any of the institutes or universities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a governing body that is soundly based and rightly based.  The final point that Senator Martin made was that graduates should have seats on the governing body.  I see that as an eminently reasonable proposal, I think, though, that it would be a matter for emendation of the legislation later on, because putting graduates on the National Institute for Higher Education governing body at the moment would be impossible because there is no such graduate, no such being in existence.  The first students went in on 1 November.  It is a good suggestion.  Perhaps if they leave <Col N="307" /> me long enough here I might take charge of the responsibility, if not somebody else in the future will amend the legislation to make room for graduates.  There is a possibility of appointing graduates of the NIHE, Dublin, to the governing body as they become available.</P>
      <P>I referred already to a <i>lapsus lingua</i> by Senator Martin with regard to a comparison, to people applying very unworthy criteria in their coming to a judgment as to the salaries people should be paid in these institutions.  We have got people back from Britain and other countries to the staffs of our various institutions.  We have been far more liberal at third level always than we have been in any other place in this country.  I know this because I myself suffered from having taught abroad, came back and found no recognition for the service given abroad.  The Department of Education in so far as they impose these things, or the Department of Finance to push it a stage further, will not be illiberal in their consideration.</P>
      <P>I was exhilarated by the debate in the Seanad and pleased to have so much informed opinion.  I hope to have such a debate to sustain me through the remaining Stages of this Bill, the next Bill on Thomond and the university legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that my estimate of 16 out of 23, if you like to put it crudely, of the Minister's creatures on the governing body was way out.  I still submit that 16 out of 23 is a valid estimate.  At the lowest the Minister will have a negative or veto power because surely if &ldquo;on the recommendation <Col N="308" /> of the Minister&rdquo; means anything, it means the Minister will clear the nominees in these various categories.  If he is not satisfied with a nominee for some reason, he will not have him appointed and is that not a ministerial appointment?</P>
      <P>Subsection (4)(a) gives him nine and down to (e) gives him another three, (f) another two and (g) gives him two, and that is 16.  I will point out something very interesting here which did not escape my eagle eye, I am glad to say.  If you compare section 5(4)(e) in the Dublin Bill with section 5(4)(e) in the Limerick Bill, you will find that in the Limerick Bill three members were to be appointed on the recommendation of the Thomond governing body: three members of the governing body in the NIHE, Limerick, were to be appointed on the recommendation of the Thomond governing body. There was no reference in section 5<i>(e)</i> to ministerial recommendation, yet here we have &ldquo;on the recommendation of the Minister'.  Ministerial recommendation grows apace as the Bills move on.  Perhaps not, because the Thomond Bill inexplicably does not give the Minister the same kind of majority at all. Section 5(4)(e) gives the Minister at least the power of veto, the power of negative approval.  It is very easy for me to exaggerate and easy for the Minister to reduce my position <i>ad absurdum,</i> but I would ask him to accept that it is very bad psychologically to be starting off the life of a new institute with &ldquo;on the recommendation of the Minister&rdquo; stamped all over the Bill, and particularly in section 5.  I regret that we will not have more members of the governing body elected by democratic procedures.</P>

      <P>I support that. I will not repeat what Senator Murphy has said so well.  To learn from experience is a great thing.  We have noticed the growing pains in some of these institutions that have been set up, NIHE, Limerick, Thomond, and so so.  We have seen some protests and conflict between the students and the people running the institute.  Institutions develop over the years.  Universities and technological institutions, boarding schools and so on, and teachers, people <Col N="309" /> who deal with young people, have a lot of experience and learn a good deal from day to day because they have to cope from day to day.  They can muster the means of handling these tensions and difficulties.  Therefore, it is very unwise of the Government to take so much responsibility onto themselves.  The Minister happens to be an academic and he knows what I am talking about.  By and large people who work in the civil service and in politics do not really have the skills to handle these difficulties.  It would be much better if the responsibility were vested in the institution so that it would develop a corporate sense of identity and learn the means to defuse situations when they arise or to avert them before they arise.</P>
      <P>In the situation which Senator Murphy has spelled out, the Minister is the man with whom the buck stops all along the line.  When the chips are down ultimately the protest will not be against the president or the governing body of the institute, it is going to end up in Marlborough House, or in the Department.  There should be far more delegation of authority to the institute.  We should set it up and trust it and let it do its own business. The involvement of the Minister in all of these clauses is not really healthy political thinking.  We may live to regret the large visibility of the Minister in that area.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I appreciate the concern of the Deputies and I would be inclined to amend if I thought it was well founded.  With regard to the analysis by Senator Murphy, it is true that nine of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with subsection (5) of this section.  I pointed out in the course of the discussion that section 5(4)(a) is heavily qualified by the provisioons of section 5(5) because the people to be appointed have to be chosen from a very wide range in industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce, the professions, staff of the institute, staff of any college or body referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that even suspicion of danger <Col N="310" /> would be impossible, due to the wide spread of those nine who must be appointed.  There is not a way that anybody could get out of an obligation to choose from those areas.  There is not a possibility of complicity between people chosen to act on the governing body, whether they be industrialists, agriculturists, men with a first interest in fisheries, commerce, the professions.  The possibility of those people, if they are worth their salt at all, being influenced by the Minister to the extent that they would suspend judgment or that they would have no minds of their own is just not on.  I know that the two men who hold chairs in two of our traditional universities know in their hearts and souls that what I am saying is the truth.</P>
    <P>With regard to the three and two and two which Senator Murphy added to my nine above, three of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staffs of the colleges of technology managed by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  If the House knows about the colleges of technology and their staff it knows quite well that you could pick any three members of the staff of Kevin Street, Bolton Street, the College of Commerce, Cathal Brugha Street, the College of Marketing, and you could guarantee independence of mind and ability and knowledge of expertise in this field.</P>
    <P>I will go on to section 5(4)(f) and (m). Two of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staff of the regional and technical colleges.  The regional technical colleges will be in the Dublin area, the same as the ones on the Limerick governing body are in the Limerick general catchment area. Again I say the arguments would hold good with regard to the teaching staff of the regional technical colleges.  If I were looking for creatures, whatever I would do with creatures I do not know, I would not go to the staffs of regional and technical colleges or to any of our teaching staffs in any of our institutions for such creatures.  I am quite confident again, <Col N="311" /> that any two members of the teaching staffs of the regional technical colleges could be relied upon to have expertise, ability and commitment in this field.</P>
    <P>The management boards of regional technical colleges will account for the next two.  I cannot say of any of the categories, under paragraphs (a), (e), (f) or (g) that there would be any danger of unworthy people being selected to act on the governing body.  With regard to the distinction Senator Murphy referred to, paragraph (h) is the corresponding paragraph here to the one he referred to:</P>
    <P>one of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.</P>
    <P>We have a special case in Limerick because the two institutions there are on the same campus and with a view to what may happen in the future I think cross-pollination between Thomond and the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick is very important.  It is very important that there should be as much communication as possible between them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Martin's point about the importance of having people on the governing body with expertise, I take that point completely, but if he looks at section 5 (4), specifically (b), he will <Col N="312" /> see that three members of the academic staff of the institute shall be chosen by the academic staff, with their own knowledge from the academic side and from being members of the institute and working in the institute; (c) one shall be appointed from the non-academic staff, again somebody who would be in touch with the problems of students and anybody else in the institution; (d) two full-time students of the institute &mdash; I do not know whether they will be in aid of the governing body or performing the office of the necessary gadflies to sting the governing body into action; &mdash; (e), again people who have the training and the knowledge and the expertise in this field. I can go on to (f), (g) and (h) and say the same of them.</P>
    <P>I missed the point of what Senator Martin said about the conflicts arising between students and the governing body and so on, and that it is important that people would be <i>au fait</i> with the problems and with a solution of those problems on other occasions.  That is provided for very adequately in section 5.</P>

      <P>It is not so much that we are disputing the composition of the governing body which, as the Minister suggested, is very well spread, and all the separate representations do not have to be justified.  It is the method of selection.  I do not really know what the method of selection is.  Take paragraph (f) &ldquo;two of whose members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister and members of the teaching staff of the regional and technical colleges&rdquo;.

      <P>Democracy and proper representation would be served if <Col N="313" /> it had been stated.  Earlier the Minister made play with section 5, suggesting that it severely curtailed his prerogatives by making him have regard to the extent to which various professions should be represented on the governing body.  I think the point proves the opposite from what the Minister was saying.  He has such a wide brief in section 5 that it does not severely curtail his choice at all.  It is the simplest thing in the world to nominate anyone and fit him into one of these professions.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;creature&rdquo; was too strong and I withdraw it.  I am not saying the people the Minister is going to nominate will be absolute toadies, but it is natural for the Minister to choose people who he knows are, shall we say, safe, but let it pass.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy has a point, but on the other hand if the Minister does nominate, adopting Senator Murphy's words, safe nominees who do not fulfil their functions, I think that ultimately, particularly in the present and future context, the uproar will be such that the Minister will be under a tremendous amount of pressure to nominate the people who would be representative of the professions.  He would be very foolish to try to do otherwise in the initial appointments.  There will be a procedure for choosing representatives which will work satisfactorily once the categories have been defined.  It may be unwise to say this, but the procedure will develop and the nomination system will become a more well-organised, well defined procedure and the Minister will have no doubt who are the representatives of the professions and the various categories and he will nominate those people who have come up in this way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="314" /> SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 has given great concern to Senator Martin and me. I should like to refer to subsection (3). The entire section deals with the administration of the college, and subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall not remove or suspend any of its officers (including the Director) from office without the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I know for a fact that this clause is giving concern to the members of the staff in Dublin.  In which circumstances will that most unusual event take place &mdash; the suspension of a staff member?  It is very much a rarity in academic circles.  Like the civil service, I suppose we look after our own.  You probably would have something like gross moral turpitude or gross negligence, and I think these matters are best handled, so to speak, within the family.  I can imagine a situation when, if someone had to be suspended he should be suspended very quickly.  It might need a very quick suspension to deal with the matter, but here we have a situation where they cannot do that without consulting the Minister and waiting for his clearance.</P>
      <P>The inability of the governing body to suspend its staff without ministerial reference is a grave defect.  Already in fact the authorities in the NIHE Dublin and the staff representatives in their union are agreed on the procedures involved in the case of suspension or dismissal.  The trade unions would not at all mind, if you like, handling these affairs internally. There is no difficulty from that point of view, and I must say I can only regard it once again as evidence of this uncontrollable itch to interfere on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the shadow of the meaning; there were references to casting shadows forward to a university Bill, and that is fair game.  The Minister ticked us off quite skilfully on that matter, and fair dues to him.  That is not my main concern about this.  Academic institutions, and I do not have to tell the Minister this, work according to the type of experience they have had, and it is a good school if it has a good spirit working within it.  If it has not got a good spirit working within it all the inspectors in the Department will not make it a good school.</P>
      <P>You really cannot legislate a good spirit into it.  A good university really depends on generating its own excellence.  There seems to be in section 9 and in a good deal of this Bill the suggestion that you would see lecturers, teachers and so forth almost punching a clock, coming in and out in a regimented way, in other words obeying rules that are entirely appropriate to a Govermennt Department.  It is perfectly proper that people who are doing the kind of very important day-to-day work that civil servants or executives in firms do should be at their desks at a certain time.  People who are working in an institution of this kind sometimes do their very best work by staying at home, by thinking things out, by writing things out, by engaging in experiments, that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that section 9 and indeed the candid spirit of the legislation do not take sufficient account of that, and the way in which people are appointed by being placed on a scale seems to be too much under control of, I am not saying the Minister or civil servants, but an agency outside the institution itself.  In other words, the institution itself is not to have as much freedom as I should Ike it to have to regulate its own business.  I am not saying anything pejoratively &mdash; the Minister was kind enough to say that I would be given absolute leeway with <Col N="316" /> regard to a point I made about salaries and I am quite willing to suppress that. But I think this other point is an important one.  I do not think the Bill actually gives enough indigenous freedom to the institution itself.  It is too much hedged around by both ministerial and civil service monitoring from without.  I sincerely feel that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this section first I queried subsection (3) and I was persuaded that it was necessary and important to put it in for the protection of individuals, that it was a liberal subsection to protect people from hasty action on the part of the institute, and it was only because I was convinced that there was something in this in so far as the protection of the individual is concerned that I agreed to put it in.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that it is being looked at from a different point of view.  It is being looked at as another instance of ministerial interference.  From listening to Senator Murphy I would admit that it sounds strange that the institute could not suspend their director or any other officer.  The only justification for it is in the area of protection for individuals. Admittedly, there is a whole body of legislation now which tends to protect the individual.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that if the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, wanted to make a decision that they would be held up unduly by applying for consent in individual instances.  I do not think it would be employed very often.  As Senator Murphy said, all institutions tend to defend themselves and look after their own.  I do not think the situation would arise very often nor would there be any great delay in processing it.  It would give the governing body pause if they had to submit their decision to dismiss or suspend to the Department.  It would be an argument corrective against hasty action.  That is all I have to say about it.  I did challenge it when I first saw it, but I was convinced that as it provided an extra safeguard for individuals it was worth putting in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very interesting that the Minister made that comment in response to what has been said.  I want to make one further comment on this point. It would have been reasonable in subsection (3) that the removal should have to be at the behest of the Minister, and the word &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; might well have been omitted.  One hopes that many of these negative clauses will very rarely, or perhaps never, be invoked once an institution like this gets underway.  If they are invoked, clearly there are problems which need important changes, maybe legislative changes, or changes in the constitution of the governing body, or other sorts of changes.  If the institute had to get the Minister's approval or consent for removal or suspension, this may bring such a suspension into the realm of politics, in other words, the Minister will be open to questioning in the Dáil on such an issue concerning such individuals.  In other situations, certainly in connection with semi-State bodies, he would have said he had no function in the matter. One wonders whether this is actually wise, seeing that it means, in a sense, Dáil supervision of these institutions, when we have always tried to avoid that with other bodies &mdash; perhaps not educational bodies, but certainly commercial bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also very sobering for the Minister to consider that he might have to answer questions in the Dáil about his action with regard to the suspension or dismissal of somebody.  It could also be the reverse of the coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>One last word on that point.  I should have thought that, as the Minister suggested, there is now a sufficient body of general legislation as regards unfair dismissals and appeals procedures to take care of any possible victimisation.  Before we leave this section I want to ask the Minister to look into the following situation which may arise under subsection (5).  As I understand it, the position in Limerick and in Dublin in the matter of appointments is that the relevant assessors board recommend an <Col N="318" /> appointment and then it is duly endorsed by the other bodies.  If, however, the successful candidate is appointed at any point on the salary scale above the minimum, I understand that requires ministerial sanction.  This is already involving these institutes in considerable and unnecessary correspondence with the Department who want all kinds of information as to why somebody is being put on a particular scale, what are his years of service and so on.  I suggest that this should be at the discretion of any assessors board.  It should be a part of the appointments system to have the discretionary power of recommending that X be appointed at point three on the scale. Since the new appointments system came into the NUI college this has been a standard feature of assessors boards.  It is never extravagantly abused.  Assessors boards do not suddenly say everyone is going to be appointed above the bar, or at the top of the scale.  I suggest this is a measure of discretion that should be left to the appointing bodies within the college and that the matter of increments should be taken care of there, and does not warrant further interference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could reinforce Senator Murphy's point.  I can understand the Department's attitude in producing this sort of legislation.  It is not necessarily bad.  If this institute gets going the way we all hope they will in the near future they may start to protest that the legislation, if it is applied with the rigour of the law, is too strict.  We hope this institute will develop and expand its own spirit &mdash; which is a crucial thing in any body, school, college or educational institution &mdash; that it will develop its own momentum and its own character.  The important point is that if it does so, it is absolutely certain to find legislation of this type too restrictive.  When I say that, I am not questioning either the Department or the Minister's motives in drawing <Col N="319" /> up this kind of legislation, but I would make the parallel with semi-State bodies. Semi-State bodies are governed by legislation which gives the governing body and the executive a great deal more freedom than is being given to this institute. That is important because our universities have always been given a good deal of autonomy.  They have operated not always satisfactorily &mdash; no institution ever does &mdash; to the benefit of the State and to the benefit of the system.  To hedge them in with all sorts of clauses would have been a mistake.</P>
      <P>Even though this legislation may pass the Seanad unscathed, I believe that if NIHE, Dublin pass the test and fulfil the wishes which we have expressed for it then the clauses we find in this section may very well be either redundant or not operated.  If that is the case, I do not mind too much but it causes an overflow of correspondence between the Institute and the Department which holds up forward movement, that is very serious.</P>
      <P>This is why the academic section among the Independents is querying the Minister on these clauses.  I am only speaking for myself, but in my view, either these clauses will be redundant or, if they are operated with the rigour of the law, the institute will be coming back in a few years saying they need freedom to develop, that the legislation is restricting them and they want the basic spirit of the legislation changed.  This is the basis of the argument we have been making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with both of my colleagues.  I thought I would avail of this opportunity to put that on record.  It may be too late for the institution to come back in five or six years time saying this legislation is too repressive, because at that stage it will be too late and the decision cannot be reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take one tiny detail which Senator Murphy raised.  Take an assessment board who appoint somebody to a certain level, say a junior lecturer.  There is an incremental scale between £7,000 and £10,000.  I do not think the board that appoints that man or woman should have the right to decide which point on that <Col N="320" /> scale he should have, nor is it a matter for a civil servant either, because the only people who are really responsible, who really know how to decide that, are the people within that academic community. If the people from the assessment board say that person should be appointed at point F on the scale, they do not know that there may be an older person in the institute who is just as good as the appointee who is at the same point.  In other words, we could do a lot of harm if we give that kind of authority.</P>
    <P>If we give that authority to the civil service, whose only criteria are qualifications on paper, they are not the right people to decide either.  The people best equipped to decide are the head of the department and the academic colleagues. They know the ecology of the department; they know the temperaments of the people within the department.  I have seen such psychic damage inflicted on somebody because a youngster from outside with many degrees was brought in and put one step on the scale above him.</P>
    <P>The point I am making &mdash; I am not even asking for a reply &mdash; is this: in the implementation of legislation in the crucial early years, I would urge the Minister to supervise his Department in such a way that that kind of damage is not done, in other words, that great delicacy is exercised on the part of the civil service and the boards of assessors to be sure of what they are doing when they are putting somebody on a certain scale in the college.  You have no idea what dreadful human reverberations come from indelicate decisions in that area.  The only people who can decide it are people within the college.  This is a summary of my attitude towards this Bill.  If the Bill must stand as it is, it is an accretion of practice that will show how the Bill works.  The Minister must be utterly scrupulous and see that it is on the right lines from the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy made the point that the assessors board had the very important role of assessing and recommending a candidate.  He advocated that the assessors board would recommend a point on the scale.  I do not think <Col N="321" /> that comes fully against what Senator Martin was talking about.  Unless there is a totally external assessors board, I presume there will be somebody from the institute represented on it, I do not know off hand, but if there is, he will be <i>au fait</i> with the problems that might be created by a wrong placement.</P>
      <P>Already elaborated by the Higher Education Authority with the Department of Education, are a general scheme and criteria laid down for the Higher Education Authority about placing appointees at particular points on the scale.  That has been worked out by the Higher Education Authority after consultation with the Department.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this legislation that would preclude Senator Murphy's recommendation being accepted, namely, that the practice could be encouraged that the assessors, provided that they had representations from the institute, should recommend the point on the scale, and there would be no problem if that corresponded with the detail of the scheme worked out with the Higher Education Authority.  If it did not, there would be a possibility of settling the matter by negotiation.  As the institutions are funded by the Higher Education Authority, it is an area in which the Higher Education Authority are competent. Some of the problems Senator Murphy heard about may have been teething ones; in fact, the Department were too involved, by necessity, because the institutions were only being launched, were only getting under way and without being sustained by the Department they could not have been launched at all.</P>
      <P>Senator's West's mind is the kind of mind I would like to have on the governing body.</P>

      <P>He would be able to deal with all these problems and iron out the difficulties about what look like restrictive clauses.  All institutions, as Senator Martin said, from the primary school up develop their own spirit, their own way <Col N="322" /> of looking at things.  I accept it is important that there should be knowledge of that.  The Higher Education Authority in elaborating their scheme, with specific reference to the placement of appointees on particular points of the scale, did not elaborate it without examining the institutions to which the scheme would refer. Again, that is not a substitute for what Senator Martin said, someone within the institution knowing the structures, the seniorities, and the value of members of staff.  It is very important to have that kind of input.</P>
      <P>Senator Jago made the point about &ldquo;officers and servants.&rdquo;  The terminology does not particularly &ldquo;grab me&rdquo;, but it is &mdash; we made this point in one of the Houses when we were dealing with the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Bill &mdash; enshrined in the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  Section 9(3) in referring to the removal or suspension of officers deliberately omitted &ldquo;servants which is defined already in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make one further point?  The Minister has been very generous in his reply.  This is specifically referring to the difficulty raised concerning subsection (2).  I have been a member of asessment boards.  I tried to assess my future colleagues.  Basically one has to assess three things and the third may be of less importance than the other two. First, will the person be an adequate teacher?  Second, will he adequately carry out what in the broadest terms is called &lsquo;research&rsquo;, in other words, the sort of work that ensures that his teaching is kept alive and that his knowledge does not grow stale?  Third, which is the most difficult to make and may be the least important, we have to asess the individual as a person.  Is he going to, in some minimal sense, be able to create a relationship with his students and with his colleagues. I do not think I have ever failed anybody on the last one.  I have been on assessment boards and I know I made wrong decisions on the first two, because one is working too much on the paper qualifications.  Both Senators Murphy and Martin referred to the fact that there is great danger that civil service procedures may <Col N="323" /> be, in a sense, pushed upon this institute and that the paper qualifications will be all.  I think the civil service are much too astute to appoint only their own men on those grounds, but it could happen that in a transfer of procedure this was the sort of thing that happened.</P>
      <P>I would like to illustrate this in my own case.  We are not always academics; we are not always fighting civil servants.  We spend most of the time fighting with the administrators in our own institutions.  I have not reached the intellectual eminence of my colleagues here.  One of the daily papers recently in a list of university teachers did not categorise me as a university teacher at all.  I do happen to be one, whatever <i>The Irish Times</i> might think.  I am only a humble associate professor and my colleagues Senator Murphy and Senator Martin have reached the apogee of the profession&mdash;</P>

      <P>One day recently I met an administrator in my own institution.  He said: &ldquo;I see you do not do any research&rdquo;. To put it crudely, I think I have been busting my backside over the last 15 years of my academic life to do some of the best research in my subject anywhere.  I said: &ldquo;How do you measure this?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I see you have never taken a sabbatical year.&rdquo; The fact that I had never taken a sabbatical leave&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be.  But the point is that the measurement of qualities is a very difficult and delicate one.  As I said, I have been on assessment boards and have not made the right decisions, but I am certain that the boards which have a fairly strong input from the institution making the appointment will eventually make the right appointment.  Of course, there must be strong external guidance but, as Senator Martin said, there are delicate problems of staffing which have to be considered when making a new appointment, because this could affect the balance of the department and create <Col N="324" /> a great deal of backwash and many problems if it was not handled correctly.  That is the sort of thing this legislation can take into account as this debate is making clear, and the Minister has responded on the right note.  I hope this is not all wasted on the desert air and that it will seep down into the great channels which we hope to see guiding this institute in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Senator West's outline of the qualifications he would look for in an appointee is highly commendable.  It might be true to say of assessment boards and appointments that there is no royal road to success in them, the same as there is not for assesment for entrance to third level institutions.  There is an element of hit-and-miss in everything.  People who have been turned down for positions later acquitted themselves with great distinction elsewhere.  This has happened in institutions and will happen again.</P>
      <P>In section 9(2) the mention of the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Education is totally unconnected with that kind of assessment.  The Minister will have absolutely no part to play in it.  The systems built up by the institutions and the universities over the years will no doubt act as headlines for the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, and there will not be any outside departmental interference whatsoever in it.</P>

      <P>I want to express my disappointment again.  If you look at the debates on the Limerick Bill, I suggested that this brought ministerial interference to a really absurd point.  The Minister went a long way towards admitting that there was much in what I said.  He said that it was put in there because of concern that from time to time the governing <Col N="325" /> body might charge excessive fees and that the Minister's court of final appeal would prevent the charging of excessive fees for courses and so on.  He admitted that that was a rather farfetched and remote possibility.  I recognise, of course, that he cannot change section 15 in the Dublin Bill when it is already in the Limerick Bill.  However, I want to express my disapointment that it appears again.  Let me echo my colleagues' words of appreciation of the Minister's generous response to the points we are making.</P>

      <P>Molaim an dara léamh a thabhairt don Bhille seo chun Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan a chur a bhonn reachtúil.  Is é seo an triú hinstitiúid nua oideachais den tríú leibhéal a raibh sé de chúram orm a bhunú ar bhonn reachtúil agus ar mhórán bealach is é an institiúid is mó tábhacht dóibh go léir.</P>
      <P>Is annamh an deis a bheith ann chun coláiste oideachais nua a bhunú do mhúinteoirí.  Tá bunú coláiste den saghas seo níos neamhchoitianta fós sa mhéid go bhfuil na saoráidí atá ag teastáil le haghaidh traenála i scileanna praiticiúla agus fisiciúla chomh ilchasta agus chomh costasach sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá na saoráidí sa choláiste seo, laistigh agus lasmuigh, go hinmholta.  Tá an bhéim ar na scileanna praiticiúla chomh maith leis na scileanna teoiriciúla.  Go dtí seo reachtáileadh na cúrsaí traenála <Col N="326" /> do mhúinteoirí i scileanna praiticiúla agus teoiriciúla in ionaid éaesúla, roinnt mhaith dóibh in ionaid shealadacha.  Go deimhin, fuair an-chuid múinteoirí oiliúínt shár-mhaith amach sna cúrsaí sin ach de ghnáth ní raibh caighdeán na saoráidí a bhí ann sách árd chun múinteoirí a oiliúint a mbheadh sé de chúram orthu saoránaigh an Stáit a thraenáil don saol atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Is institiúid náisiúnta é Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan agus líonann sé bearna fadthréimhseach in ár gcóras oiliúna do mhúinteoirí agus soláthraíonn sé scoth na saoráidí chun múinteoirí a oiliúnt i réimsí áirithe saineolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Bhí a lán daoine le fada an lá ar an dtuairim gur chóir coláiste a bheith ann le múinteoirí a thraenáil sna réimsí nach raibh leagan buan traenála orthu.  Mar sin féin tháinig an socrú faoi bhunú na hinstitiúide go dtugtar Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan air anois ó dhá fhoinse.</P>
    <P>Sa chéad áit, i 1969 d'órdaigh an tAire Oideachais go gcuirfí tuarascáil faoi mhúinteoirí a oiliúint i gcorpoideachas in Éirinn ar fáil mar go raibh imní air gur deineadh faillí sa ghnó seo le tamall anuas.  Mhol an tuarascáil go mbunófaí coláiste chun fir óga agus mná óga a oiliúint mar mhúinteoirí corpoideachais.</P>
    <P>Sa dara háit chuir an tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas tuarascáil ar fáil i 1970 faoi thraenáil múinteoirí, in ar moladh go soláthrófaí cúrsaí traenála do mhúinteoirí ábhar speisialta in institiúid amháin, agus go reachtálfaí na cúrsaí seo i Luimneach.</P>
    <P>Thángathas ar dhá shocrú.  I dtosach socraíodh go mbunófaí coláiste corpoideachais i Luimneach.  Cheannaíodh suíomh ar bhruacha na Sionna inaice an ionaid ina mbeadh an Foras Náisiúnta um Ard-Oideachas.  Thosaigh an obair ar an bhfoirgneamh &mdash; an chéad choláiste oiliúna sna hoileáin seo chun múinteoirí corpoideachais a oiliúint a tógáladh go speisialta le haghaidh an ghnó seo.</P>
    <P>Ag an am chéanna bhíothas ag smaoineamh ar institiúid a bhunú chun múinteoirí ábhar speisialta a oiliúint agus i 1974 shocraigh an Rialtas go gcuirfí an dá institiúid le haghaidh múinteoirí a oiliúint le chéile i Luimneach ar an suíomh gcéanna faoi aon bhord stiúrtha amháin <Col N="327" /> agus go dtabharfaí an Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan mar ainm ar an institiúid nua.</P>
    <P>Bhí tosú an Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan chomh teoranta san go raibh sé deacair d'aoinne ag an am a shamhlú go mbeadh sé ag borradh agus ag fás mar atá sé anois &mdash; coláiste nuaaoiseach oiliúna do mhúinteoirí, a sholáthraíonn cúrsaí oiliúna i gceithre réirnsí, agus go bhfuil sé i gceist níos mó cúrsaí a phleanáil i 1981 agus sna blianta atá romhainn.  Ní raibh ach roinnt scoláirí i gcúpla seomra i Luimneach a bhí ar chíos nuair a thosaigh an chéad bhliain den chúrsa cheithre mblian.  Úsáideadh an t-áras gleacaíochta agus na saoráidí spóirt a bhí ag an gColáiste Réigiúnda Teicneolaíochta i dTrá Lí &mdash; a bhuíochas sin do Choiste Ghairm-Oideachais Thrá Lí.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh sé furast do na mic léinn ná dá gcuid múinteoirí.  Ach taobh istigh de bhliain tháinig grúpaí mac léinn eile a bhí tar éis an chéad chuid dá gcuid traenála a chríochnú in institiúidí eile.</P>
    <P>Nuair d'athraigh na grúpaí seo chuig an suíomh ag Plassey ní raibh ach na saoráidí gleacaíochta a bhain leis an bhfoirgneamh nua críochnaithe agus fuaireadar na chéad léachtaí i bhfoirgnimh réamhdhéanta a sholáthraigh mo Roinn dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ainneoin go raibh an tús teoranta, d'fhás an coláiste bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus tá sé fós ag fás.  I 1975 tháinig na chéad chéimithe amach as an gcoláiste. Bhronn an Chomhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais na céimeanna san.</P>
    <P>I 1976 agus 1977 ba é Oilscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann a bhronn na céimeanna san, agus ó 1978 i leith do bhronn an Chomhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais na céimeanna ar na micléinn.  Tá na cáilíochtaí seo ar aon chéim i gcaighdeán agus i stadas leis na cinn a bhronntar ag Ollscoil ar bith.</P>
    <P>I 1978 tosnaíodh ar an dara céim i dtógáil an Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan.  Arís is foirgnearnh é seo atá beartaithe go speisialta chun múinteoirí a oiliúnt i réimsí speisialta, adhmadóireacht, miotalóireacht, tuatheolaíocht agus tráchtáil.  Críochnaíodh an foirgneamh i samhradh na bliana 1979, agus <Col N="328" /> i bhfómhar na bliana sin cláraíodh mic léinn den chéad uair in adhmadóireacht, miotalóireacht agus tuatheolaíocht.  Is suimiúil an scéal é forbairt an Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan mar ionad chun múinteoirí speisialta a oiliúint.</P>
    <P>A college for training teachers of physical education was first conceived in 1969 by my predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  He requested Captain Michael MacDonagh, inspector of physical education at the Department of Education and Dr. John Kane, then head of physical education, St. Mary's College, Strawberry Hill, now professor of physical education at Loughborough College of Education, to prepare a paper on the training of physical education teachers in the Republic of Ireland.  At that time, two colleges, St. Raphael's, Sion Hill and Ling College, were engaged in the training of women physical education teachers but there were no facilities within the State for the training of men as physical education teachers.  There was no established national standard of qualification.</P>
    <P>In their paper, Captain MacDonagh and Dr. Kane suggested that a new college be set up for the training of men and women teachers.  Conscious of the growing recognition of the importance of physical education in the curriculum, the Minister accepted this recommendation in principle and the decision was taken to establish a national college of physical education at Limerick.</P>
    <P>A site of approximately 54 acres was purchased at Plassey, Castletroy, adjoining the site of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  A programme was organised whereby groups of young men would start their course at St. Mary's, Strawberry Hill from 1969.  In 1972 young women who had taken an initial year of training at St. Raphael's and Ling joined the Strawberry Hill group.  When the National College of Physical Education opened in 1973, all these students were transferred to Limerick from Strawberry Hill to complete their courses, and graduate from Limerick.  A board of management was appointed to plan and oversee the development of the new college, and an acting <Col N="329" /> director was appointed on 1 September 1973 for a three-year period.</P>
    <P>The specially designed facilities available in the physical education building &mdash; the first purpose built physical education college in these islands &mdash; compare favourably with any physical education college in Great Britain or in Europe. The following indoor facilities are available: a large sports hall 36×24 metres, a fully equipped gymnasium 24 metres ×12 metres, four squash courts, a 33 metre, six lane swimming pool, diving pit with one metre and three metre diving boards, dance studio.  The building also contains a lecture theatre capable of seating 150, lecture rooms, reading rooms, seminar rooms, laboratories, administrative offices and student common room. As to outdoor facilities, the college is situated a matter of yards from the Shannon, which is used for many water activities such as canoeing.  Lough Derg is upstream for sailing activities.  There is an all-weather play area 70×100 metres, five outdoor tennis courts, and an eight lane international size athletic track.  An additional 35 acres adjoining is being purchased and in all nine playing pitches, and three practice areas are provided.</P>
    <P>The physical education course aims to produce highly specialist teachers of physical education who are, in addition, able to teach another area of the school curriculum competently to leaving certificate level.  The course, therefore, consists basically of four elements &mdash; physical education studies &mdash; theory and practice &mdash; elective subject, pedagogics and teaching practice.</P>
    <P>The Report on Teacher Education, published by the Higher Education Authority in September 1970, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that courses for the training of teachers of specialist subjects should be concentrated in a single institution and centred in the Limerick Institute for Higher Education, which was not then established.  In 1972, the Minister for Education, Deputy Padraig Faulkner, TD, informed the Government that it was intended that the National College of Physical Education would be an independent college pending a decision on the siting of the centre for the specialist <Col N="330" /> teacher training courses which were conducted by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In May 1973, approval in principle was given for the provision of a single institution for the training of teachers of specialist subjects, which was to be treated as an additional phase of the college for training teachers of physical education, and it was decided to seek a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) for a loan for the construction and equipping of the Institution.  The World Bank subsequently approved the application for a loan and the work of construction of the second phase of Thomond College was completed in January 1979.</P>
    <P>The Government's decisions of 13 December 1974 on higher education included the following in relation to the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects at Limerick, and the National College of Physical Education:</P>
    <P>the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects, Limerick, and the National College of Physical Education, shall have a Joint Governing Body of twenty-five members, and shall be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On 5 November 1976, the Government approved the title Thomond College of Education for the institution for which the joint governing body would have responsibility.  On the same date, the Government approved a list of names of persons who should be invited to act on the governing body of Thomond College of Education, and the first meeting of the governing body was held on 8 March, 1976.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Board of Management who had all the headaches of getting the college of physical education off the ground, and also to the <i>ad hoc</i> governing body which has been responsible for the affairs of Thomond College since 1975 and whose term of office has been extended until the college is established on a statutory basis. A director for the college was appointed on a permanent basis and took up duty on 1 September, 1976.</P>
    <P>As an exceptional matter the National <Col N="331" /> Council for Educational Awards was authorised to be the degree awarding body for Thomond College of Education &mdash; then the National College of Physical Education &mdash; in 1975.  The college was granted recognised college status by the National University of Ireland in 1976 and the university was the degree awarding authority for students of the college who graduated in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Education, I restored to the National Council for Educational Awards their degree-awarding function.  On 18 November 1977, I announced that the NCEA were to be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree level courses in Thomond College of Education &mdash; and also certificates, diplomas and degrees for NIHE Limerick, the NIHE, Dublin and the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The first groups of leaving certificate students for the courses in general and rural science, metalwork and engineering science, and woodwork and building science enrolled at Thomond College in autumn 1979, for the first year of four-year degree level courses.  The National Council for Educational Awards will be the degree-awarding body for these courses.  Two of these groups, the metalwork and woodwork students, going into their second year in autumn 1980, have been joined by two groups of students with a training in trade in the appropriate skills.  The students with a trade background hold senior trade certificates. This is the best kind of mobility.  They have completed a full statutory apprenticeship and have undergone comprehensive written and practical examinations, oral examinations in Irish and English and a searching interview before being selected.  They have been exempted from the first year of the course and will be paid a weekly maintenance allowance during their period of training.</P>
    <P>A one-year course for training graduates as teachers of commercial subjects will commence at Thomond College in autumn 1981.  Thomond College will also provide in-service courses for teachers in areas such as educational management, <Col N="332" /> adult education, remedial education and educational technology.</P>
    <P>Student-teachers of all specialties have common core-areas of study &mdash; pedagogics, education theory, teaching practice; and core subjects &mdash; English, Irish and mathematics.  Through the National Council for Educational Awards a consistency of standards and a central examination system are achieved.</P>
    <P>Ní misde do gach scoláire tréimhse éifeachtach a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht fhaid atá sé ag freastail sa choláiste ionus go bhfuighidh sé oilteacht agus líofacht sa Ghaeilge.  Do rinne an Seanadóir Ó Maolcatha tagairt don riachtanas sin nuair a bhí sé ag caint roimhe seo sa tSeanad.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the college is an attractive building designed to be in conformity with the all over campus development plan.  Approximately 6,000 square metres of additional accommodation have been provided in this phase. There are three lecture theatres, each capable of seating 100, nine classrooms, ten laboratories and workshops, four drawing rooms, an educational technology suite incorporating a laboratory, a workshop and a teaching resources centre, a business machines room, an audio-typewriting room, social areas, staff common room and staff and administrative offices.</P>
    <P>A further 30 acres of land will be purchased in 1981 to accommodate the outdoor requirements of the rural science course, so that the total area of land available for the use of the college will be in the region of 120 acres.</P>
    <P>One of the unique features of the college is the amount of outdoor teaching space required to mount the physical education and rural science courses.  I have outlined earlier the outdoor facilities required for physical education.  For the rural science programme, it will be necessary to provide for fruit trees and shrubs, bush fruits, soft fruits, kitchen garden, flower garden, lawns, bee-keeping, nursery plots, museum plots, transplant plots, experimental plots, glass houses, small animal house, crop plants, farm animals, animal buildings, food storage space, manure compost and so <Col N="333" /> on.  It is also necessary to provide for rotation of crops.</P>
    <P>In the current academic year, 283 students have been enrolled at the college. The total planned capacity of the present buildings is approximately 800 students.</P>
    <P>I now propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill as it has been presented.  Section I deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 establishes the college which shall be known in the Irish language as Coláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan, Luimneach, and in the English language as Thomond College of Education, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Section 3 defines what is meant by membership of the college.  The functions of the college, set out in section 4, indicate its special purpose.  The functions are:</P>
    <P> (a)  to provide suitable degree level courses for the purpose of the training of teachers for service in such schools and institutions as may be determined by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(b)  to provide courses for teachers already serving in such schools and institutions as may be determined by the Minister:</P>
    <P>(c)  to provide such other courses as the Minister may from time to time determine;</P>
    <P>(d)  to engage in research in such fields as the governing body may deem appropriate:</P>
    <P>(e)  subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultation with an tÚdarás&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  to buy and acquire lands or buildings:</P>
    <P>(ii)  to institute and if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes and other awards;</P>
    <P>(f)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to maintain, manage, administer and invest all the money and assets of the college;</P>
    <P>(g)  to accept from donors gifts of <Col N="334" /> land or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donors: provided that nothing in any such trust or condition is contrary to the provisions of this Act;</P>
    <P>(h)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the college.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of the governing body, and prescribes its structure and functions.  Like the national institutes for higher education, the Bill provides for a 25 member governing body consisting of the chairman, the director and 23 ordinary members.  The chairman and the 23 ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  The manner of appointment of the 23 ordinary members is set out in section 5 (4) and is as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  seven shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (5) which draws particular attention to the need for adequate representation of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions;</P>
    <P>(b)  three shall be appointed who shall be members of the academic staff of the college who shall be chosen by the academic staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(c)  one shall be appointed who shall be a member of the non-academic staff of the college chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(d)  two shall be appointed who are full-time students of the college chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(e)  three shall be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick; <Col N="335" /> (f)  two shall be appointed on the recommendation of An Chomhairle Oiliúna;</P>
    <P>(g)  one shall be appointed who shall be a member of the staff of a university in the State, or of any college or institution which is a constituent college of, or is recognised by, such a university;</P>
    <P>(h)  one member shall be appointed who shall be a member of the academic staff of the colleges of education for primary teachers; and</P>
    <P>(i)  three shall be appointed after consultation with such bodies representative of the interests of second level education as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the functions of the governing body.  The governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the college and shall perform all the functions conferred on the college by this Act and shall have all such powers as may be necessary under this Act for this purpose.  The governing body may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks proper to assist it in such manner as the governing body shall direct and the governing body may assign to any committee so appointed such duties as it thinks fit.  The acts of any such committee shall be subject to confirmation by the governing body unless the governing body dispense with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a post of chief officer of the college, to be known as the director.  The Second Schedule sets out the conditions governing the appointment of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment of an academic council for the college and prescribes the functions of the council.  The academic council acts as specialist advisers to the governing body on academic matters.  Its functions relate to the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the college.  The membership and terms of office of the academic council are determined by regulations made by the governing body.  Section 8 (3) lists <Col N="336" /> particular functions of the council as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  to design, develop and implement appropriate programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(b)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement such programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(c) to make recommendations to the governing body on programmes for the development of research:</P>
    <P>(d) to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students;</P>
    <P>(e)  to make, subject to the approval of the governing body, and to implement the academic regulations of the college;</P>
    <P>(f)  to propose to the governing body the form of regulations to be made by the governing body for the conduct of examinations and for the evaluation of academic progress;</P>
    <P>(g)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the award of fellowships, scholarships, bursaries, prizes or other awards;</P>
    <P>(h)  to make general arrangements for tutorial or other academic counselling;</P>
    <P>(i)  to exercise any other functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, which may be delegated to it by the governing body; and</P>
    <P>(j)  to implement any regulations which may be made by the governing body concerning any of the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the governing body, the academic council may establish such and so many committees either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the college as it thinks proper to assist the academic council in the performance of its functions and may determine the functions of any committee so established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> Section 9 enables the college to appoint such members of staff as are necessary subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance and to determine the conditions of service and pay of such staff subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the staff serving in the <i>ad hoc</i> college may be transferred to the service of the statutory body and protects the conditions of service, pay and pension rights of the transferred staff, which will not be any less favourable than the conditions they enjoyed while serving as members of the staff of the <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places responsibility on the college to prepare and submit to the Minister as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, a pension scheme for staff. All provisions of any pension scheme submitted by the college will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the public Service.  Every approved scheme will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within twenty-one sitting days.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires the governing body to submit to the Minister annually a report of the work of the college.  The section also provides that the college will give the Minister any information about its operation that he may require from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that in each year there shall, in accordance with Section 12(2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 be paid by the Higher Education Authority to the college, out of moneys received by the Authority under Section 12.1 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, a grant or grants of such amount or amounts as the Authority think fit.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires the college to keep accounts which must be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When received by the institute the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be submitted with the accounts to the Minister.  The Minister will lay the accounts before each House <Col N="338" /> of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the college to charge fees for admission to courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event held by the college or for admission to any event held at the college.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is the usual provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtais.  Section 17 provides for the short title and the commencement date.</P>
    <P>Thomond College of Education is a national instution and fills a long-felt gap in our teacher training system.  It provides superb facilities for training teachers in particular areas of specialisation.  A college such as this is particularly relevant to current educational needs when the emphasis is on encouraging and developing practical skills as well as factual and theoretical knowledge, and on the encouragement of physical fitness and sport as an essential part of education.</P>
    <P>Ba lease liom críochnú gan mo mheas a chur in iúl do na daoine a bhí freagrach as cúrsaí oiliúna na Roinne a stiúradh thar na blianta faoi choinniollacha oibre nach raibh i gcónaí fábhrach &mdash; is é sin le rá lucht eagraithe na gcúrsaí, na múinteoirí agus na coistí gairm-oideachais &mdash; ní bheadh sé indéanta na cúrsaí a eagrú gan comhoibriú uathu san uilig.  Tá de chúram ar Choláiste Oideachais Thuamhumhan leanúint leis an dtraidisiún suntasach seo ach tá bonn curtha leis an ghnó a fhágann ar chumas an Choláiste glacadh leis an dúshlán.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille don tSeanad mar thogra a bhfuil lán-mhuinín agam as ó thaobh leas na tíre agus an oideachais.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá ar dtús go gcuirim fáilte roimh an mBille.  Is cúis áthais dornsa é an Bille seo a bheith tugtha isteach sa Teach seo ag an Aire.  Táimid buíoch don Aire mar gheall ar an cúntas fada a thug sé dúinn ar a riachtainí is atá sé Bille den tsórt seo a thabhairt isteach, ar na smaointe a bhí in aigne na ndaoine a cheap an Bille seo <Col N="339" /> tamaill de bhlianta ó shin, agus ar an dul ar aghaidh a deineadh ó chéad chur tús ar an obair</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  What I said with regard to the NIHE Bill, Dublin, can be equally applied to this.  The Bill, when it becomes law, will provide for a long felt want in the educational system.  I welcome it wholeheartedly and I wish every success to those who will be entrusted with developing this new educational institiute in the country.  Physical education has been neglected in this country down the years for a number of reasons. Firstly, we did not have sufficient numbers of trained personnel.  Secondly, we did not have the accommodation. Schools all over the country had the bare minimum teaching accommodation.  We had no gymnasia and very little was done about it.  The only attempt at providing physical education in most of this country, especially in rural areas, however informally, came from the GAA and athletic clubs who endeavoured to promote physical fitness.  Times have changed and this is a welcome step forward.</P>
      <P>As in every other big development, it is not enough to provide the trained personnel, you have to have the gymnasia and a general purposes room in the primary schools, so that these people will have a suitable place to work.  Concurrently with this development in the training of more teachers, good progress is being made, first of all at national school level, providing general purpose rooms, where some physical education work can be done and, secondly, in the larger schools where splendid gymnasia are being erected.  Up to quite recently, it was a cause of envy for people who went to the North of Ireland to see the fine equipment that was provided for physical education in schools there is comparison to what was available here.  I am glad to see that that is being remedied and that we are making headway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that a number of rather large physical education centres are about to be built or being built already. I congratulate the Minister for the part he played in that.  Physical educational centres in a provincial town will be a great <Col N="340" /> amenity and will go a long way to developing physical fitness, pride in physical fitness and providing people with some alternative to public houses during their leisure hours.  Concurrently, progress is being made at different levels and it will have a good result.</P>
    <P>Teachers of physical education and of commerce are in short supply.  When any kind of specialist is in short supply, as I indicated on the other Bill, the more remote areas of the country are most likely to suffer.  When the number of applicants is small they can pick and choose, they tend to concentrate on the cities, Dublin, Cork or Galway, the university cities, the bright lights.  The more rural and more remote parts of the country fare badly.  When we have the more adequate supply of specialist teachers that the Bill is providing for, we will be able to fill the vacancies, whether they be in Bawnboy, Carrigallen, Blacksod or Derrybeg.  All the youth of the country will then be getting an equal opportunity. That is what this Bill and the other one we dealt with earlier are designed to do, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I spoke already, in regard to the other Bill, about applications for vacancies for teachers.  During the last three months Cavan Vocational Education Committee was looking for two commerce teachers.  They had four applicants.  One of the four was fully qualified. None of the other three was fully qualified.  The committee was forced, as a temporary measure, to put in the best qualified of the three who were not fully qualified, on a temporary basis.  Situations like that arose because there was not provision for turning out teachers of that kind in the past.  The Bill will put an end to that situation and for that reason I welcome it enthusiastically.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see rural science is included.  I hope the course that teachers will do in this new institute will result in their using the knowledge they have acquired of shrubs and flowers to beautify the countryside where they settle down. Every school in the country should have a shrubs and flower plot and, in some cases small vegetable plots and so on, and I hope turning out a sufficient number of <Col N="341" /> people qualified in rural science will help to develop that.</P>
    <P>I have already made clear with regard to the NIHE, Dublin, Bill what my views are on developments of this kind.  This is a further development and I heartily welcome it and wish it every success.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas ormsa freisin fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Is dóigh liom gur Bille an-thábhachtach é i saol an oideachais san tír seo.  Sa chéad áit is é aidhm an Bhille comhordú agus comheagar a chur ar oiliúint mhúinteoirí in ábhair speisialta i gcóras oideachais na tíre; agus san méid sin, is dóigh liom gur céim nua ar fad é bunú Choláiste Thuamhumhan leis an gcuspóir sin a thabhairt chun críche, is é sin, nach mbeadh aon deighilt nó aon scarúint idir aicme ar bith múinteoirí sa gcóras náisiúnta, go mbeadh na cáilíochta céanna acu go léir, go mbeidís ar fad, mar a deirim, ar chomhchéim agus ar chomh stádas san gcóras oideachais.  Measaim gur fearrde iad ina ngairm dá thoradh sin agus gur fearrde na micléinn nó na scoláirí a bheidh faoina gcúram agus a mbeidh siad freagrach astu feasta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá go leor leor tréithe nó míreanna éagsúla ins an mBille seo ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh go mion. Molaim an tAire as ucht an Bhille ilghnéitheach a chuir sé os ár gcomhair agus ar an gcaoi ar dhéileáil sé leis an gcuspóir a bhí roimhe nuair a bhí sé ag cur an Bhille seo in ár láthair.  Go mór mhór ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don alt dheireannach den ráiteas nuair a dúirt sé go mba mhian leis a bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na daoine a bhí freagarthach as cúrsaí oiliúna do mhúinteoirí a stiúriú thar na blianta faoi choinníollacha oibre nach raibh chomh sásúil is atá siad anois. Is é sin le rá, go mbeidh sé de chúram ar mhúinteoirí agus ar na coláistí ghairm oideachais sna blianta atá romhainn na cúrsaí a eagrú agus an comhoibriú céanna a fháil agus an traidisiún súntasach seo a leanúint.  Mar a dúirt an tAire, tá bonn maith curtha leis an gnó a fhágann ar chumas an choláiste glacadh leis an dúshlán.  Molaim an tAire as ucht ráiteas dá <Col N="342" /> leithéid a chur amach sa Teach seo anocht.</P>
    <P>I too welcome this Bill on behalf of this side of the House.  It is a very important Bill in so far as it rationalises the training of specialised teachers in the Department of Education and puts all categories of teachers on an equal footing, as it were. Therefore, it aims at conformity in the staffing and qualifications of the various categories of teachers and in the various aspects of education.  That is a very important factor and for that reason Coláiste Thuamhumhan will go down in history as a great step forward in the scientific and practical advancement of education in this country.  In that regard I sincerely thank the Minister and his Department, Heretofore, as he may well know, categories of teachers were trained under various circumstances.  Some were trained in the early years of the implementation of the Vocational Education Act as a result of short courses &mdash; one year's course which was extended later to a longer course.  Woodwork teachers, for instance, were trained in a centre which was designed or allocated by the Department of Education.  Teachers of domestic science were trained in other centres and so on.  Each category was trained in its own way.  It was not a uniform degree. They were not graduates of a national university or of a national institution.</P>
    <P>To that extent they had various qualifications and this tended to categorise them in the eyes of the public and also in the eyes of the pupils whom they had to teach.  This was a great drawback at that time.  That will now be remedied.  All trained student teachers will graduate with uniform qualifications which is a great step forward.  They will be respected as having the same standard of education and qualification for their vocation and they will be respected accordingly by the pupils for whom they will be responsible.  I am glad I have seen the day it has been put into effect.</P>
    <P>I am glad the teaching of Irish has been mentioned as a subject in Coláiste Thuamhumhan because there is an opinion, perhaps a false one, that Irish is not getting the attention it rightly deserves in the Thomond College of Physical Education. <Col N="343" />  That rumour has gone abroad, rightly or wrongly.  If that is even partially true, it would be a great mistake and a retrograde step, that the national language would not get its rightful place in an institution so important as the Thomond College of Physical Education. Because of its nature, physical education is a subject that brings its teacher and pupils into great personal contact.  The vocabulary, for instance, needed for giving the instructions necessary to deal with classes in physical education is often single words: seas, rith, tar, imigh.  Apart from that it brings the teacher and pupils into the recreation centre and into the various spheres of activity.  There is hardly any other subject which brings the teacher/pupil relationship into greater emphasis than physical education.  Therefore, physical education teachers have a great role to play.  There is also their connection with other recreational activities, organising games, outings, tours and concerts.  For these reasons, physical education teachers have a vital role to play.  The same can be said for the teachers of other practical subjects, such as home economics.  These teachers also have a great responsibility.  I am glad that there is mention of the teaching of Irish in the Minister's statement and that it is part of the curriculum.  I am doubly glad it is stated therein that student teachers will be obliged to go to the Gaeltacht once a year while in training.  This is ideal because, without going to the Gaeltacht and experiencing the life there and hearing the language being spoken habitually, those people could never acquire the language properly and could never understand or be motivated to the right degree to promote the language subsequently.</P>
    <P>The students who are privileged to go to these colleges and institutions are often very vocal in complaining about the institution which they enjoy.  This is a regrettable fact.  These students should be glad to be in these institutions because they are in a privileged position.  They are privileged to be sent there by the educational system of the State and they <Col N="344" /> should appreciate that and not be complaining or agitating and looking for better conditions the moment they get inside the doors of these institutions.  They would be much better employed if they turned their attention and energies to the acquisition of knowledge imparted to them, thereby ensuring they would be worthy of the vocation which they have chosen and for which they have been sent to these colleges by the Minister and by the system of education.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to mention.  The great difficulty with regard to these teachers at the moment is that they are not in sufficient supply.  Every vocational education committee in the country are finding it difficult to get, especially, metalwork teachers and physical education teachers.  That is the case in my own constituency, Roscommon.  A physical education teacher resigned recently and the committee were concerned because they felt they would not be able to fill that vacancy.  That is a pity.  I know it cannot be helped at the moment because the training facilities are not there to a sufficient degree, but that will be remedied now.  The same applies to metalwork teachers.  My own county, for instance, could find employment for two or three metalwork teachers at the moment.  Le cúnamh Dé, nuair a bheidh an coláiste seo faoi lántseol, agus nuair a bheidh sé ag obair i gceart faoi cheann a dó nó a trí de bhlianta, beidh an scéal sin leigheasta.  Beidh na múinteoirí le fáil. Beidh múinteoirí le fáil agus beidh riar maith agus comhordú ar an gcóras múinteoireachta in ár scoileanna.  Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo agus guím gach rath ar an obair a déanfar faoina chúram.</P>
