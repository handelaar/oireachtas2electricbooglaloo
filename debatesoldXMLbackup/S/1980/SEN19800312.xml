      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House about item No. 18 on the Order Paper, relating to Afghanistan and Iran.  About a month <Col N="1168" /> ago I raised this matter along with a number of other Senators, including Senator Hussey and Senator Murphy in whose names the motion is down.  This is quite a serious matter where many of us feel the Government should have a clear policy.  Time is not on our side in relation to this issue.  The Leader of the House accepted the necessity for an early debate on the matter and the question of the Olympics is coming up fairly soon.  I appreciate the fact that Senator Hussey may still be in the United States, but independent of that, this seems to be an issue we should be facing up to.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is his intention to arrange that that be taken.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to two of the changes in the <Col N="1169" /> structures and functions of Government announced by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann on 11 and 13 December 1979. The Taoiseach, in those statements, outlined an integrated package of changes most of which have already been effected by Government orders.  These particular changes which, as I say, have already been implemented, refer to changes in the titles and functions of Ministers and Departments of State.  The two remaining elements of the package, namely the proposals, on the one hand, to bring the Department of Labour and the Public Service together under one Minister and, on the other hand, to increase the number of Ministers of State to 15 require amendments to existing legislation and hence the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the proposal to bring the Departments of Labour and the Public Service together under one Minister.  The present position is that section 3 (3) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1973 provides that the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service shall be assigned to the same person. This provision must be repealed in order to permit the appointment of a member of the Government who is not also the Minister for Finance to be Minister for the Public Service.  Senators will be aware that, in present circumstances, the Taoiseach's intentions are that the member of the Government having charge of the Department of Labour should also have charge of the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a considered reaction to the emergence, since the setting up of the Department of the Public Service in 1973, of the successful management of industrial relations as one of the main requirements for national progress.  The needs of Government are never static and our structures must always be flexible enough to cope with changing circumstances. Certain needs existed in 1973 which determined the setting up of a separate Department of the Public Service. First, the Public Services Organisation Review Group had recommended <Col N="1170" /> the setting up of such a Department which would be assigned to the member of the Government who would also be the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it was felt that a separate Department was necessary in order to ensure that adequate attention was given to and adequate skills developed in the important areas of personnel management including industrial relations and organisation.  Prior to 1973 these matters had been dealt with in the Department of Finance where they were inevitably subordinated to wider economic considerations. It was possible to cater for these needs by setting up a separate Department which would be assigned to the same member of the Government as the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>However, in the light of developments in regard to industrial relations, we have found it necessary to look again at the structural arrangements in this area.  The Government have a twofold role on the industrial relations front.  The Minister for Labour is concerned with fostering a constructive climate in the industrial relations field and for providing all the legislative basis and much of the institutional framework for industrial relations matters.  The Minister for the Public Service is responsible for a co-ordinated approach to industrial relations in the public service.  The Government are the largest employer in the State since over a quarter of the work force and well over a third of those employed on the basis of a wage or salary are public servants.  Obviously then, movements in the public service exercise a major influence on the whole economy. In recent years, it has become more and more evident that trouble in the public service means trouble for the country.  At present, therefore, it would seem logical to co-ordinate the Government's two roles at ministerial level.  This will strengthen and deepen the existing cooperation between the two Departments concerned.  No one is going to pretend that this is the answer to all industrial relations problems.  It is, however, a visible move on the part of the Government to illustrate their determination to get to grips with such problems and to ensure <Col N="1171" /> that there is a fully co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>Before I move on to the other major aspect of the Bill, I want to make one thing very clear.  This change in ministerial responsibility does not, in any way, imply diminished commitment to the existing programmes of the two Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>This House has always had a healthy interest in the work of the Department of the Public Service in relation to the various programmes for the reorganisation of the public service in terms of structures and personnel policies.  The learned and enlightening contributions to the debate, in November 1978, on the fourth report of the Public Service Advisory Council are adequate testimony to this.  I want to assure the House that there will be no change in the priority to be accorded to these programmes and of my own determination to see that, under my aegis, an adequate rate of progress is maintained consistent with the development of more effective and efficient administrative machinery.  Neither will the change mean any diminution of the priority to be accorded to very important work of the Department of Labour in those areas not directly related to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I want to move on now to the second major provision of this Bill.  The present position is that section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1977 restricts the maximum number of Ministers of State to ten.  This Bill provides for an increase in that maximum to 15.</P>
    <P>It is only a little more than two years ago since this House debated in great depth the many issues arising from the creation of the office of Minister of State. There was general acceptance in the House of that measure.  Some reservations were expressed as to the adequacy of the number of offices being created and indeed one Senator with prophetic insight forecast that it would not be long before another increase became necessary.  Prior to the creation in 1977 of the office of Minister of State the business of the Government was allocated between 15 Ministers of <Col N="1172" /> Government who had the assistance of seven parliamentary secretaries.  This situation had existed for 40 years despite the ever-growing range and complexity of Government business.  When we introduced the 1977 Act we made two fundamental changes.  First, we abolished the office of Parliamentary Secretary and replaced it with a new office of Minister of State which would have greater responsibilities.  Secondly we increased the number of posts available to lend assistance to Ministers of the Government from seven Parliamentary Secretaries to ten Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>After two years, this issue can now be judged from experience.  The demands giving rise to the 1977 Act have certainly not diminished, indeed, they have grown.  We have had the continuing growth of responsibilities in relation to all aspects of EEC matters.  There has also been a continuing increase in the demands made on Ministers on the home front.  There has also been a dramatic increase in the demands being made on politicians generally and Ministers in particular, by the general public in terms of the service the public require.  We are now dealing with an electorate that is more articulate and better informed than ever before.  Such an electorate demands a more sophisticated level of service from its elected representatives.  The House will be aware of these developments. The results of the combination of these factors can be seen in the expansion of the roles, functions and activities of the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the question of the role and influence of the Oireachtas. It is difficult to answer criticisms that because of the increasing complexity of the business of Government the institutions of the State are not sufficiently answerable to Parliament.  Some measures have been taken to correct this.  We have an active Joint Committee of both Houses looking into the affairs of the commercial State-sponsored bodies; a Bill to establish the office of Ombudsman has been introduced.  We see the present measure as a further step which will bring the number of people <Col N="1173" /> answerable to the Oireachtas for the management of Government business to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, as Senators know, a constitutional limit of 15 on the number of Ministers of the Government.  We must look elsewhere for ways to meet the needs I have been talking about.  In the case of some Departments of State, it will mean the assignment to them of more than one Minister of State because of the scope and complexity of the business they discharge.  The process of Government is becoming an increasingly sophisticated one.  We can no longer hope to respond in a piecemeal manner to the challenge being posed.  Neither can we expect to share out ever-increasing burdens among a constant number of hard-pressed individuals without affecting the level of service being delivered.  Our experience in the last two years or so has convinced us of the necessity of having the number of Ministers of State increased to 15.</P>
    <P>This measure, together with the rationalisation of functions at ministerial and departmental levels already announced by the Taoiseach, will mean that we are moving into the new decade with a full strength team equipped to meet the challenge ahead.  It has been said that, if we had brought forward this measure before our Presidency of the EEC, it would have received more widespread support but at least our experience now stands to us in that we can be absolutely confident of the need for the measure.</P>
    <P>The opportunity afforded by this amending legislation required to provide for increasing the maximum number of Ministers of State and for having a person other than the Minister for Finance appointed as Minister for the Public Service is being availed of to make certain other technical amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  First, the 1977 Act makes no provision for the termination of the appointment of a Minister of State on his becoming a member of the Government nor for his resignation for any other reason.  I am proposing that such provision now be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> Second, section 7(4) of the 1939 Act provided, in the case of the office of Parliamentary Secretary, that his appointment or tenure of office would not be affected where another member of the Government was nominated to act for the Minister having charge of the Department where he was assigned.  I propose here to make a similar provision for the office of Minister of State. Finally, as regards technicalities, section 2(1)(6) of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, still contains a reference to the obsolete office of Parliamentary Secretary. I am proposing that the office of Minister of State be substituted in the relevant section for the office of Parliamentary Secretary.  These are minor technical amendments and I do not wish to dwell on them at this stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that I have every confidence that the measures set out in this Bill, when taken in conjunction with the other elements of the package announced by the Taoiseach last December, will make a major contribution to providing this country with more effective and more efficient Government machinery.  The electorate have the right to demand and expect the best from the machinery of Government.  We are committed to seeing that they get it and I will be continuing to strive for this in my capacity as Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle we do not object to this Bill but for political reasons we suspect the motives behind its introduction.  One could say there is a need for an increased number of Ministers to deal with the increased volume of public business, but one might ask why is it necessary at this time for the Minister to introduce this Bill when, for example, we are just past the six months during which this Government held the Presidency of the EEC. Reverting to the previous Taoiseach's speech of two years ago about the formation of Government and about the need for a reform of the public service on the run up to the six months Irish Presidency, which was to stretch Government to the limit, if these appointments <Col N="1175" /> had been considered necessary then in the interests of the public service and of this country they should have been created about a year ago so that the appointees could have carried out their duties from 1 June last to the end of December.  For that reason we have to question why this Bill is being brought before us at this time.  The Minister presented extremely poor arguments in the Seanad today and in the Dáil last week to support the reasons why it was necessary that we pass this Bill and allow the Government to create five more posts as Ministers of State. The appallingly bad arguments made are particularly illustrated in one section&mdash;when the Minister speaks of the role and influence of the Oireachtas and why, in his words, we need to appoint five new Ministers of State.  It is the Minister's arguments that we are paying attention to here.  One of the reasons we want to appoint the five Ministers of State is so that the Oireachtas should be better served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find this infantile stuff completely unacceptable and patently insincere.  If we are concerned about the Oireachtas and about the workings of the Oireachtas&mdash;the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash;we should be facing up to issues other than the question of Ministers of State.  It is a contradiction in terms to suggest that the appointment of Ministers of State, in any effective sense, affects the Oireachtas because there are two arms of public service.  We have the Executive of Government and the Oireachtas.  The problems of Parliament are in no sense served by the appointment of Ministers of State.  There is a danger that the term Minister of State rather than Parliamentary Secretary may put a gloss on an office that is not all that very significant.  In public relations and propaganda terms that might suggest that when a Minister of State is answering questions or attending to business that these matters are being attended to by people in government at the highest level, while in fact they continue to be done by people at the second level in the Executive, because they are not <Col N="1176" /> obviously Ministers in an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The title &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; can be abused in the sense that ultimate responsibility in any Government Department is held by the Minister, not by the Minister of State.  If Ministers wish to opt out of contentious business, or to have an easier life in certain respects they now have the perfect formula: they may send the Minister of State to meet the delegation, to handle the business or make the speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave reasons why this Bill is in the interests of the Oireachtas. It is patently obvious that the Oireachtas is in terribly bad shape.  Attempting to look objectively at parliaments in the free world one would probably find that the Oireachtas is among the poorest served. In Dáil Éireann, for example, I know of cases where eight Deputies are expected to share a single private secretary for typing facilities.  We are talking now about the running of a country. At fifth or sixth levels in semi-State companies, executives have private secretaries and separate offices.  If there is to be any sincerity about attempting to make the Oireachtas strong, in line with Deputy Lynch's speech two-and-a-half years ago, the problems of the Oireachtas must be tackled and we should not have the window-dressing and the padding that is going on in this Bill and the pseudo naming with the Minister of State game.  This is a conviction I hold very strongly.  I am probably correct in addressing myself to it since the Minister was allowed to mention this particular topic.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the corrective action being taken by the Government so far as the Oireachtas is concerned.  He mentioned the active Joint Committee of both Houses for semi-State bodies and a Bill to establish an Ombudsman and committee work.  Committee work is taxing in the extreme the capacity of Deputies or Senators to perform on these committees, unless they run the risk of losing their seats should they have them, for example if they are Members of Dáil Éireann.  Short of providing proper secretarial support and decent office <Col N="1177" /> facilities for members of the Oireachtas nothing will happen.  It is an insult to come into either House and suggest that it is out of consideration for the Oireachtas that these Ministers of State are being appointed.  The sophisticated needs of today's electorate demand that if Deputies are to be reelected and to give a reasonable performance to their constituencies, they must also be able to take time off for national issues, independent of local work.  This needs funding and a secretariat.</P>
    <P>The appointment of these Ministers of State in no sense, in my judgment, provides a service to the electorate but it might serve a purpose for the political party in power by having more Ministers of State on the high roads to the country driving their Mercedes, the political status symbol, to attend fetes, dinners and football matches and so on.  There have been recent changes in personnel by the Taoiseach and very able people were demoted and replaced by, in some cases, people who are much less worthy in terms of political competence.  The obvious pay-off is these extra five appointments. We must suspect this more because it did not happen a year ago but is happening at this critical time.</P>
    <P>We were told today, after a recent Parliamentary Question, that the cost of a car and driver is approximately £33,000 and the support in terms of office and other expenditure is estimated to cost another £42,000 which makes a total of about £75,000.</P>
    <P>I am not against the essential principle of more people in the Executive, especially if the people appointed are worthy and are going to do a good job, but in a balanced sense, if the Government are looking at the needs of the public service, at the needs of the Oireachtas and at the unhealthy state of democracy, any proposal of this nature brought in by the Government should be balanced by due regard for democracy and, within the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the support I mentioned which should be extended so that individual Deputies and Senators are <Col N="1178" /> assisted.  It is only in this way that Deputies and Senators will have time to question, to probe, to make speeches, to study, and so on.  This would assist democracy in this country a damn sight better than the present measure which is being introduced for obvious political reasons by the Minister.  The total cost of this exercise will be about £500,000 and if it is a question of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo;, I would prefer to see this money being spent to assist Senators and Deputies.  This Bill should be supported by back-up services for basic democracy in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your point very fully, with respect, having read the Minister's speech in the Dáil and in the Seanad, where he addressed himself directly to these issues, I was merely responding to the overtures made by him.  In principle we do not take exception to this Bill but for many reasons that are patently obvious, we suspect the motives behind it and make a plea for the Minister to follow this up with respect for democracy by introducing all the facilities which are so urgently needed if we are to fulfil his expressed concern for the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The first objective of this Bill is to bring the Department of Labour and the Department of the Public Service under one Minister.  I strongly support the case for coordinating industrial relations in both the public and private sectors at ministerial level.  Public sector employment, as the Minister pointed out, accounts for over a quarter of the total work force in the country and, indeed, some of the more serious disputes that have occurred in recent years have been in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Movements in pay and conditions in the public sector have implications for the economy as a whole.  I therefore welcome this organisational change as a positive step in the direction of co-ordinating the approach to industrial relations <Col N="1179" /> at Government level by placing responsibility for the public service on the member of the Cabinet who is also Minister for Labour.  It further underlines the vital importance of good industrial relations for our economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments in relation to the Department of the Public Service.  The daily strain placed on Ministers, to which I shall be referring in a few moments in connection with the increase in the number of Ministers of State, raises the question of relieving Ministers of routine matters and thus delegating to civil servants.  If economic development is to be effective, the pace of public service reform must be intensified. I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and his Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will continue with the explicit political initiatives already taken by the Fianna Fáil Government for reform and change.  I would like to express the hope that the necessary response will be forthcoming from civil servants, not least by accepting the need for mobility within the service so that the knowledge and skills within the service can be most appropriately utilised.</P>
    <P>The second major objective of this Bill is to increase the number of Ministers of State from ten to a maximum of 15. With the ever-increasing scope and complexity of Government business and the level of service expected in modern conditions, an almost intolerable burden is placed on Ministers, thereby causing a health hazard as well as other undesirable consequences.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering for a moment the pressures that are placed on Cabinet Ministers in 1980.  Several members of the Cabinet have to conduct and attend to business at three levels.  There is the primary consideration of constituency work where the volume continues to increase and a Minister is expected not only to attend to the individual and group needs of his constituents but also to attend a host of functions and other public engagements.  Any Government Minister who foregoes these constituency <Col N="1180" /> obligations does so at his peril and the pressure on him is compounded by the multi-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a Government Minister who is fulfilling the duties expected of him must give considerable time, thought and energy to his Department and the associated range of duties, including the key aspect of new legislation.  Furthermore, as a member of the Government he has collective responsibility for Government policy generally.  Thirdly, our membership of the European Community demands ministerial representation and presence.  This international dimension of a Minister's work has added greatly to the work of several individual Ministers in particular and has placed new and heavy burdens on Government machinery generally.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, an overwhelming case for posts of Ministers of State. When the number was increased in 1977 to ten, several Opposition Senators in this House said at that time that ten was not enough.  The Government have now had an opportunity over the past two years to assess whether ten is adequate. Clearly the workload in some Government Departments is greater than in others and therefore it has proved necessary to assign more than one Minister of State to a particular Government Department.  The Department of Agriculture is a case in point.  I do not think that anybody could seriously argue that the appointment of 15 Ministers of State is unreasonable; indeed I would argue that it is a realistic level in the complex, demanding environment in which Government operates as we enter the eighties.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were simply a matter of the eminently reasonable and perceptive case made by Senator Hillery just now, it would be churlish for anyone to offer criticism of this Bill.  I have personal experience of the things he spoke of most recently and I could not disagree with his characterisation of the workload on Ministers and, indeed, of the perils of neglecting aspects of that workload but I say with regret that it is not quite so simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> There are two matters in this Bill, one being the proposed increase in the number of Ministers of State and the other the matter of amalgamation of the Departments of Labour and the Public Service.  Let me take them in reverse order to the Minister's presentation in his speech and talk first about the number of Ministers of State.  I do not want to add anything to what Senator Hillery has just said about the need for extra people, but those arguments seem to me totally vitiated by what we have seen happening in the recent past with the reshuffle of Government.  Let me except the person currently sitting in the Minister's chair. Deputy Calleary, from what I have to say next.</P>
    <P>I have been appalled and shocked, and I know members of the Government party have had the same experience, when looking at the quality as human beings of at least three of the Ministers of State who have been appointed.  I will not name them now; I am able to say a rude thing when it is necessary and I do not think it is necessary now, but anyone who observes the political process in Ireland will be able to name those three persons.  Can one say that they were put there to help their Ministers to perform better or to take a workload off them, or because of their talents to make their contribution to relations between Oireachtas and Government, or to the quality of Government in Ireland?  They were not.  They were put there as a pay off not for talent but for reliability.  If we are going to have five more, what will our expectations be in regard to the sort of person chosen?  The tragedy is that if one does things that on the face of it seem to be necessary for the sake of the better functioning of our State and better democracy and then misuses those powers in the way we have very recently seen with the passing over, as Senator Staunton said, of people who did command the respect of all of the Oireachtas and of all sides of the Houses, one must ask what all this is for and what are the motives.  I want to see the burden on Ministers lowered so that they can do their real job more effectively, but on the <Col N="1182" /> evidence of the past few months I must question the intention.</P>
    <P>I have to give notice that I will scrutinise the use made of this measure when it becomes law and the five appointments are made.  I will scrutinise, as will the whole country, the appointees, and will ask the question&mdash;as in the light of the recent past we must why these persons and not other persons?  I hope we will be able to give the answer that they were the best persons available, but I am afraid we will not be able to give that answer.  I would be happy to be proved wrong in that surmise.</P>
    <P>Let me make some small comment on an observation of the Minister in his opening speech when he talked about relations with the Oireachtas and the service to the Oireachtas.  I do not propose to cover again the ground that Senator Staunton covered, but let me simply put it on the record that if we expect the Oireachtas to function efficiently, and if we want it as a source of real input into the public life of this country, not simply as a bit of window-dressing and genuflection towards democracy, then we will have to stop the contemptuous way in which we currently service Members of the Oireachtas.  In regard to myself, I do not have an office, or a telephone or a cupboard, and I do not have any servicing whatsoever.  I am not putting the burden on any individual. That is the failure of public decision to service the Oireachtas properly.  We can go through the whole of the Oireachtas and find that we are rottenly serviced as representatives of the people, from end to end.  We set that existing situation of long continuation and the approximate cost of rectifying it against the approximate cost of these number of extra posts and then we look at what the extra posts are being used for, and we have to have it out about priorities.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the other trend, which is in regard to the matter of the Departments of Labour and the Public Service.  We have seen the situation where one might say traditionally the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Finance had the same Minister.  In fairness one might <Col N="1183" /> caricature it or at least get to the situation of saying the Department of the Public Service had been carved out of the Department of Finance.  I can see the argument for doing that.  I can see also the argument for a drawing closer of the Department of Labour and the Department of the Public Service.  I can certainly see an argument for legislation to permit that drawing closer, but I will pick up a theme that I have touched on many times in the Oireachtas, both in this and in the other House when we were discussing the matters of the structures of Government.</P>
    <P>It is very striking in Ireland first that we have bad labour relations.  We have had recent confirmation of this in Community figures and they must give pause to everybody of every political point of view, but it is even more striking that labour relations are worse in the public than in the private sector, and in the private sector the spectrum is very great. There are firms with absolutely impeccable labour relations records which would bear comparison with any in the world and there are those which are dreadful.  I only make that aside, which I will not pursue, to make the point that to a great extent in our political and social environment the quality of labour relations is a function of management: good management, good labour relations; bad management, bad labour relations.</P>
    <P>I have made the observation which I think is incontrovertible that in the public sector we have bad labour relations. If one draws the conclusion from those two recent observations it seems inescapable that the fault is the quality of management in the public sector.  That is a desperately serious problem for the whole community because so many of the things done in the public sector impinge on all of us.  I need not pursue that; everyone will know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The question I ask is whether a piecemeal reform of this kind is sufficient. I ask it to answer it in the way I have answered it many times in my decade in the Oireachtas and say in my view it will not be sufficient.  Putting it <Col N="1184" /> very briefly, we have inherited a British structure of public service.  The British have reformed it a bit and we have reformed it a bit less, but it is not appropriate for us.  I believe that the efforts at democratisation in the public service and some of the semi-State bodies introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Leary, have to be pushed onwards and extended.  Reform of the Civil Service Departments themselves in a much more fundamental way is necessary, because what I can only call paternalism and an authoritarian approach to the work force, if it ever worked, certainly did not work in the last or the present decade.</P>
    <P>What depresses me about the two parts of this Bill is that the things that need to be done in the interests of reform and continuous improvement of the State are being done for reasons that are less honourable and that are more party political.  I said my piece on the Ministers of State in that regard but I cannot help remembering the trumpetings that accompanied a piece of &ldquo;reform&rdquo; of ministerial responsibilities when in 1977 a Department of Economic Planning and Development under Minister Martin O'Donoghue was established.  It did not seem to me to be the right thing to do then, but I saw a political reason for it. Now it has been summarily disestablished at a time when certain inputs from that person and that Department might have been useful in the management of our economy.  Again, the disestablishment in my view was party political in exactly the same way as the establishment was, and neither of them was for good reasons.</P>
    <P>The liaison between the Department of Labour and the Department of the Public Service is a little step which may be useful, and I certainly do not propose to divide the House on it or oppose it. However, it is my experience in the public service, in universities and in the private sector also that if people want a good liaison they can establish it as human beings quite easily, and that formal mechanisms do not necessarily improve liaison at all.  If there were a real requirement for better liaison between <Col N="1185" /> the Departments of the Public Service and Labour it could have been achieved on a telephone.  We have all seen cases, both in private industry and in Government Departments, and in my own experience in universities, where an amalgamation leads to bitter rearguard action that is fought for five or ten years and vitiates the intended good effect.  I am not sure this is going to do any good. I will not oppose it, but I offer the conviction that it is too small and too limited a step in dealing with entrenched attitudes in both Departments.  It is those entrenched attitudes, very loosely and broadly characterised as authoritarian and paternalistic, which are the prime cause of our bad labour relations in the public sector.  I look on those bad labour relations in the public sector as among the most pressing problems which the State currently faces.</P>
    <P>With those doubts, hesitations and questionings of motive, this is the warmest welcome I can give the Bill.  It will probably do a little more good than it does harm.</P>
    <P>To tie together my observations on the two sections of this Bill, the doubt and the sadness I have in regard to both is that things which may or may not be necessary for the better functioning of the State&mdash;and their success or failure will really be dependent on the way in which they are implemented&mdash;are not simply being politicised but are being party politicised.  On the evidence of the actions of the last few months, I and many other people will await the implementation with more doubt than confidence as to the ultimate result.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I welcome this extra attempt to organise a better service for our democratic process and our way of governing through the democratic process.  I would say as an aside that I am not personally very happy about the way the democratic process and government through the democratic process operate at the moment, but I am realistic enough to recognise that things like that will not change overnight.  I would hope that they would be moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a modified form of the Westminster model.  Thank God we have not got some of the aspects of that model which are probably the root of some of the problems in the UK. I am thinking, for instance, of the monarchy.  We have a system which operates from our Constitution and down through the various executive systems of State.  The present system involves an Oireachtas which is fairly cut off from the real decision-making process unless it works through the party system and in the future it will need modification.  The joint committee system which has already been mentioned is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the situation where the members of the Oireachtas over a couple of generations have increased in sophistication, training and education.  Therefore, they can be harnessed to help in the running of the State in a different way from that set up in the beginning.  I am not in any way taking from the sophistication of Members of the Oireachtas earlier in this century but I am saying that there is a difference.  At the same time there is a difference in the electorate.  They are more highly educated, their demands may be put more articulately and the power systems available to them are used more effectively. One would, therefore, expect changes to take place.  While I would be disappointed at the way changes in the public service have taken place I would put it down to faltering incrementalism. At the same time I recognise that some improvements have taken place and that is why I would support this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> The addition of five more Ministers of State is the kind of step which can in itself induce change in an indirect way in the public service, which is where the management process mentioned by Senator Keating takes place.  By appointing five new Ministers of State there are five individuals operating between the Cabinet Ministers and the public service as full-time administrators and one would expect that those Ministers of State by their very presence there, the questions that they ask, their own particular pet hobby horses that they will follow, will induce the change that is required.  Therefore, I see it as a very important step.</P>
    <P>I would not make any apologies whatsoever for the fact that these individuals are politicians and are not appointed the way the top people in Government would be appointed in other countries, such as the United States.  They do come from the democratic process and are subject to the continual observation of the electorate.  If at any date they get the notion that they are gods almighty in their own areas, the people have their own way of dealing with that.  The appointment of elected people is the essence of the democratic process and we should not be in any way worried about it.</P>
    <P>Neither do I think we should be worried about the fact that there will be changes in the people who occupy these positions.  As political parties become more sophisticated, in the sense that the individuals who are elected have wider experiences, different kinds of training and so on, one would expect that there would be changes, that different individuals would be appointed to different positions.  We cannot expect that forever we would have situations where there would be only ten, 15 or 20 people capable of being Ministers in a party. Surely as time goes on we would reach the position where 100 per cent would be capable of doing this and therefore one would expect to see changes in appointments, depending on the essence of the democratic process.  That is what we are seeing at the moment.</P>
    <P>It was less than understanding of <Col N="1188" /> Senator Keating to pick on the quality of the individuals who have recently been appointed.  I am sorry he has left the House.  As I said in putting forward the principle, I would expect to see changes and maybe that would be healthy in a democratic process.  I would go further and say that in relation to the first ten Ministers of State who were appointed we were enabled as Members of the Oireachtas to see them here in the House taking Bills through and see them visibly growing in their ability and in their confidence in dealing with tricky aspects of legislation.</P>
    <P>They are just examples that occurred to me to drive that point home.  The Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, dealt with tricky legislation concerning consumers and has now been promoted to a Cabinet position.  That is a very healthy process.  Likewise, there have been tricky aspects of the Landlord and Tenant Bill handled by Ministers of State and so on.  One would expect to see Ministers of State improve their positions. I have also noticed, listening to Members of the Oireachtas operating through the party system or in Joint Committees, that very often the person without great talents may be the individual who asks the right questions and has that critical judgment which sees what is at issue and suggests a creative solution.  I am quite confident that the Ministers we have at the moment will show more of this and will improve as they move into their jobs.</P>
    <P>We all know about the famous Coalition Cabinet of all the talents which had its own difficulties.  It is not always the person who articulates the particular lines of policy who is the best at getting the results.  I would say, judge by the results.</P>
    <P>They are the points which I wished to make in relation to the appointment of five new people, the principle of the appointment. That is the reason that I see the five new appointments as a significant step in the evolution of the democratic governing process.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other aspect of the Bill, the Department of Labour undertaking responsibities for the Department <Col N="1189" /> of the Public Service, Senator Hillery has outlined the logic in that.  I will not add to the discussion on principle.  I would like to take the opportunity, since the Minister mentioned the problems of industrial relations, to reiterate the need for the improvement of the management of industrial relations in the public service and the need for the people who operate in the protected system of the public service to recognise the privileged position they are in and to appreciate that that is of value in itself.  That protection and security are not always available to those who work in the exposed sector of the manufacturing industries particularly.</P>
    <P>Recently there have been statements from the Minister about absenteeism.  It was only yesterday, in the Irish Management Institute that I came across a particular instance where, between 1970 and 1979, absenteeism in a particular division of a major company in this country went from a 5 per cent average to 30 per cent.  There were 30 per cent of the people missing for various reasons.  I am sure that many Senators have heard, within the public service, people referring to their entitlement to sick leave.  These practices, which take place within the protected area of the public sector must not be passed on in the way I have described.  The company I referred to is a manufacturing company in the exposed sector.</P>
    <P>It is a very logical step that the Minister for Labour should have the ultimate responsibility for determining policies in relation to industrial relations that will be operated either directly or indirectly through legislation to the public sector as well as the private sector.</P>
    <P>As a third point I would like to respond to a point made by Senator Staunton when he referred to the role of these Ministers and whether or not they were needed in relation to the responsibilities of Cabinet Ministers; that it would give them an excuse for not dealing with certain situations and so on.  This is one of the problems we have in management in the whole of our society.  I would hate to <Col N="1190" /> see this principle of delegation not being recognised here in the Seanad.  It is impossible for a Cabinet Minister to deal with all the questions that are referred to him, all the issues, to answer telephone calls from people who want to contact him.  He has to allocate his time to priorities.  The good man or woman will be the person who decides what those priorities are.  The appointment of these people is the natural recognition of the need for delegation.  I would hate to see a number of tired, broken Ministers trying to deal with every situation that is presented to them when the delegation process offers the obvious solution, that is, they have somebody who is democratically elected to share the burden. Because of those arguments I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am able to take a slightly different view of this situation as an Independent Member.  It is obvious that politics enters into decisions of this type whatever the protests on the Government's side may be.  On the other hand, one gets somebody from the Opposition, like Senator Staunton, protesting about decisions such as this, but it is unlikely that when his party come back into Government they will rescind a decision like this.  It is more likely that they will welcome it with open arms and do exactly as the Government are going to do, distribute posts of this nature evenly around the country to keep their supporters happy, and to balance the political budget.  Everybody recognises this.  That is not to say the decision itself is wrong. It may well be right.  My feeling is that it is neither wrong nor right but that it is inevitable.  I doubt if it gets near to solving the problems that we face.  It seems to me that the average Member of either the Dáil or the Seanad can only give an outside view of the problems because he only sees a Minister at interviews and operating in public, but he does not face the pressure that a Minister faces in modern political life.  The interesting views on this question, as was the case in the debate on the Report of the Public Service Advisory Council, come either from people who have been Ministers, <Col N="1191" /> who have had the experience, who have experienced the pressure, or from people who have been on the other side, senior civil servants who have worked in top positions in Government Departments and who see the situation on the inside but who get a different view.</P>
      <P>As an independent observer, I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for Government Ministers.  It is often my job to meet them, to interview them.  They rarely refuse an interview, if they can fit it in at all, with a Member of the Oireachtas and the interview often comes late in the afternoon.  They have had numerous delegations, they have had meetings of their own, and internal committees in their Departments.  The wear and tear on the Minister's face at that time of day is very obvious.  The pressure that a Minister is under in modern life is tremendous.  I doubt very much if this will do a great deal to lessen that pressure.  It may, on the surface, appear to help the Cabinet Minister but I doubt if it really will.  It also could cause him some problems.</P>
      <P>I see the situation with a somewhat jaundiced eye.  Given our situation, given the tremendous demands on the Minister, which have been outlined, quite apart from his constituency work, his departmental work in dealing with routine departmental problems, and what is more obvious perhaps to the public, his work in initiating policy and legislation, then add to that his EEC work, and it requires something of a superman to be a good Minister.  One can divide Cabinet members into two categories; the first one, a very small one, the &ldquo;good&rdquo; Ministers one meets and the second one, let us just call them Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The good Ministers I have come across in my nine years in this House are very few and far between.  It is because one needs superhuman qualities to be a good Minister.  Any Member of the Oireachtas can be a Minister if he just relies on his civil servants.  We see so often a Minister coming into this House and just repeating what the civil servants tell him and the difference when one <Col N="1192" /> comes across a good Minister is that he physically tries to push his own policy line into the channels that run in his Department, and to get that through his own departmental committees.  Quite apart from facing the Cabinet and then facing the Oireachtas and the public, that is a considerable job.  Very few Members of the Oireachtas really are capable of this.  One really effective Minister makes his presence felt and he may not sometimes have much impact upon the public but it is very clear to us, as Members of the Oireachtas.  I wonder if this Bill will really help the situation.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder what I would do if I was in charge of a Department of State.  It is not constitutionally impossible because Members of the Seanad can be and, in fact, have been appointed Ministers of State.  It is somewhat unlikely that an Independent Member would become a member of a Cabinet.  I feel, if I were a Minister and suddenly out of the blue&mdash;supposing I was representing my home constituency of Cork North East, and put in charge of a big Department&mdash;down on top of me were sent from Heaven two Ministers of State&mdash;they would not be from the Cork area, but from Donegal or County Louth&mdash;I would do my best, if I thought that I was in any way in control of the situation to keep them out of the centre of activity, keep them as far away from the scene of the action as I possibly could.  I would give them all the dirty jobs; I would make them sweep the yard. At least in my Department the civil servants working for me would be nominally under my control but the people who would not be under my control would be the Ministers of State, hopping around trying to get publicity, trying to get in on the act, trying to push me around.  I would try to send them off to Europe or send them to Sarawak on interparliamentary jaunts and hope their plane would land in the jungle and that they would take a long time getting back.</P>
    <P>One of the more formidable of the Ministers in recent times, the present Taoiseach, although he ran two Departments, did not have a Minister of State <Col N="1193" /> to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; him during his tenure in those two Departments.  This is the inevitable political reaction&mdash;it might as well come from the Coalition Government as from this Government&mdash;to the problem of pressure, on the one hand, on the Ministers and, on the other hand, the need to spread the jobs around.  It may be something that we cannot resist but I wonder how it will solve any of the problems.  We should be trying to strengthen the Minister's position inside his Department and give flexibility rather than appointing Ministers of State in his Department.  I would like to see some sort of Ministerial Cabinet, not the Aireacht concept that we had before, but a Ministerial Cabinet set up inside the Department in which the Minister would be able to nominate a very small number of people who would be fulltimers, not necessarily political people at all.  They certainly would not have to be elected but they would be people who might come from the commercial world, people who had experience in the sort of administration that one has to have to become skilled in when one is running a Department.  In a sense, that would act as a buffer between the Minister and his civil servants.  When a Minister comes into a new Department he may know something about it if he is an old hand, an experienced politician, but we have had examples of Dáil Members becoming Ministers on their first day in the Dáil and they could not have known much about their portfolios when those portfolios landed on their desks.</P>
    <P>Let us take the position of someone who is a bit more experienced.  Because of the political system he has no idea until a day or two before his appointment of what Department he will be put in charge of and, when the jockeying has been accomplished, he has then to try to formulate some sort of policy and make an input into his Department.  That is asking a tremendous amount from most people.  If I was in this position I would try to pull in a few small groups from outside politics altogether to act as a buffer between the civil servants and myself, not to set up a permanent tension between us but to try to assist me in formulating <Col N="1194" /> policy and to push it through the departmental channels.  It would then be up to me to get it through the Cabinet and the various other areas.</P>
    <P>It is important that there should be commercial and industrial inputs into our political life.  I would choose people from that area because in my experience the people who make the most success of these extremely difficult tasks are generally not people from the academic or legal worlds but people who have had experience in the world of business.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, therefore, to note that there is more emphasis on people coming from commerce and business in our top administrative structures.  I would like to see this being extended.  I would like to see this going further so that more people from this sector would offer themselves as members of political parties to contest elections.</P>
    <P>This type of expertise is nearer the type of expertise that one really needs to be a successful Cabinet Minister than the sort of expertise required in the lecture room or in the Law Library&mdash;not that people from both of these professions cannot play an important part in our political life as indeed they have done, but I do not really see the appointment of extra Ministers of State as having a really beneficial effect.  It may make a marginal improvement.  Neither can I see that anything that the Minister said in his opening remarks really makes the point that we could not do without these extra posts.  It may, sadly, be the parliamentary response to the problem, but I doubt if it is the way of getting down to solving it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former public servant I would like to say a few words to confirm, and in some respects to qualify, comments made by previous speakers.  I am prepared to accept in principle the desirability of provision being made for extra appointments as Minister of State provided responsible and competent persons are appointed to these offices and that a well-defined and reasonable range of responsibilities is assigned to each such Minister of State.  Otherwise you <Col N="1195" /> can have the situation that Senator West in his Walter Mitty moments a while ago was describing, when he visualised himself as a tough go-getting Minister who wanted to relegate any assistant Ministers to the wilds.</P>
      <P>The cost, which is substantial, of having these extra posts would, I think, be justified if the criteria I have just mentioned were fulfilled and if what the Minister expects is fulfilled, namely, that these new appointments do add to the flexibility and effectiveness of administration and subtract from the enormous burdens which have to be borne nowadays by members of the Government. The cost was mentioned also by way of contrast with the paucity of finance for basic services of the Oireachtas itself.  That is a good debating way of making a point.  It is not that one should be substituted for the other but that more money should be provided to improve the service available to Members of the Oireachtas.  There is undoubtedly some service, however exiguous, available to members of political parties, but those Members of the Seanad who are not members of political parties do not, as far as I am aware, enjoy any facilities at all of the kind I have in mind, for example, access to typing services.</P>
      <P>About a year ago I heard with interest some jealous references here to the research facilities available to Members of the Oireachtas.  Indeed, the proposition was that they should be expressly denied to members of the European Parliament.  But when I inquired I did not discover that these services were of a very extensive character.  I know the staff of the House provide a service which is beyond criticism but only a limited staff is available for that purpose. I do not think in comparison either with Government or the public service in general that the basic services available to Members of the Oireachtas are at all adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the possible improvement of the effectiveness of the Oireachtas through extension of committee procedures.  In my experience <Col N="1196" /> the committee procedure&mdash;I am not a member of any such committee&mdash;has worked very well for the Members of this house in relation to EEC affairs and I particularly like the procedure under which there can be a call for a debate in this House where the committee regard the matter they have examined as being of such importance to have such debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other committee mentioned by the Minister, the Joint Committee which examines the workings of State-sponsored bodies there is, as far as I am aware, no automatic provision for the discussion of the reports of that body in either House.  They have produced reports on some companies at least which many Members of both Houses would wish to have debated, particularly the report on Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>On another aspect of this Bill, I understand from the Minister's opening speech that the reason there is an express provision enabling the linking of the Department of Labour and the Department of the Public Service is because there was an express prescription in the 1973 Act that the Department of the Public Service should be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I assume he can confirm that the absence of any other provision in this Bill does not prevent new re-alignments of Ministerial responsibility taking place.  A number were announced by the Taoiseach within the last few months. There is another which has not been announced but to which I referred favourably on the occasion of the debate on the roads programme recently.  I was suggesting that it would make good sense, and give greater coherence to policy, if responsibility at ministerial level for our roads system were entrusted to a Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister confirm that there will be no easing of his own intention to promote progress with reforms in the public service.  In the debate to which he referred here in November 1978 many of us criticised the almost complete <Col N="1197" /> lack of progress in some important areas such as mobility within the public service.  There is scarcely any mobility between Departments, not to mention between departments and public bodies and between the public sector as a whole and the private sector.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, it might be easier to arrange some exchanges at managerial level between the public sector and the private sector than it is to effect even temporary transfers within the public service itself.  I am sure it would be extremely beneficial not to one party alone but to both.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate to the need for management of the public service to be improved.  My own opinion is that one particular Devlin recommendation has been allowed to steal all the limelight and obscure another which is of even greater importance. The one that has got the limelight is the idea of the Aireacht&mdash;of there being a special high-level policy group within each department in close contact with the Minister.  Far more important, it seems to me, is the second recommendation which is linked with that, that execution and policy should be separated and that execution should be in the hands of named and identifiable public servants who would be responsible for the efficiency of the discharge of that particular function.  We never hear of that recommendation at all, although I think a personal responsibility before the public for the discharge of what are Executive functions would make a great contribution to improved management of the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this Bill I would certainly want to be convinced and I am not convinced by the Minister's statement that the amount of taxpayers' money involved in the creation of five new Ministers of State, practicially half a million pounds, is going to result in benefits for the taxpayers.  Here we are discussing a Bill to appoint five additional Ministers and we have no information as to which Departments these Ministers of State are to be assigned to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand the pressures on <Col N="1198" /> Ministers but I cannot understand why it is necessary that these additional appointments be made.  Just to name a particular case, in one Department alone, namely the Department of Agriculture, we now have a Minister and two Ministers of State.  I cannot remember which other Departments got additional Ministers of State.  But I am at a loss to know where the five extra Ministers are going to be put.  I am appalled to think that, at a time when we have been told to tighten our belts, when the taxpayers here have been saddled with additional burdens in taxation in the last few weeks, when there have been cutbacks in various Departments and money is not available for certain works and certain projects, the Minister brings before us a Bill, the intention of which is to enable him to appoint an additional five Ministers of State at tremendous cost.  I am not convinced of the necessity for it and I suspect that the Ministers so appointed are being appointed for reasons of political patronage.  I hope I am wrong about that.</P>
    <P>I would not quibble with the Minister about the cost if I could be convinced that the public in general would get a better service as a result of these appointments. In the Department of Agriculture at the moment we have a Minister and two Ministers of State.  Is money available and are grants to the agricultural sector being paid out any more freely because we have additional Ministers there?  If one of the new Ministers is assigned to the Department of Health and Social Welfare, will that result in a speeding up of payments of social welfare benefits?  Will there be an improvement in regard to hospitalisation? What benefits will be derived from the five nameless people who will be appointed, possibly within the next few days?</P>
    <P>I want to place my criticism on record.  I am firmly convinced, that, at a time when we find ourselves in the financial straits that this country is in at the moment, it is absurd that a Bill of this kind should be brought before the House, putting this additional burden on the taxpayers here.</P>

      <P>As far as the first provision of the Bill is concerned, that is, the bringing together of the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Labour, I can see a certain amount of merit in that, particularly in view of the rather difficult times we are going through on the industrial relations scene. But I would like to know how long this innovation is going to last.  We have the example of the setting up of the separate Department of Economic Planning and Development which, after a couple of short years, was done away with.  As a trade unionist I was inclined to lean towards the idea of detailed economic planning, which is not usually found in the capitalist system, that could monitor the functions of other Departments to create employment.  It was sad that that Department was abolished after two-and-a-half years.  Now we have another innovation, the services coming together. I wonder how long that will last.  I am not really opposed to it.  I hope it works. Possibly there are some arguments in favour of it but that may not be the case in two years' time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointments of the extra Ministers of State, let me say first of all that I am certainly not critical of any of the individuals that have been appointed since the first five were appointed at the start.  I welcomed the idea of the five people being appointed at the time and I opposed people on our own side of the House who thought that one or two extra should have been appointed on that occasion.  I felt that the right thing to do was to appoint the five and then wait to see exactly what advantages came out of that.  I see no evidence that it has made any great difference to the state of the country.  It has made no very significant contribution.  It may have eased the burden on some of the Ministers dealing with medical cards, telephone problems, housing and so on. But it certainly has not played any role in leaving the Minister free to get further involved in the type of legislation that is needed to remove the inequalities that exist in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> We have a situation where we are urging people outside to accept technology, to accept changes, to accept rationalisation and to accept redundancies, and we provide a few pounds so that these changes can be made.  Then we are seen to create extra jobs in Government.  I am not criticising the extra jobs created in the civil service since Fianna Fáil came into power.  It is very nice to see jobs being created.  But I wonder if there are double standards with regard to the public service and the private sector, the industrial sector in particular.  We have a situation where people are encouraged to come into the civil service, particularly by the present Government.  There has been a substantial increase in numbers and it helps to show that they are creating employment and the Government can say that jobs were created.  I am in a dilemma about it because I like to see jobs being created.  But outside in industry, even in the administrative sphere of industry, if some manager comes in with a proposition, he does not just come in with a proposition that he wants the operatives or the craftsmen to rationalise.  It is usually a package which also gets rid of superfluous administration. That is the way the problem is dealt with.</P>
    <P>Today we are trying to appoint five extra Ministers in addition to the ten we already have and the Minister has not made a case for doing so.  If I, as an ordinary trade unionist, go to the negotiating table with such a proposition, I must make a case.  I must show the criteria on which the jobs are based and why it is necessary to create other jobs.  But no case has been made here and that is my argument against it.  I am not worried about the calibre of the people concerned or about personalities.  I do not even claim that these appointments are being made because of political patronage.  I do claim that no case has been made.  I have seen no evidence since the first five were appointed that the situation has improved dramatically.  Admittedly it is only a short time since the last five were appointed. At the time I expressed reservations <Col N="1201" /> although I welcomed the five because I could see an additional burden as a result of being in the EEC and so on.  I thought they should be appointed in the areas that were being affected by EEC membership.  Unfortunately I see no reason to welcome this Bill.  I am not one who dislikes seeing people getting on and I have no doubt that the people who will be appointed and have been appointed are hardworking and diligent people. But we cannot ask the people outside to rationalise and then operate some sort of a Parkinson's law for ourselves with a whole lot of offices close to Government Buildings with their windows blocked with people looking out.</P>
    <P>I am trying to give a graphic description of the way things worked some years ago in some of the industries before they caught on.  This is the way that an ordinary working man will look at it.  He will ask himself what is the case for these new appointments.  Do we know that the persons who will get the jobs will have the job qualifications?  Are they in some way measurable or can they be studied?  I am really trying to make the same case that Senator Whitaker made.  I am saying it in a different way but I mean the same thing, that we have not made a case.  We should be in a situation where we can say to the public that we know what the responsibilities of these new Ministers will be, what their duties will be and that we know exactly what will come out of those duties and responsibilities.  I cannot see that we are in a position to do this. Therefore, I cannot vote for the Bill and I propose, if it goes to a vote, to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to let the opportunity pass without making a few brief comments on the Bill that we are debating.  The Minister has told us that there are two proposals in it.  With regard to the first one, linking the Department of the Public Service and the Department of Labour, he advanced what I would describe as valid reasons why it has merit.  I certainly accept that. <Col N="1202" /> It is perhaps time that we changed from the situation that has prevailed since 1973 when the legislation was that the Department of the Public Service should be automatically linked to the Department of Finance.  As far as that proposal is concerned I have no basic objection to it.</P>
      <P>As far as the second proposal is concerned, increasing the present number of Ministers of State from ten to 15, I do have an objection.  Listening to the debate this afternoon my objection to this proposal has been strengthened.  I approached this debate with an open mind.  I had hoped that the Minister would have advanced convincing arguments as to why it was felt necessary to increase the number of Ministers of State at this time.  I have studied the speech closely and, apart from rather wide and general statements such as that we have a continued growth of responsibilities in relation to all aspects of the EEC and that there is a continuing increase in demands made on Ministers on the home front, there has been no convincing, concise argument made as to why we should have this increase in the number of our Ministers of State.  No attempt has been made to show how public administration will benefit from these additional appointments. No attempt has been made to show what advantages and what benefit will accrue to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that this proposal is being put forward on the basis of two years' experience.  I might be cynical enough to say that there are many&mdash;and that might even include the Minister&mdash;who did not, after two years, realise that this necessity existed.  The vast majority of people became aware of this proposal only on 14 December last, the day after the Taoiseach had announced the appointment of his new Ministers of State.  I find it rather extraordinary that the Taoiseach, who for two years presided over the operations of two large Departments of State without the assistance of a Minister of State, should on 14 December last decide, for some reason obscure to me, that it was <Col N="1203" /> necessary and desirable in the nation's interest that these extra appointments should be made.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came back into Government we have gone a long way where ministerial appointments are concerned. We have gone from a situation over two years ago where we had 15 Ministers, including the Taoiseach, and seven parliamentary secretaries to a situation where we will now have 15 Ministers, including the Taoiseach, and 15 Ministers of State.  I have not found the Minister's case convincing, and I listened with interest to the arguments from the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>Two Senators made their contributions. Again the arguments they advanced were weak.  They did not spell out the advantages which the nation or public administration would obtain from the making of these appointments.  One Senator put the weight of his argument on what he described as the burden that Ministers carry today under three headings, constituency work, government responsibility and work in relation to the EEC.  That is a general observation. Without saying what the case was he said there was an overwhelming case for increasing the number of Ministers of State to 15.  He said the figure was not unrealistic.  Again, that is an argument in very wide and general terms.  That same argument could also be used maybe this year or next year to argue that the number we are now talking about should again be increased.  There was not a concise argument there.</P>
    <P>The second Senator who spoke from the Government side of the House advanced arguments that five more Ministers of State could bring about desirable changes in State administration. He said the appointment of elected people to the position of Ministers of State was the essence of the democratic process.  Fine.  I will not argue with that, but he made no attempt to justify this or to explain the return that would come to the nation or to the taxpayers from the appointment of these additional Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>We have to have regard for the cost of <Col N="1204" /> these appointments.  A sum of about £500,000 has been mentioned as the figure required to cover the cost of their appointment, State cars, office facilities and personnel.  I would argue that at the present time, in view of the economic circumstances that face our people and our country, and on the basis of the arguments put forward here, the expenditure of that sum is an unnecessary extravagance, one which I would describe as a waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing cut-backs in public services and reductions in the money being made available to local authorities for desirable work.  Money for desirable schemes, such as local improvement schemes, and for reconstruction grants to put toilets into homes which do not have them, is being reduced or removed. The people who are at the losing end of these decisions will find it hard to appreciate the necessity for these appointments.</P>
    <P>I spoke about a reduction in public funds.  If there is a reduction in real terms, then as night follows day, it follows that the cost of administering these reduced funds to the general public will require less administration.  That brings into greater focus the desirability for making these appointments.  Side by side with this cut in public expenditure in real terms, we had severe tax increases in the budget.  We are being advised by the Taoiseach and his Ministers to tighten our belts, to produce more, to accept less, to make sacrifices on behalf of the nation and at the same time we are being told it is necessary to expend a further £500,000 to create five additional offices without being told in concise terms what benefits will arise from these appointments.</P>
    <P>I never tried to be political in my arguments here but I want to make a point.  I believe many members of the general public will look with a fair measure of cynicism on a situation that is rapidly developing to the point where almost half the Fianna Fáil representation in Dáil Éireann will be accommodated in State cars.  I oppose the creation of these extra posts because whatever reservations <Col N="1205" /> I may have had at the beginning of the debate they have been strengthened by the absence of valid and convincing arguments as to why the posts should be created.  I believe that their creation involves an unjustifiable waste of taxpayers' money.  The duties these proposed office holders will discharge are far from clear and therefore, as far as I am concerned, their advantage to the public and to the country is highly questionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended contributing to this debate but having listened to the lack of argument from the Opposition I have to add a few points. For too long our politicians have been both overworked and underpaid and they have tolerated conditions and standards that no other section of our community would put up with.  People get the politicians and the Government they deserve.  Ministers have responsibilities; politicians look after the affairs of the country and if we do not give ourselves a certain standard of living that is our fault and the fault of people like us.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard said he was not going to be political.  It is our job to be political.  The Government are making a political decision.  They have decided, because of the increasing complexities of Government, because of our involvement in European affairs, because of our growing, developing economy, that it is necessary to give people responsibilities that heretofore might not have been necessary.</P>
      <P>Recently the Taoiseach gave the Tánaiste responsibility for the Department of Energy.  A few years ago there was no talk about energy.  We were not as conscious of it then as we should have been, perhaps.  As time goes on we must look at these Ministers of State, at their responsibilities and at Departments in new ways.  We must make sure we face up to the challenges in a real way so that the country can have the type of service it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many areas of Government we have neglected, for example, family <Col N="1206" /> law reform.  I cannot see why a Minister of State should not have responsibility for that very important area.  There is also a need to have a Minister of State responsible for children and young people generally, given that in our society we have the highest proportion of young people in western Europe.  These are areas that should be the responsibility of one person and a section of a Department alone.  No Minister who is overworked&mdash;dealing with constituency and Government work, looking after a Department of State and getting involved in European affairs&mdash;can give of his best in every section.  He requires help.</P>
    <P>In the last election, for example, three Ministers lost their seats.  They said afterwards that they had not sufficient time to devote to their constituency affairs. One could not possibly devote sufficient time to one's constituency if one was being a capable and a good Minister.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for supporting this Bill.  It is necessary that we increase the number of such posts.  Perhaps in a few years we may need another three or four people to look after various sections of Government.  We should make no apology for that.  I do not think State money is being wasted.  For too long we have not paid sufficient attention to our politicians and the people involved in Government generally.  We have not given them the services they require.  Are the general public aware that in some offices in Leinster House ten people have to share the office, maybe with two or three telephone lines?  They are not able to give their constituents the type of service they need and require.  I do not want to hear any talk of apologies or about cutting back in public expenditure.  I have no doubt that this Bill is necessary and should be supported by all sides of the House.  I would be prepared to give way somewhat if I heard any convincing arguments from the other side as to why we do not need five more Ministers of State, but I have not and I am disappointed. This measure is being opposed for party political reasons and for no other reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the buck stops in five more places and we can expect decisions to be expedited, then it would be a good thing and I would welcome this Bill.  If, for example, one of these Ministers is going to taking up an appointment in the Department of Social Welfare and that appointment helps the old age pensioners or the people who are waiting for six, seven or eight weeks for their social welfare benefits, or helps the non-contributory pensioners who are waiting three or four months for their pension books then this is a good step.  I agree with the Senators who say that the reorganisation of Departments should be constantly kept in review.  One becomes sceptical when one looks at, for instance, the Department of the Environment with two Ministers of State. When they took over their new appointments they closed down the Department for several weeks and abolished the grants available to the poorest sections of the community.  Those grants not only encouraged people to improve their living accommodation but, in a very significant way, assisted people to provide additional bedrooms, back kitchens or to lay on sewerage or water services.  This has caused some anxiety around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Departments ought to be reorganised to coincide with the general organisation of departments in the EEC. When I was president of the Transport Commission I attempted to get momentum towards a transport policy.  I convened the first meeting between the Council of Transport Ministers in the Parliament and the Commission.  While other European Ministers could speak with authority on the transport problem, our transport administration and legislation are divided between the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Labour on the social aspect of transport problems, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Transport possibly with the smallest slice of the cake.  In many of these Departments, for any one particular aspect of an overall problem to be dealt with, it is necessary to have not only Ministers but civil servants drawn from a number of Departments of State. <Col N="1208" /> Since it is reasonable to assume and expect that we shall remain part of the greater Europe, certainly for the foreseeable future we would be wise to look again at the reorganisation and the responsibilities of our various Departments of State, as the Minister suggested in the first part of his speech.  A serious look should be taken at the entire reorganisation and groups of responsibilities in our Departments.</P>
    <P>Many points have been made in the course of this debate and many questions have been raised.  I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the House about the necessity to increase the number of Ministers of State.  It is a valid criticism to say that the Minister, in his speech, did not make an exceptionally strong case for the appointments. I look forward to the answers to some of the questions raised by Members on both sides of the House.  If the Minister is able to do that, it should be possible to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is realistic enough to know that a Bill such as this always raises a certain amount of political suspicion from the other side of the House.  I would be sold on these additional ministerial appointments if the Minister had put forward more convincing arguments, but his statement did not convince me.  We are a small democracy, with a very small population, but our public representation in proportion to the population is very large.  I wonder if the Minister can give us some indication as to how we stand compared with other democracies in this regard.  With up to 30 ministerial appointments, will our political represen tation be proportionate to other democracies?  I have grave doubts in this matter.  We are inclined to regard the democratic situation as it applies in Ireland as unique, perhaps because it is of our own making.  As politicians we have been inclined to take far too much local representation work on our shoulders.  We have been inclined to accept people coming to us at all hours of the day and night with what are rather trivial matters&mdash;social matters which <Col N="1209" /> could be given a hearing in and given attention to by other forums.  In a way we have created a monster which we find difficult to dispose of.  We see one way out of it&mdash;by creating additional ministerial appointments.  I am not convinced that is the way out of our problem.  Because of our economic circumstances I would have thought the creation of these positions would have been deferred.  As I said, I would have preferred additional arguments to those outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that the integration of the Department of the Public Service with the Department of Labour will work satisfactorily.  Industrial relations in the public sector are very different from industrial relations in the private sector.  For one thing, the environment is completely different; for another, the attitude of the workers in the public service is completely different from that of the workers in the private sector.  One reason may be the security of tenure they enjoy over people employed in the private sector. Having one Minister responsible for industrial relations in what are two completely different fields may not be the ideal way to handle what is a very complex matter.  As we know, industrial relations are becoming increasingly difficult. I would have preferred separate Ministers to be responsible for industrial relations in the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Members for their contributions.  In general they support the need for the changes proposed in this Bill.  Any reservations expressed were, I believe, either on grounds of scale or timing, or other details of ways and means, or were politically motivated.  I will deal with that in some depth later.  It has been said that this measure will not be of any help to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In fact, it will enable Ministers to respond more effectively and more quickly to the wishes of the Oireachtas and to devote more time to legislative proposals by allowing them to share some of their other functions in that context.  The present proposals are in line with other <Col N="1210" /> measures to improve the operating capacity of the Oireachtas to which I referred at the beginning.  For instance, the secretarial assistance available to Deputies has been increased and the staffing of Joint Committees is now also satisfactory.  I think it was Senator Staunton who referred to the inadequate secretariat.  When a backbencher, and coming from a big constituency, I too appreciated the difficulties of service in the House, but it has been improved.  It used to be one-in-ten and now it is one-in-seven. Also the allocation of funds to the Opposition Leaders has been increased, and increased substantially, since our return to Government.</P>
      <P>I have a number of points to make.  I hope Senators will bear with me for some time, because first I want to go through some of the specific points raised.  It is obvious to me that, in particular, the Fine Gael speakers have an inconsistent, in fact a contradictory, approach to this measure.  That was very evident when some Members spoke about the different aspects they agreed and disagreed on.  In 1977 when the legislation introducing the ten Ministers of State was being debated in the Dáil, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party asked if the figure ten was adequate.  As somebody who had recently left Government, he was aware of the pressures on Ministers which, of course, have grown very substantially in the intervening period.  A question was asked why, if it was necessary, it was not done in time for the EEC presidency, implying again, as it was implied in the other House, that if that had been the case the measure would have been received more warmly. This decision and this Bill are not related in any way to a temporary period of stress, but have been decided upon after mature reflection and mature judgment of the overall Government situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the staffing requirements, and I will try to answer some points made.  I want to come now to the charges of political motivation.  It is extremely disappointing that Senators should level charges, not specific charges, of incompetency or unsuitability <Col N="1211" /> against Ministers of State who are not present.  The best judgment by which any politician can be measured is how he fares in his own constituency over a long period.  All those people are politicians who have given long, dedicated and devoted service to the Houses of the Oireachtas and their constituents. To put it bluntly, I think it was very distasteful to hear Senators criticise these Ministers of State.  The Taoiseach appointed excellent people who are capable of filling the offices to which they have been appointed.  I could couple that with a comment made by Senator Markey when he referred to politicians meeting constituents or receiving complaints, some of which were trivial and which had created a monster.  This is a demand on time and can be wearying.  In addition to helping people, the politician at whatever level it be&mdash;county councillor, Senator, Deputy, Minister&mdash;has an opportunity of listening to people in his own area who will be able to tell him by their complaints and problems what difficulties exist.  It is a very useful exercise in democracy and it is something any Member of the Oireachtas or of any local authority has an obligation to carry out, no matter how difficult or how time-consuming it may be for her or him.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating referred to labour relations being worse in the public sector than in the private sector.  A later speaker seemed to put that the other way round.  It is a bit facile to say labour relations are worse in the public sector.  This picture has been distorted by one or two or perhaps a few more, prominent, long-drawn out disputes in essential services. But it is unfair to say that the conflict is due purely to bad management.  Other factors such as size of organisation are clearly important.  To the one person who disagreed with the bringing together of the two Departments under the one Minister, I say that not only the industrial relations sphere but the training, recruitment and placement areas of responsibility lie with one Department operating to a large extent in the private sector and the other Department operating in the public sector.  The arguments <Col N="1212" /> in favour, at this point, far outweigh those against.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker asked what was the future alignment.  The specific amending of the 1973 Act means that the Minister for Finance is removed from that legislation and the Minister for Labour is the Minister assigned at present to have responsibility for the two Departments. As time progresses or if the Taoiseach of the day decides, there can be any other alignment.  This is the reason for that particular change.</P>
    <P>The contributions of the Ministers of State have been referred to.  Here there is something I should say, and it was Senator West who drew my attention to it.  The first essential of any Member of either House, whether he be appointed to ministerial office or otherwise, is common sense, hard work, commitment, dedication and if he is appointed Minister a knowledge of the portfolio to which he is appointed.  I believe that to be the first essential.  There are others of course.  The basic difference from the role of Parliamentary Secretary, as it was in the past, was that it was an informal delegation or transfer of functions.</P>
    <P>Another very important attribute is the power to delegate, followed by a trust and confidence in colleagues to be able to assume that power and deliver on it.  There was substantial evidence of that in the past.  A Parliamentary Secretary did not have functions or powers formally transferred to him by his Minister. If that Minister had not the power to delegate, or did not have the confidence in other people to do a job, that Parliamentary Secretary became somewhat isolated and was not able to give the same performance as Ministers of State at present and in future will be able to do.  I should give the House an independent comment on that situation from the review body on higher remuneration, the Devlin Report, Report No. 20, and I will quote specifically from that:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the responsibilities of Ministers of State are significantly greater than were the responsibilities of Parliamentary <Col N="1213" /> Secretaries and we take this into account in our recommendations.</P>
    <P>That independent view indicates that the situation has changed so much that the transfer of functions is a formal transfer, not informally as was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to correct a point made by one Senator.  The Department of Labour will not be taking over responsibility for the Department of the Public Service.  Both Departments will remain as separate entities reporting to the same Minister.  The object is, of course, to improve co-ordination on industrial relations together with the other areas I mentioned, not to amalgamate the two separate functions.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte referred to the demise of the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Planning as a function is not being abandoned.  It is an essential central theme in this Government's approach to our economy, and the statutory functions of that Department have been transferred by Government order to the Department of Finance, which has a statutory obligation to continue planning.  It will continue in the very same way.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the cut in public expenditure.  I want to assure that Senator that this is a fallacy he would like to believe.  The correct position is that there has been a curb on the growth of public expenditure.  There has been no cut back.  The Senator referred specifically to local improvement schemes.  Part of my constituency covers a rural area also, and all I will say is that his memory is very short.  If he thinks back he should be very embarrassed indeed to refer to the local improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment was mentioned because there have been appointed to it two Ministers of State, and the opportunity was availed of by the Senator to refer to the withdrawal or the discontinuance of certain grants.  No reference was made by him to the very <Col N="1214" /> substantial increase in the local authority home loans available to young couples and the increase in the income limits there.  It was a political point to give some weight to weak arguments.</P>
    <P>Reorganisation of the public service was referred to.  This Bill itself is a simple measure which aims at improving the machinery of Government in two ways. Firstly, it seeks to facilitate the democratic process and improve the discharge of public business through the creation of five additional offices of Minister of State.  Once the Bill has been passed the Taoiseach will, of course, announce the precise areas to which these additional Ministers of State are to be appointed.  It would not, therefore, be very constructive at this stage to begin any speculation as to what these areas might be.  But I will say that this is a matter which has been the subject of very careful thought, and the allocation of responsibilities will be in the best interests of improving the Government machinery and making it more responsive to the very substantial pressures which I mentioned in my opening speech.</P>
    <P>I should also refer here to an exaggerated figure of cost which was used also in the other House and is probably about 50 per cent too high.  I am surprised that a businessman should make this point, and strangely enough it was a businessman who made it in the other House too.  Investment to make a more effective and efficient public service machinery available to our community who deserve it is money well spent, and I believe this will be the outcome of the extra appointments we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>The various programmes for the reorganisation of the public service were given a new impetus by this Government when they came into office in 1977 and I am personally committed to seeing that this impetus is maintained.  Under my aegis as Minister for the Public Service I will be endeavouring to ensure that there is an adequate rate of progress on this front.  These programmes seek to improve the machinery of Government in a <Col N="1215" /> number of ways.  Firstly, we are trying to ensure that the quality of advice being given to Ministers is improved through freeing Ministers and their senior advisers in so far as it is possible to do so within the existing legal constraints from being too involved in the day-to-day executive business of their Departments. This means trying to get acceptance for administrative structures which facilitate concentration on policy formation, review and appraisal of existing policy and greater emphasis on planning and financial management, a very critical area today.  Broadly speaking this involves the creation of the particular management structure which the public services organisation review group termed the Aireacht.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the spectrum we are seeking to improve the delivery of service to the client&mdash;and the client is extremely important&mdash;through the creation of structures aimed at facilitating the discharge of the executive responsibilities of Departments.  This means identifying and setting up self-contained executive units which will be able to concentrate with a single-minded purpose on their task of delivering the particular services for which they are responsible. This is the other part of the equation in the Aireacht executive structure recommended by the review group.  Thirdly, allied to the foregoing developments we are pursuing the establishment in all Departments of specialist staff support units for planning, finance, organisation and personnel in order to facilitate the development throughout the service of specialist skills in these functions which are common to the operation of all Departments.</P>
    <P>I will return for a moment to the second major provision of this Bill, that is the one which permits a member of the Government other than the Minister for Finance to be appointed Minister for the Public Service.  I have already referred to the changed circumstances on the industrial relations front which gave rise to our anxiety to bring responsibility for public and private sector industrial relations matters together under one <Col N="1216" /> Minister.  I am looking forward to the challenge which this will pose for me as the Minister concerned.  I hope to be in a better position now to ensure that there is full co-ordination in our approach to industrial relations problems.  Our economy is too small to afford the luxury of rivalry between different sectors on something as basic as the area of pay and conditions of service.  We must seek to arrest for all time the tendency for one sector to set headlines for another.  I am not about to allocate blame for trend setting to one sector or the other. Neither, however, am I going to understate the very real problems of this nature which have existed nor my intentions of getting to grips with them.  I look forward to and am confident of getting an appropriate response from both employers and unions to this initiative and to working closer with them in achieving greater understanding, co-ordination and harmony in these matters.</P>
    <P>I thank all who contributed, realising that the main criticisms offered were political and appreciating too that people at certain times have to say things that I believe they have no conviction in saying. This is obviously proved by what was said in the Dáil Chamber particularly at the time of the 1977 Bill.  The measure before this House is a move in the right direction.  It is the result of mature and careful thinking on the future development of our whole public service area.  I look forward to those appointments adding a new dimension to the operations of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy that my first appearance in this House is to promote a Bill which will make significant improvements in our social welfare services, and be of particular help to those genuinely in need of them.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the provisions of the Bill I would like to explain to Senators why this year's Social Welfare Bill has an unfamiliar look.  It contains some complex technical sections which are designed to facilitate the consolidation of all social welfare legislation.  As Senators are aware, the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976, is with the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills but four further statutes have been enacted since it was introduced in 1976.  Arrangements to have these Acts and the present Bill incorporated into a revised measure are well advanced.  I propose, in due course, to withdraw the present consolidation Bill and to introduce the revised Bill.  This will assist the Standing Joint Committee in their examination of the matter.</P>
      <P>The principal technical changes arise out of the creation of a new Schedule&mdash;the Eighth Schedule&mdash;to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  This new Schedule sets out the rates of social assistance payments on the same lines as the rates of social insurance payments are set out in the Third Schedule to the 1952 Act.  It will thus be possible to provide for future changes in rates of assistance by amending the Schedule without making changes in the main text of the Principal Act or other statutes. Before I leave this point, I should mention that the technical or structural changes in themselves do not affect entitlements under the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Bill will give effect to the increases in the rates of social welfare payments and other changes in the social welfare schemes announced in the budget.  The explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill sets these out and to facilitate comparison includes tables which in previous years were incorporated in the text of the Bill itself.  I trust that Senators will have found the <Col N="1218" /> memorandum of assistance in their consideration of this legislation.</P>
    <P>During last year the Government's commitment to keep social welfare payments in line with increases in the cost of living was fulfilled and, in addition, real improvements were brought about in the value of these payments.  The increases now being provided for&mdash;25 per cent on the long-term payments and 20 per cent on the short-term payments will continue this process.</P>
    <P>Retirement pensioners, old age pensioners and widow pensioners and other persons on long-term payments are generally regarded as requiring special attention in the social welfare context and I am sure that the desirability of higher increases in their case will be readily acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I should point out that these percentage increases are on top of the temporary increases of about 6 per cent provided from October of last year under the terms of the national understanding. The decision to continue these increases means that the annual rate of increase over the rates provided from April 1979 exceeds 31 per cent for long-term and 26 per cent for short-term payments.</P>
    <P>I would now like to illustrate the effects of the increases on individual payments and to express them in cash terms which is the form in which they will be judged by recipients.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being raised by £4.20 to £21.00 for persons aged under 80 years and by £4.50 to £22.50 for those over 80.  The reduced rates of pension payable where weekly means exceed £6 are also being increased. A further step is being taken this year towards rationalising the scales of means and rates of pension.  Since last year's improvement, pensions are reduced by £1.30 for every increase of £1 in means.  Under the present Bill, the stages between rates will now be lowered to £1.20.  This will extend the scale of means and pensions to include six additional rates of pension and reduced <Col N="1219" /> rates of pension will be payable up to a means limit of £23.  For a pensioner with qualified children, of course, the means limit will be higher.  The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under 66 years of age is being increased by £2.10 to £10.55.  The overall maximum payment for a pensioner with a dependent spouse will, therefore, go up to £31.55 and to £33.05 if the pensioner is over 80 years.  The additions to pension payable to pensioners with qualified children are being raised by £1.15 to £5.70 a week for each of the first two children and by 90p to £4.40 a week for each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>This year a number of further changes to individual schemes have been found to be possible.  Two such improvements affecting blind persons are being made in the Old Age Pensions Acts.  The qualifying age for blind pension is being reduced from 21 to 18 years, and the amount of a blind person's earnings which may be disregarded, when means are being assessed for pension purposes is being increased.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for the increases in the general rates of unemployment assistance.  The increase in the personal weekly rate of assistance will bring the maximum up by £2.85 to £17.00 in urban areas and by £2.75 to £16.45 in rural areas.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £12.25 and £11.95 respectively and the rates for dependent children to £5.30 for each of the first two and £4.10 for others.  Thus the rate of assistance for a married couple with two children is being increased by £6.70 to £39.85 in an urban area and by £6.55 to £39. in a rural area.</P>
    <P>The means of certain smallholders in specified disadvantaged areas may be assessed notionally for unemployment assistance purposes.  The assessment is based on land valuation but only where the valuation is £20 or less.  In these cases, special rates of unemployment assistance are payable.  The notional system of assessment is a concession having regard both to the present levels <Col N="1220" /> of farm incomes and the means test for unemployment assistance generally.</P>
    <P>The special rates payable to smallholders who continue to avail of notional assessment will be maintained at the level payable from October 1979. The additional increase of 20 per cent will only apply to those smallholders on factual assessment.</P>
    <P>Any smallholder whose means are assessed on a notional basis may have his means assessed on a factual basis if this would be to his advantage and some 3,000 smallholders have already opted for factual assessment and are receiving unemployment assistance at the rates generally applicable.  Smallholders on factual assessment will receive the general 20 per cent increase provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill deal with two improvements in the unemployment assistance scheme being provided this year.</P>
    <P>Section 7 will increase the amount of earnings from seasonal fishing disregarded in assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes to a maximum of £120 as against £80 at present.</P>
    <P>The six months' continuous residence requirement for unemployment assistance purposes is being removed by section 8.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 11 provide for increases in all rates of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions and other improvements.  The improvements in widows' pensions automatically apply to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly personal rate of widow's non-contributory pension is being increased by £4.20 to £21 and the amount for each qualified child by £1.40 to £6.90.  Provision is also made for reductions of £1.20, as opposed to £1.30 at present, in pension for each £1 increase in means and for additional rates of pension.</P>
    <P>Section 13 applies a 25 per cent increase to the social assistance allowance payable to single women aged between <Col N="1221" /> 58 and 66 bringing the maximum from £14.65 to £18.30, and section 14 applies a 20 per cent increase in the rates of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a deserted wife who becomes widowed will qualify automatically for widow's non-contributory pension at the same rate as the deserted wife's allowance which was in payment to her.  Under present procedures, a woman in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance whose husband dies must, if she wishes to obtain a widow's non-contributory pension, apply specifically for it; this entails a reinvestigation of means.  The means test and the rates of payment are the same in both schemes, and I consider that title to widow's non-contributory pension should be conferred on such widows with the minimum of formalities.  While the provision will convey no monetary advantage, I know that the simplification of procedures will be welcomed.  It will, of course, be open to a widow to apply for a reinvestigation of her means if she considers that a higher rate of pension should be paid to her.</P>
    <P>The present definition of orphan for social welfare purposes includes a child whose parents are dead and who does not reside with a step-parent.  It also includes a child whose mother dies while deserted wife's allowance or benefit was payable to her and whose father does not wholly or mainly maintain him.  Cases have arisen where a woman who was deserted by her husband dies but, prior to her death, had not applied for, or had not qualified for deserted wife's allowance or benefit.  Similar situations have occurred where a husband was deserted by the wife and, on his death, the children were left without rights to benefit.  Accordingly, it is proposed to expand the definition of &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; to include the child of a deceased parent, who had been deserted prior to death where the other parent has abandoned the child.  The provisions in sections 12 and 22 of the Bill will enable orphan's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance or orphan's pension <Col N="1222" /> under the occupational injuries scheme to be paid in respect of such children.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the increases in the rates of contributory benefits and pensions under the social insurance scheme which are provided by section 15 of the Bill.  The personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit is increased by £3.40 to £20.45 and a married couple will now receive £33.70, an increase of £5.60 per week.  Allowances for children with these benefits are also being increased.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension is being increased by £4.40 to £22.05 with an addition of £14.30 for an adult dependant, while maternity allowance, which is a short-term benefit, is being increased to £20.45 in line with disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The new personal rate of widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit, will be £22.50 and, for those aged 80 or over, £24.05.  The additions to widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for qualified children are being raised to £7.50 for each child.  A widow or deserted wife with three qualified children will now get £45, an increase of £9 per week.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of contributory old age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 go up to £24.50 and, for those over 80, to £26.25.  The addition to pension for an adult dependant is being raised to £15.65, where the adult dependant is under pensionable age, and to £18.30 where the adult dependant is aged 66 or over.  Accordingly, a married couple both over pensionable age will get £42.80 as compared with £34.25 at present and, if the pensioner is aged 80, the new rate will be £44.55, an increase of £8.90 per week.  In the case of these pensions, the increased amounts for child dependants will be £6.40 for each of the first two children and £5.30 for each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>All the personal rates contained in section 15 of the Bill are the maximum rates, payable where the contribution conditions for the benefit concerned are fully satisfied.  Most people qualify for <Col N="1223" /> the maximum rates, but when the claimants' insurance records are deficient, reduced personal rates are payable.  As is normal, these rates will be increased by regulations.  I would remind Senators that it is only the personal rates of benefit that are reduced where there is a deficient record.  The allowances for a dependent wife and children remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>A persistent criticism of the disability benefit scheme is that it can act as an inducement to malingering.  It is alleged that some workers claim benefit in respect of unnecessarily frequent short absences from work.</P>
    <P>At present, a person is disqualified for payment of benefit for the first three days of illness unless those days fall within 13 weeks of a previous period of illness or unemployment.  A person can thus get disability benefit from the first day of a sick absence occurring within three months of the end of the previous claim even though the second absence may be as short as three days.  In order to tighten control in this area section 17 of the Bill will apply the three waiting days to every claim to disability benefit, except in the case of a person who becomes ill while unemployed or who suffers a relapse within three days of returning to work.  The position in regard to waiting days for the purposes of unemployment benefit and injury benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Rates of benefit under the occupational injuries scheme, including amounts in respect of adult and child dependants, are being increased by section 20.  The increases being applied are in line with the increases under the general social insurance scheme. However, this year, for the first time, disablement benefit is being treated as a long-term benefit and the 25 per cent increase is being applied to it.</P>
    <P>The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner who has attained the age of 66 years is being raised to £11.75 and in the case of a pensioner living alone, the additional <Col N="1224" /> allowance is being increased to £1.65.</P>
    <P>Beneficiaries under the schemes of unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit, invalidity pension, injury benefit and supplementary welfare allowances can be affected by an anomaly as regards entitlement to an increase for an adult dependant.  This is being dealt with by sections 6, 14, 19 and 23 of this Bill.  A beneficiary under these schemes who is single or widowed or receiving deserted wife's benefit or allowance may be paid an increase&mdash;known as a &ldquo;housekeeper's allowance&rdquo;&mdash;in respect of a woman who is wholly or mainly maintained by the beneficiary to have the care of at least one child.  However, certain married persons who are separated from their spouses cannot at present be paid the allowance even though their circumstances may be analogous to single or widowed persons.  The amendments provide for the payment of the &ldquo;housekeeper's allowance&rdquo; to married persons in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    <P>The amounts of children's allowances are being increased again this year.  The monthly allowance for the first child will go up by £1 to £4.50 and by £1.50 to £7 for each subsequent child.  The new monthly payment for a family of three children, for example, goes up to £18.50, an increase of £4.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances, which are paid directly to the mother, constitute an important source of income for large families particularly in the lower and middle income groups.  The adjustment in the child income tax allowance announced in the budget statement will ensure that the full value of the increase in children's allowance is directed mainly towards these families.  The increased rates will be effective from 1 July 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for increases in the grants paid in respect of multiple births which, at present, are fixed at £100 in respect of triplets and £150 on the birth of quadruplets or any higher number.  These amounts are to be increased to £300 and £400 respectively from 1 April 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> Section 26 raises the earnings ceiling from £5,500 to £7,000.  The rates of pay-related social insurance contributions are also being increased to meet the employer's and employee's share of the cost of the improvements in the social insurance schemes.  The effective increase of 0.8 per cent on the current rate of contributions, 11.2 per cent, applicable to persons eligible for all benefits, will be borne by employers and employees by increases in their contributions of 0.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>While the section provides for the new rates of contribution by the substitution of &ldquo;3.5 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.2 per cent&rdquo; and &ldquo;8.5 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;7.5 per cent&rdquo; in section 6 (1) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, I should point out to Senators that the present rates of contributions are not 3.2 per cent for employees and 7.5 per cent for employers.  The rates were, in fact, temporarily increased to 3.4 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively by section 5 (2) of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, for the tax year ending on 5 April 1980.  This provision will lapse next month leaving the original rates in section 6 (1) to be increased from 6 April 1980 by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Increases are also being provided in the rates of voluntary contributions.  All these changes will be effective from 6 April, 1980.  The new rates and the increased earnings limit are expected to increase the yield from contributions by £44 million to an estimated £380 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Any necessary increases in the special or &ldquo;modified&rdquo; rates of contributions payable in respect of certain employments, for example, civil servants, outworkers, certain share-fishermen, will be made by regulation.</P>
    <P>The overall cost to the Exchequer of the provisions of this Bill will be £90.2 million in 1980.  Of this amount, social assistance will account for £57.3 millio, all of which will be borne by the Exchequer. The total increase in the cost of the social insurance changes is expected to be £77 million and will be met out of the <Col N="1226" /> social insurance fund.  This fund is financed by contributions from employers and employees and by an annual subvention from the Exchequer.  As increases in pay-related contributions from employers and employees will yield an estimated £44 million, the extra cost to be borne by the Exchequer will be about £33 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Bill which I have outlined can be summarised as the increase of long-term payments such as pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, by 25 per cent, the increase of short-term payments such as disability and unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance by 20 per cent; the increase of children's allowances by an average of about 28 per cent; the extension of entitlements for various categories, for example blind persons, widows, orphans, seasonal fishermen and the taking of measures to prevent abuse of the disability benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill will bring about a real improvement in the social welfare system, and I, therefore, have pleasure in recommending it to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began his speech by informing us that it was his first occasion visiting the Seanad.  May I, therefore, say that he is very welcome here and extend to him my very sincere good wishes in his position.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to oppose the Bill that we are now debating.  I, in fact, welcome the modest increases that will become available under this Bill and the minor improvements that have taken place in certain aspects of the social welfare legislation.  When we look at the situation of the people who are on social welfare we think particularly of the old, the needy, the widows, deserted wives and the unemployed.  When we relate their situation to the actual amount of money that we make available to them I am justified in saying that it is a rather meagre sum on which these people are expected to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> When we talk of social welfare recipients we are dealing with the weakest and, in fact, the most deprived section of our people.  When we were debating the 1979 Bill I said that I am not always satisfied that we as a community or as a society fulfil the duty we owe to these particular people.  I believe that we constantly fail to recognise that what we expect these people to survive on is totally inadequate to provide a decent standard of living and that, by doing so, we often fail as well to recognise the contribution that some of these people, particularly those on old age pensions, have made to the building of this nation.  As a community we avail far too often of the slightest excuse to pass on to others the responsibility that we owe to these people.  It is tragic that the old, the needy and the infirm amongst us have to depend on the charity of relatives or neighbours to get them through difficult times.</P>
    <P>I should like very briefly to look at the scale of income that will be available to some of these categories of people under the Bill.  And while the sums given, as the Minister has said, represent a certain percentage increase we could, at this stage, question if that increase will be adequate should inflation continue to increase over the coming months.  Will the increase that has been granted be sufficient to maintain the standard, poor and all as it is, of living that is available to the people who will benefit from this Bill?</P>
    <P>When we look at the pension that is available to the retired, the old age contributory people, to persons under 80 years, we are talking of a weekly income of £24.50.  If a person is totally dependent on that sum of £24.50 to buy food, clothing and provide heating and cooking facilities then obviously that person is on the poverty line.  The invalidity pension will be £22.05 per week.  Unless the person who is dependent on that figure has available to him or her the charity of a family or neighbours that £22.05 will, in fact, be totally inadequate to provide that person with any acceptable standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> I would like to refer to the non-contributory old-age pension for those under 80 years of age which will be £21. The observations I have made in relation to the other cases that I have referred to are valid again.  In relation to unemployment assistance the differential, small as it is, between the rate payable in urban areas and in rural areas will still continue. I asked for the justification of this difference last year, and I ask for it again.  Even though the difference may be small why should it exist at all?  A disabled person's maintenance allowance, again, at £20.05 per week is a rather inadequate sum to provide any reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the opportunity was not availed of to bring about a few improvements in the social welfare code.  For example, the Government did not see their way to reduce the qualifying age for the old age pension to 65.  I am disappointed to see, in relation to the means test, that the base of £6 is still being persisted with.  This base of £6 per week means has existed for a number of years.  The time is long past when it should be reviewed upwards.  In relation to the same aspect I regret that the means limit still remains at £23 per week.  For example, if a non-contributory old age pensioner has means that can be assessed at £23 or over per week he is automatically deprived of benefit.</P>
    <P>Very often that means of £23, £24 or £25 per week has been acquired over a life-time of hard work when that person has been thrifty, because he has means that can be assessed as equalling or exceeding £23 per week, he is penalised for the thriftiness he has shown during his lifetime.  On the other hand, one will find that perhaps somebody who had a similar opportunity to be equally thrifty acted otherwise, his or her attitude is appreciated and rewarded as against the position of the person who through hard work and thriftiness succeeded in putting aside something that equates with an income of £23 per week.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at that aspect of the situation.  I am a member of an old age pension committee and month <Col N="1229" /> in month out we are confronted with cases relating to old age pensioners. Their pension should be looked at and adjusted upwards substantially.</P>
    <P>One matter that concerns me and many other public representatives is the considerable delay that has been experienced by people who apply for pensions and social welfare benefits.  These delays can run into many months.  I hope that when the Minister is replying to the debate he will be in a position to give us an assurance that these delays will be elimimated before very long.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme that comes under what we are discussing here, that is the fuel scheme, in which certain people in receipt of social welfare benefit obtain vouchers to the value of £1.50 per week during the winter period.  As I understand it, the benefits of this scheme are confined to 17 towns and cities, mainly in the East.  These 17 towns and cities were designated as long ago as 1942. Thirty-eight years have elapsed since then and the time is long past for confining the benefits of this scheme to 17 towns.  It is true to say in relation to old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and people in receipt of unemployment benefit in other towns and cities throughout Ireland that their needs for heating and fuel for cooking are as great as the needs of the people who, luckily, reside in the designated 17 towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously there is discrimination there.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will give this matter his early attention and see that the benefits of this scheme are extended and made available to the same categories of people throughout the country.  I will not oppose the Bill.  I welcome the improvements that it brings about and I have no wish to impede its progress from the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LadyGoulding" hpid="Lady Goulding Lady Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Lady Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill.  I have not read it thoroughly but I made a few brief notes on it.  I welcome very much the increase in the children's allowances.  This will make a <Col N="1230" /> great difference to many mothers who have six or seven children who find it very difficult to get by on what their husbands earn.  This allowance to them will be of great benefit.  I understand very well that Senator Howard would like to increase all these allowances.  This may perhaps come in a few years' time, with the coming of silicon chips when we will be able to produce more and there will be more money in the kitty to give out.  I will be the first one then to suggest that the unemployed should get a higher rate. I cannot see at the moment how it would be possible for this to be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The other point that I wish to make is that the gap that existed for those who are blind between the ages of 18 and 21 has now been closed.  This is a great step forward because I think it was very unfair that in the past they were not covered.  Now they will get their disability allowance,</P>
      <P>The allowance for old age pensioners over 80 has been increased considerably. Again, of course, we should like to increase it more but maybe in the future we shall.  The disability pension has gone up considerably.  I know this will be a great comfort to a great number of people that I have the good fortune to work alongside in the north of the city.  A little extra will help them very considerably. In the future maybe it will go higher.</P>
      <P>Another point is the extra money given to unmarried mothers.  This is badly needed.  Although it is only a small amount it will be of great help to them.  I welcome this Bill, which I consider to be very good, I look forward to going into it in more depth.  These are just a few points I picked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and make the observation that the beginning signs suggest that we have a conscientious and diligent person.  I hope I am proved to be right later on and that I have not to take back those kind remarks.  Whilst I have criticisms to level at some parts of the Bill it would be unrealistic to say that increases are not <Col N="1231" /> good and that improvements have not taken place.  I must acknowledge that.  My argument is quite consistent with what I believe and what my party believe.</P>
      <P>The increases are very welcome, and we have no intention of delaying the Bill in any way.  We want to get it through the House as quickly as possible.  We want people to get the money as fast as possible.  The big problem&mdash;this happens not only with this Government but has happened with successive Governments&mdash;is that we are dealing with the effects and not the cost of the social welfare problems.  I cannot blame any particular individual for that because it goes back to the foundation of the State and was inherited from other places.  Senator Goulding made the point that if we make enough later on more could be given.  She referred to the silicon chips.  The way society functions is if we make enough later on we will see what we can do for the poor, the underprivileged and the deprived.  If we are not doing well, they do not come into the overall reckoning to the same extent as every other person in the community.</P>
      <P>The social welfare increases are really only catching up on past neglect, the partial removal of the food subsidies, the staggering recent price increases, local authority cut-backs.  These will hit hardest the people on social welfare and low wages.  Many people on social welfare have to use gas cylinders.  Postal charges are to be increased soon.  The increase in the VAT rate may not affect the lower paid as drastically as those in the higher bracket.  They all play a part in eroding the benefits.  We will be in the same position next year, having a Social Welfare Bill introduced, probably with reasonably good increases, but the same vicious circle will start all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take issue with the Government over one thing.  I know their philosophy would not allow them to go as radically as I would like to see them go.  At least I can say to them that the decision to reduce by a very substantial amount the funds that are available to the National Committee on the Pilot <Col N="1232" /> Schemes to Combat Poverty is deplorable.  These projects and services are designed to assist the poor.  The latest figures available shows that 40 per cent of this Committee's funds have been expended. I have a particular interest in this since it was my leader, Deputy Frank Cluskey, who convinced the European Council in 1974, the Council of Ministers, to extend the whole antipoverty programme, not only to Ireland but to a lot of other countries, thereby identifying with the needs of the poor in general.  This committee was put into a system where it is very difficult to bring about radical changes which would to a greater extent than would normal increases in social welfare, not solve the problem, but make the problem less acute.  We will not solve the social welfare problems in our society.  They are there and all we can do is deal with them and make them less acute.  The national committee on the poverty programme because of this cut-back are being denied an opportunity to at least eat into the selfishness which exists in our society and highlight a lot of areas of social concern and thereby make the lot of the people on the lower incomes and particularly social welfare recipients in all categories, that little bit better off. That is all it could do but at least even that bit is gone at the same time as we are doing this.  It would not be very hard to make an argument that we can produce more money for art and cultivation. I am basic.  When there are poor about, the knife and fork come before the art and the cultivation.  I urge the Minister to think about the pilot scheme on poverty.  He has shown some good signs.  I would like to know if he has something in mind that could ease my resentment of the lack of a radical approach to try to solve the problems to a greater extent than what we can do by mere increases in the social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>People are getting a good increase now, but there is individual aggression over the common ownership which makes us accept the existing order.  We look on it as being something unchangeable. The best we can do is to try <Col N="1233" /> to alleviate or make the problem less acute, by introducing payments every so often, if everybody else is satisfied that they are doing well.  We are not in a position, by the very nature of society, to introduce any legislation that would see a better redistribution of the country's wealth because the type of legislation needed would have to be very strong. very forceful, very radical.  So the fact is that legislation introduced to give people increases in social welfare payments is feeble legislation.  It is not getting at the causes but dealing with the effects.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this in a dogmatic way but there are plenty of editors, priests, parsons, lawyers and other men of substance around but they do not have any remedy to offer to the poor. They all say it is sad to see the poor and they all say how sorry they are that there is so much misery in the land.  But none of them is prepared to stand up and offer any solution to the problem.  What happens is that, because of pressures, some sort of feeble legislation is introduced and mild charity abounds with no radical cures.  Whoever said that the poor will always be with us was right because there are not enough people in the political field prepared to exercise pressure to bring about the type of radical changes necessary and which should be introduced by so-called men of substance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the increases.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to come in with legislation year after year and why people are so afraid to go radical because whether we like it or not most laws, feeble as they are, are socialistic, they imply the right of the State to control the individual for the benefit of the nation.  For example, in the planning Acts, there are provisions preventing widening of streets or putting houses back to back and so on. The right of an owner to do certain things is taken away in order to protect the rights of other people.  If one wants to build an extension one cannot encroach on somebody else's property.  Why cannot we have this approach when it comes <Col N="1234" /> to social welfare recipients?  The Truck Act was brought in to protect employees from being swindled by employers. It is an old Act but that was the basis for it.  That is socialistic.  So are the Factories Act and the Inspectors Act and so is the Act providing for inspectors to board a ship to see that the equipment and cranes and everything else are in proper condition, because the rights of somebody else would be interfered with otherwise.</P>
    <P>The so-called free education scheme which we have to an extent is also socialistic.  We have these Acts that can be described as socialistic because they all interfere with the freedom of contract. Why cannot we get to the point of interfering with the freedom of contract of people in the wealth bracket who have had the wealth tax removed?  Why cannot we face up to that?  It might not have done a lot for social welfare but at least it would have done something; the people who got the money out of the removal of wealth tax do not need it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the whole question is if one looks back to the early thirties and forties one sees that everybody was in the same boat.  Very few people got secondary or third level education.  There was more understanding among people then and everybody helped one another. But the society we now have, the selfish scrambling system, has resulted in a moving away of workers from the inner city and away from those left in poverty throughout the country; they are out of touch and they do not care.  Somebody has to remind them that there are people on the poverty line and that £39.85 is not going to alleviate, to any extent whatever, the problems of a person on assistance who has a wife and two children to keep.  The few pounds he will get next year will not alleviate them either.</P>
    <P>We have got the post and telegraphic arrangements and we have socialistic legislation.  Why cannot we get a bit further in relation to social welfare? Why cannot we at least get back to the combat poverty pilot scheme again, put more money into it and put pressure on <Col N="1235" /> society as a whole who have an obligation to these people in the lower income category and which is not being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>No matter what way one argues about it, poverty will always be with us because there is a private monopoly on capital and land and, by and large, most of us are motivated by the profit motive. We seem to be afraid of a society based on live fraternity and service.  Yet we go to church and listen to all the Christian speeches.  We say it is bad to see people so low down and why do we not do something about it.  Why are we not brave enough to start introducing radical legislation and face up to it in that way? One need not call it socialism, one can call it what one likes, but radical legislation is definitely needed if we are going to overcome poverty.  It has to be overcome by this force that is not yet employed, the force that will drive out selfishness.  That can only be done by the people in power, the people who hold the reins.</P>
    <P>It is time that all of us faced up to the need to go a bit further in helping the people who have to depend on social welfare as a means of existence and we should make no apology to the rest of society for doing it.  As long as we live with wrong that wrong will only produce more inequality and it exists and it is up to us to try to do something about it. Wrong, in the midst of abundance, really tortures people who are poor.  I am not getting emotional and I am not saying anything I have not said before.  I speak with authority about this because I was born into poverty, into a very large family in the Dublin slums.  I know what I am talking about.  I am into my sixtieth year and I am listening to the arguments of people all over the country that private enterprise is going to give full employment, that everyone will be happy and everything will work out well.  It does not work, it has not worked and it will not work.  And the reason it will not work is because we encourage this selfish scrambling system.  We are not prepared to fight the people who put others on the poverty line by this <Col N="1236" /> monopoly and grabbing and selfishness. The society makes men greedy for wealth because the conditions of distribution are so unjust that instead of everybody being assured of enough what happens is that many are condemned to want and all considerations of justice, mercy, religion and sentiment are stepped on by the very society we live in.</P>
    <P>Let us hope the day will soon dawn when we will be able to come in with a Social Welfare Bill that says we have a system now where there is a fairer and more equitable distribution of the wealth that is created, we are now in a position to say that there are not 25 per cent of the population on the poverty line any more and all the fear of want is gone. Also I would urge the Minister to look at the delays.</P>
    <P>Another area which is not in the Minister's bailiwick but about which he might be able to do something is the question of old people on social welfare who have to depend on turf to keep their bodies warm; they have to keep coming back to advice centres on a regular basis to ask for the turf to be delivered.  Then after pressure is put on the officials concerned with it, the social welfare recipient comes back in another few weeks to say that the turf has not been delivered for another four weeks.  These are a few of the areas which the Minister could tackle.  He should make sure that nobody is treated like that.  I know it is not the Minister's particular responsibility to have the turf delivered but I believe he could put the pressure in the right area and maybe give somebody a boot in the right direction.  I believe it is also possible for him to have another look at the pilot scheme to combat poverty and to let us know what his thinking is in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to this House and to congratulate him on the very conscientious job he is doing as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to welcome this Social Welfare Bill.  In particular I welcome the 25 per cent increase for those on long term benefits and the 20 per cent for those on <Col N="1237" /> short term benefits.  It must be remembered that this comes on top of the in creases last October and they are significant cash increases to help the less well off.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with any particular aspect of the budget, I would agree with Senator Howard who talked about the distinction between what we call rural and urban payments.  As a person living in a rural area I know that people in rural areas have often to go at great inconvenience to various centres to claim for benefit and they have a lot more hardship in many cases than people in the urban areas.  As well as that people in urban areas have greater services than people in the rural areas; I am referring to county council service, transport services and so on.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I cannot agree with him in his remarks about one aspect of the old age pension.  He mentioned that there is no change in old age pension entitlement rates.  The upper limit has gone up from £17 to £23 which means there are six additional rates of payment. I support what he says in relation to the means at the lower rate which is still £6 and has been £6 for a very long time.  In this day and age I feel that that limit should be increased so that a person would get the full pension when they earn a little more than £6.  The fact that they would have a reduced pension is not a very equitable system.  It is a fine step by the Minister to give six additional payments in this budget.  To bring in six additional payments in one Bill is very commendable.  One of the first things I would like to welcome in the budget is the fact that a blind person can be payable at 18 years of age now instead of 21 years.  Also the means test for this pension is being eased.  That is something I have been asked about by a number of organisations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of old people, very recently the Minister was in Athenry, County Galway, to open a day centre there which is organised by the Athenry Community Council.  They should be congratulated on getting this <Col N="1238" /> day centre which the Western Health Board and county council assisted greatly in setting up.  At the opening the Minister will remember that a number of speakers talked about the need for a geriatric home in the north-east Galway area.  There has been a lot of pressure from the Roscommon people who have sought the establishment of this home somewhere in the area.  The reason I mention this is that we have a prescribed relative allowance which I might deal with later on which is a bit confined at the moment.  But I am glad that the Minister since he was appointed Minister for Health and Social Welfare has been advocating that prevention is better than cure.  I am glad that we have such a fine home help service and that we have these facilities to help people so that they do not have to go to hospitals.  Relative allowances like that are a better way of dealing with the problem than having too many homes.  But in this area there is a need for a geriatric home and I hope that it will be considered.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Connaughton has arrived here because I wanted to challenge a statement that he made in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> last week in connection with these farmers who are getting smallholders' unemployment assistance.  As the Minister stated in his Social Welfare Bill, there are 3,000 farmers receiving this benefit on a factual basis where a pension officer comes out and assesses their income.  They will be getting the increase in this budget.  But Senator Connaughton stated that if those farmers who were assessed on land looked for an increase they would get into trouble.  He also said that if they did not look for an increase they would still get into trouble.  I want to put on record that I checked this out with the Department and was told that that was absolute rubbish, that the option was still there for a smallholder either to stay on the notional system or to look for factual assessment if he wants an increase.  Factual assessment could obviously help a farmer who had flooding or a very high valuation or disease in his herd and so on.  I know that the majority of farmers in the 12 western counties, 18,500 <Col N="1239" /> altogether, will stay on the notional system because the multiplier is low and they can be involved in mixed farming. They can have any amount of stock and they will not be penalised as Senator Connaughton suggests.</P>
    <P>This is a very disturbing matter and it has caused a lot of concern to farmers who have approached me.  I would like to know what basis Senator Connaughton has for making this statement. If he has any evidence I would like to hear it, and I am glad that he is here for this debate.  I feel that he has rushed into print without checking the facts.  I have checked them with the Department and I understand that there will be an advertisement appearing in the paper shortly stating the position.  In fact the position is already stated in the budget and it is stated also in the Social Welfare Bill before us.  But I am glad to have this opportunity to get him to clarify it because it is causing some concern.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the prescribed relative allowance.  This allowance has also been increased in the budget and has been seen to be of great benefit where there has been one relative in the family.  The problem is that an old age pensioner may be getting this relative allowance for his son but if the son gets married the allowance is then terminated.  It seems unfair, because he then will have a woman in the house who might be very well able to look after that old person.  I would ask the Minister if he would look at that scheme, because it is confined.</P>
    <P>I would also support what has been said by Senator Howard that the qualifying age for the old age pension might be reduced to 65.  I understand the Minister said in the Dáil that this would cost about £12 million.  I hope that the money can be found in a future budget to do that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would make that recommendation and also the recommendations in relation to the lower rate of means for the old-age pension which is £6.</P>
    <P>Again I welcome the increases in this budget which are significant cash increases, <Col N="1240" /> and I hope that the Minister can continue to help those less well-off sections in our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House and to congratulate him upon the large across-the-board increases in long-term benefits which far exceeded the expectations of many concerned bodies before the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, one comment I would make generally on the administration of the services for which the Minister is responsible&mdash;and here like Senator Harte who represents the authentic voice of the Labour Party in this House&mdash;I am impelled to play the devil's advocate when we are discussing and debating social welfare measures.  Increases in social welfare benefits and payments in themselves are ineffective if they do not make sufficient impact on the lives of the recipients to ensure a real improvement in their living conditions.  Today when we are spending more and more of what the State collects in taxation on social welfare we have more real poverty in Ireland than we should be prepared to tolerate.  That being so, we are not getting value for our money, and if we are not getting value for our money then we should take a long look at the administration of the social welfare schemes.  I am not going so far as to suggest, as a well known Nobel Prize winning economist whose name for the moment escapes me suggested that we would get equal value for money if we simply handed out the money in the hope that the needy would lay their hands on it.  But I believe that we should give more authority and money to voluntary organisations who are working on the ground and who are in a position to know where the real needs are.  In that regard I am very glad to hear the Minister's commitment on his appointment, which was reported in the newspapers, to increase community involvement in social affairs.  I often feel that when we have a good voluntary organisation going, which is working well, when it is taken over by a Government agency it often means the <Col N="1241" /> bureaucratic kiss of death.  I suggest that we give more money and more authority to voluntary organisations.  I do not believe with Senator Harte that the political will to make radical changes is not present.  The Bill which the Minister has before the House today shows that that concern and that political will are there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It grants relatively good increases to people who are most in need, I certainly congratulate the Minister as Minister for Health and Social Welfare and on, in this first budget, ensuring that this type of increase has been forthcoming.  Most people might feel that at this time and at this time of the year the Government might in fact have got away with increases of less than the 20 and 25 per cent increases in social welfare allowances.  It is also true that if inflation continues at the present rate, at the end of the year anything less than the increases given will not, in fact, make those recipients much better off.  But nevertheless at a time when there is a great tightness of credit and a general lack of available finance it is heartening to see that the people who are most in need of this type of help and benefit are actually getting it.</P>
      <P>I would also like to address myself to the question of the old age pension.  The means rate of £6 is particularly low and one could say that any person with an income of only £6 or thereabouts in today's money terms should not be impeded, because of that, from receiving a full old age pension.  While on this subject I would say that many people around the country were disappointed that the qualifying age was not dropped another year.  Many were hoping that the Government would reduce the age by another year, taking into account the employment situation here, the modern trend towards early retirement and the fact that there may not be jobs for people once they get into the sixties.  I would ask the Minister to take particular note of that in the forthcoming year and, if at all possible, to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> In reply to Senator Kitt's comments about the farmer' dole, I want to ask the Minister a straight question, and I will be listening very attentively when he is replying.  Of all the persons who are now in receipt of what we call the small farmers' dole, will each and every one of them be getting automatically an increase of 20 or 25 per cent?</P>
    <P>Can we put on record in this House this evening that every person in Ireland in receipt of the small farmers' dole unemployment assistance will be granted the entire amount?  The Minister's budget speech gave the impression not alone to me but to many others who read it that if any recipients of the farmers' dole wanted to get an increase there would have to be an income test.  Let nobody read too much into Senator Kitt's comment, when he alleges I made the point that there could be a spot check on anybody who did not apply for the increase.  I want to go on record as saying that there is no shortage of spot checks in this area.  At several Garda barracks in the west it has been known that an inspector from the Department&mdash;or as we call him, an officer connected with the Department, either as a pension officer or otherwise&mdash;has been meeting folk on their way to sign for the dole or to collect the dole, and that in-depth assessments have been made.</P>
    <P>To reply to the Fianna Fáil group in Galway County Council, it is true that for a Government supposed to have in their ranks the greatest number of small farmers in Ireland, since Fianna Fáil took office several thousand farmers have been disqualified from the dole.  In the last budget between 5,000 and 6,000 were taken off it altogether.  I find it very difficult to understand any party getting terribly concerned about the so-called comments made about this subject because, as I read the Minister's speech, this is the way these people will have to be assessed.  Spot checks are part and parcel of the present situation as any Senator or Deputy who lives or works in the west is well aware, from a constituency point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> The whole question of social welfare is a very loosely tangled area because so many different types have to be helped. It is true that over the years successive Governments have done their very best to ensure that there is a reasonable spread of this benefit to the people who need it most.  Nevertheless, like all policies, there are black spots in the service. For one reason or another there are people who should be entitled to these benefits but for some unknown reasons they do not seem to be able to get them.</P>
    <P>I find the officials of the Department most co-operative but for some reason, maybe because of a bad postal service or bad communications, there seems to be too long a delay in regard to some people getting their benefits.  I am specifically speaking about persons who have no other income, for instance, people who might have to go on disability with medical certificates.  I never heard of more certificates getting lost between the post and the Department as happened in the last six or eight months. This is causing genuine hardship to the individuals concerned.  It is fair to say that once the documentation is in order, the Department officials at all levels are most helpful but nevertheless it often happens that several weeks elapse before a person gets the money he is entitled to. All one hopes is that the service will be improved to such a degree that that will be stamped out as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I welcome the increases. It is important that the people who are in most need are looked after. One would hope that the inflation rate might not rise too high so that before the next budget those increases will be reasonably meaningful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the new Minister into the House, and the provisions made in this new Bill.  For the first time in a long time we have a situation where we have a 25 per cent increase in long-term benefits which, irrespective of what happens this year in inflation terms, will mean a genuine and definite increase in the amount of money that old age pensioners and long-term beneficiaries will have in their hands at <Col N="1244" /> the end of any particular week.  We have an increase of 20 per cent in short-term benefits, and short-term beneficiaries are as entitled to an increase as the long-term beneficiaries.  The long-term beneficiaries are the people we should be concerned about more than the short-term beneficiaries, because they are the people who cannot help themselves. They are not people who work.  They are out of work because of social, economic and health circumstances.  They have lost their jobs because they are sick, they got too old or they are just not able to cope with the job they have been doing. At last there is an attempt being made to help these people.  In helping them I sincerely hope the delays in the provision of the services they need will be shortened.</P>
      <P>We can stand up here and talk about lack of money, but we do not have the same lack of money as a person who is waiting for his social welfare cheque on a Friday morning and has no money in the house.  If there are three or four kids shouting, a wife or a husband shouting, and if there is no money in the house they have to go to the local shop and look for credit.  They come to a local advice centre, a TD or councillor.  He phones the Department of Social Welfare and they say &ldquo;The computer has not processed that today,&rdquo; and when the computer processes the cheque it will go through.  A computer process is of absolutely no use to a person who is waiting for £5 or £15 when he owes £20 to a shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the civil servants who operate social welfare schemes are not doing their best, but there is a definite difference between a civil servant in his office who is being paid monthly, who has a permanent job, who has a pension waiting for him at the end of a particular period, of a TD or Senator who has a salary waiting for him at the end of a month, and a social welfare beneficiary.  At the end of any week we do not have to wait for our salaries because we can get credit in a shop but a person waiting for a social welfare benefit cheque will not get credit in a shop.  These people are suffering <Col N="1245" /> from a lack of understanding in the civil service, in the computerised era that we are living in.</P>
    <P>People come to clinics, whether they be political clinics, welfare clinics or any other type of clinic.  They do not have the money to pay the rent, the rates, or even for bread and butter.  They go to the people who have the money to do that.  I suggest that our social welfare system be changed to a reasonable system.  For example, there should be a computer terminal in Kilkenny so that if a person living in Kilkenny does not get his cheque he should be able to go into a computer bureau in Kilkenny and tie into the computer in Dublin if the computer is at fault, and there should be a reply immediately. That would be a much better system than having somebody write or phone 786444, the telephone number most used by TDs, Senators, county councillors and social welfare beneficiaries.  It is also the most abused number, in the sense that there is absolutely no way you can get through unless you have some sort of system whereby you keep it ringing.  There is a new computerised system based in Ennis where you dial 786444 and it will keep ringing until such time as the phone is answered, but there are very few people who can afford to keep ringing 786444 from a telephone box in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill is an improvement on anything that has happened in the past, but it cannot work unless the communications system between the person who needs the benefit and the Department is improved.  I sincerely hope that in line with the benefits provided in this Bill there will be an improvement in communications between the prospective beneficiaries and the Department.</P>
    <P>People feeling desperate come to my clinic because they do not have one solitary penny in their pockets.  We try to get through to the Department, and they say the computer has not processed the cheque.  The fact the computer has not processed the cheque does not mean anything to the person who does not have one solitary pound of butter or loaf <Col N="1246" /> of bread in his hand.  We send these people to the community welfare officer. The community welfare officers throughout the country are doing a magnificent job in providing a buffer between the computer in the Department of Social Welfare and the people who need the benefit.  These people deserve a lot more credit than they get because sometimes they get a lot of criticism which they do not deserve.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for improvement in services It provides for improvements in actual returns for the people who need it. I plead with the Minister and the Department to ensure that there will be an extension, a speeding up of the provision of the actual cash benefit to the people who need it, rather than an extension of the amount of paper work that flows between the Minister's office and public representatives or the needy people and the Department's representatives.  In other words, we have a Bill which provides for extension and increase in monetary value.  Let us get this monetary value through immediately to the people who deserve it.  This is one of the best Bills I have seen come through this House.  All I ask is that the benefits get to the people who need them much faster than they have in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their congratulations, their good wishes, and for their very wide-ranging contributions.  In the time available they covered quite an amount in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard made a fairly wide-ranging contribution and some of his points were taken up by other Senators subsequently.  Senator Howard welcomed the modest increases and minor improvements.  I felt that he might have gone on and said what he really thought&mdash;that they were good increases and good improvements.  The increases are substantial and the amounts provided are catching up.  I accept what he says about the need to have substantial improvements in the total amounts, but this Bill goes a considerable way <Col N="1247" /> towards catching up.  Beyond that I agree with what he and other Senators said about bringing particularly the long-term benefits up to the levels we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to forget that there are some novel features in our social welfare schemes which do not exist elsewhere.  Some people who returned from England, for instance, claimed that things have improved a great deal here in recent times, and novel features like the free telephone rental, free television licence, electricity allowance and the free travel arrangements, which are paid for by the Department of Social Welfare, are good and help the total package.  I am not saying that in any way to take from the general point, but at the same time we should realise the value in what we have.  I agree that this policy of making substantial increases is one that we would like to be able to continue.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned reducing the qualifying age for old age pensions from 66 to 65 years.  Senator Kitt stole my thunder by pointing out it would cost £12 million to do this.  Needless to say, this is something we would like to do, and it is a matter which will be further considered within the resources available.  The cost is actually £12.8 million.  This has to be considered in relation to priorities.  We have reduced the age for the blind person's pension from 21 to 18 years.  We would all like to see increases in long-term benefits and other measures in the future, and we will be looking for the resources to do this.  In relation to the means limit, the upper limit is increased.  I accept there is a complicated mechanism in operation, but it is a costly mechanism.  That is an aspect that I had to argue in putting the point.  In effect, it increases the upper limit from £17 to £23.  This is a reasonably substantial improvement and I hope that the improvements can continue.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the fuel scheme.  This is a limited scheme.  It is operated by certain local <Col N="1248" /> authorities at present and is subject to review.  My predecessor introduced a new principle.  The new principle in that sense was, I believe, a breakthrough.  It introduced the voucher scheme as an alternative measure, and I would like to build on this coming into the review for next autumn.  We will be undertaking a review in that instance and also looking at the possibility of extending the scheme more widely.  We hope to revise the scheme by next winter.  My predecessor did a good deal of work in this area and I would hope to continue the review of the scheme and that there may be resources to go a good deal further.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard and other Senators raised the question of delays for applicants in getting benefits from the Department of Social Welfare.  Last year's strike created enormous problems for the Department of Social Welfare. There were 860,000 people involved, and when you run into a situation like the postal dispute it created problems for the Department.  I would like to pay tribute to the staff for the way they overcame these problems, which they dealt with in an excellent way.  Those problems continued because there was a spill-over which continued to have an effect up to Christmas.  The biggest problem arises in relation to situations where the means have to be assessed, particularly where land transfers are involved.</P>
    <P>Many cases which were referred to me by Deputies and rural Deputies in particular, relate to the assessment of means where the local pensions committee and a land transfer is involved.  There is a statutory requirement to have a transfer authenticated before finalising the means assessment.  In many instances you find that these particularly prolonged delays relate to some technicality like that. Nevertheless, I accept the general point in relation to the service.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan made some very interesting points on the supplementary welfare scheme and the fact that this is operated by the health boards.  The emphasis from the Department to the health boards is to be liberal in the scheme as it is a fall-back situation.  I <Col N="1249" /> am very glad Senator Lanigan congratulated the boards, because many of the people involved do an excellent job. It is not always as satisfactory as I would like to see it, but that was the intention of the scheme and one would like to see it operating effectively.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, he made a general point about computer delays.  The computer is generally very fast doing calculations. The biggest delays occur in getting things to the computer and getting them back.  He also raised the question of the regionalisation of the system.  I will give serious consideration to that in whatever respect it is applicable, but it is not always as readily applicable as it appears.  I accept that there can be delays when there are postal systems involved.  In relation to some of the rural complaints we pursued, we found there were more delays getting the cheques to people in rural areas than there were in Dublin.  I am concerned about that.  Senator Lanigan called for an improved communications system.  This is something which, within the Department, is being improved currently.  The whole computerisation system is being advanced. The Senator introduced the concept of regionalisation and this is something I am particularly interested in.  I note that he would like to see a computer link in Kilkenny especially.  In all of these things, one has to do a work study and look at what is happening and see what the most effective system is.  In the Department there is quite a concern to be efficient in that respect and to get the payments made in good time.</P>
    <P>I also spent time with staff in the Department who deal with the frontline, officers who are meeting the people.  I had discussions with them about their experiences and the kinds of delays which can occur.  We try to make more effective the actual face of the Department which meets people at the desks or booths to which they go.  I found the discussions to be very rewarding in the sense that people who are on the job could identify some of the points which can cause delays, which are not as obvious <Col N="1250" /> when one looks at the system as a whole.  I accept that that must be a priority, and it is something we will give attention to.</P>
    <P>The other aspects raised by some of the Senators in relation to means tests, and particularly those in relation to rural situations, relate to the fact that there have not been contributory schemes available.  I am concerned about that, and I am working with considerable urgency on the examination of the question of a national income related pension scheme.  What we can bring from it remains to be seen.  As you know, a study was carried out and a paper was produced some years ago.  I asked that work in this area be accelerated within the Department and we are working at it to see what can be done.  The problem in this area becomes one of very large scale cost.  It is the kind of thing which, in the medium and longer term will do a great deal to do away with many of these means situations.  I would like to see that happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding welcomed the Bill, especially the increases in the children's allowances.  As one might expect, because of her interest in handicapped people, she also welcomed the reduction in the qualifying age from 21 to 18 years as a priority for blind persons, and the increases in the allowances for the disabled and for unmarried mothers.  These are particularly welcome and, as I have said, it is a process which I would certainly like to continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte also acknowledged the increases and would like to see this kind of priority continuing.  I accept what he said about social welfare increases only catching up and we will certainly try to maintain that process.  If one takes it that the consumer price index increase was 16 per cent and that the increase in long-term benefits amounts to 31 per cent, then there has been a fair effort at catching up at this stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte raised particularly the question of the Poverty Committee and there has been a certain amount of confusion <Col N="1251" /> about the actual position.  It is the EEC programme to combat poverty, which is due to terminate on 1 December 1980.  Taking the shorter period into account, the financial allocation to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty for 1980 represents, in fact, a slight increase on that for 1979. The committee have been informed of their allocation and I understand they are examining the situation.  The figure of £500,000 which has been allocated for the Poverty Committee for this 11-month period is an increase of £2,250 on the figure for last year.</P>
    <P>The committee were asked on 26 February to submit the restructured budget to consider the position and to submit their views in that respect.  Once these views are submitted they can be considered and I will be quite happy to meet the committee and discuss the priorities in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt raised the question in the Athenry Day Centre and congratulated the people of Athenry for the work they are doing in relation to that day centre for elderly people and for others as well. I am glad he raised it because it brought up the whole question of attacking poverty in our society and the structure which has developed.  Senator Harte said that for years there has been this question of catching up and he is not satisfied that radical changes are being introduced. One of the most worthwhile radical approaches is to combat poverty directly on the ground and in the community and by setting up the infrastructures within the community to ensure that poverty will not be allowed to happen. It happens for many reasons other than cash.  If the educational and support systems are not there it will not be possible to break out of the cycle.  I would see the emphasis on the voluntary community activity as a particularly important one in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt also saw the need for a geriatric home in his own area and emphasised the benefits of the increases in the prescribed relative allowances <Col N="1252" /> which will be very useful.  I agree with him in that respect and I would like to see these increased further so that as many elderly people as possible can be maintained in their home and community environment and will not be pushed off into separate homes which are very often distant from their own original home and community.</P>
    <P>He and Senator Connaughton raised the matter of smallholders' unemployment assistance.  It is important to make it clear what the position is in relation to this scheme and Senator Connaughton asked if I would do so.  He asked if all persons will get an increase.  Yes, that is true.  The October increases were due to finish on 31 March and are now being continued and all recipients, whether they are on the notional or factual assessment, will continue to get that increase. That was an additional allocation in the budget and the resources had to be provided to maintain that increase, which was given under the national understanding as an over-winter six-month increase.  It is now being continued and everybody will have increases.  The notional cases will continue as they are at present, and the factual cases will receive the 20 per cent.  There are 3,000 smallholders who have opted for factual assessment and they will get this 20 per cent increase.  It is important to be clear that the smallholder can choose whichever form of assessment, notional or factual, will be of greater benefit to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton said that if the smallholder does not look for an increase he will be looked on with suspicion and may find himself on spotcheck lists. There is no question of that whatsoever; he must realise that these notional schemes are highly concessional in their nature.  When they were introduced the figures increased from 8,000 to 30,000, and that is an indication of the value of opting for the notional system which was involved at the time.  There has been a progressive development over the last few years to increase the multipliers on the one hand and to introduce factual assessment and also to freeze notionally assessed rates.  The rates for persons <Col N="1253" /> over £10 poor law valuation have already been frozen in previous years. There is nothing new in that sense and there is no Machiavellian trick involved. This is just a continuation of a process which has been going on.</P>
    <P>No reflections whatsoever will be cast on any smallholder who opts to continue on the notional system, nor will any spot checks be carried out on smallholders merely because they do not opt for factual assessment and wish to remain on the notional system.  That whole suggestion is completely untrue.  The intention is that the maximum amount of resources available to the State will go to the people who need them most and that people who have benefits and concessions, like the notional system, can opt to stay on that system.  On the other hand, 3,000 of the 21,000 who are now in the scheme have changed to factual assessment.  It is open to people who feel they will lose under the present arrangement to change to factual assessment and to receive the 20 per cent increase which applies there.</P>
    <P>There was a question asked about unemployment assistance and the difference between the rural and urban rates.  This is something which has been there historically.  It derived originally from the fact that a large proportion of the rural recipients were either smallholders or relatives assisting on farms who could normally acquire the basic necessities of food and sometimes fuel at less cost than in the urban areas.  This was the traditional situation.  I certainly will ensure that the points made by Senators in relation to the rural and urban rates are considered before the next Bill is brought to the House.  The differential at this stage is, of course, quite a small one.</P>
    <P>The increases granted in this Bill are substantial.  Most Senators have conceded that.  They are weighted in favour of long-term recipients which is a change influencing the structural position, yet the short-term recipients more than keep pace by having their benefits increased by 20 per cent.  This is a policy issue as far as the Government <Col N="1254" /> are concerned.  There would be those who would have expected lesser benefits especially in the unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit schemes, but the Government's policy here is to ensure that those who are genuinely unemployed and genuinely in need will do more than keep pace as far as that is possible.</P>
    <P>The children's allowance increase will result in a real gain, a real benefit.  This will be the second year in which real benefits have been provided on children's allowances.  There are in addition numerous other smaller improvements which are particularly important to the recipients, for example, the reduction of the blind person's qualifying age.  The total cash allocated in this Bill is £90 million, and that is a substantial transfer of resources which is necessary and very desirable.</P>
    <P>It is important to attack the structures underlying poverty and help the people who are in greater need.  I was glad to see that Senator Kitt raised the question of voluntary community work, because I believe that this can have a very major lasting effect in combating need, loneliness and poverty within our society.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed, to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 75, it is deemed to have passed First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport <Col N="1255" /> of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators.  I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of a list of the amendments made by the Dáil.  As Members are aware, they may speak only once.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill had its origins in the Seanad and all the spadework has been done by my predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I am pleased to make my debut in the Seanad to complete the good work that he started.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Bill, 1979, was passed recently by Dáil Éireann.  During its passage through the Dáil 92 amendments as shown on the list accompanying the green print of the Bill were agreed to.  Most of the amendments were introduced as a result of views expressed by Deputies during the course of debate or following the receipt of submissions about the Bill from interested organisations. The purport of these amendments is as follows:</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 57 are amendments to the Foyle Fisheries Acts and have the effect of enabling authorised persons to lie in wait for possible poachers on the banks of rivers. Heretofore authorised persons had power only to enter and pass along the banks of rivers and the Foyle Acts were successfully challenged in this area in recent times.  It is necessary therefore to amend the Acts to rectify this omission.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Bill, 1979, as passed by this House contained the usual provisions covering the disqualification of Members of the Oireachtas from membership of or employment by the central or regional boards.  It is necessary to apply a similar disqualification to members of the European Parliament, and that is the purport of amendments Nos. 2, 3, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 61, 63, and 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> It has been decided to define a strokehaul because lack of a definition has raised problems in court from time to time resulting in failure to secure convictions and that is the purport of amendment No. 5.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 11 will enable the central board to continue the important research on certain species of sea fish which is being carried on at present by the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>There was not provision in all cases for the repeal or amendment of orders made under the Bill and this has now been provided for in amendments Nos. 7, 16, 22, 37 and 38.</P>
    <P>The Bill as passed by this House stipulated that the Principal Act was repealed to the extent specified in the First Schedule to the Bill.  The date of effect of the repeal as the Bill then stood was the date of enactment of the Bill, but this required to be altered to the appointed day so as to continue the present arrangements until the new boards are established.  There are, however, two specific provisions in the First Schedule which require to be brought into effect on the date of enactment of the Bill and amendment No. 8 regularises the position.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 17 provide for the preparation and submission of development programmes within two years of the setting up of the new boards and of subsequent programmes at least once in every five years.  Originally preparation and submission of yearly programmes were envisaged but it was decided, in deference to views expressed in the Dáil, to provide for more flexible longer term planning.  Budgets will be submitted annually.</P>
    <P>The central board are enabled pursuant to amendment No. 10 to charge fees for promotional services.  It was already empowered to charge fees for services covering the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of fisheries.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 71 are textual amendments arising out of the necessity to refer specifically to Rosnalee Weir which is an adjunct to Mallow Hatchery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are technical amendments making it clear that the indictable provision contained in section 46 of the Bill is in addition to and not in substitution for the provision contained in section 309(1) of the Principal Act which provides for summary hearing of any fishery offence.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation it is necessary, when a foreign sea-fishing boat is being charged with an infringement of fishery legislation, to obtain certificates from each of the twelve registrars of ships around our coast to the effect that the vessel in question is not registered as an Irish sea-fishing boat.  The procedure involved in complying with this requirement is tedious and the resultant delay often causes problems for the State.  The purport of amendment No. 25 is to eliminate the need for the production of such certificates.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 includes &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; in the categories of people who may prosecute fishery offences in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 50 of the Bill as passed by this House provided for the revision of certain penalties under the Principal Act and the Act of 1962.  There was provision for the payment of a fine of £500 plus £50 for each salmon and £5 for each other fish involved, in respect of offences against certain sections.  Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 increase the fine for each &ldquo;other fish&rdquo; from £5 to £10.</P>
    <P>Section 51 as passed by this House contained provisions for disqualification for three years of a person from holding a commercial fishing licence on conviction of a third fishery offence of a prescribed character.  Amendment No. 30 has the effect of disqualifying a person following conviction for a second offence of a prescribed character.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 provides for the payment of part of fines imposed by a court, as compensation in respect of loss or damage incurred in connection with interference with or trespass on an aquaculture installation.</P>
    <P>The power of authorised officers to <Col N="1258" /> take a boat to port is now related to a boat believed to contain illegally caught fish as distinct from illegally caught salmon.  Amendment No. 32 will strengthen the power of authorised officers in combating illegal fishing for all species of fish.</P>
    <P>The reference to the use of firearms in exercising the power to take a boat to port has been removed by amendment No. 33.  The section still empowers an authorised officer to use such force as is necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 53 of the Bill as passed by this House contained several references to &ldquo;an authorised person or persons&rdquo;. These should have read &ldquo;an authorised officer or officers&rdquo; as these are the descriptions used in the Principal Act. This is the purport of amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 36.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 39, 40, 42 and 45 enable the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to grant a licence without fee to engage in aquaculture to persons who are at present lawfully so engaged.  There is provision for appeal to the arbitrator concerning the refusal or grant of such a licence.  These amendments were introduced in deference to representations made by persons holding oyster beds under old charters.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the Bill as passed by this House provided for a fine of £500 on summary conviction and £2,000 on conviction on indictment for trespass or interference with a fish farm.  In deference to representation made by fish farmers amendments Nos. 43 and 44 were introduced in the Dáil, the effect of which is to provide for jail sentences as well as fines in both summary and indictable cases involving trespass or interference with fish farms.</P>
    <P>The Bill as passed by this House did not empower the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to demand from persons paying the first sales levy information other than weight of fish handled and price paid.  The obligation to record additional information could be important, and amendment No. 48 provides for this.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49 provides for the prohibition by order of the sale of certain kinds of fish or rod caught fish.  This <Col N="1259" /> would enable the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to implement proposals to ban the sale of rod caught salmon after the closing of the commercial fishing season or to introduce a complete ban on the sale of sea trout.  Such proposals are under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 50 provides for the prohibition by order of the sale of certain types of net.  This will help to stop at source dealings in monofilament nets, the use of which in salmon fishing is illegal.</P>
    <P>Section 59 of the Bill as passed by this House entitled anyone who is registered in the Register of Trout, Coarse Fish and Sea Anglers to fish in any fisheries owned or occupied by the regional board by whom the register is maintained or in any central board fisheries.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 51 has the effect of empowering the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, the Commissioners of Public Works or the Land Commissioners to exclude from the provisions of section 59 any fisheries which will be transferred to the central board by either the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, the Office of Public Works or the Land Commission.  Any fisheries acquired direct by the central board may also be excluded from these provisions.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 52 deletes subsection (4) of section 20 of the Principal Act from the repeals listed in the First Schedule to the Bill and substitutes instead a new subsection (4) which enables the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to define the boundaries of the fishery districts at sea.</P>
    <P>The Bill as passed by this House provided that a warrant issued under section 297 of the Principal Act allowed an authorised person to enter and search a particular garden, dwelling-house or curtilage.  It was considered desirable that an extension of these powers was necessary so as to allow any structure or building in such a garden or curtilage to be entered and searched also.  Amendment No. 54 provides for this.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 19 of the 1962 Act specifies that a certificate under <Col N="1260" /> the hand of a registrar of ships in the State that a boat specified in the certificate is not registered as an Irish sea-fishing boat shall be conclusive evidence that the boat is not so registered.  The Attorney General has stated that the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; in this context could be held to be unconstitutional and he has advised that the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; should be substituted.  Amendment No. 56 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 58 is to ensure that where any sections of the Principal Act, which are extended to the Moville Area, are amended in this Bill, the amendments will also extend to the Moville Area.  The Moville Area is the portion of this country which forms part of Foyle Area, which Area is administered by the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 62 and 64, the number of members to be appointed to the central board by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is being increased from &ldquo;four&rdquo; to &ldquo;not less than four or more than six&rdquo;.  This is to enable the Minister to ensure that all interests are represented on that board.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 66 and 69 deal with representation at central board meetings.  Regional boards are empowered to nominate a substitute to attend meetings of the central board in any case where the chairman of a regional board is incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties as a member of the central board.  This will ensure that every regional board can at all times be represented at central board meetings.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 68 empowers the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service to pay an allowance to the chairmen of the regional boards.  The attention of my predecessor was drawn to the fact that the chairmen of the regional boards would have to devote a considerable amount of time to dealing with the affairs of their own boards and that in addition they would have to attend meetings of the central board.  The point was made that they should therefore be paid an allowance and this is accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> The expressions &ldquo;coarse fish&rdquo; and &ldquo;consequential disqualification order&rdquo; had not hitherto been used in Fisheries legislation and they are not therefore defined in the Principal Act or in the Act of 1962.  As these expressions are used in this Bill they must therefore be defined and amendment No. 72 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The wording in the adaptation of the licensing provisions in the Principal Act to enable regional boards to issue licences was defective in some minor respects.  Amendments Nos. 73, 74, 75, 84 and 85 remedy the position.</P>
    <P>It is provided under amendment No. 76 that officers of the central board may be appointed as authorised persons under the Fisheries Acts.  This will enable these officers to carry out protection duties if required.</P>
    <P>The powers of staffs of regional boards who are authorised officers were limited to their own regions but amendment No. 78 provides for the exercise by such officers of their powers in any other fisheries region provided the regional board of that region so agrees.  This will facilitate the drafting of protection staff into any additional region where the prevailing circumstances may require such action to be taken.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 79 and 86 provide that authorised persons may lie in wait for poachers on the banks of any lakes or rivers, frequented by any species of fish.  This will aid protection officers in combating poaching.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 81, 82 and 83 include fyke nets for eels in the list of scheduled engines set out in the Fourth Schedule of the Principal Act and fixes the licence duty therefor.  Until recently fyke nets were used primarily for experimental purposes but their use as a commercial fishing engine is becoming common and the number of applications in my Department for authorisations to use such nets for commercial purposes is on the increase.  Consequently the time has come to designate this type of net as a commercial engine and thereby entitle the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to fix the licence duty in the same way as <Col N="1262" /> in the case of other scheduled engines. At present the licence duty for fyke nets is fixed by the relevant Board of Conservators with the approval of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>Section 301 (2) of the Principal Act sets out the powers of search, inspection and examination held by authorised officers in connection with their investigations in regard to fish suspected of having been illegally caught.  The section is defective in that the authorised officer is not empowered to search the various business premises listed in the section. Amendments Nos. 80 and 88 remedy the defect.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 89, 90 and 91 provide that when the owner of a fishery proposed to be acquired by the central board cannot be found, the fishery may be acquired notwithstanding the fact that such owner has not been found or ascertained. It was considered desirable that such a provision should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments of a purely technical nature were also introduced during the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  I understand that this Bill was debated very constructively by the Members of this House and as a result was substantially improved before its introduction to the Dáil.  The final form of the Bill as Senators see it today is I hope a true reflection of the wishes of the two Houses and, in fact, of all people interested in fisheries, and Senators are to be thanked for their contributions towards this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  I am sure all the Senators on this side of the House wish him well and the best of luck.  We welcome these amendments.  I certainly feel they will be of great benefit to the Act.  We hope that the new board will get on to the ground as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see in amendments Nos. 62 and 64 that the Minister is prepared to ensure that the people who are interested in fishing will get representation <Col N="1263" /> on the board.  The main thing is the preservation of fish stock, particularly of salmon.  I agree that the penalties are very heavy in amendments Nos. 28 and 29.  Are they heavy enough to ensure that the stocks will be preserved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Reynolds in welcoming the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  I am one of the Members of this House very interested in the amendments to this Bill. It is very important.  We have a new Minister.  My assessment of him is that his approach to any business is a positive one.  That is the only approach we can have to this Fisheries Bill with any hope of making a positive response. That is very basically essential to make any progress.</P>
      <P>The amendments are a clear indication that the Bill has received wide consideration. It is essential after the Bill is passed that there be proper follow-up. There are special difficulties as to the enforcement of the Bill.  I will not go into all of them.  The region has a special problem, and that adds to the difficulty of implementing this Bill.  I would hope that due consideration will be given to that aspect of the problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to the amendments.  Amendments Nos. 9 and 17 provide for the preparation and submission of the development programme. That is essential.  If they are seen to have that kind of input and interest they will get the proper response.  The Foyle Fisheries have been left hanging on a survival principle far too long.  This has resulted in poor results.  We hope that tomorrow will bring some solution and that we can deal more easily with the problem.  I am glad to know that the Minister has the courage to provide for a development programme.  That indicates a healthy, positive approach.  I am very pleased to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 29, which was referred to by Senator Reynolds, provides for the payment of fines of £500 plus £50 for each salmon caught. Is it a sufficient deterrent?  While nobody <Col N="1264" /> can have the perfect answer I am all for having it stated absolutely that the Government will discourage poaching on the River Foyle.  The consequences are disastrous if it is not stopped.  Are the penalties provided under this section sufficient? We have also to take into consideration that we have two very substantial rivers leading off the Foyle, the Mourne and the Finnel.  The price of allowing poachers to continue here is too high to pay.  I ask that a very close watch be kept on the number of people who are caught, the number fined and back in business.  When we consider the price of salmon £500 is not a serious fine.  A person might get £500 in a couple of hours in one night if he was lucky enough.  If he paid his fine he might not be caught the next night.  We have got to be practical about this thing.  Five hundred pounds is not a serious amount.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 removes the use of firearms in taking a boat to port, and I welcome that very much.  I admit that I was unaware that such powers existed in the Foyle Fisheries Act.  I welcome its removal, because firearms have been used.  We are on a very dangerous road if in fact we have a State where the Garda have to use firearms.  If any section of the people who enforce the law are empowered to carry arms to enforce the law, that would be contrary to the whole principle of maintaining law and order within the the State.  It makes it easier for people to come out clearly and speak against those who are poaching.</P>
    <P>Everybody is involved in the preservation of our fisheries.  It is a major interest, not a sectional interest at all.  I am glad to see that the firearms provision is removed.  I would like to see this getting as much publicity as possible.  Therefore, having removed that provision the State will now be able to prosecute those who are found on boats with firearms.  I am very pleased with that provision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49, which prohibits the sale of certain kinds of fish whether caught by rod or caught by net, is a very good provision.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 50 prohibits the offer for sale of certain types of nets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> It might be easier to legislate than to implement the legislation, because we have to recognise that we are dealing with the water that is the border line between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties.  That presents a very special problem in so far as it is not too difficult to buy a net on one side of the Border and evade the provisions that are intended under section 50.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind the special problem that he has under this section.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to amendment No. 52 which enables the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to define the boundaries of fishery districts at sea. This presents a special problem in so far as where the Foyle enters the sea has been a source of trouble for quite a long time.  I hope that the Minister is aware of the difficulties that face him in the implementation of this legislation here and faces the Foyle Fishery Commission, and that special care is taken to make sure that we implement legislation as it is intended here.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 62 and 64 enable the Minister to widen the number of people acting on the board, to not fewer than four and not more than six; so that all interests will be covered on the board. That is a very welcome development in so far as that the special interests and problems of the area call for fairly wide representation to be on any board that will get full and proper support to enable them to be effective.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 79 and 86 provide that authorised persons may lie in wait for poachers on the banks of lakes and rivers.  In this case it is very difficult to implement because we have had a tradition here in this area in that people have been poaching and they have nearly felt it was patriotic to poach because they were challenging the divided authority.  It is a special problem.  It is one of the areas about which it will be easier to get the legislation passed than to act on it on the ground.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House and the Minister that he will have the maximum support in the introduction and implementation <Col N="1266" /> of this legislation.  Any of us who are seriously interested in the improvement and preservation of our fisheries can only have that attitude.  I only hope that the Bill will be successful in bringing about improved control of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>There is a special problem again in so far as the Foyle Fisheries Commission fish themselves.  This is always put forward as an excuse by those who are poaching to say that the Foyle Fisheries Commission are counting fish and checking on fish, but they have a fishery business.  This will be one of the problems that the Minister and his new board should look at.  I certainly welcome this.  The Minister's speech goes further in explaining the amendments and is very useful to me.  I am very happy with the Bill.  I am delighted that it is coming in, and I wish the Minister success in its implementation and guarantee him maximum support.</P>

      <P>I would also like to refer to amendments Nos. 1 and 57 and support what Senator McGowan has said concerning the relevance of these amendments to the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the problems that arise in relation to declining salmon stocks.  Senator McGowan lives in the area and he knows the situation.  Every Member of the House should know the situation concerning the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the need for tightening up the regulations and legislation as is done in these amendments because the annual reports which are laid before the House have shown how the salmon stocks have declined drastically over the last 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we are prepared not only to put teeth in our legislation, but when we have got that legislation on the Statute Book to enforce it, then the fate of the salmon, the Foyle Fisheries and the many other fisheries which this Bill refers to will be gloomy indeed.  I welcome any amendments such as Nos. 1 and 57 to tighten up the regulations regarding the Foyle Fisheries enabling authorised persons to lie in wait and to catch poachers.  The Minister has to be <Col N="1267" /> encouraged to put the legislation into effect when it becomes statutory.</P>

      <P>On this Stage I just want to make a comment on section 54 which bears the benefit of a whole range of amendments, Nos. 39 to 45.  These amendments now put the section in a very satisfactory state as far as those engaged in the business of aquaculture are concerned.  I would like to thank the Minister and his predecessor for what they have done in that context.  They have made it much more secure for people of enterprise to invest their money and carry on this business.  Any person who now interferes with anything being done pursuant to an aquaculture licence is guilty of an offence punishable by the stronger penalties now provided for.  I had been worried when the Bill was before the Seanad that, without that, the common law provision about larceny might be very defective in relation to fish, which if they were still swimming about even in sea cages might possibly have been regarded as wild animals whom nobody could steal.  This section makes the position much more secure.  In any case I have since got better advice about the common law, which is that if these wild animals are reclaimed and are put in confinement in a sea cage, they are then deemed to be in the possession of their owner and the normal rules as to larceny apply.  I commend these amendments and the other amendments in the Bill.  I have a further short comment to make which, since it centres on the administration of the Bill and the Lough Sheelin position, is appropriate to the Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>Senator Reynolds and Senator Maloney asked if the penalties were heavy enough.  I hope they are, and if they are not we will increase them; we have the power to do that.  We have a climate of opinion at large today with regard to conservation, that demands conservation and I get the impression that we will all work towards that end.  When I ask for the co-operation of the Members of the House in relation to conservation, I wish to co-operate with them too, and will not be found wanting in introducing any measures which they suggest that would improve the situation.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowen complimented amendments 9 and 17 which deal with development programmes with the boards.  These will be good; they will set out the development programmes and we can compare notes with different regions and come up with possibly the best solutions, and one region can learn from another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan was very concerned with regard to poaching on the River Foyle.  My intention is to show no mercy to poachers.  Decent law abiding people will find this Bill encouraging.  It will be conclusive to keeping the law, and I hope that those who are tempted to break the law will find it discouraging.  We will continue to discourage them.  We do not propose to use firearms, as can be seen in the amendment, but we have the authority to use such force as is necessary.  Senator McGowan brought to my notice the peculiar problem in the Foyle, being an area of dual jurisdiction. We have representatives from our Department in the Foyle Fisheries Commission. We are aware of the problem, and I will endeavour to meet my Northern counterparts to discuss all <Col N="1269" /> aspects of our joint problem.  Poaching under the guise of pseudo-patriotism will find no place in our fishery programme.</P>
    <P>Senator West re-echoed the fears about the salmon.  Táim buíoch leis an Seanactóir Whitaker as ucht an fáilte a thug sé liom.  His reference to aquaculture is necessary.  It is a new departure and very important, with great possibilities, and there is a certain amount of insecurity among promoters. I hope the Bill will help to dispel that. The Senator mentioned that some people might look upon wild fish in cages as fair game.  I remember something similar happened to domestic ducks that strayed more than 100 yards from the house at home and they were shot.  I hope that will not happen to the fish in the cages.  I thank Senator Mulcahy for his kind remarks.</P>

      <P>I want to raise on the Final Stage the very serious problem in Lough Sheelin, and I want to ask the Minister if he really feels that the legislation which we are now discussing and which we hope will shortly become law is sufficient and has enough teeth to deal with it.  I was particularly pleased that, within the past few days, the Minister visited the troubled areas and has seen the tragic situation for himself&mdash;and tragic is the word&mdash;which has occurred there.  Very briefly the problem is a problem of growth and algae on the surface which is now practically covering one of our most famous lakes.  The optimists say that instant, swift and stern action may save the lake and bring it back to its position as one of the great fishing lakes of Europe. I am not in a position to make a judgment but I do know, and I think the Minister will agree with me, that the problem has been caused by slurry disposal in the region around the lake and I want to know whether the legislation we <Col N="1270" /> have is sufficiently strong to deal with this problem.  It is not a question of doubt in this case.  A scientific study has been made covering Lough Sheelin and its surrounding areas and without any doubt it has attributed the present crisis, the eutrophication problem, the growth of algae on the surface of the lake so that it practically covers the whole surface, to the dumping of slurry which has occurred since 1971.  Its occurrence is mainly due to intensive pig production in the surrounding counties and the dumping of slurry from intensive pig farming and, to a certain extent, from intensive cattle farming in the area.  The problem was considered by the Agricultural Institute and they recommended that storage facilities should be provided to hold slurry produce in the period September to April and that the slurry should only be disposed of by land spreading at specific loadings during the remaining period.  These recommendations have been followed by some of the producers in the area but unfortunately not by all and the situation has deteriorated.  I would like to quote one paragraph from the report of the scientific study by Mr. Trevor Champ.</P>

      <P>I quote from the report by Mr. Trevor Champ:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of increased turbidity, sunlight has been cut off from the rooted vegetation in relatively deep areas of the lake.  These plants which <Col N="1271" /> provided food and shelter for a big number of organisms important in the diet of trout, are now confined to shallower zones.  Emerging insects indicative of clean water conditions, which were widespread in the lake prior to 1971, are now confined to a specific area....</P>
    <P>The extra load imposed on the lake by the introduction of intensive pig fattening (and to a lesser extent cattle production) must be reduced.  Since repeated recourse must be had to disposal (little more than dumping) of slurry during the winter months, it is evident that controlled land spreading during the growing season is not a workable proposition in the Sheelin area.  This method of slurry disposal must cease and some alternative means be introduced forthwith.</P>
    <P>That, in a nutshell, is the problem.  I want to ask the Minister if the Bill before us can deal with this problem and if the Minister intends, instantly, to take the strongest possible action so that one of the lakes which was justly known as one of the great brown trout fishing lakes of Europe can be restored, even at this very late stage, to its former glory.</P>

      <P>This Bill, which sets up new structures for the preservation and development of our inland fisheries, is now happily on the point of beng enacted. But no one knows better than the new Minister that the potential of this legislation will not be realised unless there is continuous and effective coordination of effort to this end.  The whole range of powers to deal with any particular situation does not lie in the hands of the boards, whether central or regional, or even in the hands of the Minister himself.  Lough Sheelin is a case in point.  It is a lake I have known and loved for many a year.  The Minister visited it recently and saw for himself its present deplorable condition.  The coordination and co-operation needed to deal with this urgent problem, which is essentially one of slurry disposal, as Senator West has just said, extends to the local farming interests, to the local <Col N="1272" /> authorities, to the Department of the Environment, to the Department of Agriculture and possibly other agencies. Unless they can all be brought to appreciate the vital need to preserve an invaluable national asset and to co-operate fully in the measures necessary to achieve this, then we face disaster. Success or failure in the particular case of Lough Sheelin is for me the critical test of the effectiveness of this legislation. Indeed it will determine not only whether the legislation itself is worth while, but whether, as far as inland fisheries are concerned, is it worth while having a Department of Fisheries.  I very much hope that the Minister and his Department will successfully pass this test and earn our congratulations.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senators West and Whitaker for their remarks about Lough Sheelin.  I can say that there is constructive effort and coordination in the Cabinet.  We have the desire and the will and the intent to deal with the problem of Lough Sheelin.  I am well aware of the pollution problem in it. I saw it for myself.  But I would not like it to be felt that others were not aware of it and were not working on it before I went there last Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since November last a technical subcommittee made up of representatives of the Department of Agriculture, the Inland Fisheries Trust and An Foras Talúntais have been actively considering a practical solution to the problem.  This sub-committee have contacted the four county councils that border the lake and they are examining the possibility of transporting the slurry out of the catchment area around the lake and using it as a fertiliser on other farms.  They are also deciding if it would be possible to treat the slurry to render it less harmful.  There is a certain amount of scientific research going on as a long-term policy.  They are also looking into whey production, because the whey being fed to pigs is aggravating the problem.  On 14 January the county agricultural officers in the areas concerned were asked to complete a list of farmers prepared to take the <Col N="1273" /> slurry.  They were asked for other technical advice.  In February technical advice was asked, too, with regard to the processing of slurry and the possibility of EEC funding of this as a long-term view.  The present position is that Meath, Westmeath and Longford County Councils have pledged their co-operation in alleviating the problem, but they have not as yet come up with any ideas of their own.  Cavan County Council have not been very co-operative to date, but I hope that we will get a certain amount of co-operation from them now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the two possible solutions mentioned, the transportation of slurry from the catchment area, and the treatment of slurry at a centralised depot, the following is the position: we are awaiting now a list of farmers who are willing to take the slurry and there is an assessment being done on the quality of that slurry.  When that is available each farmer's eligibility for grant aid for storage facilities under the farm development service will have to be examined and the setting up of a distribution system in consultation with the producers and the recipients and the advisory staff will have to be tackled.  The possibility of treatment will have to be studied more carefully when we have the scientific findings from the people we have asked for them, in January and February.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that we are committed to seeing that Sheelin does not die.  We want everybody's help at this stage.  I am asked if we have the teeth to do it; I think we have, but we need co-operation too.  We want co-operation and goodwill from all sections, and I feel that the Members here in the Seanad will use their undoubted influence to attain this goal, to which we all aspire.  It may only concern a small corner of Ireland but it is a well known and important corner.  If it is Sheelin's position to be in danger today, next year or during the year it could very well be some other area.  We must all help to keep Ireland clean.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker looked upon Lough Sheelin as a test case.  We are prepared <Col N="1274" /> to accept it as a test case, and I am confident that we will not be found wanting in that test.</P>

      <P>The problem I wish to raise on the Adjournment is heightened by the introduction of oral examinations in French to our leaving certificate examination&mdash;something which I raised on two occasions on the Adjournment over the past ten years or so.  I am very glad to see that after tortuous negotiations the pilot scheme has started and that at least 20 per cent of our students taking French in the leaving certificate are getting oral examinations in the language this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not connected only with that.  It, in fact, has wider ramifications.  The problem I am raising is the inadequate number of language teaching assistantships by exchange between France and Ireland.  These assistantships are restricted to people who are studying French in university, they can either be undergraduates or be graduates who have a specific interest in French. The assistantship exchange scheme is an agreement between this country and France by which an equal number of students at this level from French universities come and teach in our Irish schools and a corresponding number of Irish students go and teach in French schools. The number going both ways each year is currently 36.  This number is inadequate by almost any measure.  One of the familiar, not necessarily accurate, tests of schemes such as this which operate here is a comparison with Britain.  Our number is 36, the number in Britain is 1,400, and if one reduces that figure&mdash;taking the relative populations into account&mdash;the fraction being 3/50&mdash;one reaches a figure of 84 as a fair comparison. That is not a very good measure but it does give an idea that we are very much out of scale and my plea to the Minister of State for Education is that these assistantships should be greatly <Col N="1275" /> widened both in numbers and in scope.</P>
    <P>The test which is applied by the Department of Education to undergraduates or graduates who wish to participate in this scheme from our point of view is that they either are taking, have taken, or intend to take the Diploma of Education.  Now I can see from the bureaucratic point of view why there is a restriction such as that but I would argue that it may not necessarily be the best type of restriction.  I would urge the Minister of State just to apply the scheme to students who are studying French at a high level as a main subject in their university courses or to students who have just graduated in such a course.  The fact of having to take the Diploma in Education should not be considered necessary as it rules out a wide category of people who are not going to be teachers but who will need expertise in oral French in many other walks of life.</P>
    <P>This situation prevails and is administered by our Department of Education and their French counterparts under a cultural agreement between this country and France and the cultural agreement is overseen by a joint commission, French/Irish, La Commission Mixte, which meets every two years alternatively in Paris and in Dublin.  One of the complaints from people who have been attempting to have this scheme broadened and the numbers increased and the scope of the scheme widened is that it is very difficult for anybody who is not in the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Education or the French Cultural Service to succeed in having any input into this commission. The operations of this commission are somewhat of a mystery and one professor of French who has complained to me about the problem says that as far as he is aware the problem does not lie with the French Government who would be happy enough to increase the number of language assistants if we would only increase our number, but the initiative needs to come from us.  The difficulty is to get our representatives on this commission from the Department of Foreign <Col N="1276" /> Affairs and the Department of Education to ensure that our case for an increase in the number of assistantships is clearly and fairly put.</P>
    <P>As I said, this scheme has become doubly important because of the oral French test at leaving certificate level. This necessitates more and more teachers having good up-to-date oral French.  Not only in the teaching profession is this a requirement nowadays but with the developing commercial cultural contacts between this country and our European partners, and particularly with France, people in very many walks of life now need to have a good working knowledge of French.  In common with other Members of the House I sat for the leaving certificate examination when one studied the written but not the spoken language.  It has been one of my ambitions&mdash;which I have always postponed&mdash;to become fluent in French. Like many other Irish people it would be of the greatest benefit to me.  I think that the Department and the Minister of State, should take a generous attitude. He should do two things.  He should ensure that at the forthcoming meeting of the commission early in April our case is put for an extension of the numbers covered by this agreement.  Also he might go a bit further and make the process easier by actually widening the membership of the commission and getting an input from other bodies, such as in this case, the Committee of University Professors of French.  But I would urge him to widen and increase the numbers in this very important scheme because there are more and more people who must have a knowledge of French. We have got to be able to teach it in the schools and we have got to enable our undergraduate students who are taking French as a major language to study for a year in France on exchange schemes such as this.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an ócáid seo teacht ós comhair an Tí agus eolas maidir leis an scéal seo a chur os a chomhair.  I would like to place before the House some information <Col N="1277" /> which is additional and perhaps repetitive of that which has already been given by Senator West.  The scheme for the exchange of assistants between Ireland and France derives from the cultural agreement between the two countries which was signed in 1967.</P>
      <P>Article IV of the Agreement provides that:</P>
      <P>The Contracting Parties shall, to the greatest extent possible, organise the sending or exchange of teachers, students, research workers, lectures, assistants, scholars and cultural experts as well as of representatives of university or extra-university cultural groups.</P>
      <P>They shall facilitate in a general way collective meetings of young people and of youth groups of both countries.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of this article, a scheme for the exchange of an equal number of language assistants between Ireland and France was launched in the 1969-70 school year.  In that year, seven assistants were exchanged.  The numbers increased gradually over the years as the following figures illustrate:</P>

    <P>The current 40 exchanges include a new development whereby four of the exchanges were specifically from the non-university, third level technological area, an area with which I know the Deputy is in sympathy and would welcome the departure.</P>
    <P>I have not yet made a final decision on the number of exchanges to be arranged for the coming school year, but in arriving <Col N="1278" /> at such decision I will bear fully in mind the views of the Senator and also his reference to the English scene.</P>
    <P>Activities under the cultural agreement are reviewed approximately every two years when a meeting of the joint committee of French and Irish officials is held.  The meetings are held alternately in Paris and Dublin and the officials are drawn from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Education and other interests covered by the cultural agreement.  The next meeting of the joint committee will be held in Paris on 1 April and at this meeting the arrangements for the language assistants scheme will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the exchange scheme is two-fold.  Firstly, it gives young graduates or undergraduates, who intend to proceed to a teaching career, an opportunity to spend an academic year abroad and thus perfect their knowledge of the language and the culture of the host country.  Their placement in a school gives them an insight into the educational system and adds to their career preparation.  The second objective is to improve the students' knowledge and understanding of the language and culture of the host country. In addition, there are the general benefits which accrue from foreign travel and experience. The assistants are usually student teachers between the third and fourth year of their training course.  They are engaged for an eight-month period, October-May.  The basic studies of the assistants are: (a) to assist the regular staff as supernumeraries; (b) to conduct conversation classes in French or English as appropriate; (c) to supplement such classes by exercises in reading, dictation and oral composition; and (d) to give the pupils an insight into the institutions and way of life of the assistants' country.</P>
    <P>The assistant is not required to undertake formal class teaching or be made responsible for discipline or class supervision. If, in a particular case, however, the school principal is satisfied that the assistant is willing and competent to undertake formal class teaching, such may be allowed, provided it is supervised by <Col N="1279" /> the regular class teachers and provided that the amount of such work is strictly limited.  In any event, an assistant would not be required to teach for more than 12 hours per week.  The assistant is encouraged, but not compelled, to play a full part in the social life of the school and in out-of-school activities.  For purposes of facilitating the pursuit of private studies by the assistants and of affording them travel opportunities during their stay in the host country, their time-table arrangements are such as to allow them one free day per week, usually at weekends. School principals ensure that: (a) the school staff co-operate in helping the assistant to integrate with the school and the local community; and (b) any additional advice and help considered appropriate is given to the assistant in the matter of his or her studies.</P>
    <P>In the operation of the scheme, my Department invite applications each year from the authorities of second level schools and the technological colleges who wish to participate in the scheme. The number of assignments to be made in any year is determined by the Department in consultation with the French Cultural Service and having regard to demand and available finances.  The selection of Irish schools to which French assistants are assigned is the function of the French-Irish Pedagogical Committee&mdash;a committee representative of my Department, the French Cultural Service and the Irish Association of Teachers of French.  The selection of Irish students to be assigned as assistants to French schools is made by a committee representative of the Department, the Higher Education Authority and the French Cultural Service.</P>
    <P>I might add that, in addition to assistant exchanges, my Department operate a scheme whereby experienced language teachers are exchanged between Ireland and France for a full school term. Currently there are ten such exchanges. Assistant exchanges are also arranged between this country and Germany.  The number of such exchanges is substantially less than those with France, and I am under pressure at the moment to increase <Col N="1280" /> it from the existing level of eight.  The question of launching a pilot scheme of exchanges of language assistants between Ireland and Spain is currently under consideration.  I am quite sure the Senator shares with me the view that exchanges should not be limited specifically to one country but rather we should have as great a spread as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that the assistant exchange scheme in respect of France, and to which Senator West has referred is, and I agree entirely with him, by far the most rewarding of all the educational activities undertaken jointly by Ireland and France from the point of view of improving and perfecting our teachers' command of the French language, For example, when examiners were being recruited for the pilot oral exam at leaving certificate, 1980, by far the best response came from former assistants. The standard of oral French acquired by assistants is usually of a high order. With the expected rapid expansion of the pilot oral at leaving certificate level, there will be need for increasing numbers of examiners with a high degree of proficiency.  Furthermore, the implications of the introduction of compulsory orals at leaving certificate in the mid-eighties will necessitate the employment by schools of teachers who have sufficient oral proficiency to teach effectively through the medium of French. Hence I am anxious to give every support to the fullest development of the exchange scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, this is the second occasion on which I have the pleasure and the honour of being here with you, and I find myself in the unusual but very welcome position of being entirely at one with the proposer of the motion, and regret that finances and resources are not of the kind that would allow us to implement more fully what the Senator and I wish for our assistants and our students.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 March 1980.</P>
