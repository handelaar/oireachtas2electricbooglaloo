      <P>I have notice from Senator Martin that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The sudden unavailability of anthracite and its implications for the economy and the environment.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, in view of the fact that the British Government are announcing proposals for the Government of Northern Ireland this afternoon and as this is the only House of the Oireachtas in session, would the Leader of the House consider giving time to the House to discuss these proposals tomorrow?</P>

      <P>In common with other Independent Senators I have my name to motion No. 21 on the Order Paper:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting the continuing impasse in Northern <Col N="1518" /> Ireland, calls for constructive attitudes and constructive policies which will lead to a resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Leader of the House on a number of occasions if it would be possible to arrange a debate on this subject before the recess.  There were certain difficulties which I appreciate and, while I feel a good deal of sympathy with Senator Cooney's request, I would like to ask the Leader of the House, if it does not prove possible to discuss this matter before the summer recess, to give a commitment to have a debate on this motion at the beginning of the new session in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my support for Senator Cooney's proposal and to put it in much stronger terms than Senator West has now expressed because, as Senator Cooney said, a new initiative is about to be announced and there could not be a more appropriate time to discuss constructive attitudes and constructive policies and give us an opportunity not alone to speak of the British-Northern Ireland connection but the constructive attitudes and policies which we hope our Government have in preparation.</P>

We will know its content by the end of today so any desire for delay that I previously had is removed.  I simply want to add my voice to those who urge on the Leader of the House the desirability of taking up this topic&mdash;I would wish before the Seanad rises.</P>

      <P>The only way this matter could come before the House is by way of a motion.  There is a motion dealing with Northern Ireland but we have agreed on the way in which motions will be taken by this House, that is to say, that each group gets a turn.  The one on Northern Ireland is not next for consideration. We have adhered to a certain pattern and we would be departing from <Col N="1519" /> that pattern by taking it now.  The next motion that would be taken, if the House has time to take a motion before it adjourns, is a Fianna Fáil motion and I am not prepared to depart from the order in which we have dealt with this matter up to now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 34 to 40, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a participant returns goods or an article under this section to a recipient and a recipient alleges that the value of the goods or article decreased while in the possession or under the control of the participant and such decrease was occasioned by the wilful neglect of the participant, the recipient shall for a period of 21 days following receipt of written notice from the participant tendering return of goods or article, have the right to apply to the Court by way of summary proceeding and the Court, if satisfied that because of the wilful neglect of the participant the value of the goods or article decreased while in his possession or under his control, shall order that an amount equal to the amount of the decrease may be deducted from the payment falling to be returned by the recipient under this section.</P>
      <P>(3) Where a recipient wishes to apply to the Court under this section he shall first lodge in Court the amount of the payment to which this section applies.</P>
      <P>(4) A recipient who fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and who has not made application to the Court under subsection (2) of this section shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a very distinguished man, Johnny Costello, who said on very many occasions that Members of the Oireachtas were not paid to be parliamentary <Col N="1521" /> draftsmen but to be legislators.  I had to spend some considerable time putting together an amendment to section 4 of the Pyramid Selling Bill.  I must say I would have preferred not to have had to spend that time because I was aware, having drafted the amendment, that it was imperfect.  I would obviously have been happier if the resources of the Department had been available to me to put together what was, in effect, a complicated amendment.  But it was with considerable pleasure that I discovered today that a Government amendment, which has just been circulated to Members, in effect adopts the provisions of the amendment that I sought to put before the House.</P>
    <P>When this matter came before us last week I spent some time making the case that the provisions of section 4 were completely against a principle that has existed in common law down through the years, a principle that has provided that where a party engages in an illegal contract the court will not allow the criminal or the person who engages in such a contract to have access to the courts to enforce parts of that contract.  We had some difficulty in convincing the other side of the House that it was desirable, that that subsection (2) was offensive to this principle and I must say that, with the conviction with which distinguished Members on that side of the House found some objection to my seeking a week so that the matter could be fully considered, I felt that I was wrong and that I had misinterpreted something that I always understood to be the case.  The amendments, both our amendments and the Minister's amendment, do not in fact propose to deny the criminal access to the courts and I would like to explain why, in drafting the amendment that Senator FitzGerald and I drafted, we did not seek ultimately to deny him total access to the courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a standard work, &ldquo;The Law of Contract&rdquo; by Cheshire and Fifoot, which explains the background to this principle and this policy.  It says:</P>
    <P>Certain types of contract are forbidden <Col N="1522" /> at common law and are therefore <i>prima facie</i> illegal.  The first essential to an understanding of this head of the law, which has been clouded by much confusion of thought, is to discover if possible the principle upon which the stigma of illegality is based.  The present law is the result of a development that stretches back to at least Elizabethan times, but its foundations were not effectively laid until the 18th century. What the judges of that period were at pains to emphasise was that they would not tolerate any contract that in their view was injurious to society.</P>
    <P>Senators on all sides of the House agree that this Bill is necessary.  We recognise that pyramid selling or pyramid sales contracts are injurious to society.  In various statutes down through the years it has been recognised that there are varying degrees of illegality in contracts. Some contracts, though illegal, must be recognised to some extent by the courts. There are others which the courts, with the interests of society a heart, regard as reprehensible and they will not tolerate allowing parties to such contracts access to the courts.  Included amongst the types of contract regarded as most reprehensible is a contract to commit a crime.  Anybody who promotes a pyramid selling scheme is inviting a participant to commit a crime.  It is with great reluctance that we should allow people who pursue such schemes to have access to our courts.</P>
    <P>As many Senators pointed out last week, there are circumstances in which great injustice could be done if participants in a pyramid selling scheme were not allowed access to the courts.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, where in order to be fair one allows a party to such an illegal contract to have access to the courts, he will have access only under conditions which ensure that the party seeking justice, so to speak, under such an illegal contract, is restricted to aspects of it that will ensure justice and will ensure that he will not gain in any way from the contract he enters into, or that he seeks to have others enter into.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> Subsection (2) of section 4, as it stood, was highly objectionable in this sense.  It put the promoter of a pyramid sales scheme in a position where, when a participant in that scheme returned with the goods and said to the promoter: &ldquo;Take these goods back&rdquo;, the promoter could say: &ldquo;Those goods are not in the same condition as they were in when I gave them to you.  I am using my rights under section 4 (2) of this Act to deduct a sum of money to compensate me for my loss.&rdquo;  We are talking about criminals.  It is likely that, in almost every case in which a participant would try to return goods, the criminal would say: &ldquo;The goods are not in the same condition.  I am holding on to the money&rdquo;.  It leaves the participant in the awful position that he would have to seek redress through the courts.</P>
    <P>It would seem that we were allowing the presumption of innocence, so to speak, to fall to the person we regarded as the criminal, and the presumption of having committed a wrong to lie with the person who was lured into the contract by the participant.  In order to get over that difficulty we propose that, where a participant returns goods to the promoter, if the promoter maintains that the goods are in a less valuable condition than they were when he first handed them out to the participant, the promoter can exercise a right to obtain compensation. He must, in the first instance, lodge in court the amount of the value of the goods, he must then apply to the court and ask the court to determine whether there has been a loss and, if the court is satisfied that there has been a loss, then the court will allow a deduction to be made.</P>
    <P>We also provide in the amendment that this procedure would have to be gone through within 21 days of the participant seeking to return the goods.  It is also provided in our amendment that the court proceedings would be summary proceedings and consequently would be dealt with speedily.  In so far as those parts of our amendments are concerned, <Col N="1524" /> I am pleased to see that the Government have adopted the idea and have, in fact, incorporated all those elements in their own amendment.  I am far happier with the Government amendment so far as it goes in that respect.  They had the benefit of the experience of the parliamentary draftsman.  I am happy to adopt the draftsman's excellent results.</P>
    <P>There is one difference between the two amendments.  In our amendment we provided that, where a promoter of a pyramid sales scheme fails to return the money to the participant, and does not exercise his right to go to court to have the court determine whether any loss has occurred, the promoter would thereby commit a crime.  There would be a criminal sanction hanging over him if he refused to return the goods as envisaged under section 4(1).  In the original section there was no intention&mdash;it was not provided for at all&mdash;that the promoter, or the recipient as he is described in that section, would commit a crime if he failed to respond to the request of another party to the pyramid sales contract. I would be happy to see that proposal to make it a crime dropped altogether if I understood how a participant or a party who wanted to get out of the scheme could get out of it otherwise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain to me what will happen when a party who is inveigled into one of these schemes discovers, perhaps for the first time, that he is engaging in a crime and realises that he is certainly engaging in something that could be very injurious to himself, and wants to get out.  He goes to the promoter and says: &ldquo;Take back these goods and give me my money back.&rdquo;  If the promoter refuses, he is not in that way committing a crime.  I accept that he is, in the first instance, committing a crime by engaging in this type of activity at all.  It is putting a difficult onus on a party who himself, in some way at least, is participating in criminal activity, because you are leaving it to the party who is the less dominant of the parties to the contract to go to the authorities and say: &ldquo;I have engaged in this crime.  I now want to get out of it.&rdquo;<Col N="1525" /> He is, in effect&mdash;even though improving his chances of getting out of the scheme&mdash;leaving himself vulnerable to prosecution.  I would have thought it better if we provided for the possibility that the original promoter would commit a further criminal offence by failing to return the money when the party who found himself involved in the scheme wished him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to open by expressing thanks to the other side of the House for the respect they have shown to the House in agreeing to Report Stage being taken a week after it was proposed to be taken, and congratulating the Minister on taking Senator Molony's point.  It is an acceptable amendment.  It is an incident Members of the House should remember for future occasions.  Senator Molony had his own criticisms of the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister's amendment, as far as it goes, is very good, and is a great improvement on what we saw first.  There is no indication in this section of the degree of neglect which will cause liability.  I would have thought that in a situation of this kind it should be the minimum duty to take no more care of the goods that a man finds himself conned into having than he would take of his own goods, which I would take to be the liability of a gratuitous bailee, and that he would not have such a liability as might arise if he was deemed to have <Col N="1526" /> received money.  Obviously he would not be entitled to throw the watches out the window, but he would not be in any more trouble than he should be if he had gone for a bathe with a watch on him. There is an absence of a definition of the neglect which would give rise to the liability in the existing measure.  Senator Molony's amendment did suggest the insertion of the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; which has that degree of deliberation which would impose something of a lesser burden on the person who finds himself, together with everyone else on the terrace, stocked with goods which nobody can buy because everybody else has got them.  That is the extreme and absurd case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Senators who contributed in any way and also I appreciate the work Senators FitzGerald and Molony have put into this.  I assure the House that I am not out to stifle discussion as such.  The Seanad is here for discussion and if it finds a flaw in a Bill or thinks something should be done this is the place to discuss it. Senator FitzGerald has often said that he is never out for political point scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(1) provides that a payment in respect of goods or articles shall be repayable by the recipient to the participant. Subsection (2) provides that if the goods have decreased in value because of the neglect of the participant an amount equal to the amount of the decrease in value may be deducted by the recipient from the payment failing to be returned by him under this section. Amendment No. 1 in the names of Senators Molony and FitzGerald proposes to give the recipient 21 days in which he may go to the court to claim that the goods were reduced in value and to look for a reduction in the amount of the repayment he is required to make. The amendment proposes to require the recipient to lodge the amount claimed in court.  Subsection (4) of the amendment proposes to make it an offence to fail to comply with the provision of subsection (1) unless the recipient has made an application <Col N="1527" /> to the court for a reduction. The intentions of subsections (2) and (3) of amendment No. 1 are in accordance, no doubt, with the philosophy of the Bill, but there have been some problems with wording which Senator Molony referred to earlier on.  He said that perhaps the wording was improper.  I do not want to detract from what they have said, but were it not for the wording I probably would have been accepting the two subsections just as they are.  That was the advice I got from the legal people in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment which was circulated proposes to achieve what Senator Molony and Senator FitzGerald intended.  The reason for not including subsection (4) of amendment No. 1 in the Government amendment is that I am advised it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to prove that the recipient has made the repayment required by section 4 (1).  I appreciate that the situation will now be fractionally less biased in favour of the participant than the two Senators intended.  If the participant's demand for a refund is ignored by the recipient the participant will have to go to court for redress.  I am told there are several things he can ask the court to do. He will almost certainly get his money back but he will have to take the initiative. I regret this, but we are going as far as we can to put the onus on the recipient.</P>
    <P>In view of the line I am taking I assume that amendment No. 2, which proposes to say that the duties of the participant should be that of a gratuitous bailee, will now be withdrawn.  I recommend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his response.  I accept the point that is made in relation to subsection (4) of our amendment and in those circumstances am happier to accept the Government amendment as drafted rather than our own.  I want also to add my words of thanks to what Senator FitzGerald has said in regard to the <Col N="1528" /> generous way in which the Minister responded to this.  I am aware that last week he found himself in the difficulty that he was anxious to have the Bill become law.  Even though it could still have become law by deferring Report Stage to this week, by accepting the amendment it cannot now become law until the Dáil reassembles in October.  It has put the Minister in the difficulty that he has been unable to discharge an undertaking that he gave in the Lower House that it would become law before the summer recess.  However, the worth of the legislation will prove to be all the more as a result.  I thank him for dealing with it.</P>

      <P>I do not know where or in what way to raise the point I want to raise now.  The Senators on this side of the House have been made aware of a situation which will be affected by the Bill we are dealing with on Report Stage.  It is a situation of an entirely honest trading company who have been engaging in their particular activities for very many years, indeed before the war and in my childhood.  They have received advice that what they have been doing for all that time will be rendered an offence by the provisions of this Bill.  There would be a way of dealing with it if the House would agree to recommit section 1 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware that such a scheme has been in operation for some time but which will not be affected by this Bill.  This is a matter we went into in great detail.  A Senator mentioned it to me in private and I do not want to mention names in this House, but the Bill is not intended to catch out such dealings or such selling systems.  Is the Senator referring to a system that goes on mostly in private houses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is going to become law and it might be a bit late afterwards. I looked again at what the Minister said in the Dáil before we had Second Stage last week and I was quite satisfied with his view on it.  Looking at the definition of a scheme under subsection (1) even though it is not intended to include people who involve themselves in direct selling schemes other than pyramid sales schemes, the constituents in section 1 (1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) could in fact include such schemes.  For that reason I wonder whether the other side of the House would agree to Senator FitzGerald's suggestion that section 1 be recommitted at least for discussion now. I have looked at subsection (1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) and I am convinced that some of these schemes, with which I am familiar, could come under the scope of the Bill before us.  I do not know the way around it, but I am convinced that they would come within the definition of a scheme.  I am convinced they would come within the definition of the scheme.  Consequently people who involve themselves, whether it is in the business of encyclopaedias, household ware or cosmetics, could find themselves committing a crime.  It may not be the Government's intention to prosecute them, but there is no question but that the schemes they are presently involved in would, under the scope of the Bill, be criminal.</P>

      <P>That cannot arise.  The <Col N="1530" /> legal people and the draftsmen have gone into this in great depth because we knew this point would be raised.  This Bill has been in the pipeline for many years. Senator FitzGerald may remember that as well.  Those problems arose down the years.  In the light of that experience our people were very satisfied that no genuine scheme of selling&mdash;door-to-door selling, night selling over-tea selling or anything like that, as long as they were genuine on the selling of goods&mdash;would be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give an example most Senators are familiar with?  There is a system of sales engaged in by a company&mdash;I will name the company because I do not think there would be any objection to it as it is a household word&mdash;Tupperware, boxes for keeping sandwiches fresh and so on.  I do not think there is any difficulty under paragraph (a).  What they do is ask a housewife to hold a party in her house, invite her friends and these goods are produced in association with wine and cheese, or tea and sandwiches, or whatever.  There are also practices like this in the sale of cosmetics.  Take the constituents of the scheme:</P>
      <P>(a) goods or services, or both, are to be provided by the promoter or, if there are two or more promoters, by one or more of them;</P>
      <P>It qualifies there.</P>
      <P>(b) the goods or services so provided are to be supplied to or for other persons under transactions effected by participants;</P>
      <P>It qualifies there.</P>
      <P>(c) the prospect is held out to participants of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of persons who become participants;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in effect, may be one the Minister may see as a way out but I put it to him that it is not.  A promoter asks a housewife to engage in this scheme.  The housewife calls in her friends to the sales party.  The participant is invited not just to sell goods but to have her friends sell <Col N="1531" /> goods.  She is given money not for getting participants in, but for selling the goods ultimately.  It does not disqualify the application of paragraph (c) to those circumstances.  The prospect is held out to participants of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of persons who become participants.  There is every possibility that the original company will pay the agent for sales of a sub-agent. They are not engaging in pyramid selling, but effectively the middle person who introduces what I call the sub-agent will receive a benefit for passing these goods on.  That is a prospect held out to participants of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of persons who become participants.  I accept what the Minister said in relation to legal advice, but I would ask him to take the point that Senator FitzGerald made.  These people have actually obtained legal advice. I can confirm that they have obtained legal advice because I have spoken to one of the persons who advised them on this.</P>

That is not the way they <Col N="1534" /> operate.  Thus they do not over-flood the market.  They solicit orders.  They may carry a sample, but they do not sell unless they have an order.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 1 and 6, after &ldquo;contract&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or lease&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment I propose is a very simple one in line with the point I made last week when we were dealing with Committee Stage of the Bill.  The Minister expressed concern that some petrol retailers were being obliged, because of conditions and contracts they had with wholesalers or suppliers, to use trading stamps in promoting their sales.  He rightly considered this was a practice that was unacceptable and he wished to put a stop to it.  Consequently, he proposed that certain provisions in contracts obliging retailers to promote their business by use of trading stamps would be void.  I felt that many of these obligations were imposed by way of conditions in leases rather than in contracts.  My amendment proposes to extend the void condition to include conditions like that not only in contracts but in leases.</P>

      <P>Having considered the amendment I must say I am not in general agreement with it, although I accept the point made by the Senator.  When we discussed this on Committee Stage I maintained that the meaning of the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; would include lease but I undertook to have the matter looked at again between then and Report Stage. The Senator raised a very valid point; I thought it proper not to rush the Bill <Col N="1535" /> through that day and considered we should give it another week.</P>
      <P>The Department's legal advisers have been consulted again and their advice is that there is no possibility of confusion here.  I have been advised positively that a lease is a form of contract.  Therefore, while I appreciate the concern expressed by the Senator on Committee Stage, lest there be any difficulty with the interpretation of the section I can confirm that the fears are groundless.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come back to a point made by Senator Molony on Second Stage regarding the actual operation of trading stamps schemes.  While I realise the Senator would like to know more on the subject, I should explain that while certain factors are common to all schemes each one operating here has its own special features.  I should also point out that the Bill merely lays down a general statutory framework in which trading stamp schemes may operate.  It does not set out to regulate their financial affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, however, there are three schemes of which we are aware operating in Ireland at present which would fall within the scope of the Bill. Broadly speaking, the profit to the promoter of a trading stamps scheme arises out of the difference between the cost of the stamps to the retailer and the cost in turn to the promoter of redeeming <Col N="1536" /> those stamps, plus printing and promotional outlays on the stamps themselves.  There is, of course, also a hidden profit on the stamps that may not be redeemed at all by customers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the benefit to the retailer, his profit would essentially materialise from the difference between the increased turnover generated by the use of stamps as a promotional device and the cost of the stamps to him.  I should add that the Department have seen no evidence to suggest that trading stamps have been other than a profitable promotional device for retailers.</P>
    <P>Finally, from the consumers' point of view, trading stamps could be said to amount to a discount on purchases of various products in selective retail outlets. Although it could be argued that this discount is theoretical in so far as prices in general in franchised outlets might be higher than those elsewhere, the findings of the Department and other independent consultants would not appear to bear out this argument.  It can be seen, therefore, that trading stamps will appear to be acceptable to all interested concerns.  Therefore, the course taken in this Bill&mdash;to regulate rather than prohibit trading stamps&mdash;is the right and entirely justifiable one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this brief contribution I wish to refer to three areas: first, the co-operative education programme as an important element of courses at NIHE; secondly, the industrial and commercial representation on the governing body and, finally, I wish to put forward a criticism of the emphasis on electronics design engineering courses not only in the NIHE in Limerick but also in the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting on these three points briefly, it is worthy of note that <Col N="1537" /> the needs of industry are now receiving active support from educational institutions, especially from NIHE, Limerick. As a small, developing country we have much going for us.  We have political stability.  We have a highly attractive incentive package to offer investors and, very importantly, we have a young educated labour force.  The regional technical colleges and the NIHE as technological institutions have a special role to play in our industrial development. I understand that considerable weight is attached by overseas investors to the geographical location of these institutions and to the courses they offer.</P>
    <P>The co-operative education programme has much to commend it.  It infuses an element of practice into the academic material covered in the courses.  It should enhance the relevance of courses for the students and, no doubt, the practical experience gained off campus has a maturing effect on them.  However, I should like to make two observations on the implications of co-operative education.  Caution is needed in striking a balance between the proportion of time allocated to academic work on campus and that spent on placement under the co-operative scheme.  Perhaps a one-year placement as part of the degree courses in NIHE is excessive.  It would appear that, conscious of this situation, the placement period now required on engineering courses at NIHE has effectively been reduced to six months.</P>
    <P>My second observation on co-operative education relates to the impact on post-graduate courses.  As in the universities, the NIHE will have each year a limited number of top calibre graduates who will be suited to and will benefit from post-graduate courses. These high quality students will usually be offered attractive jobs on graduation. Having had exposure to the practical world through the co-operative education scheme, they may well have acquired the added incentive of wishing to take up attractive jobs immediately on graduation, thus deferring indefinitely the opportunity to pursue higher degrees. <Col N="1538" /> If this occurs, and I suspect it does to some extent, then the co-operative scheme helps to deprive suitable graduates of the incentive to follow post-graduate work.  In general terms, however, the co-operative education programme is a most desirable concept and development in the educational system.</P>
    <P>The second point on which I would like to touch briefly is the composition of the governing body and in particular the representation from industry and commerce thereon.  This is very desirable.  It provides a direct link between the NIHE and people who can make a valuable and realistic contribution to the deliberations of the governing body.  Furthermore, these representatives could act as a medium in raising funds from non-Government sources which could be channelled into the already underfinanced area of applied research.  There is much to be said for industry playing a greater part in contributing more funds to research work.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the engineering discipline.  The NIHE have become the country's main source of engineering graduates and is, therefore, playing a crucial role in meeting the country's technical manpower requirements. Among the engineering specialisms, particular importance is, quite rightly, attached to electronics.  Employment in the electronic industry in Ireland has grown rapidly in recent years and the increase in the value of electronic exports has been quite dramatic.  While welcoming the exceptionally high demand for NIHE's engineering graduates, especially in electronics, I wonder are we going somewhat overboard in the NIHE and also in the universities, in providing courses in electronics design as opposed to more broadly based courses in production engineering with an emphasis on electronics.  Our greatest need, it is widely acknowledged, is for production engineers to meet the requirements of manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome this Bill which provides a statutory basis for one of the newest, most relevant and exciting developments in our educational system.</P>

Beidh mé ag moladh leasaithe dá réir ar Chéim an Choiste.</P>
    <P>While I wish to see NIHE Limerick established on a statutory basis, I am not enamoured of this Bill in its present form because it treats NIHE Limerick as if it were a State corporation rather than a pioneering third-level educational institution needing special freedom and flexibility if it is to succeed in the urgent national objective of promoting technological studies and skills in a country still too biased in favour of the purely academic.</P>
    <P>Instead of so many strict and detailed Ministerial controls, I suggest that what should above all appear in this legislation, and in any other legislation concerning third-level institutions, are provisions establishing a system or procedures to reassure the public that two essential criteria will be met.  One, that staff appointments will be on merit <Col N="1542" /> only, with no room for canvassing or favouritism; and two, that the degrees and diplomas awarded will be of an adequately high standard, bearing favourable comparison with those in other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The second of these criteria requires not merely that standards should satisfy the NCEA but an effective system of external examiners or advisors as well.</P>
    <P>The first criterion&mdash;regarding staff appointments&mdash;would be satisfied by legislation requiring, not only in NIHE but in every university and third-level institution, an appointments system directed towards ensuring the pre-eminence of excellence and quality.  I believe the best way of doing this is to prescribe assessment by a board comprising at least as many extern as intern assessors with an independent Irish person as chairman, and making the judgment of such a board virtually final.  If any concession has to be made to the over-riding authority of a Governing body, a two-thirds or larger majority of such a body should be needed to overturn the assessors; even that might, I fear, still leave some room for the undesirable personal canvassing which has occurred in the present NUI appointments system.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister's approach is based more on a view of NIHE Limerick as a State-sponsored body to be tightly controlled rather than as a pioneering third-level institution in the technological field, meriting a high degree of flexibility of action, subject to the two public interest qualifications on which I have focused as being particularly important.  I intend to submit amendments on these two matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the fact that we have a national institute for higher education in Limerick and one of the aspects that has contributed most to its existence was the campaign which the people of Limerick and the mid-west region in general, launched during the sixties for the purpose of having a university in Limerick.  Instead of a university, the National Institute for Higher <Col N="1543" /> Education was established there.  The concept was well founded in that we have an institute specialising in the teaching of administrative and technological skills in an age when rapid change is taking place in the skills required in business, in the professions and in technology generally.  The pioneering work which the institute have carried out has been well worth while.  The institute have produced young people well equipped to enter the fields of business, industry, agriculture and the professions. They have provided facilities, opportunities and services for young people not alone in the mid-west region but much further afield.</P>
      <P>The courses that are available there are wide-ranging, expanding and lead to degrees and diplomas for the people who participate in these courses.  The progress of the institute can best be measured when we reflect on the fact that involvement in 1972 was 100 and in the present year the figure is something in the region of 2,500, including both full-time and part-time students.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the director of the institute and his staff for the work and what they have achieved in the institute over the years.</P>
      <P>Additional facilities and buildings must continue to be provided to meet the growing demand which is being made on them and which I am confident will be made in the future.  I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that the facilities and buildings required will be provided and that financial constraints will not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one or two reservations in relation to this Bill.  The first concerns the status of the institute as it is.  I found the observations of Senator Whitaker very valid when he described the Bill and the intent behind it as treating the NIHE Limerick as somewhat of a State corporation or a State-sponsored body as opposed to a pioneering third level institution. I gathered from his remarks that he shares my worry that the pioneering and enterprising spirit, which I believe is essential to an institute of that <Col N="1544" /> kind, may be somewhat retarded by the constraints that this Bill may impose on certain aspects of it.  There is a feeling within the institute, and certainly within the area, that while it has been described in certain quarters as having the same status as other universities, it lacks the authority, independence and freedom that other universities have.</P>
    <P>I have reservations also in regard to the proposal concerning the constitution of the governing body.  The governing body as proposed in the Bill is loaded in favour of the Department and in favour of the Minister.  People in the area are conscious of this and people associated with the institute are conscious of it. There is resentment at what could be described as an element of over-lordship which has been introduced into it.  Tied in with that is the fact that throughout the Bill there is a continuing sequence of events where far too many decisions which, while they can be taken by the governing body, nonetheless are still subject to the consent and approval of the Minister and the Department.  In an autonomous institute they should be taken by the governing body.  There is an element of constraint within the Bill in relation to the operation and the decision-making process within the institute. These constraints will inevitably have the effect of retarding or restraining enterprise and, perhaps, development to a degree.</P>
    <P>There is also in the manner in which the finance is being allocated to the institute another element of constraint. There is a necessity to seek approval for spending in connection with various items and for the purchase of certain articles. Far too many of these decisions are being made subject to the consent and approval of the Minister and the Department.  I suggest to the Minister that for the institute to be effective, to develop properly and to achieve the task that we want to see it achieve, it requires that extra freedom.  In relation to finance, that freedom could be ensured to some degree by providing finance by way of a block grant and thereby eliminate the necessity of the governing <Col N="1545" /> body having to seek consent and approval for expenditure.</P>
    <P>The institute has been in existence for the greater part of a decade.  It started well and it has progressed well.  We should have confidence in it to do the job that is expected of it without surrounding it with red tape and constraints of one kind or another.  We should remove these constraints where they apply and ensure that it has the freedom and independence to develop as an institute of higher education should.  Let us remove the shadow of over-lordship.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider again the question of the composition of the governing body.  He should take steps to remove the feeling that, if the governing body is appointed on the basis proposed in this Bill, it will be under the shadow of being loaded in favour of the Department and the Minister.  We should provide finance by way of a block grant and have confidence in the capacity, integrity and ability of the governing body to decide how that finance can best be spent for the benefit and progress of the institute.</P>

Is suimiúil an ráiteas é agus is fiú é léamh, agus é a athléamh, mar is scéal iontach ar fad ó thús é, scéal an Fhorais Náisiúnta um Ard-Oideachas i Luimneach.  Is é bunchúis an Bhille, dár ndóigh, ná an Foras Náisiúnta um Ard-Oideachas, Luimneach, a chur ar bonn reachtúil.  Tá an foras ag gníomhú dar ndóigh, le ocht mbliana ar a laghad.  Is dóigh liom gur tosnaíodh leis na cúrsaí i bhFómhar na bliana 1972.  Buíochas le Dia agus buíochas dos na daoine a cheap an scéim agus a cheap an foras, buíochas leo go léir, tá ag éirí go hiontach leis na cursaí agus leis na micléinn. Nuair a tosnaíodh ar na cúrsaí i 1972, ní raibh ann ach 100 macléinn ann agus ní raibh ó thaobh na cúrsaí a bhí le fáil ach oiliúint ar administrative systems, business systems, electronic engineering, European studies and materials and industrial <Col N="1546" /> engineering.  An lá atá inniu ann, idir micléinn lán-aimsire agus páirtaimsire agus micléinn ag gabháil do iarchursaí nó do ard-chúrsai, tá tuairim 2,500 ar na rollaí.  Comhartha eile ar fheabhas an fhorais, an clár atá acu ó thaobh céimeanna a bhaint amach: business studies, administrative systems, European studies, regional studies, public administration, electronic engineering, industrial and management mathematical science, materials and production engineering, energy technology and chemical technology.</P>
      <P>Bhfuil éinne anseo a chreidfeadh go dtiocfadh an feabhas sin laistigh d'ocht mbliana?  I dteannta na gcúrsaí sin tá cúrsaí i gcóir diplomas.

      <P>It is very satisfactory that we are here today to put the NIHE, Limerick, on a statutory basis.  We had lots of comings and goings since the idea was first mooted on 12 December, 1968.  Lots of things have happened since then but certainly the forethought and wide vision of all concerned, from Brian Lenihan who was Minister in 1968 down to our present Minister, who decided on 18 November 1977, that the NCEA was to be a degree awarding body, are very much to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Living in the age we are in, with the extraordinary development we have seen in the recent past and in the knowledge that we are only at the start of an extraordinary development in chemical and electronic technology, it is expedient and necessary for our survival that we compare favourably with the best in the world.  Let nobody have any doubts about it, we have, thanks be to God, very intelligent and dedicated students. There is no reason why they would not <Col N="1547" /> be as good if not better than the best in the world.  It is significant that last year one of the post-graduate students from the NIHE in Limerick took first prize in competition with students of comparable standard from all the EEC countries. That is very satisfactory.  I appeal to all concerned with the running of this institute for very close co-operation between the institute itself and the institute in Dublin when it is functioning fully, and all the regional technical colleges, the State Departments of Agriculture, Industry, Tourism and so on and also the voluntary bodies that encourage development in industry and agriculture and who have very close contact with the State Departments.</P>
    <P>I must refer to something that I believe in very strongly.  I often remind myself of it when I hear of great developments, sensational developments in technology, how we can do far more than we ever did before with new discoveries and so on.  It is great.  But the thought that always comes back to me is this: man lives not on bread alone.  Man cannot be the final arbiter of his own destiny.  It is most important in all educational establishments, in all human activity, especially at this particular time, in our troubled state of mind, in this country, that we remember we have a duty to our conscience and to our country. For that reason&mdash;I do not know exactly how it could be done&mdash;a great deal will depend on the governing body, and to a greater extent on the academic council, to instill into the students, not alone knowledge of what is there and a thirst for knowledge about what is not yet discovered, but also to put these in their proper perspective and to get students, young and old, to realise that they have a duty to use that knowledge to the betterment of their country and their people.  I do not know how that is going to be done.  Possibly, a course of, say, Irish studies, Irish in the broadest sense&mdash;language, culture, music&mdash;to complement the studies they have already undertaken in the technological field. These would give them a direction, because it is no use knowing who we are <Col N="1548" /> or knowing what we are doing; we must also know where we are going.  What does it profit the man to know everything that can be known, to make everything that can be made, if he does not use it for the betterment of his neighbours and his country.</P>
    <P>I wish again to compliment the Minister on his work.  It is one of the biggest achievements in his career.  He should be very proud of it.  The successes that have followed the establishment of an Foras in Limerick have been outstanding and so too, please God, will be the successes when the similar institution comes to fruition in Dublin.  I conclude by referring to part of the Minister's speech in which he sums up admirably the position and the need for such institutions:</P>
    <P>The dynamic growth of the sixties made it quite evident that we had in Ireland qualities which few abroad had previously attributed to us: we could achieve high levels of productivity and rapidly assimilate new knowledge and acquire new skills. Those industrial organisations which came to Ireland in the sixties discovered many of our latent strengths and built upon them.  Initially, of course, much of the newly-generated employment was not particularly sophisticated or intellectually demanding.  However, the sixties served to lay the foundation for a new era of development which commenced in the seventies and is now under way in the eighties.  Ireland is no longer looked upon as a source of cheap, unskilled labour, but as one of the special locations where the engineering business and scientific expertise necessary for the sophistication of the &ldquo;micro-chip era&rdquo; is available.</P>
    <P>Do not let us think for a moment this is the end.  Unless something extra is brought to the knowledge that the students are acquiring, we will get nowhere, economically, socially or culturally.  We must bring with it the knowledge and realisation that we have the duty, as Irish men and Irish women, and as Christians, to fulfil our talents in the service of our <Col N="1549" /> fellow countrymen in every way possible. If we do not do that all the knowledge and skills we have acquired will go for nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in relation to this Bill.  I join with Senator Cranitch in his welcome for it and his congratulations to the Minister on the amount of fruitful effort which has gone into the preparation of this Bill and the enormous amount of background work which, inevitably, has been involved and is only hinted at in the Minister's speech.  I should like to join with Senator Cranitch in relation to the philosophical comments he made which I thought were very appropriate and apt. A combination of the aspects&mdash;the practical ones which the Minister was so concerned about and the philosophical ones Senator Cranitch referred to&mdash;bring us back to the kernel of the Bill and the steps which, quite rightly, are being taken.  We had in the establishment of the State, in our struggle to decide our own institutes, our own way of life, a major part of that, particularly in the early stages in relation to education.  It has, perhaps, been unduly neglected over the years.  That is no reflection on the excellent academics and administrators we have been so fortunate to have here.  I do not think we were able to give higher education the attention which it not only deserved but needed if we were properly to develop as a State.</P>
      <P>Until recently one heard, all too often, references to the universities and non-university institutes in ways which were more reminiscent of a 19th century Victorian novel than of the realities of life in the 20th century, or to the necessities or opportunities of present-day life.  We should reflect upon the fact when considering the Bill that our universities were established primarily on the Victorian pattern of Britain, universities which were set in being primarily to serve the needs of the then United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In many ways they served those needs very well indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Irishmen took advantage of the <Col N="1550" /> opportunities offered and rose to very high positions within the United Kingdom and its colonies overseas, high positions which they won on the merits of the education they had received at higher institutions here.  Nonetheless, those institutions, no matter how excellent, were certainly not initially designed or intended for the opportunities or difficulties of the present day world.  They could not be, by the nature of things, but they have bedevilled our education.  Even today one hears otherwise sensible, responsible parents talking about degree and non-degree granting institutions.  One hears of the confusion that arises in parents' minds, very understandable concern for their children, but often totally irrelevant to present day reality.</P>
    <P>It is important&mdash;here I join with Senator Whitaker&mdash;it is essential that this institute which is being set up should have the highest possible standards, standards which are not only accepted within the institute but accepted by totally independent external persons and bodies.  They should not only be accepted but seen to be accepted.  That is vital not only for the well-being of the institute, not only for the immediate concern of the students and graduates of the institute over the years but it is essential in terms of our national well-being and the acceptability of the educational standards we have here and which, increasingly, must be related to international standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to many companies from overseas setting up here. Those companies are looking for very high standards of education and attainment. They are not necessarily interested in our own problems, our own standards. All they are interested in is that our graduates, our technologists, should be of an acceptable standard.  An acceptable standard in today's world for the sort of industries we are looking for means the very best standard and nothing else.  Unfortunately, it will not be sufficient for us to set those standards and internally adhere to them unless they are examined and seen objectively and <Col N="1551" /> externally to be of a sufficient quality.  I very much echo and support Senator Whitaker's comments.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points of detail, or other philosophical or general points one would like to discuss.  The Minister has referred to them briefly.  I remember, when secretary of the Federation of University Teachers, being involved in many discussions on the arguments pro and con&mdash;there are arguments on both sides and very good arguments&mdash;regarding the higher level institution to be set up in Limerick.  We have reached the best result and I am happy with it.  The setting up of an institute specifically like this, independent of our excellent but rather traditionally orientated universities, is absolutely necessary.  I have found difficulty in certain circles here, even in quite knowledgeable academic circles, getting through the points that in one of the best university institutions in Europe, in Hanover, there is a situation in which, basically, there are two faculties, the faculty of medicine and the technological faculty.  Many people here, with all genuineness, would say that such an institute is not a university and, I suppose, in a Victorian sense it is not. However, in a 1980 sense it is probably one of the best universities in the world. There are many arguments relating to these matters that one could go into.</P>
    <P>Turning to specific points, I note in relation to section 8, on the governing body, that the academic council will, according to subsection (3) (a) be able to design, develop and implement appropriate programmes of study whereas in all the other paragraphs it is either being given power to make recommendations or to make them subject to the approval of the governing body&mdash;with the exception of subsection (3) (b) where it comes back again to tutorial or academic counselling.  I really do hope that this means what it seems to indicate, that the academic council only, not the governing body, not the directorate&mdash;no matter how excellent these people will be&mdash;not the Department of Education, <Col N="1552" /> not anybody else, but the actual academic council will be involved in the design, development and implementation of appropriate courses of study.  That is an absolute, if I may use one of the Minister's phrases, <i>sine qua non</i> in this Bill.  I am very glad to see it and I hope it will be enshrined as a cornerstone in relation to this institute.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with Senator Whitaker in relation to the State-sponsored body.  I can appreciate some of his criticisms but, nonetheless, in some ways what we need is to make it very clear that this is indeed a State-sponsored institution of a very new type and, I would hope, of a very excellent type.  Many of our State-sponsored bodies, in very different ways, have shown the innovation, the inventiveness and the excellence which will be required of this body.  We think of the IDA which is copied worldwide; we think of Córas Tráchtála.  I believe we have an opportunity in this institute to set standards of innovation in a developing country, a country which is changing from a relatively undeveloped agricultural base into an extremely technological country. We have the opportunity here, with this institute playing its part, once more to give, in a very small but very critical way, a lead to many other countries in education.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the position of the director and we have been very fortunate in Limerick in the excellent contribution which Dr. Walsh has made to the development of the institution and indeed to higher education generally here.  The post of director is an absolutely vital post, particularly in such an institute. This is something we have to look at very carefully.  I am not altogether happy that the post of director is a more or less permanet appointment, no matter how excellent the individual concerned may be.  This is an institute which by its very nature, to be successful, will have to be innovated continually.  It would be a great tragedy if, in any way, one got a situation in which bright early ideas became stultified at a later stage.  That is no reflection on any individual; I have <Col N="1553" /> the highest respect and regard for the individual who has been concerned so far; it is just a general attitude of mind which inevitably afflicts all of us at some stage or other.</P>
    <P>I would like to join in welcoming the Bill and, in particular, the range of studies which the Minister referred to.  I am still not happy with these divisions between degrees, diplomas, certificates and so on.  It is the excellence of the course followed, of the teachers involved, of the students themselves and of the examinations which they pass at end which matters, not the actual title of the piece of parchment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in the sense that it is overdue.  It has been a very long gestation period.  I refrain from describing it as a ridiculous mouse. As always, one listens most carefully to the preceding speaker.  Senator Conroy seemed to suggest that many of our traditional universities were conceived a long time ago in a Victorian age and that in some sense their ethos is, perhaps, outdated.  I would remind the House that there is much that we have to be thankful for in our Victorian heritage. Victorian is not necessarily a pejorative word.  Most of our political and parliamentary heritage, in fact, stems from the Victorian era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have more than a passing interest in this Bill because the history of it involved some of us in the traditional university colleges.  I may say that I heartily endorse the Minister's view that his predecessor was very wise in 1968 in resisting the clamour to set up a traditional type university in Limerick. Members may recall that some of the slogans at that time spoke of Limerick's God given right to a university.  We needed another traditional type university in 1968 like we needed a hole in the head.  I say this as someone whose discipline could not be more remote from what is now being done in the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick because I am very much a traditional historian indeed.  But in 1968, and increasingly since then, the wisdom of the decision not to set up another university <Col N="1554" /> in Limerick has been vindicated. There are still those who say that the Burke plan of 1974 might have had a successful development, that if NIHE&mdash;if I may use an appalling but convenient abbreviation&mdash;had been constituted a recognised college of the National University it might have gone on to become that kind of technological institute at its best, that it is, but also have partaken of what is best in the traditional university life as well. However, I agree with the Minister's subsequent steps when his Government returned to office and I am entirely in favour of the exclusive role of the National Council for Educational Awards in connection with this institute.</P>
    <P>Those of us in the university colleges had an invidious task to perform in 1976-77, either in connection with NIHE, or Thomond, in that we were expected to be the midwives of these institutions and there was a brief and rather unhappy connection between the traditional colleges and the Limerick institutions. But it was quite obvious that their whole mode of procedure and their whole objective were totally different from ours.  Even in those disciplines which most closely resembled what was being done in Limerick we did not really have the terms of reference in which to communicate with them.  It was unfair, but understandable, that some of the staff in the national institute and in Thomond have accused us of academic imperialism when the last thing we wanted or needed was to be saddled with the problems of such an institution.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker spoke of an unfortunate and brief-lived marriage, <i>Mopso Nysa datur.</i>  I was very glad that Nysa set up on her own feet.  The Minister's review of history of the institution, as he outlined it in the other House and in this House, has been extremely favourable. He has praised the progress of the institute in glowing terms, has spoken particularly of the unique contribution made by its off-campus experiment and by the co-operative programme.  He expressed the hope that the institute would become, in time, a technological university.  He <Col N="1555" /> approved highly of the activities of the planning board and of the <i>ad hoc</i> governing body, in short, a success story to date with laurels being awarded all round.  It is in that context, and against the Minister's favourable view to date of what has been happening, that it is most difficult to understand the nature of this Bill.  The Bill is out of character with what the Minister said has been the happy history of the institute to date.  I might say, if it is not too personal, that the Bill is also at odds with what we know to be the generous liberal heart that beats under the Minister's formidable exterior.</P>
    <P>In 1969, the Higher Education Authority expressed the hope that the Limerick institute would become an independent authority, udarás neamhspleach, under the general protection of the Higher Education Authority.  It seems to me that the Government have departed radically from this essential recommendation of the HEA, that the Limerick institute should be autonomous.  What this Bill does is to impose a level of ministerial control which is incompatible with&mdash;let us leave aside for a moment such cliches as academic independence&mdash;the institute's own potential for growth, as Senator Whitaker reminded us, with the flexibility which should be allowed to this institute in these early days.</P>
    <P>I have not been approached by anyone from Limerick about this Bill. Maybe that is no compliment to me.  One or two suggestions have been made to me from, shall I say, traditional colleagues who said I should not push the Minister too far on this because if I make a clamour for academic independence and say the Minister should apply the same standards all round and control all third level institutions or control none, he might say: &ldquo;Perhaps I will do that&rdquo;.  I considered such a Machiavellian approach and dismissed it as unworthy of me.  We have to speak up for our Limerick colleagues on this, because it is not only the Limerick people whose hope for the future is being undermined, who <Col N="1556" /> are not being trusted to deliver, but also their counterparts in the institute soon to be set up in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Some Members will recall that the officers already appointed to the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, held a press conference in Leinster House and, while they were very discreet and very diplomatic, it was quite obvious that they were very worried about this Bill.  On the Minister's own statement, this is the model for the national institute in Dublin and the model for Thomand. The question that worries many of us is: is it to be the model for the new university of Cork, the new national university of Dublin, and so on?  I cannot see how you can apply one set of standards to one third level institution and not to the soon to be created universities.  Let me give it another twist.  Why should you insist on the need for ministerial control and public accountability of the national institute in Limerick, but not of institutes which have a great deal of internal independence with not so much public accountability, and which are recognised colleges of a national university in places not 30 or 40 miles from here?</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy took the bull by the horns boldly and said, yes it will be a State-sponsored body.  I would remind Senator Conroy this is at odds with the Minister's own description of a technological university.  Why can we not combine all that is best in the new development, all the exciting things that have been happening in Limerick, and which we need so badly for our own development, with the best in the old academic tradition?  Why cannot we combine technological innovation with academic independence?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his Dáil speech, referred to developments at Eindhoven University where, he suggested, there is a considerable amount of direct public control.  There is on the Continent generally a tradition of State-sponsored education.  Similarly Senator Conroy made a laudatory reference to Hanover. Why should we accept our models and standards from Europe?  Is it not enough that they dictate our economy and, inspleach <Col N="1557" /> creasingly, our foreign policy, without imposing their educational models on us as well?  I would remind those who would dismiss academic independence as a luxury that Germany is a vast country with a long university tradition, but there was not a &ldquo;geek&rdquo; out of most German academics during the most hideous tyranny Europe has experienced.</P>
    <P>I do not want to look at the Bill in detail.  That will come on Committee Stage.  I was delighted to hear Senator Whitaker has amendments to offer.  Needless to say, there are good points in the Bill.  I do not wish the Minister to regard my criticisms as being carping.  For example, it is excellent that the Bill spells out that, where the institute have a business contract to carry out, or an appointment to make, members of the governing body should declare their interest. We observe this by gentlemen's agreements in the traditional universities. I am all for writing this measure of public integrity into the Bill.  As I have said already, I am entirely in favour of the dominant role of the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>What I object to throughout the Bill, and it is in virtually every clause, is the overwhelming and intrusive role of the Minister at every hand's turn, in appointments and in planning but, above all, in the composition of the governing body.  I cannot understand how any academic Senator, in whatever party he finds himself, or on whichever side of the House he sits, can accept this travesty of a governing body.  In a governing body of 25, it is clear that the Minister could have, if needed, 13 out of 25.  He appoints nine members directly and others add up to a majority.  Conversely, it could happen that only three of the academic staff could sit on the governing body of 25.  These restrictions speak for themselves.  Perhaps it is that the Minister does not really see it as a technological university.  Perhaps Governments in general want to see education, as they see broadcasting, as an instrument of public policy.  If so, all I can do, and people like me, is to record our protest.  Of course we accept public <Col N="1558" /> accountability.  I reject the ivory tower nonsense but then I have seen very little of the ivory tower practice.  It is my experience that governing bodies of traditional universities are responsible. They do appreciate the considerable freedom and power that they have and it is not power without responsibility.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Whitaker's suggestions about a cast iron objective appointments system being written into the Bill which would ensure objectivity and high standards. Since the traditional universities find themselves in a somewhat defensive position in all this it is only fair to say that the appointments system in the traditional universities, certainly the NUI, has seen a vast improvement over the last decade particularly.  We have a system whereby in the vast majority of cases&mdash;and all these cases are widely publicised&mdash;appointments are made by unanimous acceptance by the academic bodies of an assessors' board report where sitting on those boards and depending on the seniority of the post involved are people from outside the universities whose voice, if not crucial, is at least highly important to the decision made.  I am quite prepared to see a guarantee for the system written not simply into this legislation but into the impending university legislation as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke in the Dáil about the danger of academic drift.  What can be the only ground on which to excuse the overwhelming ministerial proposed control of the institute is the fear that somehow the institute may not continue to do what they were set up to do, that they will allow their resources to be diverted, that there will be an academic drift.  Is this really why he wants to impose a stranglehold on the national institute in terms of control?  If this is so it is, I must repeat, at odds with what the Minister says have been the responsibility, efficiency and success of the institute in the last five years.</P>
    <P>If I were a member of the National Institute for Higher Education staff in Limerick I should be gravely disturbed by this Bill.  It is, more than anything, <Col N="1559" /> specific.  It has the psychological climate of the Minister and the Government all over the place, so to speak, in every clause of this Bill which should disturb me very gravely in my new beginnings. As I said, I do not know how any Senator who happens to be an academic can support this Bill as it stands and even at this late stage I hope the Minister will look at it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have managed for a fair number of years now not to speak on Bills to do with education because I have a great fear of doing damage in that area.  I have rather directed my little learning into other areas where the damage could not be so great. However, I feel in this case a compulsion to speak and it is not merely because of the negative nature of the points that I will make or which have been made but because of the importance of these points and perhaps because of one general point I want to make not precisely arising out of terms of the Bill itself but rather out of what has been the common theme of this debate.  That is the whole question of technology, which word, if I am not wrong, is not in the Bill.  Maybe I should have found it but I looked for it and did not find it, but it has been referred to many times in this debate and also in the debate in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister has chosen to follow this course that he has with regard to the retention or the taking into his own hands of such enormous powers as seem, from the reading of this Bill, to be taken into the Minister's hands.  Senator Murphy in his contribution described academic freedom as a cliché which he would not use but they are a pair of words which I clasp firmly to my own heart as meaning a very great deal.  He anticipated me and, very correctly, made the point with regard to Germany that there is on the Continent, of which the Minister has cited an example, a tradition of dependence in the Germanic areas on the state which you do not find in these islands and the dangers and real harm of that <Col N="1560" /> became very obvious in the thirties when the independence which we enjoy and know about of our universities would have been exercised&mdash;and indeed in our circumstances that independence was exercised against the dominant politics of the day, as everyone in this House probably knows in the case of University College, Dublin.  Maybe you can fault them for having that view that they had but they maintained their independence which was the significant and important thing.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that since I sat down first in this seat since this debate started I have been handed a letter asking me to use my influence, God help us, to get somebody appointed to a professorship in one of the colleges of the National University of Ireland.  Well, if that is what they do in the greenwood what shall they do in the dry?  If in the actual circumstances of the university colleges at Dublin, Cork and Galway somebody is daft enough to think that I would have an influence which I would care to use in favour of some candidate or that could be used, what on earth is going to happen where it is known from the beginning that the final answers to all these matters are to be found in the Minister?</P>
    <P>It is very important from the point of view of the prestige, self-confidence and continued good performance of this institute that they should have recognised before the world their independence, their right to say no, their right publicly to criticise departmental or educational policy, their right to dissent from industrial policy, their right to engage in social criticism of the degree of industrial development which is taking place, their right to question whether technological development of a particular kind should be used in this island.  They should be encouraged, quite apart from the matter of continuing the pioneering work they have been doing.  I, too, would like to recognise with regard to these applied sciences that they should be ready to take a stance in the consideration of the social and human problems which technology, the very success of man in his use of his knowledge in dominating <Col N="1561" /> nature, is creating for him.  We will go out into these streets later this evening and if we choose our moment wrong how long will it be before we reach wherever we want to go as a result of man's ability to clutter up his routes with more and more of his own inventions? Then, along with that, suddenly, or perhaps after due notice, the source of all this motivation in our streets is going to be withdrawn from us with the drying up of energy and then we will have to cope with all the social consequences of the withdrawal of the motivation of this new technology.</P>
    <P>I want to make two points.  The Minister should be positively limited as to the influence he can exert on the institute. May I say with regard to that that I understand very well how a Minister, such as our present Minister for Education, knowing himself to have nothing but good intentions with regard to this institute, or any other higher institute that there may be, may not see the point that his successors may not be so well disposed and knowing the quality of his advisers, he cannot allow himself to think that a time could come when a Minister might not have such qualities and advice available to him.  It is not a question of all power corrupting because that is not what Acton actually said.  All power tends to corrupt, and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely, and so it does.  It is very dangerous not to have this power in regard to the management of this higher institute of education broken up as much as possible with, what Senator Whitaker rightly said, proper criteria for determining quality appointments to the staff, awards of degrees and so on.</P>
    <P>On Senator Conroy's point, it seems outrageous that I should venture on to a field with Senator Conroy connected with education, but I do.  These pieces of parchment do matter a little bit.  It is just like a good name as regards finance. Nobody knows how good Mr. A may be with a degree, but if Mr. A has a degree that is recognised as of high quality and standard everywhere, he is a luckier man than those holding other pieces of parchment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood the Senator.  I still think a degree has an importance because of usage.  The second point, which I do not intend to pursue at any length, is that I think your company tells you a lot about yourself. If the Minister will be patient with me for making this point once more, it is the old Newman point about education: you are educated rather more by the people who are at the college with you than by the people who are actually teaching you. The word inter-disciplinary has been used.  I take it there is at present an inter-disciplinary approach in the institute in Limerick, but by the nature of things, if there are not departments engaged in the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, in simply studying for the pleasure of it, and if people are not rubbing shoulders with people who are not career orientated&mdash;that was also used&mdash;they will themselves be the lesser people for not meeting and becoming friendly with people who are called to a different type of activity.  For example, take the Church. There are people with vocations who never want to be bishops.  It is very good for bishops that there are plenty of such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know anything about the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, until I read the Minister's speech in Dáil Éireann which was a great aid to me.  I then found out what the previous Government had proposed with regard to this institute, what Senator Murphy referred to as being a recognised college of the national university. That is old ground now.  I do not know how you do it, but it is extremely desirable that the institute be engaged in doing much more than merely producing people for jobs; merely feeding the requirements of industry.  This, apart from anything else, is going to lead to the type of radical criticism, which will have a certain validity, of the institute in Limerick which you found being mounted in the <Col N="1563" /> sixties in America with regard to the academic institutions&mdash;that their existence was justified by their production of people who would be able to feed the armaments industry and be advisers to the Pentagon and so on.  I think it is rather important that there be people mooching around in Limerick who will continue to mooch around doing their bits and pieces of independent research, that may or may not ever see the light of day or may not even be published.  I am not a believer in this determination of the value of a man by the number of papers he publishes.  He may produce only one paper in his life but all the worthwhile colleagues in his area may know he is at it and may be more influenced by the genuineness of his approach than they will be by the serialisaton of the various bits he is getting out.</P>
    <P>It is enormously important for this institute to have the feeling at the end of the day that it is every bit as worthy as University College, Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin, University College, Cork, University College, Galway, Maynooth and any other university.  It must be as good as the best and it must be treated by the Minister in the same way; it must not be in any way subordinate to them.  I cannot feel in my heart that the Minister is going to propose legislation of a like kind in respect of the other academies.  If he is not proposing it, and he should not be proposing to put forward legislation of that kind for these institutions, he should not be proposing this legislation for this institution.  This is my view.</P>
    <P>It may be that an tÚdarás have advised on this matter.  Senator Murphy referred to some report but I want to ask the Minister whether, under the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 an tÚdarás had advised him on the need for this institute or on the nature and form of the legislative measures required.  Section 5 of that Act says:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall advise the Minister on the need or otherwise for the establishment of the new institution <Col N="1564" /> of higher education, on the nature and form of these institutions and on the legislative measures required in relation to their establishment or in relation to any existing institution of higher education.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they have given any advice on this, but in the division of power I would hope that an tÚdarás would be brought in in some way.  Even though its function may only be advisory it still can have conferred on it additional functions by appropriate provisions in this legislation with regard to the operations of this institute.  I make the quick point of a legal character in case the Committee Stage is taken quickly.  Section 2 of this Bill says:</P>
    <P>There shall, by virtue of this section, be established an institute of higher education within the meaning of the Higher Education Authority Act, ...</P>
    <P>There is not any such thing as &ldquo;an institute of higher education within the meaning of the Higher Education Authority Act,&rdquo; as will be seen if one looks at the Higher Education Authority Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other speakers in expressing some disquiet at the way in which this Bill is being framed but, at the same time.  I wish the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick every success in its development for the future.  I fully realise the importance which this institute plays in national life, an importance which will continue and grow and which is underlined by the fact that a similar institution which will be administered on similar lines is being established currently in Dublin.  The pattern which is set out in this Bill is one which will be followed and reproduced elsewhere and it makes this legislation doubly important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the apprehensions of speakers such as Senator Murphy, Senator Whitaker and Senator FitzGerald on the amount of direct ministerial control of the institution.  I believe that the initial <Col N="1565" /> decision to separate this institution from the universities was the right one.  I also feel that the decision to place its certification under the National Council for Educational Awards was also the correct one.  But, having said that, I feel that the NIHE, Limerick, should have been distanced somewhat more from the Minister and his Department.  The problem of freedom is a real one and I am somewhat worried&mdash;I would be more worried if I were a member of the institute staff&mdash;by the provisions of this Bill and particularly the provisions which allow the Minister such a high degree of control.  I echo what Senator Whitaker said.  I believe that the Minister has the very best of intentions but he will not always be in his present position.  As we all know, Ministers are figureheads. Much of our life is spent dealing with bureaucracies of various types&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <P>The Minister is a very decorative person.  I would be happier if there was another body acting as a buffer between the Department of Education and this institute such as universities possess in the Higher Education Authority.  All of us are aware of the difficulties that may arise in terms of an institution such as this where a good degree of freedom and flexibility is needed if the institute is going to attract high quality staff.  That is the first and absolutely vital thing we have got to ensure if it is going to establish courses which will attract high quality students. There are very many students in this country who would benefit from the sort of courses which are given by the NIHE, which are not generally given in the traditional universities.  I am delighted to see emphasis in a different direction from the traditional one.  It is absolutely right. Some push from the top was required to set this in motion.  If the motion is to continue to attain the mathematical perfection which we would desire it to have, then I believe that the institute once set on its own feet should have been given some more autonomy and less <Col N="1566" /> ministerial direction than is set out in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Not very long ago I fought a long and a lone battle in this House&mdash;in the dying days of the previous Government&mdash;to preserve the independence of the scientists in a certain Government institute.  It was already a semi-State body but in my opinion it was going to be an even more semi-State body than it had been before in the face of some changes in the administrative structure.  Ultimately, although not on that particular occasion, my side of the argument turned out to be that acted on.  The scientists involved working in an institute which has the highest of high reputations for pure research and applied research in agriculture felt that their position was threatened by administrative changes which would have brought them more firmly under the control of the Government Department involved.</P>
      <P>I echo this plea to set the institute on the road and then give it the maximum possible degree of freedom.  The Minister referred to the parallel drawn with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an interesting and very worthwhile comparison with what we would hope the NIHE will develop into.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has reached the position in the forefront of educational institutions in the world mainly because a high component of its effort and its money has been put into pure research.  It has some of the greatest pure research scientists in the fields in which that institute deals with.  These are men who are not working in their fields because of the particular applications in different areas; they are interested in science for its own sake.  From the very first the MIT set out to attract pure scientists of the very highest calibre just because they were pure scientists and it has succeeded in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised and delighted on a visit to the institute some years ago to find that, although it had not been the original intention of that body, it in fact had a small but excellent Arts department. The Minister will be glad to learn that in that department there are men <Col N="1567" /> with a fine knowledge of the classics, men who excel in the literary field.  As it was explained to me, they could give a broader sweep to the educational range of that institution and they were performing a valuable service.  One should not neglect either side of this sort of equation.</P>
    <P>First, the NIHE will need to recruit pure scientists whose skill and devotion is to their science and not necessarily to any applications of that science.  Of course they will be involved, but the pure scientist is a pure scientist. Generally he is interested in things for their own sake.  I am certain that if this body is to develop there will have to be a mixture of the pure scientist and the person dealing with applied science.  That is the best mixture and the most productive one.  It is the interaction between the people working at the very forefront of knowledge and the people who are working with very many applications of knowledge in industry, and in the various walks of life to which science has been applied, which provides the real stimulus, the real development and the real interest for students and, in actual practical in economic terms it probably also provides the best pay.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that some of the appointments will have to be men who pursue art for art's sake.  I use &ldquo;art&rdquo; in the wider sense of the term.  There is no doubt, and many speakers have stressed this, that equality of the staff who are appointed is absolutely essential.  I would generally follow Senator Whitaker's line and say that cast-iron methods of appointment are needed to ensure that the highest quality people get the appointments.</P>
    <P>I would also like to back up Senator Whitaker on the problem of standards of degrees, diplomas and so on.  We need to ensure that these are of the very highest calibre and if we do so now I am sure that there will not be the problem of second-class citizens <i>vis-a-vis</i>, the universities. I would hate to see this.  We definitely need educational institutions <Col N="1568" /> which deal with the components of our education with which the NIHE will deal, and we must ensure that the standards are of the very highest.  The only way we can do this is by obtaining the services of external professors from the recognised professional bodies elsewhere.  It is not enough to try to validate the degree certificates and diplomas internally.  Anybody who has worked in third level education will know that external validation is essential.  I would like to see this written into the Bill in a specific form.  It is an absolutely fundamental point which I intend to develop on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would join in a plea from all sides of the House that, in establishing the NIHE and in putting its relevant legislation on the Statute Book, we give that body the highest possible degree of autonomy and the greatest possible level of flexibility and that we cut down to the minimum acceptable level the dangers that very intimate contact with the bureaucracy can always have to such an institution.  We should ensure by this legislation that the NIHE Limerick and its successor in Dublin&mdash;and surely the pattern will be reproduced to a fair extent when the Dublin institute is legislated for&mdash;fulfil the extremely important role they have to play in Irish third level education to the very best of their ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have spoken in this House when the Minister was with us, and I should like to welcome him.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick Bill, 1980, and to say at the outset that the development of the institute is extremely welcome.  The campaign in the Limerick region for a number of years was for what was termed a university, to seek equal status, if you like, with Cork, Dublin and Galway.  I am very glad that what has developed in Limerick is this National Institute for Higher Education rather than a body with the title of university.  At that time one could see that the future in this country was a technological one and that, in so far as employment in the marketplace was concerned, <Col N="1569" /> people emerging from the universities with qualifications in the arts were facing a period of tremendous problems.  We were educating far more people than this country had the capacity to employ in the Arts and not nearly enough emphasis was being put at that time on technical education, I welcome this most welcome change. This Institute for Higher Education is in line with the activities in the regional technical colleges.  One of the very significant events in this country in the last decade has been such a spawning of activity in this technical education field. With the present emphasis on industrial employment and technological employment, these institutes obviously take a major part in the role of successive Governments in creating jobs.</P>
      <P>I welcome this development, also, because I have seen activities in Germany and other countries and the emphasis on technical education there. For example, in Trondheim in Norway there is an NTH College which is a major institute.  In these very advanced countries, had they not a generation ago developed these technical education structures, they would not today be in their present very strong position. Perhaps we might have advanced much further as a nation if we had at an earlier stage put an emphasis on technical education.  With the emergence of free second level and third level education in this country, until recently it might have been the ambition of every mother that her children go to university and, to an extent, there was a notion that a technical institute was an institute of somewhat lesser standing.  I hope that things are now turning full circle, against our crippling statistics of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that, in welcoming this institute, which is in the country's interest, the debate should not take the form of a concensus, because there should be a concensus about this type of development. It is sad that the negative aspects of the Bill have been emphasised by a number of speakers in this House and, indeed, by independent speakers as well as those in the political parties.  Obviously, <Col N="1570" /> if there are weaknesses in the structure of this Bill and public misgivings about the structure, Members of this House must, as is their function, concentrate in this debate on these deficiencies rather than compliment the Minister on the better sections in this Bill.  Certainly in this Bill there are very useful sections in the setting up of the structure and there is much on which the Minister and the parliamentary draftsmen are to be commended.  I know the Minister, I hold him in high regard and am quite certain that the furthest thing from his mind is to set up a structure which might be politically suspect, or, in so far as the present Government are concerned, a structure which might imply that it is a structure which is going to be pulled with political strings by the present Government. I know the Minister much better than that.  However, the problem is that it is not a matter that justice must be done but justice must be seen to be done. In the setting up of the structure, with the heavy hand of the Minister and of the Department and the familiar type of cynicism in this country, whether or not justice is going to be done, it will not be seen to be done, and this is not a very good start for this institute.  Also, this is the first such institute in this country and, as such, where the Government are committed in principle to the development of other such institutes, this clearly is the model being set up for other institutes. The precedent established by this Bill when passed by the Oireachtas will presumably be the model on which further institutes in Dublin and elsewhere in the country will be based.  It is for these reasons that there is disquiet.</P>
    <P>Regarding the debate in Limerick, at that time they sought equal status with the university and this institute has emerged. They have been told that it is comparable with university training but that it is simply a different type of education. If the universities have traditionally and continue to have a great deal of autonomy, an independent spirit and independent decision making, if this structure has by and large been acceptable to Governments and if the institute in Limerick is equal in status to a university, <Col N="1571" /> then why do the present Government not grant to this institute in Limerick, in terms of the governing structure and in terms of the administration, a somewhat similar structure at least so that the same spirit of independence can develop?  I join my colleague Senator Murphy in seeking a marriage between the technical and the university structures which have served this country very well.</P>
    <P>The universities have not been geared for technological education and this institute is, but can we afford to throw over traditions running back for centuries? Can we afford to throw over these administrative or governing traditions in this whiz-kid age of the 1980s? That is damaging and a dangerous precedent is being created.  Although I know it is far from the Minister's mind that this should be the background, this will be seen to have political undertones. We completely support the development of this institute in Limerick.  It is one of the great events in this decade; but it is very sad that, instead of discussing the establishment of the structures of this institute in the Oireachtas, we cannot have a concensus between the three political parties and the independent Senators. Obviously, because of the structure being proposed it is necessary that we should differ.  For that reason the Fine Gael spokesman for education in Seanad Éireann will put down a number of amendments for Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is against the principle of autonomy and against the notion of independence of a highly-qualified staff.  It is sad that this is happening in the vocational education sector.  It seems to run through the vocational education system.  Even at local level, in the administration of the vocational schools, I take exception to the structure through which committees of county councils appoint teachers because I have seen too many appointments made where graduates are expected to doff the cap against a background of political controls to those on various county councils. <Col N="1572" /> I do not say that in a narrow political sense, as this is completely unacceptable. I urged the last Minister for Education to change the system, and I urge the present Minister to do so.  This vocational aspect of education at all levels seems to be bedevilled by notions of interference.  While there may be many very good people on the board, I object to the fact that so many of the Minister's people are on the board.  The Minister can apparently appoint nine directly and four indirectly from the representatives of the regional technical college, from the teaching staff and from the management boards.  It is very unacceptable. Even the term &ldquo;director&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;president&rdquo; really implies that he is the agent of the Minister in running the college.</P>
    <P>This institute will face problems in their relationship with the Higher Education Authority, which up to this was liasing with them in regard to the establishment of forms of administration.  In relation to functions, under section 4, to provide degrees and so on and other courses with the approval of the Minister, the heavy hand of the Minister comes in again.  In another section in this Bill, when a structure has developed and when a staff of professors and lecturers have been appointed, if in terms of discipline it is necessary to remove or to suspend a member of the staff of the institute, apparently the institute cannot remove or suspend a member of the staff without the consent of the Minister.  This weakens the authority of the governing body of this new institute.</P>
    <P>If this institute has similar status to that of universities and if the universities have representation in the Seanad of which we are Members, what is the position of those who study and qualify from the institute in Limerick?  If it has similar status, then it should have similar representation through the same structure of electing the university Senators. A fight was fought to develop technical education, and to suggest that this new institute be at least equal if not better in this age than any university college.  But in the setting up of the structure we are <Col N="1573" /> not being fair, because we are strangling the institute by the heavy hand of the Minister.  I know that the Minister is the last person consciously to establish a political structure, but it will be interpreted in this way.</P>
    <P>We welcome the establishment of this institute in the broadest terms possible for all of the reasons that have to do with the technical age and the necessity for technical education.  However, we believe it is very sad that on the introduction of this Bill there are so many aspects that are controversial and that we cannot have the necessary consensus.  For that reason that we find ourselves in the position of having to oppose on Committee Stage a number of these sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome the Bill, as do most people in this House.  It is a very important development in Irish education.  There is no doubt but that the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick gives us very good reason for satisfaction and great hope for the future.</P>
      <P>It is very important that a Bill like this would appear to be as free as possible from any type of political connotations.  I do not say that in the context of whatever Minister for Education we might have either in this Government or in another Government, but is it prudent for education as we know it and particularly for an institute of this type to have a situation whereby the nominees of the Minister would in fact total more than half the board?  Most of those things do not turn that way.  However, perhaps in relation to a few small changes in the make-up of the board, we could prevail on the Minister at this stage, rather than wreck a very good Bill, to have a rethink on the composition of the board.  This heralds an innovation in Irish education.  There is no doubt but that it is time that this emphasis came to be.  The functions as stated in the Bill are wide-ranging enough to take care of any major changes that might occur in education at this level in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> I congratulate the people who drafted this Bill.  On the question of the membership of the board, the Minister's nominees total 13 out of 25.  While I have no doubt that it is very important for the Minister for Education of the day to have more than a vested interest in an institute of this kind, nevertheless, because of the fact that it is involved in the educational field, there should be no shortcuts on behalf of anybody involved in the education of our third level students and anybody on a board such as that of NIHE should be there in the best interests of education generally.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that it was found necessary that it should be seen publicly that 13 out of 25 nominees would be the Minister's nominees.  The people appointed with the Minister's approval might be there in the very best interests of education but people might not see it that way. When it comes to Committee Stage I will have to press the Minister to have a rethink on this question.  Other than that, it is a very good Bill and long overdue. One hopes that the lesson to be learned from the institute in Limerick will spread across the country and that the type of education and courses provided will train students for various positions in life.  If we are to keep up with this fast-changing psychological world it is important that we have people trained for the right pursuits in life.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent Bill but, because of the composition of the board and in the best interests of education generally, would it be possible for the Minister to change his number of nominees and thus ensure we have an institute deeply involved in education and autonomous as far as possible.  I hope the Minister takes note of the serious reservations that the members of Fine Gael have on this Bill. When it comes to Committee Stage perhaps there may be changes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien in opening the debate <Col N="1575" /> for the Opposition gave a very well balanced view of the Bill before the House.  He referred to the long delay in the development of the institutions, which arose from the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and regretted it.  It is as well to set that Act in its context.  From 1929 to 1940 the whole world was in a very depressed state and, in particular, industrialised countries were in serious economic difficulties.  It was not a question of their reaching out and seeking for people with vocational training, technician training or technological training, it was a matter of trying to survive in a period which does little credit to anybody who was involved in trying to organise the world at that time.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on the record of the House my appreciation of the part that Senator Mulcahy played many years ago in the development of the technological part of our education system.  As the House knows, he was a pioneer in this respect and worked very hard on the committee which recommended the establishment of a chain of regional technical colleges throughout the country which would make technological education available to as many as possible in as many regions as possible with the allied view that industrial development would follow upon the establishment of these regional technical colleges.  The House remembers that the commission mentioned the desirability of setting up new colleges and the idea of the national institutes grew from that recommendation, although the national institutes, being heavily in the technological area, are not quite what was recommended by the commission when it mentioned new colleges.</P>
    <P>We got back to our old discussion with Senator Keating about the relative merits of what were called, by a man who died this morning, C.P. Snow, the two cultures.  It is very easy to pick up something like that which had its own insights and which was a very important lecture in its time.  It is very important to place it in its own social context because <Col N="1576" /> many of the points made by C.P. Snow in that lecture were to be taken in the context of the university which he attended and the social set-up in the country in which he lived.  It is true, and has been mentioned in the course of this debate, that in many European countries there is a strict dichotomy between what we know as the traditional university and the technical institutes or technological universities.  In this country we had a marriage of convenience quite a long time ago.  Senator Staunton indicated that the universities were not properly here for technological input.  We have in our universities civil engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, agricultural engineering.  All these disciplines are already incorporated in one or other of the universities we have already.  It is easy to develop a kind of cerebral argument about the two cultures as Senator Keating was doing, without their having very much reality in the country as a whole or at least outside certain restricted areas, particularly in our capital city.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery emphasised and praised the importance of the cooperative element in the education being provided in the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick, but he thought a full year of connection with an industry was excessive and indicated that in some instances they had cut that down.  He said perhaps this was an indication that the period they are using now is too much.</P>
    <P>The second point he made on that&mdash;and perhaps these are detailed points which should be raised on Committee Stage&mdash;was the possibility that, when students from the institute got accustomed to working in industry, this would discourage them from doing postgraduate work later on, that they would be affected by the desire to be working and earning immediately and consequently, the research part of the institute would suffer as a result.  This is a possibility.  The acting director of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, was very keen that a develop-changin <Col N="1577" /> ment in research should take place.  In my opening speech I indicated the exact strength of the research group there at the moment.  Perhaps another suggestion that Senator Hillery made could come into play&mdash;I thought of it when he was speaking&mdash;if there is an industry which finds that the talents of a particular student from the National Institute, Limerick now, Dublin in the future, suit that particular institute, they could make a grant available to him to do the research.  Consequently he, the institute and the industry would get the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned the danger of overemphasis on any particular development and he mentioned the danger of going overboard on electronics and particularly on electronic design at the expense of production engineering.  These are details but they are, no doubt, details that will be taken cognisance of by the institute.  I know that nearly everybody who feel it incumbent on him or her to make a speech nowadays must make some reference to micro-chips or electronics or the speed of technological advance and so on.  There might be a danger that there would be overemphasis on this area.  I am not in the position to say that there is but a warning perhaps is no harm at all.  Our duty should be to see to it that the courses are available for people to take up the position in the rapidly expanding electronic industry.  We should also be thinking in the education world about what will happen when the computer makes people redundant.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us to think educationally, apart from economically and socially, about this particular problem.  There is also an obligation on us to think out and research the best course for people, so that their minds will be as flexible and adaptable as possible and as creative as possible because they will have to train and retrain many times during their lifetime.  It is important also in 1980 to put on record that we should not allow in 1984 a fictional 1984 situation to develop and to make sure that the type of education we are giving <Col N="1578" /> will see to it that the citizens will be in charge of the technology and not vice versa.</P>
    <P>Thug Senator Whitaker óráid mhaith agus bhí sé soiléir go ndearna sé macnamh ar an gceist.  Dúirt sé go raibh brón air gur sórt bord Stáit a bhí i gceist againn sa Bhille, nach raibh solúbthacht&mdash;de réir mar is cuimhne liom na focail a bhain sé usáid astu&mdash;ag baint leis an institiúid mar gheall ar an mBille agus go raibh mion-laincísí ar an institiúid, laincísí nach bhfuil ar na hollscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liomsa go bhfuil sé seo fíor. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil gad ar bith ar an institiúid agus is féidir liom a rá nach bhfuilim ag glacadh leis na leasaithe a luaigh sé.  Bhí sé ag caint ar níos mó cumhachta a thabhairt don bhord ach ag an am chéanna ní ag tabhairt níos mó cumhachta don mbord a bhí na leasuithe ach a mhalairt ar fad.  Níl a fhios agam go bhfuil sé sin cóir nó an bhfuilim ag déanamh éagcóir ar an Seanadóir ach de réir mar a thuigimse an scéal deireann sé go gcuireann an Bille laincisí ar an institiúid ach mar sin féin tá laincis aige féin ar an mbord nó dhá laincis san méid a bhí le rá aige faoin chaighdeán agus faoi na poist ins an institiúid.</P>
    <P>Éinne a léigh an méid atá ráite agamsa cheana féin sa Dáil agus in áiteanna eile sa tir tuigeann sé gur leag mise béim ó thús ar thábhact an chaighdeáin agus tá mé sásta go bhfuil an caighdeán sin le fáil ón NCEA.  Dúirt an Seanadóir nach raibh aon dualgas ar an NCEA saineolaí nó saineolaithe a thabhairt isteach ón gcoigríoch ionas go ngeallfadh siad an caighdeán ins an institiúid, ach mar sin féin rinne mise taighde ar an scéal agus tháinig mé ar an eolas gur tháinig 41 saineolaithe cheana féin ag cabhrú leis an NCEA ionas go mbeadh caighdeán ceart ag na dioplómaí agus ag na céimeanna a bhronntar ón NCEA.</P>
    <P>Luaigh Senator Whitaker freisin go raibh baint ag Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann leis an institiúid, go raibh sé mar choláiste aitheanta a dhein ollscoil ar feadh tamaill agus gur mise a chuir an colscaradh i gcrích.  Ní bhéinn sa ghnó sin ach mar cheap nach raibh aon dul as <Col N="1579" /> agam agus go dtiocfadh feabhas ar an scéal dá mba rud é go raibh an colscaradh sin ann.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Whitaker freisin gur chóir go mbeadh institiúid againn, foras againn a mheallfhadh micléinn ón acadúlacht go dtí an teicneolaoícht.  Ceapaim go diongbhálta go bhfuil sé sin fíor, go bhfuil an institiúid sin ann agus go neartaíonn an Bille seo an institiúid.</P>
    <P>When Senator Whitaker mentioned the idea that it was a State corporation rather than an educational institute I felt it was not exactly a fair criticism. Somebody took up the point later&mdash;I believe Senator Howard mentioned it also&mdash;and said that it was not a State board we needed.  However, without it being a State board there are several aspects of many of a State board&mdash;I mention in Senator Howard's own area, SFADCo&mdash;which could be of benefit to the NIHE, namely, enterprise, the drive, push, and energy, the attempt to innovate and bring in new ideas, all those could be predicated off a national institute with benefit.  I am 100 per cent in agreement with Senator Whitaker's ideas about standards, as I said in Irish, and staff appointments.  The most important point of all is to make sure that the standard is high.  Whatever others think about us we should make sure that the standard is high.  The NCEA has an obligation in that respect, an obligation which I have emphasised time and again in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere, either at NCEA or NIHE occasions. The Membership of the Dáil and the Seanad is in agreement with me on this.  I indicated that 41 foreign experts have been on various occasions, and in various disciplines, invited here to ensure that the standards laid down for certificates, diplomas and degrees by the NCEA are of the highest international repute.  We could maintain that.  We do not necessarily have to write it into this Bill.</P>
    <P>Staff appointments are also to be the subject of an amendment by Senator Whitaker.  He referred to the appointments in the NUI and the system of appointments <Col N="1580" /> there.  Senator Murphy later said that there was an improvement.  I believe he is right and that an improvement has taken place in that regard.  The House might like to know the system that is being followed at the moment by the institute which is as of now an <i>ad hoc</i> institute without statutory being.  Posts are advertised at home and abroad, some more extensively than others, depending on the specialism required. There is a five-man selection board constituted of two members of the senior academic staff of the institute and two people who are not members of the institute. Usually one of these is a senior academic of another third level institution. There is also a chairman who is a member of the governing body who is not on the staff of the the institute.  To my mind, that is a reasonably good board for selection.  In fact, if the basic qualifications are laid down and the procedure which has been adopted hitherto by the institute does not result in the best person getting a position, I cannot see that board of assessors from outside being in any better position for doing that.  I know of a flagrant case in a university where the board of assessors unanimously recommended a person but he was not appointed to a position.  All we can do is to strive for the ideal position. I do not think it is necessary to incorporate any structure in the Bill for the making of appointments.  Wide advertising is important and a responsible board of the institute is important to advise the governing body making the appointment.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard traced the relationship of the institute to the original grouping which pushed for a university in Limerick.  He asked for a guarantee that the proper funding would be available for the institute and I have no hesitation in giving that guarantee and in also asserting that the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on the student body of the NIHE Limerick has been very high indeed. Those who read the Dáil Official Reports will know that from an answer I gave to a parliamentary question not so long ago.  Senator Howard thought there was a lack of freedom for the governing <Col N="1581" /> body and also echoed the sentiment about a State board.  I mentioned that already.  There are certain aspects of State boards, particularly the State board in the Senator's own region, that many of our academic institutions could be doing with.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point that NIHE Limerick is a designated institution for the purposes of the higher education authority&mdash;An tUdarás Árd Oideachas, which sits as the assessor of needs and makes the recommendation. Luaigh an Seanadóir Cranitch an bás a tháinig ar an institiúid agus an forbairt a tháinig air ó bunaoidh é mar institiúid <i>ad hoc</i>.  Mhol sé caighdeán na gceimeanna agus caighdeán na dioplomaí.  He went on to refer to the extraordinary expansion in chemical and electronic technology and the need to have educational structures to cope with these developments.  He emphasised one thing to which I attach particular importance, the link and co-operation between the regional technical colleges and the national institute.  This is fundamental to the whole thinking behind the structure.</P>
    <P>People who finish a certificate or diploma course, as the case may be, in a regional technical college should have places available to them in the national institute so that they will be able to move up in their own particular discipline from certificate to degree level.  He also mentioned the importance of keeping a link with the various voluntary bodies and the various promotional institutes in the various spheres of our national life, and this is important also.  Rinne sé tagairt sular éirigh sé as do thábhacht an éigse, do thábhacht na nithe spioradálta san institiúid agus dúirt sé nach raibh maitheas ar bith i bhforbairt den tsórt seo mura mbeadh grá tíre agus gnéithe den éigse seo le fáil ins an institiúid freisin.  Is doigh liom go bhfuil an institiúid ag gníomhú mar is cóir sa méid sin i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy felt that higher education has not had the attention and support it deserved up to now and that the type of university development was one which was designed to produce people <Col N="1582" /> for the service of the Crown and that very often it was not alive to the present reality.  I am not in agreement with him on that.  As I have indicated already many of the areas of engineering have been wedded to the concept of the old traditional university and wedded successfully. There is no danger in this sphere of the colscaradh to which Senator Whitaker has referred.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy also emphasised, in agreement with Senator Whitaker, the importance of standards and of external assessment.  I have indicated to the House that there is a very substantial element of the use of the external assessor already in this field.  In fact, the amendment more rightly belonged to the Bill for the establishment of the National Council for Educational Awards.  Indeed, it might be that the council itself would, on a triennial basis or every five years or so, invite, as well as the people they invite each year to act as assessors, people to make a general assessment of the standards for them.  But we are not particularly involved in that here.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to how vital it was to have an effective director and expressed satisfaction with the quality of work done by the existing director.  He said he was unhappy with the idea of the director being permanent and, indeed, there are people in other institutes of higher education worried about this whole problem of people holding office for a long time.  The Senator said that innovation, keeping in touch with new discoveries and fresh ideas was of the very nature of this institute and that all of us tend to become dulled and to run out of innovation as time goes on.  It is a problem with regard to all institutes of higher education; it is one that perhaps they themselves and those of us who are involved heavily in education should address ourselves to.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy went on to pick up one point that Senator Conroy made and denied that Victorian was necessarily a pejorative adjective and went on to point out that many of our political ideas and so on developed from that period.  He agreed that this institute was the right <Col N="1583" /> type of institute for Limerick and expressed very strongly the view that in 1968 we did not need just another university college.  I know that University College, Cork, was involved in the various moves that were made with regard to the status of the institute in Limerick.  I have already written formally to UCC to thank them for the amount of work they did at that time.  He rightly said that there was no question of academic imperialism involved.  The task was thrust upon them rather than the initiative coming from them and they trying to push out their own imperial frontiers in the direction of Limerick.  This is true and the same is true of the involvement of UCG.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator Murphy when he says that the Bill is out of character with the sentiments expressed. I do not think there is an overdue measure of Ministerial control built into the Bill.  This was a theme that was repeated time and again by other Senators.  In fact amendments were made by me on the suggestion of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  There is no intention on my part&mdash;and I do not think careful reading of the Bill will indicate it&mdash;to arrogate to myself too much power.  The level of Ministerial control is well below what is exercised, as has been said elsewhere, in other institutes.</P>
    <P>When Senator Murphy asked the question&mdash;and it is a proper question to ask&mdash;why should we accept standards or models from Europe, he went on to say something I did not agree with, that they were already dictating our foreign policy and so on.  We have a greater involvement in Europe.  The development of our economy now has to be influenced more and more by Europe.  I mentioned Eindhoven in the Dáil, I mention it here now to indicate that, as is the European tradition mentioned by Senator Murphy, there is a far greater degree of control in these institutions in Europe.  That was not why I brought it up at all.  The reason I brought it up was <Col N="1584" /> that there was an indication that standards might fall in these circumstances. What I am saying is that it does not logically follow that the standards do fall, and that in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, where a far greater degree of control is exercised, very high standards indeed can be achieved.  That was the particular reason I brought up the points that there is not a necessary link between standards achieved and the degree of control exercised.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy praised the section of the Bill which demanded a declaration of interest on the part of anybody who was involved in any of the business of appointments or other business of the institute where there could be a clash of interest. He also supported the nomination of the National Council for Educational Awards as the award-making council for the institute.  I would be sorry to think there was any truth in his suggestion that the Minister's role, as outlined in the Bill, would be deleterious to the working of the institute.  The progress it has made so far was made by it purely as an <i>ad hoc</i> body.  Very generous amounts of money were allocated by the various Governments since it was set up as <i>ad hoc</i> body and all that took place in a context where there was no statutory basis.  To use a phrase somebody else used, if this could happen in the green wood, let us hope that it will take fire in the dry.  The Senator indicated general support for the views about the appointment system and standards, but denied that this ivory tower situation existed to the extent that some people claim it does in our higher education field.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned academic drift.  It has happened elsewhere that institutes which were designed to provide a sound technological education, with special &ldquo;isms&rdquo; in certain spheres, moved away out of that altogether and developed a large sociological side.  In the end, that kind of sociological tail wagged the technological dog.  This is something which we do not want to happen. I am not conceding that the Department have put a stranglehold on the institute <Col N="1585" /> in order to avoid that.  It is important that the institute knows exactly what it is doing, what its role is, and that it should dedicate itself to that role.  This is in no way restrictive of it within the field for which it is designed.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald talked&mdash;and scared me because I am afraid of power&mdash;of the enormous powers of the Minister.  I do not concede that a closer reading of the Bill will in any way validate this claim by Senator FitzGerald.  He mentioned the tradition of Germanic control on the Continent, and indeed Gallic control, because, as a centralised idea, this is at least as evident in France.  He said that this idea of control of a higher education institute was not one we had in these islands.  That is true.  He said there was a danger in it. Senator Murphy mentioned how silent the members of the various German universities were during the great tragedy that occurred in that country in the thirties, which led to the dreadful war from 1939 to 1945.</P>
    <P>I think of another European country on the eve of another conflict.  In a university the famous Spanish writer and philosopher, Unamuno, when one of the new leaders in that country shouted, &ldquo;<i>Abajo la inteligencia</i>&rdquo;, Down with the intellect&rdquo;, &ldquo;<i>Muerte a la inteligencia</i>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Death to the intellect&rdquo;, stood up and said he was speaking in the temple of the intellect, that he would not sit there and allow this philosophy to be propounded. We would hope that no higher institute of education in this country would fall down in that situation.  I would claim in the case of Unamuno, it owes as much to the individual character of the people as to the institute for which he was speaking.</P>
    <P>In an institute like the one in Limerick, the freedom to criticise whether educational policy, or industrial policy, or social policy, should be cherished and will be cherished.  There is nothing in this Bill which would indicate that the Minister, or the Government, or anybody else, would have any power to prohibit this.  I have no power in it that will either corrupt me or tend to corrupt <Col N="1586" /> me, with all due apologies to Lord Acton. Senator FitzGerald also emphasised the importance of the high standard of the qualifications given.  I have already said I too attach this importance to it.  It is essential.  Steps have been taken in the other Act to ensure that.</P>
    <P>The inter-disciplinary aspect was also referred to.  It is important, although sometimes I wonder whether we do not attach too much importance to it.  In the traditional university where you have science, arts, commerce, engineering, I wonder whether, in some of them at least which have grown rather large, there is much cross-fertilisation as of now. Perhaps where you have a residential situation, there is more than there is in the non-residential.  At a meeting with the Irish Federation of University Teachers recently, one member of the delegation from one of the smaller colleges said there was a deal of cross-fertilisation and cross-pollination.  That is the ideal.  As the Senator said, rubbing shoulders with others who are following different disciplines is important and is an important part of the education of students.  This is catered for in the institute in Limerick to a certain extent, perhaps not as much as would be desirable, perhaps not as much in the other universities and university colleges in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If I may be permitted to reminisce I remember going to a lecture given in London when I was doing some work there.  I was an exile from Erin.  It was a talk by Professor Bowra a very famous classicist who had a knowledge of all European languages and was professor of poetry at that time at the University of Oxford.  I was sitting beside a student who was doing post-graduate work, having got his Special B.Sc.  It was a degree of a particularly high standard.  When the lecture was over we adjourned to the students union for a bottle of ale and he told me he had not the remotest idea of what the man had been talking about. The actual lecture was perhaps a far-fetched one.  He was interpreting national character from the literatures of various countries.  As he knew all the European <Col N="1587" /> languages from ancient Greek up, he made a particularly interesting job of it. It was a very interesting lecture but the student said that he did not understand it at all.  In a sense it proved the dichotomy of the highly specialised scientific discipline.  He was a student of an Irishman called J.D. Bernal of whom no doubt the House has heard.  He said that when the lecture was published he would buy it and study it.  Some of the lecture was a bit far-fetched but it was in the traditional academic strain.  It was disturbing to find somebody who had achieved a very high distinction in pure science would make that admission and it would bear out what Senator FitzGerald said with regard to the importance of the admixture.</P>
    <P>He also emphasised the importance of independent research.  I have referred to the research element already.  I know that the director was very keen that there should be post-graduate work in the institute and feared that he might be prohibited from having this.  I mentioned in my opening speech that there is considerable research, but possibly not quite as independent as the Senator was thinking of, going on there at the moment.  I am sure that the research is in the applied field more than any other.</P>
    <P>Senator West also referred to the importance of pure research.  I may make a comment on that later on.  The Senator made a point at the very end of his speech and I am not quite sure if I understand what he meant.  He said that there was no such provision in the Bill for setting up An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas.  Section 1 (1) (c) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 specifies &ldquo;institution of higher education&rdquo; as:</P>
    <P>an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act;</P>
    <P>That is the reference which has cross-reference in the Bill before the House.  I do not have to express resentment at being <Col N="1588" /> called a figurehead again by Senator West as I interrupted him to do so.  He also was very insistent on the freedom and talked about the importance of pure research.  I must confess that I am not fully aware of the fields which are being researched now but I would be inclined to believe that the research that is being done is in applied science or how to apply science in the various fields for which the institute caters.</P>
    <P>Senator West made the point that the MIT had achieved a very high name in the field of technology, one of the highest in the world, and he talked about the importance of pure science in that context as well as the importance of maintaining a liberal arts stream in the institute.  Some of the older universities insisted in the case even of applied science degrees that degrees of more or less importance in the liberal arts should be taken as well.  That used to be the tradition.  Again his emphasis was on standards and on the quality of appointments. I have commented on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to the situation where we had too many arts graduates and too few in technology hitherto.  I always like to distinguish in this field because it is not so much what they graduate in as the danger of feeling that they have been stereotyped for certain positions that I would quarrel with. People in, for example, the computer field have told me that arts graduates very often make very good trainees in the field of applied computer science, not merely at graduate level but at the level of the leaving certificate.  The idea of being programmed or stereotyped or ready to be put into a certain type of job has done more harm than the actual quality of the certificate or the range of subjects studied because a student holding the leaving certificate or a B.A. degree may feel inclined to say, &ldquo;I am not qualified for anything other than this or that or the other type of job.&rdquo;  Those of us who are in the education world could encourage people to think more widely, to think in terms even of apprenticeships and various technician jobs even where the weight of subjects studied has been <Col N="1589" /> in the other field.  I do not want to sound unrealistic but I have been at various AnCO centres and found people with arts degrees doing courses there.  This is all to the good and if we could expand that kind of thing it would be all the better.</P>
    <P>I made the point already with regard to what Senator Staunton said, that our traditional universities had nothing to do with technology.  He did not say it in so many words but he said that the marriage of technological and traditional universities was not possible.  It has been done very successfully in the case of all the various engineering fields that I have mentioned already.  I regard that the final sanction of the Minister in the question of dismissing people is an extra safeguard for the person being dismissed rather than a undue interference in the work of the governing body or the institute.</P>
    <P>Senator Connaughton felt that there were too many nominees by the Minister but if the Senator examines the text of this Bill carefully he will see that the dangers of abuse to which he referred are not as great as he imagines.  He has an interest in adult education and he welcomed the Bill as being one more effort to cope with the fast-changing technological world in which we live.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Senator Brennan's last remark, I do not think it necessarily follows that tomorrow will be the last day of the session. That is a very arbitrary statement. We might well consider that the Committee Stage of the Bill would be best taken next week.  It seems to be a very rushed procedure to take it tomorrow. Why tomorrow?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="1591" /> measure which I introduce here today is a far-reaching and innovative one.  It provides for the establishment of an ombudsman who will investigate individual complaints against the administration.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, as in most developed countries in recent decades, the State has moved into areas which were previously regarded as the exclusive concern of the individual.  Government and citizen now have contact at every turn and the citizen is confronted by an ever-increasing array of Departments, boards and Government agencies of one kind or another.  A greater volume of legislation, much of it necessarily of a complex and technical nature, is constantly being produced.</P>
      <P>Because of these developments, citizens have gained access to a wide range of Government services and support systems but they have also become increasingly vulnerable to the decisions of public servants.  Problems can therefore arise in reconciling on the one hand the efficient exercise of governmental power and on the other, the treatment of every individual case in a clearly just and fair way.  Mistakes and misunderstandings whether caused by inadequate information, faulty interpretation of known facts or lack of sensitivity to personal circumstances, can sometimes occur. And even a mistake that appears in the setting of a large scale organisation to be trivial can have serious consequences for an individual.</P>
      <P>There is really no certain way of ensuring that wrong or unfair decisions are never taken by public officials.  What can be done, however, is to provide machinery whereby the individual who feels aggrieved by such action can bring the matter to light and have it speedily clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of the ombudsman has come increasingly to be regarded as a potentially useful instrument in helping the citizen to secure fair treatment from the modern state.  As a consequence, the concept has found application in many jurisdictions, especially since the end of <Col N="1592" /> World War II.  There are now ombudsmen in many countries, notably New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Canadian states, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  In most countries, ombudsmen deal with a wide range of complaints about the day-to-day activities of public officials&mdash;such as failure to pay grants in particular circumstances, delays or refusals in granting licences, the provision of inaccurate information by officials or simple failure to reply to letters.  While the role of an ombudsman in each country differs slightly depending on the traditions, history and culture of each particular country, they all share a common objective: ultimately to serve the public, to hear complaints respecting the operation of the public service, and where appropriate, to take such steps as are available to them to remedy the consequences of a particular act or omission of the public service.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, an all-party committee were established in 1976 to consider the desirability of the ombudsman institution. The committee consisted of 12 members drawn from both Dáil and Seanad.  The all-party committee concluded that the State's sphere of activity had extended to cover a great part of the citizen's life but that there had not been a corresponding extension of redress facilities.  In consequence, despite the establishment of special appeals tribunals for such matters as social welfare, over a wide area of governmental activity the aggrieved citizen was confined to ventilating his grievance through political intervention or through the courts.  The committee, however, took the view that, despite their successful utilisation over the years, neither of these approaches was entirely satisfactory or suited to all circumstances.  They felt also that the creation of special appeals facilities, on the social welfare model, for example, would prove both cumbersome and costly; their central recommendation was, accordingly, the establishment of a new institution&mdash;the office of ombudsman.</P>
    <P>That report was published in May 1977.  There had been general agreement <Col N="1593" /> among the committee members that the views of interested members of the public would be obtained before legislative proposals were prepared.  Accordingly, advertisements for this purpose were placed in the national newspapers. Following consideration of the responses, preparation of the legislation commenced.  The drafting of the Bill proved to be a complicated matter.  The very nature of the measure and the large number of people who could be affected by its provisions necessitated careful and scrupulous drafting.  At the same time we had to be careful to follow as closely as possible the recommendations by the all-party committee.  The Bill which I present here today is the fruit of all that careful preparation.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal specifically with some detailed provisions of the Bill, I would first like to refer in general terms to the role of the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Above all else the ombudsman will speak and act on behalf of the individual citizen: he will in a very tangible sense be at the service of &ldquo;the plain people of Ireland&rdquo;.  On their behalf, he will examine the actions of public officials in their handling of particular cases&mdash;or of a particular type of case&mdash;and seek a satisfactory remedy in those instances where he finds that a citizen has a genuine grievance.  The ombudsman will deal with a great body of day-to-day administrative decisions and actions rather than with the broad scheme of Government policy or national affairs.</P>
    <P>Most investigations by the ombudsman will originate in complaints made by individuals&mdash;and it is important to note here that under this Bill the complaints can be made straight to the ombudsman by the interested party: there will be no need to go through an intermediary such as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will also be open to the ombudsman to initiate an investigation himself&mdash;for example, as a result of a newspaper report.  In this way, he will be in a position to look into any alleged action by a Government Department which might give rise to public concern that an injustice was being done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> The ombudsman will exercise influence rather than power: he will not have the authority to change administrative decisions&mdash;that would be to usurp the authority of the Government. Rather, he will be in a position to influence administrators by virtue of his ability to scrutinise matters in depth and to report his findings publicly to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Experience in other countries has shown that in many cases, even an initial display of interest by the ombudsman or his staff has the effect of putting a departmental review into motion, leading to a satisfactory outcome.  However, where this does not occur, the ombudsman will be empowered to call for documents, files or other relevant material, and to examine witnesses.</P>
    <P>Such examinations will be held in private: this is because the concept of an ombudsman is associated with a conciliatory approach, and it would not be in keeping with this to set up court-like proceedings.  The vast majority of ombudsmen find that the conciliatory approach works best: after all, the ombudsman could hardly expect to make much progress in his work if he was to generate hostility among the officials with whom he will often be in close contact in the course of his work.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the much-maligned bureaucrat, it should be pointed out that, again going on the experience of ombudsmen abroad, it can be expected that a fair proportion of investigations will show that the administrative actions complained about were fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  In those cases, an explanation of the background to the decision may give satisfaction to the complainant.  However, should the ombudsman be satisfied that a Department have acted wrongly and should he fail to persuade the Department to take corrective action, he will be empowered to make a detailed critical report of the matter to the Oireachtas, to whom the administrators are responsible.  There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that no official will take lightly the possibility of such public criticism of his Department <Col N="1595" /> from such a high and independent source.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to some of the issues which were raised about the Bill during its passage through the Dáil. We were criticised for not including the local authorities and the health boards in the ombudsman's remit from the outset. Let me stress straight away that they were excluded at the recommendation of the all-party committee and that we have attempted to include in the Bill all recommendations of that committee. Even then it was only a temporary exclusion as the intention was to include them by Government order at a later date. The Government had no vested interest in excluding any of these bodies.</P>
    <P>As an elected representative, I am only too well aware of the areas about which there is most often public concern. Whether the complaints are justified or not, is not in question.  Many of the complaints that public representatives get concern local authorities and health boards.  We would have been happy to have these bodies included immediately but for the firm recommendations of the all-party committee.  However, we are totally committed, to including them as soon as is practically possible.  It would not be possible to include them immediately as there are administrative difficulties in pursuing that course.  The fact is that consultations must take place with these bodies before they are included. The consultations are likely to take several months.</P>
    <P>They will, however, be included as soon as possible.  Therefore, I wish to reiterate the undertaking which I gave in Dáil Éireann.  The necessary steps will be taken, as provided in section 4 of the Bill, to bring local authorities and health boards within the remit of the ombudsman within three months of the date of his appointment.  The local authorities and health boards and the representatives of their staffs will, of course, be fully consulted.</P>
    <P>The question of the right of a Minister to have an investigation stopped was raised in the Dáil on a number of occasions. <Col N="1596" /> The background to this is that the all-party committee recommended that certain decisions by Ministers, where they are required or allowed to make value judgments should be excluded from the ombudsman's area.  They were not able to specify in detail what these decisions were.  The general intention, was to provide means whereby the discretionary decisions of a Minister, for which he is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas should be exempted.  It proved technically difficult to draft a provision which gave precise effect to the committee's recommendation.  The only feasible technical way off ggiving effect to the recommendation proved to be the provision that, where a Minister or a Minister of State signs a request to the ombudsman not to investigate a specific action for a stated reason the ombudsman shall cease to investigate.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been amended so that the complainant will now receive a copy of the Minister's request to the ombudsman to close the investigation and a copy of the statement giving the reasons for stopping the investigations.  The ombudsman will also include these in his reports.  I would hope that these amendments would do away with any fears of the power of veto being used to obstruct an investigation.  If any Minister were to abuse this power the ombudsman would be free to make reference to it either in a special report for that purpose or in his annual report.  It would hardly be in the interest of any Minister to abuse this power because of the degree of adverse publicity that would result.</P>
    <P>The method of appointment of the ombudsman was also raised.  It is proposed that the ombudsman shall be appointed by the President on the resolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  Some Dáil Deputies felt that his appointment and removal should require a two-thirds majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, this would contravene Article 15.11.1 of the Constitution. In order to conform with the requirements imposed by this Article we provided that only a simple majority would be required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I am acutely aware of the need to make certain that the appointment of the ombudsman will not be seen as a political appointment.  It is essential that the ombudsman be absolutely independent if he is to be able to do a good job. The Government would not wish it to be otherwise.  We are very much aware that the person to be appointed will be neutral and acceptable to all sides of the House within the constraints of the Constitution. I would like to reiterate what I said in the Dáil on this point.  It is the Government's intention to reach agreement with the leaders of the Opposition before a resolution suggesting a name would be put before the House.  This should go a long way towards meeting any objections or doing away with any unfounded misgivings that might exist on this issue.</P>
    <P>There was also a suggestion that the Bill should provide for a temporary ombudsman, who would, during any period of incapacity of the ombudsman, exercise the same powers as the ombudsman. The Bill has been amended so that he may delegate to any of his officers any of his functions except those of reporting to the Oireachtas.  This will enable the office to function satisfactorily on a day-to-day basis during the absence, for any reason, of the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Since introducing this Bill in Dáil Éireann I have been somewhat surprised by the level of criticism directed at its contents.  I had expected a widespread acceptance and indeed positive welcome for the establishment of such a novel institution whose only purpose is the public good.  If the detractors say they are not in dispute with the principle of the Bill but only with its detailed provisions I am still somewhat surprised.  The fact is that the contents of the Bill are simply the legal expression of the combined wisdom of the Oireachtas.  In other words, I accepted almost in every detail the recommendations of the all-party committee and included them in legal form in the Bill now before this House.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that there has been too much emphasis on the exclusions from the Bill and far too little on its <Col N="1598" /> positive aspects.  The establishment of an office of ombudsman in this country is of course in itself a huge positive step in the direction of the protection of the rights of the ordinary citizen.  I want, however, to stress that the minute details of the Bill also stand-up to any positive test. There has been much talk of the bodies excluded from the Bill and very little of those included.  I would like to restore the balance a little by laying some stress on the things that are included in the ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that his powers will be so circumscribed that he will only deal with the more innocuous State offices. In fact, as a look at the list in the First Schedule of this Bill will show, the ombudsman will have power to deal with complaints against all the Departments with which individual citizens have a lot of contact.  The Department of Social Welfare, with their involvement in the personal lives of so many citizens; the Department of Agriculture who affect everyone making his living from the land; the Department of Education; the Department of the Environment&mdash;these are just examples of the major areas of administration which this Bill empowers the ombudsman to investigate.  The total number of civil servants employed in all these Departments is over 50,000 and there is hardly a sphere of their activity which does not, in one way or another, touch on the life of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>Even that is only part of the picture. As I have already said, I gave an undertaking in the Dáil, and repeated it here to-day, that within three months of the appointment of the ombudsman the local authorities and health boards will be included in his remit.  The number of persons employed in these bodies amount to around 75,000 people.  The position, therefore, is that within the first three months of the office, about 125,000 public servants will have their work subject to the scrutiny of the ombudsman.  It will therefore be true to say that any citizen who feels aggrieved at the actions of almost anybody concerned in the central or local administration will be able to have these complaints investigated by the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> Of course, there are exclusions in the Bill.  However, there are very good reasons for them.  The main activities of Government which will not be subject to the ombudsman's scrutiny are the prisons and the Garda.  The exclusion of the Garda was recommended by the all-party committee, after detailed consideration, for what I would have thought were logical and plausible reasons.  They have been excluded because their work is mainly subject to the scrutiny of the judiciary or else related to security or subject to existing appeals machinery.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the prisons is due to the serious problems their inclusion would cause.  Prisoners already have adequate means of redress and their rights are adequately protected under the law and the Constitution.  There is also the likelihood that the facility would be abused.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the ombudsman should replace existing appeals procedures or interfere with the judicial process.  Therefore, he will not investigate where legal proceedings have been initiated, or where there is a statutory right of appeal to a court, or where there is right of appeal to independent tribunals or referees drawn from outside the public service.  Defence matters are not included as they do not greatly affect the everyday life of the ordinary citizen.  Personnel matters are not included, as the ombudsman is not considered the appropriate forum for dealing with employer-employee relations.</P>
    <P>The Bill was generally welcomed in Dáil Éireann, where it was the subject of a very comprehensive and constructive debate.  On Report Stage there I was happy to incorporate a number of improvements in the measure.  As I am anxious to see the office of ombudsman established as soon as possible.  I would respectfully urge the House&mdash;without in any way wishing to curtail debate and discussion on its provisions&mdash;to accord the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents the culmination of a lobby which has been in <Col N="1600" /> existence for a long number of years requesting a measure of this kind and the appointment of an ombudsman in this country.  It has been a persistent lobby, not terribly vocal or commanding tremendous depth of support all through the country, possibly because the term itself, which is Scandinavian, possibly rings a little strange to many Irish ears. The concept behind it is also not a very familiar concept.  Nevertheless, from the point of view of a good many people who consider the administration of our State, the call has been made, and made persistently.  I am glad to see this Bill before the House today, and to know that, very shortly, we shall have an ombudsman in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the complexities of a modern State, the services it provides for so many citizens in so many different ways, the way in which the State impinges on all of us at some stage in our careers and existences.  It follows, because of its increasing complexity and because of the fact that rules have to be drawn on a macro basis, so to speak, that when they come to be applied on a micro basis there will be occasional abrasions between the system and the citizen.  Many of these can be resolved and some cannot be resolved because the system is not sufficiently flexible to permit of resolution.  The ombudsman will now come into the scene and it is hoped, ensure that these areas of favourable contact will, or, indeed, conflict between the State and a citizen can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly, the reason for so long and persistent demand for this post arises from the nature of our legal system, in that we are a common law country.  Our common law, traditionally and constitutionally&mdash;with a written Constitution&mdash;has found itself unable to intervene in the area of administrative law as in some of the Roman law countries where there is a separate <i>droit administratif</i>, where there are separate tribunals and separate systems to deal with matters of administrative law. Our legal system did not develop in such a way as to permit this parallel <Col N="1601" /> system.  Particularly 20 years ago, and preceding that, there was a great lack of process for citizens who wanted to complain about the administrative law of the land.  That lack of process was what inspired the demand for the ombudsman. He is a Scandinavian creature, I believe, and we are inclined to look to parts of Scandinavia as being the source of much political and administrative wisdom. Without hearing in any great detail how he operated there and how effective he was, the general idea of what he represented was acceptable and attractive in this jurisdiction and the demand built up over the years.  We now have the position where, at last, we are going to have this official here in our system and we shall have to wait and see&mdash;because it is novel to us&mdash;how the new procedure is going to work out in practice.</P>
    <P>It would have been interesting to have heard from the Minister some details of experience of other countries of similar administrative and constitutional systems as ours in the operation of their ombudsmen, particularly from a country like New Zealand which is similar to us in terms of size, legal system, administrative structures and, indeed, general culture.  It is always useful to learn from other peoples' experiences.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman is in existence in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We read, occasionally, newspaper reports of his activities and some of his findings.  I get the impression that his role in those jurisdictions is confined to investigating serious matters of malpractice, whereas I read the Bill now before the House as giving a wider jurisdiction to our proposed official to investigate any area where an action has been taken which has led to an injustice to a citizen through the denial to him of his rights, or his full rights, in accordance with whichever administrative scheme is involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the type of office which is supposed to be set up here&mdash;if I am reading the Bill correctly&mdash;to give power to the ombudsman to intervene in practically every area of public administration. I think that is as it should be.  I <Col N="1602" /> welcome the creation of this post for another reason.  In this country, we have a written Constitution which embodies the traditional constitutional theory of the division of powers between the Executive, legislative and judicial.  Each of these powers is separate in practice and in theory, so that its independence is guaranteed by its separateness but, at the same time, things are so arranged that each acts as a check on excesses committed by the other.  The main check on the power of the Executive should be parliament but because of the party system&mdash;I do not say it in a spirit of deep criticism, it is the way the system has evolved&mdash;the capacity of the legislators to check the Executive is limited by the party whip.  That is understandable when we consider the practicalities of our system.</P>
    <P>The powers of the courts to check the legislative arm of the State are wide. They are not subject to any restriction and are widely exercised.  Those powers are used to check the Executive arm of the State although this may not have been the original intention of the theorists who evolved the idea of the division of powers.  In recent years there has been a marked tendency by the courts to expand their role in acting as a check on both the Executive and legislative arms of the State.  There always has been an inherent power to the courts arising from common law to give certain reliefs by way of the traditional orders of <i>certiorari</i> or declaration and the like, where the citizen in not even well defined circumstances could apply to the court. It was, unavoidably, a grey legal area.  A grey legal area tends to be interpreted from time to time.  The very fact that the area in which the courts operate is undefined&mdash;it possibly defies definition because of its nature&mdash;means that they have a tendency at times, depending on the mood of the bench, on the social scene, and on the pattern in other similar jurisdictions, to expand into areas that were traditionally regarded as the preserve of the executive or legislative arm of the State.  That jurisdiction has always been there in the courts and has been available for citizens in the <Col N="1603" /> theoretically comparatively narrow number of cases in which it could be called into being by a citizen.  But in recent times there has been a tendency to expand the courts' operations into what is the proper sphere of the Executive or the Legislature.  An impetus for some of this expansion comes from the fact that we have a written Constitution which cannot define specifically every right of every citizen; and the Constitution has been interpreted in recent times so as to find rights which are not written into it but which are implied from it.  One does not know whether they were ever in the minds of the framers of the Constitution or if they ever impinged on the consciousness of the populace that voted this Constitution into being.  However, that is the role that the courts adopt increasingly in modern times, inspired to some extent by constitutional practice abroad, notably from the United States.</P>
    <P>Their method of thinking is not altogether suited to our cultural, political or social scene, but that is a tendency which has been manifesting itself in recent times.</P>
    <P>Another aspect has been the tendency to give the traditional remedies of <i>certiorari</i> or declaration, two remedies which enable the courts to invalidate an action of some person, group, body or institution, or to give the traditional actions of prohibition or injunction to halt something that has been done in respect of a citizen or a group of citizens, or the traditional actions of <i>mandamus</i> or mandatory injunction which enable the courts to compel an institution or a State or a person to do something.  There has been a tendency in recent years for the courts to grant those remedies more easily to citizens in cases where in the past the courts would have held that that person did not have any <i>locus standi</i> to go before the court to seek this remedy. There has been a gradual expanding of the courts' role in this area, and inevitably this has brought the courts into adjudicating on what should be matters exclusive to the Executive or the Legislature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> That is not good because it breaches the doctrine of the division of the arms of State, and the courts should be very distinct from the two other arms of State in order to preserve the respect which citizens must have for them and on which their importance is based.  It is dangerous for the courts to become over involved in the area of the administration.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency, because of this inclination to expand these traditional orders that I have mentioned, for the courts to become more involved. Consequently, if the creation of this office of the ombudsman provides a focus for citizens to seek redress and diminish the number of applications to the courts, that tendency which has been developing may perhaps be checked.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the Bill and hope that it will prove to be of considerable practical benefit to many citizens and that it will enable citizens to go to the ombudsman and his staff for redress rather than go to the courts.  The courts, in the last resort, are available for a citizen who feels aggrieved by the system and who makes the case that the system is being exercised unlawfully against him.  Undoubtedly, there will be many instances in the future where a citizen will feel that the role of the ombudsman and his powers are inadequate to give him redress and he will have to go to the courts.  It will be interesting to see in the matter of administration and in the matter of jurisprudence whether the tendencies to which I have referred for the courts to expand their role will continue. A very interesting and useful paper has recently been published by the Law Reform Commission dealing with the judicial review of administrative action and with the problem of remedies. That is very relevant to this Bill, which in effect is providing not for judicial review but for review by the Legislature of administrative action.  On page 13 in that report an observation of a judge is quoted:</P>
    <P>The cases in which this State-side order [of certiororari] may be granted cannot, and should not, be limited by <Col N="1605" /> reference to any formula or final statement of principle.  The strength of this great remedy is its flexibility.</P>
    <P>That is a positive statement by the court indicating that the courts are self conscious of their power to use this flexible remedy to the very maximum of its flexibility. As I have already indicated, this is a trend which is not without some little question marks with regard to constitutional propriety.  I am not in any way advocating that the courts should not have full discretion to give a citizen justice where he comes into conflict with the State or any arm of it.  That flexibility must be there so that the courts can do that.  There will be instances where the ombudsman cannot give relief and where the citizen will have to go to court.</P>
    <P>The question of who can approach the ombudsman is something that will cause contention in the future.  It was a subject that caused the courts considerable difficulty over the years&mdash;who is entitled to complain of the grievance?  It appears from the Bill that only the citizen directly involved by the action, to use the word in the Bill, will have the right of access to the ombudsman.  I read the Bill as meaning that the citizen will have to be personally involved.  There can be many instances where some action of the State could involve an individual not directly but as a member of a group.  The question of what <i>locus standi</i> will be acceptable to the ombudsman in time to come in order for his jurisdiction to be invoked will have to be decided.</P>
    <P>The courts over the years have found this difficulty and there was an interesting case quoted in the Law Reform Commission paper to which I have referred, on this point.  An application was taken towards the end of the last century by a Dublin ratepayer who was aggrieved at the expense of a lunch taken by members of Dublin Corporation on a visit to the Vartry Waterworks and he decided to exercise his rights as an aggrieved citizen.  The point to be decided on was did he have a legal interest? Was he a person aggrieved within <Col N="1606" /> the meaning of the law as it then stood? Was he entitled to take his action?  The judgment is so interesting that the writer of the working paper has quoted it and the House should hear it.  The judge in question was a very well known character in Irish jurisprudence, Sir Peter O'Brien, Chief Justice, who was also known as Peter the Packer.  That gentleman is reported, when the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty, to have told the prisoner &ldquo;You are now discharged as an innocent man but do not do it again&rdquo;.  In his judgment in this case he says the question of the expensive lunch taken by the members of Dublin Corporation was very much an issue.  He said:</P>
    <P>I have before me the items in the bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I hope this does not give any ideas to the current members of Dublin Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Amongst the list of wines are two dozen , Ayala, 1885&mdash;a very good brand&mdash;at 84s a dozen, one dozen Marcobrunn hock&mdash;a very nice hock, one dozen Chateau Margaux&mdash;-an excellent claret; one dozen fine old Dublin whiskey&mdash;the best whiskey that can be got; one case of Ayala; six bottles of Amontillado sherry&mdash;a stimulating sherry; and the ninth item is some more fine Dublin whiskey!  Then Mr. Lovell supplies the &lsquo;<i>dinner</i>&rsquo;.  (This was a dinner, not a mere luncheon!) including all attendance, at 10s. per head.  There is an allowance for brakes; one box of cigars, 100; coachmen's dinner, beer, stout, minerals in syphons, and ice for wine.  There is dessert, and there are sandwiches, and an allowance for four glasses broken&mdash;a very small number under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>He went on and talked about the arguments of the Solicitor-General and how plausible they were on behalf of Dublin Corporation.  When he asked with tears in his voice whether the members of the corporation should starve he drew a most gruesome picture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> He went on:</P>
    <P>he represented that the members of the corporation would really traverse the Wicklow hills in a special condition, unless they were sustained by lunch.</P>
    <P>The judge held in the end:</P>

    <P>As far back as 1894 there was a judicial decision that a ratepayer aggrieved by an action of the corporation could proceed to have the payment disallowed.</P>

      <P>I shall not comment on that.  The point I am making is that as far back as 1894, and before it, the courts took power to intervene on behalf of aggrieved citizens who were members of a class that would suffer by reason of an administrative action.  Does the role of the ombudsman, as defined in the Bill, allow such redress under the terms of the Bill or will we have to look at it and possibly amend it later on to include that role.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that some criticisms of the exclusions are hardly justified.  I agree with the exclusions which are proposed.  One of them&mdash;the exclusion on the request of a Minister who has to give reasons&mdash;is something that I could see causing some difficulty. The Minister has to state his reasons why the ombudsman cannot investigate a specific action.  Those reasons can then be published.  The complainant will receive the Minister's request and the reasons for stopping the investigations. The complainant at that stage will still have his grievance and I can foresee litigation, by the litigant asking the court to declare that the Minister's reasons are inadequate.  That could be an undesirable development but it is not something that we can stop.  It is something I can see arising from the amendment that has been made and I can see the Minister's goodwill in receiving that amendment to <Col N="1608" /> provide for ministerial reasons being given.  It might have been better, though I can see the arguments on the other side, why the simple request would not have been absolute in its respect.  I mention this as a possibility but I hope it will be unlikely.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see how the independence of the ombudsman is guaranteed and welcome the Minister's commitment to consult with the leaders of the Opposition parties in agreeing a name to fill this post.  It is terribly important, having regard to our system and to the way in which political representations are such an accursed part of our political system at present, that this man would seem to be above politics and totally separate from the political system.  I hope that from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, he will discourage political representations to his office on behalf of citizens so that they would come directly to him instead of through an intervening politician.  In some cases he will find malpractice, in other cases he will find none.  In the case where he was introduced by a politician and finds malpractice, the credit, having regard to the way we have become corrupted by this damn thing, will go to the introducing politician.</P>
    <P>I hope that the ombudsman will, as a matter of practice from day one, discourage and eventually refuse to treat with politicians at all.  I can see difficulties there.  There are instances where a person might need the help of a local public representative to make the introduction to the ombudsman's office but it is something that we should be sensitive and careful about.</P>
    <P>Section 7, susbsection (3), provides that no person shall by act or omission obstruct or hinder the ombudsman in the performance of his functions or do any other thing which would, if the ombudsman were a court having power to commit for contempt of court, be contempt of such court.  But there is no sacntion to deal with a person who does any of the things prohibited by that subsection. The Prosecution of Offences Act, in the section prohibiting representations to the Director of Public <Col N="1609" /> Prosecutions and declaring such representations to be unlawful, suffers also from the want of a sanction.</P>
    <P>I readily concede that to prove interference so as to provoke the sanction would be extremely difficult.  Likewise, the same might appear here.  However, I think the lack of sanction in these prohibition clauses is definitely a drawback having regard to what has been the pattern of activity in this area up to now&mdash;increasing pattern, as I indicated in another Bill some days ago.  It is positive slavery as far as many public representatives are concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the exclusion of the Garda, an area which has been controversial for some time.  There was a feeling on the part of some people who have criticised this exclusion that the ombudsman might somehow act as an independent complaints tribunal.  This is a very desirable concept in theory but in principle it is fraught with great practical difficulties.  I do not think the office of ombudsman is the one to deal with this generally contentious area.  Possibly as the office develops and settles down it might be given a role in some of these excluded areas.  Possibly a role in relation to the Garda might be a future extension of the role of the ombudsman when he sees how he and his staff operate and how effective they are in investigating matters.  Because these particular complaints are so contentious and have so many legal tails to them, it is probably unsuitable for a purely administrative <i>functionnaire</i> to involve himself in them.</P>
    <P>The provision of some method of processing complaints against the police is one that gives rise to great difficulties in every jurisdiction where it is requested. Who is to compose the tribunal?  Are they to be judges or laymen, or both?  Is the tribunal to sit in public?  Will the ordinary rules of evidence apply to it?  Will witnesses be able to claim privilege, including the privilege of silence?  Will its proceedings generally be privileged?  Can it make a finding?  Will it find and attract any sanctions, either civil or criminal, and how do we get over the difficulty of double <Col N="1610" /> jeopardy?  These are all very practical difficulties.  If the tribunal is not a court and makes a finding that brings with it criminal or civil sanctions, is it a court and therefore unconstitutional? Some people who ask for tribunals are asking for something that is complex.  It is not to say that it could not be evolved, but it is complex.  Because of these complexities it is right to exclude the ombudsman from this area.</P>
    <P>I note too that the ombudsman is excluded where there is a right of appeal to independent tribunals or referees drawn from outside the public service.  I do not know what sort of scene that would be. if it is something involving a citizen in contact or conflict with the State, I do not know if that exclusion is altogether justified.  The right of appeal is a simple thing to bestow, but to exercise it can often be difficult and complex for a citizen. Would it not be much simpler if an inquiry from an ombudsman were to obviate the necessity for an appeal at all? That possibility is excluded, according to the Minister's script, and I do not know if that is a good thing.  But these are comparatively minor points, and as it is a totally new venture we will have to wait and see how the office evolves and operates in practice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope that all we wish for from this office will be realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is extremely welcome and we all wish it well.  I am particularly pleased at the flexibility the Minister has shown in the public interest in altering, amending and modifying the Bill at various stages so that we get legislation which is acceptable by the community at large.  That is to be commended in the framing of legislation generally.  The State touches the lives of all of us in an increasingly powerful way&mdash;our health, our education, our housing, our transport, even our food, and to an increasing extent our environment, our fresh air, so much so that at times a lot of us feel weighed down with the plethora of Government regulations, <Col N="1611" /> Government orders, sections and subsections and directives.  The list is endless.</P>
      <P>Any businessman could tell us that at times they feel like walking Government officials because of the number of regulations with which they have to cope.  The time has come, in a general sense, to take stock of the level of Government involvement in all of our lives.  I believe that it is at saturation point and should be reassessed.</P>
      <P>There are formal channels of appeals in all countries and we are no exception. The difficulty with these existing formal systems of appeal is that they are all seen to be arms of the State; they are all seen to be State-run appeal systems.  This is why I am pleased with this legislation, because it provides us with an independent appeal system and is doing so on what is regarded as an accepted international model.  It provides us with an independent mediator; but I hope that, as it evolves, the office would distinctly not be seen as part of the Establishment, but something set quite apart from it.  It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that this new office not only works, but works speedily, and that it avoids getting bogged down in a mass of statutes.  If that happens it will only add to the frustrations of the complainant.  It is also important to point out that the ombudsman is not there to re-assess decisions that are made, not there to reverse decisions but to investigate injustice and maladministration.</P>
      <P>If the office of ombudsman is to succeed it has to take account of certain things.  It has to enhance and add to individual rights and freedoms here.  It must to a certain extent have a slight tendency, almost a bias, in favour of the individual. I hope that the view is taken that when an individual makes a complaint the State in most cases is held slightly guilty until proved innocent. That would be a healthy attitude for the holder of the office to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the dictum is upheld that the State exists for the individual <Col N="1612" /> and not the individual for the State.  I would like to see the person oppointed going forward with that in mind. The office of ombudsman is a principle; it is not a mechanism for sorting out niggly problems.  It is a basic principle and a fundamental and pivotal office in our democracy.  It also must be seen&mdash;the Minister made this point in the Dáil debate&mdash;as just one of many steps required in an overall and major programme of public service reform.  I hope that the pace at which that reform can proceed is accelerated.  At an opportune time we in the Houses of the Oireachtas, should look at possible reform of the Houses to ensure that they are relevant to the needs of the eighties and that they are responsive to the people that live in the eighties.</P>
    <P>The office of ombudsman in Britain when set up caused a lengthy debate and a number of difficulties in regard to the relationship between the office and public representatives.  The only way one can get to the ombudsman in England is to go through his Member of Parliament. In this legislation we have taken an entirely different approach.  That is very healthy and shows that our capacity and ability to make independent legislation is increasing.  That is a welcome and a healthy sign.  To a certain extent, if an ombudsman is to be successful he will take away some of the weight of what Senator Cooney called &ldquo;representation&rdquo; now made to Deputies and Senators.  As often as not they are grievances and the people making the representations are entitled to the benefits they claim in their own right.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is that, if the office is successful, then the type of representation presently flowing to Members of the Oireachtas will inevitably flow to the ombudsman.  In Britain they got over this by ensuring that the correspondence and the difficulties went through a Member of Parliament.  I hope we can devise a proper system as it evolves.  As Senator Cooney said, we will have to watch this to see how it evolves and to ensure that there is no great duplication of effort.  Investigations <Col N="1613" /> and representations are an expensive business on the State purse.  I hope we can find a way to prevent unnecessary duplication between the work of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the office of ombudsman. If the office is successful it could change somewhat the role of the TD and Senator and give him or her some extra time to deal with legislative matters for which they were principally elected.</P>
    <P>Senator Cooney touched on the waste of time that often goes into representations made by parties from all sides of the House and which very often ends up in Members politically cancelling each other out, with no great benefit to the person who made the approach to the Deputy or Senator and a lot of headaches for the public servants involved. I hope that the office of ombudsman will streamline, rather than confuse, that system.  The British got over this by ensuring people went through their MP.  We have taken a different course, which is more open and more democratic; but it leaves us with the difficulty that there could be some duplication.  I disagree with Senator Cooney when he pointed out that he would quite positively bar any politician introducing a person to the ombudsman or introducing a case.  It has to be left open to citizens to approach the ombudsman, or, if necessary, to do so through their TD or Senator.  We should not move any hard and fast rule on that. Ie would be unfair to Members of the Houses.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the Minister's assurance that within three months local authorities, health boards and so on will be brought within the umbrella.  That is a welcome commitment by the Minister. When the office was created in Great Britain the same steps were taken in that at first those bodies were not brought in until the administrative structures were set up.  I understand that that is all that is happening here.  I should like to mention to the Minister that it is also suggested that some non-commercial State-sponsored bodies might at some stage be <Col N="1614" /> included under the umbrella.  I do not think that is urgent or necessary, but in the future it might be extended to all State-sponsored bodies.  It could be curtailed or tied into areas in those bodies which would not compromise the financial management of those companies.  I should like to refer to the excellent work of the new Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  The State-sponsored bodies that have been looked at by the Joint Committee have already reaped some benefit from that independent consultation. In the same way access by an ombudsman's office to State-sponsored bodies would also allow a little extra fresh air in there which would help the State-sponsored bodies as well as those who deal with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of access to the ombudsman, one of the difficulties that will affect us, because we have taken this independent stand of it not being necessary to go to one's TD or Senator.  It is important that the ombudsman's office be available to the much maligned man in the street. Whether this will entail branch offices or centres at which the ombudsman's staff will operate, all this has to be given a lot of consideration.  There are still many people throughout the country who have a certain fear and reluctance to write to an office in Dublin and hope to get some kind of satisfactory response.  They still regard it as writing off to central Government in some way.  It would be wrong for us to over-centralise this.  I hope that in due course the staff could be provided so that there could be some kind of a spread throughout the country when the things gets going.  I do not expect this to happen overnight.  It takes time.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the title we have adopted of ombudsman.  This is one we should keep under review as the years roll by because it is a cumbersome title.  In England they have taken the title of parliamentary commissioner and in Northern Ireland when it started they took the title of complaints commissioner. It seems to me to be more explanatory to the people who have to deal <Col N="1615" /> with the office.  It should be looked at.  I also suggest that the title might be in our first official language.</P>
    <P>I warned of the dangers of duplication. I would like to finish on that note and to mention to the House and particularly to the Minister that in Britain the procedure has been that when the ombudsman's report comes in once a year it is examined in full by a select committee and the ombudsman discusses with that committee the broad general approaches taken throughout the past year.  In doing that the committee get a certain feel for it and then it goes on to the main Houses.  Perhaps at some stage we could look at the establishment of such a committee which would allow us all to get more involved in the workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas and be of considerable assistance to the ombudsman as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has done a good day's work for the nation in introducing it.  I see it as not just a mechanism, not just a piece of legislation, but as a genuine advance of the democratic principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish him every success in his office in the future.  It is very satisfactory to see him coming in with this type of legislation on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any step to help people to air their grievances must be welcomed.  I do not think we will have any problem in that respect.  This is particularly so if the steps taken are seriously concerned with the question of pursuing justice.  While the Bill is welcome and is going to do a very effective job, it would be crazy to suggest that it will be the panacea for all ills.  It would be a mistake if it were to become the panacea for all ills relating to the whole question of human rights. From the tone of some of the contributions in the Dáil I feel that quite a lot of people may have that mistaken belief. Certainly the appointment of the ombudsman is an absolute necessity.  I will not say that it was overdue because I <Col N="1616" /> realise there was great difficulty in framing the Bill.  At the same time, I do not believe the problems of public servants and representatives will be actually eased to any great extent as some people have suggested.  In circumstances such as this, where people are given an opportunity to process their grievances through extended procedures there is a tendency for more grievances to crop up; people will be made aware that they can complain; the idea will take hold and TDs and Senators and public representatives generally will have the same number of problems to deal with as they had in the past.  The number of problems requiring the attention of public representatives will not ease to any great extent.  The opposite might in fact be the case.  It could make people more conscious of the availability and benefit of political advice centres and so on.</P>
    <P>Human rights will always need protection, particularly where the proliferation and expansion of governmental units have increased bureauracy.  This has been the cause of a lot of frustrations for people.  Bureauracy has got to the stage where the bureaucrats believe that people love to fill out forms and keep records and obey regulations.  The bureaucrats never advert to the fact that these forms intimidate certain people, people who are not totally literate.  Other people believe it is harassment and some of them feel that some of the forms are very unreasonably set out; some would even go as far as to believe that some of the forms have a stigmatising effect.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that a lot of problems will arise for the ombudsman as a result of forms having to be completed.  There may be errors or oversights and other difficulties for people presenting their problems.  It is a good thing to see people who may be aggrieved as a result of such circumstances getting an opportunity to process their claims without the intimidatory completing of very difficult forms or the fulfilling of some very difficult regulation.  It is as well to mention those points on the Ombudsman (No. 2) <Col N="1617" /> Bill because that is how a lot of people get caught up, particularly people who have not had the benefit of a good education.  Even people who have had an education sometimes find the forms as presented rather difficult to comprehend. Many problems will arise because of these forms and the type of regulations that exist.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too far into the question of human rights.  If I did I would be raising the whole matter of human rights and the Bill is not really about that matter.  I feel that some comment has to be made in this direction, whether or not this will, in fact, take us in the direction of protecting human rights.  The ombudsman's job is to satisfy grievances.  He certainly will not have the real scope to go into the question of human rights.  But in relation to intimidatory forms I feel that it would be well within the scope of the ombudsman to have a look at these forms if people complain about them.  That is well within his ambit and he might make some recommendations for modifying those forms.  I do not know whether a ministerial order would be necessary for that.  It is a very serious problem for a lot of people.  I put it to the Minister that this is one thing that would fall within the ambit of the ombudsman.  I hope that some day the situation will be eased for those people who are confused and intimidated by these forms and regulations.</P>
    <P>I can see that the ombudsman is going to hear some great cries for social justice from vested interests, both in the private and the public sectors.  The ombudsman would not be very wise to rely for his success on the sensitivity of vested interests. I have no doubt that the type of man who will be appointed will not be taken in by the cry for social justice from vested interests, but he should watch out for it.  Inevitably pressures build up no matter what your job is, and I have no doubt this cry will come.</P>
    <P>We have a good record on the question of protecting human rights.  It is as good as it is in any other country.  That does not mean there is no need for <Col N="1618" /> developments in the matter of human rights.  The ombudsman's job can be examined later to see what part he can play.  When we have a full debate on all aspects of human rights I am sure we will find that our record is as good as that in every other country.  That will not be the issue because we are not in the game of international competition.  To be as good as most may not be the answer. We may have to ask ourselves is that enough.  We may even have to ask ourselves are the terms of reference of the ombudsman broad enough, apart from the question of human rights.  In the long term they may not be.</P>
    <P>Many people have made the point to me that the appointment of the ombudsman will not change the situation to any drastic extent for those people who feel deeply aggrieved by the absence of full human rights.  In fairness we must look at the appointment as a good innovation which will make many of the problems less acute.  In time we will know whether we are doing as much as we should, and whether any new form of protection is necessary.</P>
    <P>If the ombudsman's responsibility is solely to appease the aggrieved, a sense of futility will develop in his office and will manifest itself not only in the incumbent but also in his staff.  We will have to wait and see.  If his terms of reference need to be broadened we should not hesitate to do so.  As reports are made to both Houses we will find out whether the existing safeguards for citizens are adequate.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to talk about an ombudsman without talking about human rights.  Traditionally human rights have been protected through the Dáil, the Seanad and the courts.  Very often I am critical of the media but we must compliment them on having highlighted many human rights problems.  The general public also have given great support in this respect.  Remedies for human rights problems lie in legal action.  Sometimes a test case is taken to establish what the law is.  Sometimes we have to do it through legislation.  Sometimes a letter to a TD will solve the problem.  Now, <Col N="1619" /> hopefully, applying to the ombudsman to put things right will do the trick.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that all of these methods have their shortcomings. Theoretically the Dáil and Seanad are geared to deal with any problem.  Of course we are limited by certain considerations, especially by shortage of time.  There are many more problems waiting for legislation than there is time available.  The courts have their own problems because of the existing state of the law.  If the law is not clear, it is possible for judges to suggest what it means, except where there may be a binding precedent.  Where the law is clear there is no room for manoeuvre, but that does not imply that justice has been applied. An innovation like the setting up of the ombudsman's office may generate some activity on the whole question of whether we enjoy full human rights.</P>
    <P>A TD can ask a question but, if the Minister so chooses, he can be unco-operative or unresponsive.  In this situation the ombudsman will have certain powers.  He will not be in a position to do very much and we still have the problem of aggrieved people.  This is what it is all about, trying to solve human problems and protect human rights.  Many cases will have to go to court.  The ombudsman will not be involved in that, because the remedies will have to be sought in the courts.  He cannot do much about unco-operative answers from Ministers either.</P>
    <P>The more you examine it the more you realise that the ombudsman's role is limited to dealing with questions of maladministration in the broadest sense.  My hope is that it can be extended to a greater degree to protect the processes of democracy.  If it does that, and we are heading in that direction, then the whole innovation must be welcomed and encouraged to develop in a progressive way.  Anybody who deals in reality can look at the processes under which the Bill allows the ombudsman to function as anything other than dealing with maladministration.  Earlier there was talk <Col N="1620" /> of it easing all our problems or being the panacea here for all our ills in this question of human rights or of easing the work of the public representatives, but that is an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>In order to give real effect to that and to solve those problems you have to be able to give a new means to the citizen whereby he can air his grievances, particularly the citizen who believes that he has been done a very grave injustice.  The only method that the ombudsman will have to offer is his own office.  The grievances are so vast, the problems of human rights are so vast, that he will not be able to adopt new methods.  He may, on the evidence coming before him, be able to make reports that would indicate quite clearly that new methods of airing grievances will have to be evolved.</P>
    <P>We are again back into the field of human rights and I find it difficult when I talk about an ombudsman to steer very far away from the question of a charter of human rights.  That is the only way in the long run that we can eliminate a major portion of the problems that exist in our society.  The setting up of the ombudsman is an inevitable step in that direction even though it may not be a conscious decision of the people who suggested it or the people who have decided the best way to set it up.  At least it will set the climate for the whole question of human rights to be dealt with and I look forward to the day when we will see on the Order Paper some motion dealing with that.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of being sarcastic, but the employment of an ombudsman is not going to introduce a new social order. It is not going to remove hunger and want.  If we acknowledge the limitations of the ombudsman we must accept that his appointment is a very well worth while innovation which in the long term will lead to good things for people who feel genuinely aggrieved.  Acknowledging all of that, our aim should be to pass the legislation as quickly as possible and to seek an orderly and progressive development of the ombudsman's role not only for the ombudsman but for his staff also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> As public representatives we should encourage the citizens to make good use of this provision in the hope that some of the activity of the citizens in general will influence the ombudsman to head in the direction of having more Ministerial Orders introduced.  That would be doing a good turn not only for themselves but also for other people who have not yet seen any effective measures that will ease the major problems concerning human rights.  The process of dealing through the ombudsman if it is used correctly by the citizens will lead to a process of a diversion into new channels.  This process should not be very precipitate. The ombudsman has to be appointed and he has to find his bearings.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties but I am talking about the long term and I advise citizens who have problems or grievances which come within the scope of the ombudsman to press their cases as hard as possible.  In that way, as well as having their own grievances aired and their problems dealt with, they will sow the seed for better things for other people who have problems and may not yet have acquired the knowledge or the confidence to deal with their grievances. People have that obligation, particularly when an awful lot of the problems that come to people are a result of maladministration. That is only one aspect of the ombudsman's role which through cause and effect will necessitate eventually an examination of this whole question of human rights in the broadest sense.</P>
    <P>One or two things are a little bit puzzling to me, or perhaps annoying would be a better word to use.  For example, many of the underprivileged in society have to rely on gas for cooking.  If the State decided that the Gas Company are not paying their way&mdash;and they are in particular trouble at this time&mdash;what will the situation be?  I hope that is relevant. How will the underprivileged, the old, the social welfare recipients and so on fare if the company are in such difficulties that the two-shilling meter has to be done away with in the interest of economics? Would that be within the ambit of the <Col N="1622" /> ombudsman if those people were deprived of that service because the Gas Company were not making sufficient money?</P>

      <P>If I may link what I have to say with what Senator Harte said in his last remarks with regard to gas, I want to raise the whole question of fuel and energy in our present situation.  The facts I have to lay before the House are stark and clear and are of considerable importance.  As of now the one company that has the monopoly of the supply of anthracite to this State has declared that anthracite peas and beans&mdash;forgive the metaphorical language I am using but that is the technical language they use&mdash;or otherwise anthracite that feeds hopper-fed stoves is no longer available and will never be available.  That is what the monoply company&mdash;Coal Distributors Limited&mdash;told me when I rang up on three different ruses to find out what the position was.  They said that hopper-fed stoves no longer can get the kind of anthracite necessary for hopperfed stoves to survive on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may link that to Government policy at the moment.  About six months ago Department of the Environment offered generous grants to people <Col N="1623" /> who would switch from oil to solid fuel, and a great number of the citizens of Dublin&mdash;a number of whom are my constituents, and who have spoken to me&mdash;did just that.  At enormous expense they installed central heating systems based on anthracite stoves.  They were extremely happy with them until a couple of weeks ago when they rang for a new consignment of anthracite to keep these highly environmentally desirable, Government approved devices in operation. They were told by Coal Distributors Limited that not only is it not available, but it will not be available in the foreseeable future, or at any time in the future.  They were told that Germany which produced and supplied this product, had some <i>crise de conscience</i> recently and decided that all their anthracite of this kind would be kept for themselves and that no more would be exported to us or to anybody else.  This means that the people who installed these stoves at great expense to themselves and at considerable expense to the taxpayer now have white elephants on their hands.  I pressed, I had to use a few personae.</P>

      <P>No, just insisting questions. They said there is a substandard anthracite.  But, having pressed them under various hats with regard to the effectiveness of this substandard anthracite, they assured me that it is no damn good for these stoves.  I thought the next step obviously would be to ring up the wholesalers of these stoves&mdash;Trianco Housemaster one of the key names involved&mdash;and I discovered that they are doing a roaring trade in these stoves.  In fact, there is one estate in suburban Dublin at this moment being installed with these stoves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Chair, to the House and to the Government that this is a rather tricky situation.  If people are installing stoves which I am informed there is no means of fuelling in the future, that is obviously a barren exercise and one that will cause a great deal <Col N="1624" /> of unhappiness to everybody&mdash;except of course the people who sell the stoves.  It certainly will bring no joy to the people who install them.  Even Coal Distributors Limited will not get any consolation from it either because they are not going to be able to sell any fuel to them.  Then I rang the oil companies and discovered that they have a glut of oil.  They are now handing out dinner sets as incentives to people to buy oil&mdash;people who six months ago decided patriotically to turn from oil to anthracite, to solid fuel, and who got grants from the Ministry of the Environment to do this.  So now we have a glut of oil on the market, but we have no anthracite.  Yet we have a Government policy which encouraged people to turn from oil to coal or anthracite.  In other words, we have a state of egregious confusion for the citizen.</P>
    <P>The few questions I want to ask are fairly modest.  When these grants were approved for solid fuel systems, was there any research whatever done into the availability of solid fuel?  Was there a distinction made by the Government between systems relying on the solid fuel that was available and the solid fuel that was not available?  If there was such a research enterprise undertaken, I would like to know its nature, its results and its recommendations.  If West Germany has decided to clamp down on its anthracite, have the Government any clout in the matter?  Can we approach them?  Can we say that we are a very small economy and that the amount of anthracite we would need would be very small?  As a friendly nation and part of the EEC, could we ask them to make a special case with regard to Ireland?  We have encouraged many people to instal these stoves.</P>

      <P>I had not thought of that, but what we import comes from West Germany.  The interesting thing is that the people who are importing it are monopolists.  If there were competing interests in the matter, might there be a company willing to negotiate with <Col N="1625" /> Poland or with East Germany or with Upper or, if you were really put to the pin of your collar, perhaps even Lower Silesia?  I am not a bit snobbish in these matters.  Would it be possible to investigate that aspect of the market?  In other words, have the Government a policy with regard to that or have they any strategy to deal with the situation which seems at the moment seriously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer that could be given is that it is a free market, and fair dues to the kangaroos one should find out what one is buying.  The Government have no responsibility. They give grants but they do not carry out checks.  The ordinary citizen has not the leisure, the time or the cynicism to scrutinise a Government directive of this kind.  He tends to come patriotically forward and say the Government want us to use solid fuel, so we will use solid fuel.  When he has installed the solid fuel system and suddenly finds solid fuel is withdrawn, I think he has reasonable cause for complaint.  I think he has the right to ask the Government why he was encouraged to install a solid fuel central heating system.</P>
      <P>We were talking about an ombudsman earlier.  He would be relevant to this matter because, with all due deference to Senator Harte, ombudsmen do not have anything to do with human rights, but they are concerned with administrative justice.  This seems to be a matter where the administration of the State and its resources has been seriously negligent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I have 20 minutes to talk about this and it would be of no difficulty for me to spin the matter out.  I am not going to do that.  I want to ask the following questions.  Is it true, as is alleged by Coal Distributors Ltd who <Col N="1626" /> have a monopoly in the supply of anthracite, that anthracite peas and beans are no langer available?  Is it true as some of the retailers say, that actually it is available and will be available but that these monopolists are holding on to it waiting for the National Prices Commission to allow them a rise in prices so that they can charge more for it in the autumn?  That has been alleged by the retailers.  They say that the monopolists are holding on to it until they get a price rise and that they will sell it then to the retailers.  I am asking these questions here&mdash;that is the purpose of raising something on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I know it is true that there is a glut of oil and that incentives are being offered by the oil companies.  Have the Government any plans to deal with the people who are victimised by the change from oil to solid fuel and who now wish they had stuck with oil believing the Government that oil would be scarce, which now it is not, or so it seems?  Supposing the answer to all these questions is yes, that there is no hope at the moment in terms of present policies that the German Government or other governments are going to release the right kind of anthracite to us, is it possible that our Government could make a special appeal or a special deal for our small community having regard to the fact that the amount of anthracite required is not very large?  Is there something they can do for the people who have got themselves into this situation?  Does the policy that was announced by the Department of the Environment with regard to a change to solid fuel remain as Government policy? If it does, how soon is the citizenry of the country going to be instructed as to how and what kind of means they should use to implement that Government policy.  I should like answers to these questions.  It seems that a year ago the German Government were offering £10 per ton to their exporters for the export of anthracite then suddenly they panicked and they would not let it be exported.</P>
    <P>Finally, if I seem to have made heavy weather of this matter it is not in any spirit of cynicism.  I would really like to <Col N="1627" /> know what the Government have in mind for us in the matter.  I do not question the goodwill or the good intentions of the Government in turning towards the solid fuel policy.  I am worried nevertheless that we have rushed at that policy too precipitantly, too impetuously, and I would like to know what kind of advice the Minister of State and the Government have to offer to the citizen who has got himself into this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Martin has raised quite a number of questions and I hope I can satisfy him in some respects at least.  I would like to think him for raising this very important matter.  I hope that when I am finished I will at least be able to allay some of his fears.</P>
      <P>When the matter was raised, and even before that, inquiries from the coal trade ascertained that there are adequate supplies of anthracite in stock at present but that there are difficulties being experienced in burning some of the grades of anthracite in certain specialised appliances. I presume that that is the kernel of the Senator's case.  I am assured that this situation applies only to a very limited number of appliances.  I can assure the Senator that the coal trade are examining the problem to see if improved combustion in these appliances can be achieved but I agree that is of very little help to those who are actually caught at this particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator probably knows, seeing that his research has been very well done, two grades of anthracite are available.  With the first grade, the volatiles, that is the elements that are responsible for the ignition of the coal at three to four per cent approximately, are too low to produce efficient combustion of the fuel without a forced draught.  This factor adversely affects the performance of certain stoves.  However, I must emphasise that there are many other appliances, and they are in the majority, that burn the present stocks of anthracite <Col N="1628" /> satisfactorily.  At the moment tests are being conducted to see whether a suitable mixture of available grades can be evolved to solve the problem.  I understand that American anthracite, which is in fair supply in the Irish market, performs equally well to the blended anthracite.  The problem only arose around 1 June of this year.  Up to that time, as the Senator said quite rightly, Germany supplied the suitable anthracite but since then the sizes and characteristics available are not, as indicated, ideally suitable.  With many countries turning to coal there is pressure on supplies and anthracite is also being affected in this way.</P>
    <P>There are proven reserves of approximately 10.7 million tons of high grade anthracite in the Leinster Slieve Ardagh coalfield.  In addition, there are probable or possible reserves of 12 million tons in these coalfields.  The feasibility of extraction of all these coal reserves on an economic basis has yet to be established having regard to the very narrow nature of the seams, the depth at which they occur and some other operational factors. Current annual extraction amounts to approximately 9,500 tons.  In the light of the interest being shown in these coalfields by a number of prospective development companies and expansion proposals by existing mining companies, it is hoped that the rate of extraction will be significantly increased in the relatively near future when certain legal problems regarding the mining rights have been resolved.</P>
    <P>In regard to the environment, a reduction in present consumption of anthracite would not make any real difference to the smoke levels in the environment because consumption of anthracite accounts for only a small proportion of household coal.  For example, in 1979 it accounted for approximately 50,000 tons out of a total consumption of 1.2 million tons of household coal.  The present levels of smoke in the atmosphere do not exceed limits set in the directive adopted in principle by the Council of Ministers of the EEC in September 1979.  I understand <Col N="1629" /> that levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide which are the main air pollutants from fuel usage have been declining in the Dublin area in the period of 1970 to 1978 and that present levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide do not exceed the limits set in the directive to which I referred.  Pollution levels in the provincial cities are lower than in Dublin and the latter's small size, location, wind direction and force all contribute in a mainly beneficial way.</P>
    <P>The sale of smokeless fuels has dwindled very significantly in recent years, as the House is aware.  The principal smokeless fuel is coke, which is a byproduct of the production of coal gas. There was a virtual cessation of the manufacture of gas from coal.  This byproduct, coke, and many other products with brand names which were essentially the same thing, virtually disappeared from the market.  With the increased urbanisation and the risk of smog in urban environments, there is no doubt that this is regrettable.  The United Kingdom and other parts of the Continent had to introduce smokeless fuel zones in certain cities to cope with this problem.  With the inevitable diversion to coal which will now occur in Ireland, the importance of smokeless fuels will increase considerably.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the environment, the report published yesterday by the National Board for Science and Technology, entitled <i>Energy Supply and Demand for the Next 30 Years</i>, indicates the very increased share which coal is expected to hold of the Irish energy market by 1990.  While, of course, much of this is industrial, a significant part will be domestic coal in which anthracite and coke will have a very important part to play.  While the environment is the primary responsibility of another Minister, the Minister for Energy is far from being unmindful of the side effects of this shift in the energy supply policy, and due regard will be paid to such factors in the planning and integration of that policy.  The continued availability of anthracite of acceptable quality will continue to be a concern of the Minister for <Col N="1630" /> Energy.  If it is necessary to increase the standards of performance of the special stoves for burning anthracite, this can also be looked at.  It is not, however, on the information available to the Minister for Energy, a problem of any significance other than that arising from difficulties with certain types of stoves handling one of the grades of anthracite now on the market.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin posed certain questions. The information available to us is that there are sufficient supplies of anthracite available.  However, there are shortages of a particular kind.  In reply to the Senator's second question, the National Prices Commission would insist on getting the buy-in price and the costs would have to be proved to the National Prices Commission before any increase in price could be allowed.</P>
    <P>With regard to a glut of oil, my recollection is that it was not dinner-sets they were asking for some time ago, but money in advance.  All of us who remember that should think twice about accepting the dinner-sets now.  At the time of the grants, oil was in a critical supply situation.  A change to any solid fuel&mdash;I emphasise any solid fuel because that was what the grants were for, not the particular grade of anthracite to which the Senator referred&mdash;was then and is still seen as a desirable security of supply. I am not aware of a problem about hopperfed anthracite.  The information is that, generally, there are adequate supplies of anthracite.  However, I take the Senator's point in relation to looking for other sources, and I will certainly put that point very forcibly to the Minister for Energy.  The fact that the vast majority of people can obtain fuel for their stoves is of very little consequence and is very little use to those who have the particular problem the Senator has in mind. He can rest assured that I will put to the Minister for Energy everything he has said in relation to looking for other markets.</P>
