      <P>I have notice from Senator Cooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House to-day, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The awarding of a contract for a new national school at Ballinahown, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that this week we are to devote most of our time to the Finance Bill.  I had hoped that item No. 8 on the Order Paper would have appeared on the Order of Business to-day. This would be purely to designate a date for the Second Stage of the Sexual Offences Bill, 1980, which was printed and circulated a week ago.  All Senators are acutely aware that the summer recess is approaching.  I had hoped&mdash;and all of us involved in the presentation of <Col N="680" /> this Bill had hoped&mdash;that we would be able to take the Second Stage next week.</P>
      <P>Obviously I do not intend to say anything about the content of the Sexual Offences Bill.  Senators are aware that we spent a considerable time, 15 months ago, debating a motion on the same lines.  Everybody was unanimous in their consideration that there was great urgency about this matter.  For these reasons it is unthinkable that we should delay until after the summer recess to take the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is the first time this new Standing Order has been used.  All the Independent Senators in the House have nominated me to present this Bill.  The spirit of this Standing Order is that a Second Reading should be given speedily to such a Bill.  I will conclude by saying I do not wish to be troublesome or obstructive in any way.  I would very much like to ask the Leader of the House, since we are sitting all this week, if he would put item No. 8 on the Order of Business for tomorrow so that we may fix a date for the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Hussey in her plea that this Bill should be put on the Order of Business for tomorrow so that a date for Second Stage may be fixed.  She has given all the reasons for this.  In a matter of this urgency to leave it over until October would be a very great shame and would be wrong in the circumstances of the matters that are dealt with.  Who knows how many human beings may suffer between now and next October? The point of putting it on the Order of Business tomorrow would be that we could get some date fixed at any rate before the summer recess in July.  I should like to support Senator Hussey very strongly.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Leader of the House to motion No. 20 on the Order Paper: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann, noting the continuing <i>impasse</i> in Northern Ireland, calls for constructive attitudes and constructive <Col N="681" /> policies which will lead to a resolution of the problem.&rdquo;  I believe there would be considerable support on all sides of the House, coming from all groups, for a discussion on Northern Ireland and particularly at present before the summer recess.  It would be an appropriate time considering the policies now being discussed.  I hope the Leader of the House will find it possible to arrange to debate the motion on Northern Ireland before we adjourn for the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why the wishes on the one hand of Senator Hussey and Senator McGuinness and, on the other, of Senator West, should not be accommodated and I strongly support the pleas of each of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to acknowledge most enthusiastically the claims of Senator Hussey's Bill.  It is a Bill to which I put my name and to which all the Independent Senators in the House put their names.  When an allied issue was raised for discussion last year while I cannot speak for everybody certainly I remember speaking very strenuously in favour of the necessity for dealing with this very serious issue which Senator Hussey raises on Item No. 8.</P>
      <P>The Bill is entitled &ldquo;an Act to amend the law in relation to sexual offences.&rdquo;  I agree with Senator Murphy that the two issues are not in any sense incompatible. On the other hand, if either issue is raised the opportunity for a debate immediately ensues in the House and, as the House is moving towards a recess, it is necessary to balance the relative urgencies in the Bill and the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to my extreme concern about Item No. 8, Senator Hussey's Bill to which I have given my absolutely unqualified support, and Motion No. 20 which is signed by myself and Senator West and Senator Hussey, I would have to come down in favour of the latter. Senator McGuinness asked how many <Col N="682" /> human beings might suffer between now and the end of the recess.  One cannot help immediately being stimulated to think about the number of people who have suffered over the past 12 years of increasing daily traumata in Northern Ireland.  There seems to be an imminent initiative of some kind from Britain on the matter and our Government seem to have a policy with regard to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the priority of concern as between these two matters that I am concerned with.  With due respect, I do not want to cross you on the matter. It is the question as to which of the two would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The priorities are in order. At this moment before we go into recess, in terms of political priority, many people are thinking about the Northern Ireland situation.  Many people are wondering how we feel in the South on that subject.  The Seanad has been the body that has pronounced on it most often and has debated it most fruitfully.  This is a most opportune time to find out what the feeling of the nation as reflected in the House is.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would tend to say that at a moment when various solutions are being floated in the public press, from the notion of direct rule to the notion of Ian Paisley becoming the new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Senator to be brief on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take your direction.  I apologise for being long-winded. This seems to be an absolutely opportune moment for this House to rehearse our attitudes towards this extremely important, very long-standing <Col N="683" /> and extraordinarily agonising problem which faces our nation.  The major issue which faces our nation today is the problem of Northern Ireland and that is the one which should take priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certain that we will not be able to discuss both matters before the summer recess.  Even the Independent Senators seem to be in some dilemma as to which item should take priority.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to amend the law relating to sexual offences.  I should like to congratulate Senator Hussey on tabling this Bill.  It does not really matter whether we discuss it in this House this week or next week.  The Dáil is going into recess at the end of next week.  Even if the Bill were to pass all Stages in this House, it would not be possible for the legislation to go through before the end of the summer.  For that reason, there is not really much point in this House upsetting the Order of Business suggested by the Leader of the House and debating a Bill that cannot be passed in all its Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the summer.  For that reason we should support the Order of Business as outlined by the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to this discussion I would be inclined to order my priorities in the order suggested by Senator Martin, that is, the more worthwhile subject for debate, in terms of any effect that might be produced by a debate, would be a debate on Northern Ireland.  We all know that even if the Sexual Offences Bill gets a Second Reading, it will be voted down by the Government party.  The Minister is on record as saying he will be proposing a Bill to deal with this problem.  Quite obviously the arrival of this Bill on the Order Paper will do what I have no doubt the proposers want, that is, to speed up the Minister's hand and try to force his hand in bringing forward his legislation.  It has been a feature of this Government that many Bills are introduced only in the aftermath of a <Col N="684" /> Private Members' Bill.  Tabling the Bill will probably achieve what its proposers want to achieve, that is to bring forth a Bill from the Minister quickly.  Consequently I would be inclined to think that a debate on Northern Ireland would be of greater immediacy as far as the House is concerned and would be of more value nationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my sympathy with the pleas for an early discussion on both item No. 8 and Motion No. 20.  I do so without wishing to upset the Order of Business proposed for today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be the case that the Minister is preparing a Bill like the Bill mentioned in item No. 8 on the Order Paper.  Since I have noted rather regretfully the unwillingness of the present administration to listen to amendments after a Bill has been tabled, it seems to me a good thing that this House should be able to express its opinion before that Bill reaches the stage of printing and circulation.  There is a very strong argument for debating this Bill, both on the basis that it will speed up a tardy Minister and also on the basis that it will enable us to express our opinions here.  We had remarkable unanimity the last time this subject was discussed 15 months ago.  It will enable our opinions to be taken note of in the drafting of the Bill, which is a better mechanism than trying to get them into a Bill after it has been printed and circulated.  I am strongly in favour of taking item No. 8 on the Order Paper as quickly as possible. Senator Hussey has suggested that it might be taken tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation about the North is this, that we know a British initiative is pending.  We know it is substantially decided on, though we do not know what is in it.  We understand the Taoiseach knows what is in it, but the rest of the country does not.  After decisions had been taken but not made public or implemented I would find myself in something of a difficulty.  I would be rather hung up discussing the North now, not knowing what the current British initiative is, but knowing that it is <Col N="685" /> definitely decided on.  We will be sitting for another few weeks.  We will know very quickly what is in the Northern initiative. We might take item No. 8 on the agenda&mdash;the Sexual Offences Bill&mdash;tomorrow and we might keep open the option of a debate on Northern Ireland before we rise.  I wanted to add my voice to those who have said that both matters are urgent.  I do not see any reason why they should not both be discussed before the Seanad rises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of legislative reform must be supported in all fields. The subject which Senator Hussey's Bill proposes to deal with is of the greatest importance having regard to the increase in the incidence of the crime with which it deals and for other reasons.  We must be very careful to ensure that any legislative proposals should be effective. I do not think the proposals in Senator Hussey's Bill are effective.  Therefore, I see no point in discussing it.  I think they are naive, immature and, above all, impractical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to Senator Hussey whose sincerity in the matter I do not doubt, I have sent to her a detailed analysis of and my comments on the Bill.  I would support the motion that we should discuss Northern Ireland before the recess.  That is a matter of even more importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of comments on the matters raised.  First of all, in relation to the Sexual Offences Bill, 1980, I should like to support very strongly the House giving time for a Second Reading of this Bill before the summer recess.  I am not in the least persuaded by the matters that have been raised by other Senators, not going into the merits of it, but saying that since there is a Government Bill being discussed, or being thought about, there is no point in giving time to debate this Bill.  I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that we broadened our approach <Col N="686" /> to legislative initiatives.  This is a Bill that is before the House.  In my view it incorporates a number of important reforms in the law relating to rape.  It is broad enough to encompass any amendments that might be proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the Bill at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the merits or contents of the Bill.  What we are discussing is whether or not we take this Bill before the summer recess.  I would argue very strongly that the Oireachtas is impoverished if the only legislation we discuss and pass has to come from a narrow Government source.  I say that with great emphasis. We are impoverished if we will not take important, serious and thoughtful initiatives from the source from which they come, whether it is an independent source or an Opposition party source, allow them to be discussed, make progress, and make important reforms on that basis.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that we adopted so much of the Westminster model of a parliament and left out the importance of backbencher initiative, the importance of the role of an elected representative of the people in putting forward legislation and having it discussed and passed, with or without amendments.  The title and content are broad enough for any amendment in the law relating to rape to be in order.  Therefore, I do not accept that the Government cannot make their imprint on this Bill but, nevertheless, let it go forward.  If we did that, then the Seanad would have already discussed, debated and passed this Bill.  It would speed up the process for the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point on that particular item.  I will turn now to the other motion which has received a lot of support&mdash;the motion on Northern Ireland.  I would welcome an opportunity for a debate on Northern Ireland before the summer recess, although I share <Col N="687" /> some of the reservations expressed by Senator Keating.  It is, nevertheless, an extremely important and vital area, and we do not have enough opportunities for serious discussion.  We ought to make our views known on the record at an early opportunity.</P>
      <P>Since we seem to be discussing our business and our potential business over the next few weeks, I should like to raise another important motion to add to the check list.  I would hope that there might be an opportunity for a discussion on Motion No. 18, which is a motion noting &ldquo;the significance of the report and recommendations of the Brandt Commission contained in the &lsquo;North-South: a programme for survival, 1980&rsquo;&rdquo;.  This is not North-South in a Northern Ireland context but North-South in a world context. That report has extremely important proposals and urgent recommendations in relation to the Third World.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to.  On 26 March 1980, in the Seanad, during a debate on foreign policy in relation to Iran and Afghanistan, I mentioned that I was going to table the report which has now been tabled for debate as a motion and that, in my view, it was one of the most important documents to have come on the world scene.  This is from the Official Report of the Seanad Debates, Volume 93, No. 13 of 26 March 1980. The Minister for Foreign Affairs who was in the House that day intervened to say: &ldquo;I agree with the Senator.&rdquo;  Then I went on: &ldquo;I hope the Minister will be available at a relatively early date for a debate on that report&rdquo;.  The Minister appeared to nod when I said that.  The nod obviously is not recorded.  I have the impression that the Minister for Foreign Affairs does accept the importance of the Brandt Report, the urgency of discussing it, and that he might be prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would ask the Leader of the House, therefore, to ascertain whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be available for a debate on this issue before the Seanad rises.  It has not been debated in the Dáil.  It will be a matter for a United Nations conference at the end of September, a major United Nations conference.  It would be important to have a debate in the Oireachtas on the record of our views and our attitudes towards the Government's possible initiative in that area and, if we are counting heads, it is probably the area which is of most significance in human terms of all the motions on the list.</P>

    <Title>Turf Development Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £60 million to £100 million the limitation on the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna <Col N="689" /> for the performance of their functions under the Turf Development Acts.</P>
      <P>The board's first development programme, adopted in 1946, had as its main features the production of one million tonnes of sod peat annually, improvements in the Lullymore briquetting plant and the establishment of the first generation of turf fired power stations. The second development programme, launched in 1950, concentrated chiefly on milled peat production and, since that date, the annual milled peat output has been built up to around three million tonnes.  The implementation of that programme led to the erection of four additional turf fired power stations and two additional briquette factories.</P>
      <P>In 1974 Bord na Móna commenced their third development programme to expand their peat production.  This programme was subsequently extended and now covers development of about 62,000 acres providing for the production of 2.75 million tonnes of milled peat, 32,000 tonnes of sod peat and 650,000 cubic metres of moss peat per annum in addition to existing production.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in development operations under the programme and in some instances bog areas are approaching the production stage and production will commence this year.  The operations involved in the programme extend over Counties Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Galway, Roscommon, Longford and Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the additional milled peat will be used in two new briquette factories which are planned to produce 390,000 tonnes of briquettes annually.  One of the factories at Littleton, County Tipperary, designed to produce 130,000 tonnes of briquettes per annum is nearing completion and production will commence in 1981.  The second factory which is at present in the planning stage will be erected in the Ballyforan area, County Roscommon and will have an output of 260,000 tonnes of briquettes per annum. It will use the milled peat to be produced <Col N="690" /> at the nearby Derryfadda group of bogs from which a production of 700,000 tonnes per annum is planned.  It is proposed to build the factory in two phases, the first of which will be in production in 1984 and the second in 1987.  When all these factories are in full production, total production of briquettes in all the board's five factories will be 750,000 tonnes per annum which is over twice the present production level.</P>
    <P>The balance of the production of milled peat under the programme will be used in existing electricity generating stations and in two new 40 megawatt generating units to be erected by the Electricity Supply Board, one at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, and the second at Lanesboro, County Longford, as extensions to existing stations.  It is expected that the first of these new units will be in operation in 1982-83.  The additional production of sod peat will be used to offset to some extent the reduction in output from existing sod peat bogs as they become cut out.  The moss peat will supplement the board's present production of 1.25 million cubic metres per annum, the bulk of which is for export.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna expect to be able to maintain the full production capacity of their existing three briquette factories in the present year.  As the House is aware demand at present is greatly in excess of supply so that the quantities available are being distributed to customers of the board in proportion to their purchases in 1976 which was the last year in which briquette supplies were able to meet demand. The position will not be improved until the new briquette factory at Littleton starts producing early in 1981.</P>
    <P>Bog harvesting conditions in 1979 were the worst recorded in the past 20 years.  Despite this, machine turf supplies throughout the winter were in excess of the previous years' supplies.</P>
    <P>At present the board employ 5,100 persons on average throughout the year. The full implementation of the third development programme will mean additional <Col N="691" /> employment for 2,200 persons on average.  These will include persons engaged in turf production and allied operations on the bogs and employment at the Littleton and Ballyforan briquette factories.  Apart from direct employment by Bord na Móna, the increased production of briquettes is also estimated to provide additional employment in the briquette distribution trade for something in the region of 250 persons. The programme has already generated employment for 700 persons in 1979 and this figure is expected to reach 1,000 persons in 1980.  In addition to the above, up to 200 persons have been employed by contractors to the board mainly in relation to the erection of the Littleton briquette factory.  Moreover, apart from providing employment at the board's own engineering workshops, the programme also generates indirect employment in outside engineering firms in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The present limitation of £60 million on the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna was fixed by the Turf Development Act, 1975.  At that time the cost of the programme was estimated at £28.5 million.  Due to an extension of the programme to include a greater acreage of bog than was originally planned for development, and the subsequent inclusion of the proposal to build a briquetting factory at Ballyforan and also because of inflation, the original estimate will be greatly exceeded and the capital cost of the programme is now estimated at £120 million.  The board's borrowings are expected to reach the £60 million limit shortly and consequently it is now necessary to raise the limit to provide for further borrowings.  The board expect to reach the £100 million limit in 1982.</P>
    <P>In the case of the first and second development programmes the necessary capital was advanced by the Exchequer. While the third development programme was also financed in the earlier years by the Exchequer, the indications are that from now on the board will be relying on borrowing most of their requirements from the European Investment Bank and <Col N="692" /> the New Community Borrowing and Lending Instrument.  These are EEC agencies through which loans are made for priority investments in infrastructures and the energy sectors in accordance with Community objectives and to foster economic growth.</P>
    <P>I feel that Senators generally will welcome the evidence which this Bill provides of the Government's intention to pursue a vigorous policy of expansion of Bord na Móna's activities.  The board's operations are beneficial, not alone for the valuable employment and economic activity which they generate in particular areas, but on a national scale. Our turf resources have assumed a new importance in the present climate of restricted and increasingly costly oil supplies. It is fortunate that in recent years when our excessive dependence on oil has become painfully illustrated we had in existence a State body with the organisation and technical capability to embark on a major programme to expand development of indigenous fuel. This is a tribute to the foresight and courage of those involved in the setting up of the board.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there are calls for an even greater expansion of our turf development schemes but it must be accepted that, substantial though the effort is, there are unavoidable constraints.  Not all our bogs are suited to the mechanised development necessary for large-scale commercial exploitation.  Bord na Móna are at present investigating, surveying and assessing the potential for development of other bog areas which are not included in their present programmes.  As a result of this investigation, it is likely that further proposals will evolve for an expansion beyond the activities covered by the third programme.</P>
    <P>The Central Development Committee which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Finance has investigated the prospects of increasing turf production in the western counties and submitted a report to me which I will be examining shortly with considerable interest.</P>
    <P>New development work must be accompanied <Col N="693" /> by long-term programmes to bring into economic use the areas which are being cleared of usable turf deposits. The House will be aware that this aspect has been under continuous study and an interim report on this subject by a committee was published some months ago. This report concluded that much more research and pilot development schemes were necessary before definite conclusions could be reached on the best use of cutaway bog areas.  We will be pressing ahead with this work.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome Deputy Colley here as Minister for Energy.  It is the first time that I have been involved with him in the House since he became Minister.  I wish him well as he has one of the most important portfolios and because it is in the best interests of every one here that his programme be successful.</P>
      <P>I welcome and commend this Bill in so far as it goes.  There is no doubt that the activities of Bord na Móna over the years have been highly commendable and that their efforts through their production of machine turf, milled peat, briquettes and peat moss for export have given tremendous employment where it was badly needed.  Great use was made of natural resources.  There is no doubt that certain areas benefited greatly <i>vis-a-vis</i>, population growth, better community spirit and so on because of intervention by Bord na Móna.  The board have made a great contribution over the years to our energy needs.  From what I know of the board's performance they provided leadership at a time when it was quite difficult to carry out the sort of programmes they have been carrying out over the years.  Their work is very important at this stage&mdash;I could not over-stress how important it is&mdash;when the price of oil has gone out of everybody's reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which the Minister has not mentioned is the suggestion in the Eighth Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies that Bord na Móna, as an organisation, would be seeking increases <Col N="694" /> in the value of their products on the reasonable basis that the value of their fuel should be judged on the same basis as or in comparison with other fuels.  I would not agree that just because we have to pay more for imported products every householder in Ireland should have to pay more for a nationally produced product.  We are lucky to have this product and I cannot see the logic in the board's trying to prove to all and sundry that the fuel value should be compared £ for £ with what we have to import.  I could see any ordinary businessman agreeing to that from a business point of view; there is no reason why he should not.  But Bord na Móna have a very good track record in providing reasonably priced heating products for the homes of Ireland and the fact that oil has become so extraordinarily expensive is no reason why the cost of Bord na Móna's products should suddenly shoot up.  Heating is a very important item in the family budget. Whether one is rich or poor one has to have heat of some description.  I would suggest that the Minister take another look at that proposal.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are now organising this new development programme in the west.  It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge the decision to build a briquette factory in Ballyforan.  Deputy O'Malley, the former Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, announced it some time last year and this announcement came as sweet music to our ears.  It comes to an area where there is no shortage of bog.  I have often said that it was the bogs of that area that kept the people poor for centuries and it is only right and fitting that we should now get a chance to break out of that poverty trap in so far as there are natural resources there which are at last going to be exploited. The labour force there will be ideally suited and I see no reason why it will not be 100 per cent successful.  But it is also true that there will be slight problems there and I want to take this opportunity of mentioning them to the Minister because I know that he will give them a full hearing.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are moving into the <Col N="695" /> north Galway area or the Galway area in general and there is a bog acquisition programme.  There would be very little point in the board being there unless they had sufficient bog to justify their existence there.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that I welcome the briquette factory in Ballyforan.  Any reasonable man would have to do that because it is exactly what we want.  On the other hand, the criteria used heretofore in the bog acquisition programme in other counties in the past cannot be related to what is happening now in a place like County Galway at a time when oil is so expensive.</P>
    <P>The Bord na Móna price structure at the moment, amongst other things, is certainly out of line.  Until a few months ago, the price of virgin bog was approximately £45 per acre.  I reckon, as do people who are more connected with this than I, that an acre of bogland would supply a family house for 30 years. There is a 30 year supply of turf in an acre of bog.  Householders in certain cases are being asked to hand over their 30 years supply which is, by and large, a life-time for a price that was £45 an acre and is now about £100 an acre.  That is totally and absolutely out of the question. One could balance it by saying it is in the national interest and that they cannot have it both ways, that they are getting an industry there.  But, from what the Minister has been saying recently, I know that all aspects of our energy programme must be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>If most of the boglands are acquired by Bord na Móna in the next couple of years, it will mean that farming families and the people in the small towns will be out on the market competing for the fuel with the rest of the population.  That does not make good sense.  Where it is possible to do so Bord na Móna should leave a certain amount of turf for the people who already own it.  This subject has not come up before but when the board were in County Kildare, generally speaking, one did not have the same type of ownership of small farms as one finds in the <Col N="696" /> west and, as is well known, most farms in the west have a right to turbary of one description or another and that was well used until about ten years ago.  But with progress in farming and the resulting wealth many farmers began to think that their time in the bog was wasted because we were getting cheap oil and that, hour for hour, they were better employed on the land than in the bog.</P>
    <P>But times have changed dramatically and in the last two or three years people who heretofore would not have been seen dead in a bog are now going there. That is nothing to what is going to happen in the next two or three years, particularly when we now know that it is on the cards that the price of other fuels will increase dramatically again.  I am asking the Bord na Móna officials and the Minister to take great note of this because there will be little use complaining about it in four or five years time when most farmers will have had their bog acquired by Bord na Móna and will be on the market for the very fuel that they could have had themselves.  It is as well to say that.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the board officials, in their initial acquisition proceedings in Galway, in so far as it was reasonably possible they left some turbary to the existing tenants but many people have made representations to me in regard to the fact that they have little or no bog left.  I make a special appeal to the Minister today that, in the new acquisition programme, sufficient note will be taken of changing circumstances and that, where it is at all possible, the board will facilitate the people in a way that they have not done up to now.  I am calling for real sacrifices.</P>
    <P>I understand that where there is a huge block, a few thousand acres of bog, one could not expect the board to allow a man to have a little plot in the centre of it.  Some people may think that this is not the most important point in this Bill before us but it is certainly tied up with it and it is a very big topic at the moment in County Galway and other surrounding counties.  It is very important that every effort be made now to ensure <Col N="697" /> that people who own bogs&mdash;and I am not talking about people jumping on the bandwagon&mdash;be allowed to cut turf on the perimeter of the bogs or in a certain section if they show willingness to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not take the point made that people who had bogs did not use them. What was not economically viable or feasible four or five years ago is certainly viable now and it is against that background that the board will have to look at this and, where the board actually acquire bogland, it is absolutely out of the question to talk about £100 an acre in this day and age.  It is as well to say too, that in the past eight or ten years a lot of farmers have found it suitable to their needs and to their farm plans to buy turf from Bord na Móna. This has been so in places like Attymon, in parts of Offaly and in Lanesborough. But in the last years, and particularly in 1979, it was necessary in some of those places to have one's name down maybe six months beforehand to get a year's supply of turf.  I know people who are waiting four, five and six months for a load of turf.  This is a very real problem because most farmhouses are geared to burn things like turf and they have been used to it for centuries.</P>
    <P>I hope that note will be taken of the problems that our new-found industrial investment and our involvement in places like Ballyforan will create.  We will have to accept some of the problems and put up with the inconvenience because obviously this will provide well-paid and badly-needed jobs.  But there is no point in creating more fuel problems and shortages at this stage if we can avoid it, and I think we can.</P>
    <P>In relation to this whole question of the price of the bogs, assuming that the board will, where necessary or where it is possible, allow a farmer to use bogland or leave him a part of what he now owns, it would be fairly difficult to look for too high a price.  While I say that £100 is totally unrealistic we would certainly not be looking for a real gold dust price; we would be looking for something fairly reasonable.  Where a <Col N="698" /> farmer could not possibly be left his bogland, a reasonable price should be paid.  A second look should be taken at this whole question of arbitration.  There is an arbitration clause in this so that, when a board official calls to a farmer or to a bog owner and they cannot agree on a price, it will be possible for them to go to arbitration.  That is all very well but can the Minister imagine a small farmer who has an acre of bog worth between £45 and £100 per acre deciding to take on Bord na Móna at arbitration?  He would have to brief somebody to arrive at the arbitration hearing and, whatever type of legal opinion he got, it would certainly cost him more than £100 before it would be all over so there would be no point in him going to arbitration.</P>
    <P>I understand that the IFA Rural Development Committee have been in contact with Bord na Móna and that they have proposed a system whereby four different types of bog plots would be put up for arbitration and that the outcome of that would be, more or less, binding on the people concerned.  I welcome that development.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there is a very quick decision and that that decision would be applied to all parties.  That will take a lot of the doubt out of the matter because I have no doubt that if the case as it is at the moment is put before any independent arbitrator, the price of £100 an acre will be thrown out of the window as being totally unrealistic.  In the interests of Bord na Móna it is important that the process be gone through very quickly and this decision taken and accepted so as to allay the fears of all the small bog owners in County Galway.</P>
    <P>When one considers that an eight-ton load of turf delivered now costs between £190 and £200 and that it would certainly take at least twice that, about £380 or £400, and possibly £500 or £600 next year, to keep a very small home fire burning, and that besides that any householder would have to have gas or electricity for cooking as well, it gives one an idea of what farmers are being asked to do in giving up for £100 something that they will have to pay <Col N="699" /> £500 or £600 for.  I do not think they will do that and one could not blame them.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the whole question of energy, the initial statements by the Minister were very helpful.  It is very important to make the community aware that the days of wastage are over and that anything that is produced from our own resources has to make good sense now.  Now is the time for our scientists and people in various walks of life to ensure that new methods are brought in. We should be able to get energy from waste material.</P>
    <P>In relation to the bogs, Bord na Móna will do a very fine job at the end of the day.  I believe that problems they are now encountering in County Galway can be overcome.  If, in the final analysis the board decide to relate the cost of their products to heating products such as oil, there should be no reason why the bog owners should not be entitled to a reasonable price for what they are handing over.  I see no reason why we should quibble with the purpose of the Bill, which is to raise the borrowing limitation from £60 million to £100 million because, for this type of Bill, it is only too seldom that a semi-State organisation as successful as Bord na Móna comes up before us.  I wish them well but I ask the Minister to take note of what I have been saying about the price of the bogs and how important it is to leave some bog to people who already own it.  It is very important to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for its promise of expanded development of our most important indigenous source of energy.  Not only do we need to do everything we can quickly to reduce our highly vulnerable dependence on imported energy but we also need, even more urgently, to curb our extravagant and unsustainable annual national outlay on energy by cutting out waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Energy conservation is the subject of a campaign just launched by the Minister.  Education, exhortation, persuasion, all have their rightful place in the furtherance of Government policies. <Col N="700" /> But the main point I want to make today is that I believe that the energy problem, because of its scale and nature, requires far more than this.  Our present living standard as a nation is temporarily and precariously buttressed by an annual £700 million of resources from abroad which we can pay for only by foreign borrowing.  The Government are attempting to correct this situation by a combination of fiscal, monetary and incomes policies.  The most important of these instruments is, of course, incomes policy but it is also the hardest to operate successfully.  Failure on this front, however, renders any attempt at action on the other two fronts ineffective except at the expense of an intolerable loss of jobs and a multitude of bankruptcies.</P>
    <P>I have often spoken of the dangerous tendency of governments to indulge excessive expectations of their economic management capacity.  There is all the more reason, therefore, for governments to act where action is open to them without significant adverse domestic consequences.  The field of energy is one of these.  We are spending about £800 million, possibly more this year, on imports of oil, more than 12 times as much as in 1973.  A saving of even 12½ per cent&mdash;and nobody on a conservation campaign would look for less than 12½ per cent&mdash;would reduce our import bill by £100 million and make a substantial contribution to relieving our balance of payments problem.  It would be grand if this saving could be achieved voluntarily in response to Government exhortations and following energy audits.  But I do not think it is reasonable to expect this nor do I think we can afford, for one moment longer, to borrow for wasteful purposes such vast amounts of foreign money.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the Government developing our native energy resources.  I am in favour of the Government offering any effective incentives they can to boost their conservation programme.  But we need direct management measures also without further delay, such as controls over the heating of offices and&mdash;unpopular as it may sound&mdash;rationing of petrol and oil for private use.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> Equitably shared economies would, I believe, be borne by a public which had been brought to understand the critical need for energy saving as one of the least difficult and least painful ways of correcting the frightening lack of balance of our external finances.</P>
    <P>Direct controls over consumption are much preferable to attempts to regulate consumption through the purse.  Additions by way of taxation to the inexorably rising cost of petrol and oil only give a fresh twist to the price spiral and generate claims for compensation which risk accentuating inflation still further.</P>
    <P>I will be reminded that direct controls would still leave money in people's pockets for other forms of expenditure. In part my answer is, as I have said here on a number of occasions, some money could well be subtracted from some pockets by way of direct taxation, particularly from those of us who have been receiving tax and rates reliefs in recent years even when the State was not able to meet its current outlay out of current income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair appreciates very much the importance of what the Senator is saying but the Bill deals mainly with increasing the amount of money available for turf development from £60 to £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself related the Bill to our excessive dependence on imported oil.  I am just following that particular line.  I have only a few more points to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>But he just made a passing reference to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The second answer I would give to those who say that money would still be left in people's pockets is that if this money were no longer being spent on imported oil but on domestic fuels and on aids to saving energy generally or countering its loss, for example, by buying and wearing heavier winter clothes, the domestic content of <Col N="702" /> the expenditure would be much higher to the benefit of home economic activity. There would be a significant net relief to the balance of payments and public transport would receive a much-needed boost.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, urge forthright action on the energy saving front as a complement to measures, such as this Bill envisages, to develop native energy resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first add my voice to that of Senator Connaughton in welcoming the Minister on this, the first time, I have encountered him wearing his energy hat, and to put on the record my opinion that in fact the crisis of the market economy world expresses itself more sharply as an energy crisis than in any other way.  Therefore, the Minister's job is of the most enormous importance for the future of this country and a lot will depend on how well he carries out that job.  We all wish him well.</P>
      <P>Secondly, let me echo Senator Connaughton again in praising Bord na Móna.  It is a so-called semi-State body, in fact, a State body which has served this country very well.  A Chathaoirleach, perhaps you will not rule me out of order if I cross party lines and send good wishes to the person who more than any other single individual in the State is associated with the foundation of the board.  I refer to Dr. C.S. Andrews, who has also very recently put out a remarkable and admirable book.  It is an occasion to wish him health and long life and to applaud his energy and vigour in getting the board off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That board is being carried on very well by admirable people.  They have served us well.  For my part, I am certainly not going to oppose this Bill.  It is well to put in a word in defence of the semi-State boards and companies who during the past five years, using the norms of the estimating of costs, have come up with prices for new developments which subsequently <Col N="703" /> turned out to be far too little.  Certain stones are being thrown at them for what are called wild under-estimates.  In fact, we have lived through a time and are living through a time of very dramatic inflation in the cost of industrial plant. They would be more sharply and more properly reprimanded had they grossly over-estimated.  They had to use the norms of the times when the estimates were being prepared.  There is no proper reproach that can be laid against the board if in fact the cost of certain developments has turned out to be a lot more than when they were originally on the drawing board.  The purposes for which the additional £40 million will be expended are proper and reasonable and nationally beneficial.  There is very little to be said on that score.  I wish to use the opportunity as other Senators have done, to make some comments firstly on certain aspects of the board and, secondly, to broaden the debate a little.  I trust I will be in order because I will be referring to statements in the opening speech and making certain comments on the wider energy issue.</P>
      <P>The question of turf development in Ireland is utterly inseparable from the question of energy policy.  Let me say something about the matter of policy for Bord na Móna as between what they represent&mdash;the public sector&mdash;and various companies and very many individuals who save turf themselves and who represent what one might call a private sector in peat production.  The dramatic increase in the price of energy and, therefore, in the value of the peat both in the ground and when it is available for use as a fuel have altered somewhat the balance between those two sectors.  At the risk of being misrepresented, let me say that I believe that the board must always carry on on behalf of the people the role of the workers of the large bogs, the commanding heights of peat production and of bog utilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to think aloud a little and, following some of the comments of Senator Connaughton about the interrelationship between the public and the <Col N="704" /> private sector, to comment on what he said about the price of bogland.  I do not think that £100 an acre is serious now.  It should be relatively easy to find a system of arbitration.  I am not saying that it is necessary to adopt <i>in toto</i> the IFA suggestions but it would be relatively easy to adopt a system of arbitration which would be both prompt and more equitable than what happens at present.  I want to say in a parenthesis, having praised the board, that taking them over the profile of the last two or three years&mdash;I do not know of cases in the immediate past that I would want to comment on and the practice I refer to may have been going on for longer but I have only known about it for four or five years&mdash;their purchasing policy has been rough and unduly forceful in parts of the country.  It has taken advantage of people who were too small and too poor and, if they were not organised into farmers' organisations, too scattered and not unified enough to defend their interests properly.  Those people have been taken advantage of.  The board have gone quite close to the limits of the law and possibly beyond the limits of the law.  For an organisation with an admirable record in general, I deplore that and I hope it has ceased to happen but it is fair to put on the record that from time to time it has happened in regard to the board's land acquisition policy.</P>
    <P>The question of land acquisition policy could be resolved with benefit both to the standing of the board and with benefit to people who feel they are being coerced and also with benefit in terms of the prevailing current uncertainty. That could be sorted out.  It would involve a higher price but it would not involve a ridiculous price.  In terms of the general capital cost of the whole operation we are not talking about unthinkable sums of money.  The sums of money that would be dispersed would be dispersed into a private sector of the economy, into the hands mostly of small farmers who would promptly put it back into circulation and would in general use it in a productive way.  I do not see any element of profiteering, of moving capital out of the country, or of disadvantage <Col N="705" /> to the economy, in treating, particularly the small farm sellers of peatlands, more generously and equitably than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I would bitterly oppose any effort to diminish the thrust and the power and the scope of operations of Bord na Móna but those of us who are old enough to remember the war will recall the enormous and widespread thrust of turf cutting then.  But that was private turf cutting and it was based on very simple manual labour.  It was based on human muscles both for the physical cutting and the distribution of the sods.  At the other end, you had something as big as the board who were able to mechanise and who have shown very efficiently considerable innovation and an admirable approach to mechanisation.  I have been very struck in the recent past by the fact that machinery for cutting turf has become much smaller, much lighter and, therefore, much more within the scope of private people.</P>
    <P>We have an extraordinary pattern of peat in this country.  We have the immense blanket bogs and nobody in my view, could think for a moment of allowing anybody but a State board at these bogs.  We have raised bogs.  We have little pockets of bogs and all of them in their different ways are useful.  They are a great resource.  We have to worry desperately at this moment about borrowings either by the State or by the State companies and we have to worry about where those borrowings take place.</P>
    <P>It seems to be that, believing as I do in a mixed economy and believing that the board must extend their role in what I call&mdash;using an echo from another context&mdash;the commanding height of peat production in the big bogs, that there might be a place for encouraging small individuals to get into sod peat production on the basis of existing cheap mechanisation, of diggers that cost in the order of £25,000 and £30,000 with appropriate attachments.  This will increase output and it will also provide a little bit of competition for the board in the countryside <Col N="706" /> about price.  I will talk about price and pricing policy in a minute, but I think that would be no harm.  It would be good for the balance of payments and the capital to do it would have to be mobilised by the private individuals who are doing it.</P>
    <P>Coming from me and from my party it may surprise people that I say that but I say it absolutely, deliberately and consciously, believing as I do in a mixed economy, believing that the role of the board is central, but I think that with the smaller bogs the Minister might look at ways of increasing private peat production and, indeed, of finding a trade-off and a liaison between the interests of private producers and of the board.</P>
    <P>That leads me immediately to the question of what is done&mdash;and it is the same trade-off between private interest and the board interest&mdash;with cutaway bog.  Again, the Minister made reference to that.  I believe profoundly that with the way the world is going we need every inch of land that we can possibly bring into production.  In terms of agriculture, I am extremely expansionist, and that means pushing cultivation up the mountain. It means draining the drainable areas.  It also means maximum utilisation of cutaway bogs.  It is an old debate as to how you do it.  I believe again, and let me be completely clear about it, that the control of that land must not be allowed in lumps of parcels to go off into private hands.  We have a remarkable opportunity for a semi-industrialised agriculture which can be a source of technique, a source of high technology and of high science in the countryside in a way in which it would have an extremely useful spin-off, apart from employment and apart from raw materials for the food industry. I do not want to dilute that.</P>
    <P>I do believe that we should have a policy, now that the price of peat is so interesting, which does not only relate to the big bogs which were commercially exploited in the past, but which relates to the little ones, too.  I want to say a word about how one gets cutaway bog into economic production.  In the last paragraph of the circulated text of his <Col N="707" /> speech, the Minister said that the programmes were being studied in relation to land cleared of usable turf deposits.  He said, indeed he was reiterating something which is known, that more research and pilot development schemes are necessary before definite decisions can be reached on the best use of cutaway bog areas.  Nobody is more interested in that sort of research that I am.  I have had, not in the area of soil, but in the area of animal utilisation, an interest in it and I have had some association with it for a long time.</P>
    <P>The fundamental research can only be done in a laboratory, either in the Agricultural Institute, Bord na Móna, in university laboratories or wherever.  The next level can only be done in the same institutions.  The last bit of it, of actually taking a lump of land and getting economic crops off it, requires a quiet, bloody-minded sort of individual to crack it and to spread it to other people. Once it is done it will be imitated.  The neighbours look over the fence and they will do the same but it needs remarkable people and such people exist in farming in this country.  My instinct is that having done all the research we can, perhaps the employees of a State agency are not the best people to carry out the last practical stage.  That requires people who are going to stay up all day and all night, who are going to lie awake thinking of ways of solving problems.  I would like to see a more complicated approach to the use of cutaway bog which does not say it must all be sold off to private farmers&mdash;that is no good: it is unthinkable&mdash;but which also does not say that the really entrepreneurial, vigorous, tough and sharp private farmer should have no place in learning how to use cutaway to the maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>If we say that there is a mixed economy in Ireland, let us look for ways to use the advantages of both systems. The State system can plan.  The State system can do things on a large scale. The last bit of the application of research by the first few dozen or hundred people who do it efficiently to bring cutaway into really profitable production will <Col N="708" /> probably have to be done by pokey, cranky, difficult individuals who, as I say, will work all the hours that there are, when there is no light as well as when there is light.  That is a skill that we would need to develop in this country.  I hope the Minister will think of ways of mixing, of recognising the mixture in our economy and of trading off the interests of the the two sections.  I do not believe for a moment&mdash;I would not advocate it if I did&mdash;that that should be in any way detrimental to the interests of Bord na Móna.  A big bog is like a slob in a sense&mdash;you can only exploit it on a large scale.  You can only exploit it if the catchment area and the drainage are seen to in a way that people with individually-sized farms simply cannot cope with. There should be no threat to the role of the board but there should be a bit of diversity and a bit of complexity in the approach to the use of cutaway.  I say that because I know that thought is going on.  We have an interim report and we have been promised a further one.  I hope that the Minister will resist the temptation to go along with pressure groups who want it all given out to farmers. I hope that he will do something delicate and complicated because there is a certain driving force which could be harnessed there.  It is not easy to make good farmland out of cutaway.</P>
    <P>I want to follow Senator Whitaker very briefly.  In the question of energy policy there is a supply side and there is a consumption side.  On the supply side we have talked about ways in which we can get more peat.  Bord na Móna can get more peat but there might be some more private peat as well.  There might be the question&mdash;I remember this being discontinued&mdash;of giving grants for soilage equipment.  The sort of digger that the private individual can dig an awful lot of sod turf with costs £25,000 or £30,000.  It is thinkable that there might be some sort of incentive in this regard, thereby helping to increase production fast.  Also, it would serve as a bit of competition.</P>
    <P>In price policy, I hope the board will never price up to the limit of the cost of <Col N="709" /> oil&mdash;that they will stay at somewhat less than the price of oil&mdash;because if they do that they put an energy charge on all the users which is higher than it needs to be. On the other hand, the board have to be allowed to accumulate investment moneys out of own resources and out of profits earned.  As usual when one is looking for a trade-off, there is the interest of the consumer, which is a genuine interest, to keep costs low and to keep production competitive but the board must be allowed to earn profits for their future investment.  Some competition on the private sod peat end would be quite useful.</P>
    <P>Regarding the consumption side of the energy equation, I have a few specific things to say to the Minister.  Most of the houses in Ireland are exceedingly energy inefficient and they are easily with modern equipment made much more energy-efficient cheaply.  The grants in that respect have been discontinued and the Minister has promised as a sort of teaser to contemplate insulation grants.</P>
    <P>As long as they are being contemplated but not implemented everybody will hold off to see if they are on the way. If he said &ldquo;No&rdquo; then people would get on with the job in the summer time.  If he said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; they would get on with it in the summer time but if he says &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; they will wait until he gives a clear answer and if he gives a clear answer late in the autumn there will be a blind rush in the autumn to do things that could well be done now and that will not be completed in time.  He should get off that fence.</P>
    <P>If you break down the consumption side into transport energy, domestic heating energy, industrial energy and the energy that in various forms goes into agriculture, then under all of those headings, enormous savings are possible and one of the obvious ways is to transfer from the private to the public sector and from road to rail in transportation. I am ont going to start making political points now but the political points on that issue are fairly obvious.</P>
    <P>I am straying further from the matter <Col N="710" /> in question but if I could sum up, I would urge two courses which seem contradictory but which in fact are not in regard to Bord na Móna and in regard to peat land policy.  The first is that the role of the board be not alone consolidated but expanded and, secondly, that in areas of small bog and what were formerly uneconomic bogs, ways be looked at to maximise private production as well.  I do not think they are in conflict.  There are many areas of bog that could yield plenty of energy in Ireland and it would be better for the local landowners if these areas were dug away and brought into agricultural production.  They are areas in which the board could not interest themselves and in which they would be crazy to become interested.</P>
    <P>The approach to cutaway bog subsequently needs the same sort of mixed policy, a policy which guarantees the central role of the State and of the board and of large-scale productive units and which permits a special sort of initiative from people who can put their hands on a small area of cutaway.  I will put those two things together because when you cut away small bogs you get small areas of cutaway and the subsequent usage is intimately linked with the question of who does the cutting at the time when the peat is being produced.</P>
    <P>In closing, we can find a consensus that the board have served us well.  I would urge on the Minister that a lot of the sort of engineering knowledge, planning knowledge, economic knowledge and energy-use knowledge that has accumulated within the ranks of the board be utilised in areas of alternative energy and in areas such as biomass production which will be profoundly important to energy policy.  The great companies interested in oil or in coal would want us to believe that alternative energy sources cannot make any significant contribution to our energy problem.  That is a patent and thundering nonsense which is activated by their own commercial interests. Not alone have the board served us well in product&mdash;in peat, in milled peat and so on&mdash;but they have served us <Col N="711" /> well in the accumulation of expertise. Certain forms of alternative energy production are very allied to what the board do.  I should like to think that the Minister would draw freely on that expertise in the generating of the sort of comprehensive energy policy that he has promised and that the country desperately needs.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, fearaim fíorchaoin fáilte roimh an Aire, an Collach, comhachtach, cumasach, fearúil, fiúntach fuinniúil.  Is mór an cúram atá air i láthair na huaire agus san am atá le teacht agus guím gach rath ar féin agus ar a chuid oibre.</P>
      <P>The stated purpose of this Bill is to raise from £60 million to £100 million the limitation on the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna for the performance of their functions under the Turf Development Acts.  This gives us the opportunity of passing our comments on the progress of the board to date and also gives us the opportunity of making a few suggestions as to how they can best do their work. That is particularly important at these times when we are in the midst of an energy crisis.  What is very disquietening at the moment is that so very few of our people seem to accept that we are in an energy crisis.  To me that is one of the most disquieting aspects at the present time.  Somehow or other people still think that we can go ahead importing oil, as we did before, and using it as much as we wish.  I commend indeed very highly the efforts of the Minister in bringing people to realise the stark reality of the position we are in.</P>
      <P>We have always had turf.  How many of our place names include the word &ldquo;móin&rdquo; or &ldquo;portach&rdquo; or &ldquo;corcach&rdquo;?  It is up to us to make the best use of what turf we have still left.  The word &ldquo;bogtrotter&rdquo; used be an epitaph of derision, particularly in areas that were not lucky enough to have bogs.  How many of us now in that category, not in an area of bogland, would dearly love to have some sort of a bog in which we could trot?  It is on that note that I wish to make my first point today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> I make an appeal to the Minister&mdash;and I know I am pushing an open door&mdash;for the small bog.  I have no doubt that throughout the country we have little bogs here and there, practically unknown to people for the simple reason that up to now they were not economic to develop.  I imagine that they could be developed at very little expense. The work would involve drainage, the provision of access roads and so on, but the result would be more than rewarding.  I am not speaking about the big bogs.  Senator Keating dealt very admirably with that point where you have very expensive machinery and huge areas to be worked.  I am referring to the smaller bogs that could be worked by the local owners or by a combine of owners. Such bogs were our salvation during the Second World War.  There was hardly a parish where there was any sort of a bog where people did not come together and harvest the turf from these small bogs.  I am sure the Minister has such a scheme in mind and I will be very interested to hear what he has to say when he is replying.</P>
    <P>We could hardly pay sufficient tribute to Bord na Móna, their officials, technical staff and engineers for the extraordinary work they have been doing down through the years.  They have manufactured, developed and, I might say, perfected turf-cutting machinery of the very highest order.  It is significant that people come from many countries of the world to our little country here seeing how the work of harvesting peat is done.  It is true to say that we are one of the leading countries in the world as far as turf development and turf harvesting is concerned.  That is something we should be very proud of.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Keating when he was dealing with the question of cutaway bogs, a subject in which I am very interested. We take the turf out and we have a huge area of land left, especially in the midlands.  I would agree with him that it would be most undesirable that these areas should fall into private hands again.  The State should keep them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> What is to be done with them is the next question.  The Minister mentions that it appears to be wide open so far and that it will take quite a long period of research before a conclusion can be arrived at.  I can understand that.  I should like to see the best use ultimately being made of these cutaway areas, but in the meantime I would not let it go too long.  Certain sections of these cutaway areas could be used in the interim for producing agricultural crops of some kind.  I should not like them to be unused for a long period.  A decision will have to be arrived at eventually as to what should be done with cutaway areas.</P>
    <P>Let me commend the Minister for his&mdash;should I use the word?&mdash;energy in his advertising campaign on the use and misuse of energy.  I commend him for trying to get people interested in turf again.  One of the ways he might do it would be to get in touch with the Department of Education and try to get in school books at all levels interesting articles on turf, turf development, drainage of bogs, all that sort of thing.  It would give the children and, through the children, their parents, an interest in bogs.  Bogs are something everybody should be interested in.  If the situation in the oil world continues as it is, if we have not got the turf we will not have heat or energy.</P>

      <P>I will be brief, partly because I mislaid my spectacles and I am therefore illiterate, but mainly because the Bill is uncontroversial and one agrees with everything that has been said up to now.  The Seanad is dealing with the Bill at the most appropriate time.  The Minister has been surveying the scope of our resources in this area.  I have pleasure in supporting the Bill.  As Senator Connaughton has said it is in these gloomy days a welcome turn of events that the connotations of the word &ldquo;bog&rdquo; have changed so much for the better. It was, as Senator Cranitch suggested, synonymous with backwardness, poverty, and now it is by virtue of native talent and energy synoymous <Col N="714" /> more with the best indigenous Irish technology.  One only wishes that all our enterprises were as successful as Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>I had some difficulty in following Senator Keating's philosophy in respect of our peat resources.  It seems to me that he gave a rather uncharacteristic lurch to the right.  On the cutaway areas, everybody seems concerned about the hands into which these areas will fall eventually.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister in the Dáil expressed himself at a loss as to where the rumours originated that the cutaway areas will revert into private hands.  The rumours are there and people have every right to feel concerned if they think these areas will return to private hands, because the whole origin, the whole genesis of the semi-State idea is, after all, because private enterprise failed us in developing this country.  Our enterpreneurs were not at the beginning, before the foundation of the State and in its early days sufficiently resourceful, sufficiently daring to develop the economy.  Hence the origin of the semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the benefits of development, particularly in this great success area, should redound to the people and not to that section of private enterprise which is always the most anxious to come in and reap the benefits of the successful parts of a particular economy while not having borne the heat of the day in its development.</P>
      <P>It is a pleasure to welcome this Bill and let me sincerely wish the very best to the Minister in his most important portfolio on this, I think, the first occasion in which he has been with us representing this aspect in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which increases the borrowing power of Bord na Móna to £100 million.  The Minister has pointed out on many occasions how important it is that we have more development of our bogs by Bord na Móna.  I would like to compliment Bord na Móna highly on their work for this country.  I hope they have the same success in their western development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> I was very glad last year when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, announced that there would be a briquette factory in the Derryfadda area, near Ballyforan.  I live about seven miles from Ballyforan and I know that in that area the people and the development committee there for some time were looking for a power station. It is five years since Bord na Móna acquired bog in that area and we were all hopeful that the erection of that powerful station would be announced.  Unfortunately, it was not announced and indeed there was a worse blow to follow when we heard that the peat in the areas was to be transported to the midlands.  It was, therefore, a welcome announcement in the light of that, that the briquette factory was to be established in Derryfadda.  The Minister for Energy has made allowance for the briquette factory in the raising of Bord na Móna's borrowing power.  He mentioned specifically that one of the reasons is because of the proposed briquette factory in the Ballyforan area.</P>
    <P>As many Senators have pointed out, there appear to be contradictory views about the arrival of Bord na Móna in certain areas.  This is true also in the western area, in County Galway in particular. Though we all welcome the Bord na Móna development in regard to the briquette factory, which will give extra employment that is badly needed, and the drainage work that will be carried out, at the same time there are people who are concerned that their bogs are being taken away from them and that they might get flooded when the drainage work takes place.  The problem is trying to reconcile this conflict.</P>
    <P>To refer to the price structure which has been mentioned, I can say for the benefit of the Minister that in the Derryfada area five years ago £25 an acre was being offered to the bog owners. There was very little fuss about it because the people felt that when the bog was taken over there would be employment for their sons and daughters and generations to come.  I agree there was a bad public relations job, as Senator <Col N="716" /> Keating said.  I was talking to one of those bog owners last week and only a month ago he received the £25 per acre for that acquisition.  Since then farmers and bog owners have organised to get an increased payment from Bord na Móna for the acquisition of their bogland.  I welcome the fact that the IFA have given their weight to arbitration proposals with Bord na Móna and I hope that those arbitration proceedings will be without any conditions and will be binding on both parties.  I also hope that there will be a quick decision made as regards the price.</P>
    <P>The position now in County Galway is not a question so much of price, because as other Senators have pointed out, this resource of bogland is so important that what most bog owners want is alternative turbary.  They want an alternative place to cut turf when Bord na Móna acquire bog from them.  I would suggest to the Minister and Bord na Móna that at this time of serious energy crisis when we are so dependent on imported oil, it is important that one acre of bog be allotted specifically to the bog owner before Bord na Móna move in.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is that employment is very important and it is something we are all very grateful to Bord na Móna for, particularly in the western area.  It is very early days yet in the Derryfada area but I hope the rate of employment will increase because many people have handed over bogs quite readily so that there would be employment for their families.</P>
    <P>In the last section of the Minister's speech he referred to a report from the Central Development Committee.  I should like to put on record my appreciation of what the Central Development Committee, and particularly the county development officers in each county, have done to help private turf cutting.  I hope that that work will continue. In County Galway the county development officer, Mr. Lynch, has dealt with a lot of applications from people who are interested in the type of grant available.  I am being optimistic because now that the Department of <Col N="717" /> Energy has been set up the Minister might consider giving grants to private turf cutters to develop some of the bogs that Senator Cranitch spoke about, the smaller type of bog that Bord na Móna may not be interested in or may not have access to.  As we all know, new type machinery is available and the work that the Central Development Committee have been doing could be done by direct grant from the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>There are many bogs to which it is very difficult to get access.  The only scheme available at the moment is the local improvement scheme operated by county councils.  We have a lot of applications for bog roads in Galway County Council but the position in most counties is that important though roads to bogs are, it is more important to have roads to people's houses.  The feeling among all councillors is that making roads to houses is a first priority and then there is very little money left to allocate to bog roads.  The money comes from the Department of the Environment and I would ask the Minister for Energy to ask the Minister for that Department to make money available for access roads to bogs so as to facilitate development which would be very welcome from the point of view of Bord na Móna and private turf cutters.  I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the purpose of this Bill is to increase the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna from £60 million to £100 million.  I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the discussion on it.  I join with other Senators in commending Bord na Móna on their achievements over the years, the work they have done in developing our bogland and the success they have had in achieving many of the targets that they set for themselves. I also want to commend them on the contribution they have made to the provision of employment, especially in areas where industrial jobs and in many cases off-farm jobs were not and would not easily be available.  The employment that Bord na Móna have created has <Col N="718" /> been of immense social and economic benefit to the areas in which the board operate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication in his speech that the employment content of Bord na Móna at the moment is in excess of 5,000, that there is the prospect of a further 2,200 jobs and that there are additional jobs available in distribution and other associated employment.</P>
      <P>Another fact that seems to have gone unnoticed from time to time is that Bord na Móna are the second largest producer of peat fuel in the world.  It is fortunate that in a period of scarce and costly energy we have Bord na Móna to exploit our peatland, a valuable native resource. The success of the board in achieving many of their targets has been quite remarkable and I commend them.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the energy situation that I am sure is causing some concern when we discuss the part our peatlands and turf development can play in the provision of energy sources, is that, as is the case in relation to oil, we are dealing with a wasting, non-renewable resource. I would be interested if the Minister would indicate to us the research being done by Bord na Móna and, perhaps, in the Department into replacements for that non-renewable resource.  I have read with interest about the development of biomass.  Perhaps in this field there are prospects for creating a source of energy that would be of use to future generations. It would appear that while our peatlands will provide turf for this generation and perhaps the next, in 30 or 40 years from now it is very likely that that resource will have been exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said today in relation to the use to which cutaway bog will be put.  Research has shown some potential uses for cutaway bogs.  Principal among them would be the use of cutaway bogs for agricultural purposes.  About two years ago I had the opportunity to visit a cutaway bog near Rochfordbridge, County Westmeath, of which approximately 2,000 acres had been brought into grassland production.  I was very impressed with what I saw there.  I was <Col N="719" /> impressed with the quality and volume of the grass being produced, with the quality of the cattle that I saw on that holding and with the carrying capacity of the acres in question.</P>
    <P>That conveyed to me the very distinct impression that there is quite a valuable potential in cutaway bog for use in the production of grass.  It has other uses as well, horticultural, amenity, production of plant seedlings and, perhaps, forestry development.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that if it is shown to be suitable for forestry development, consideration should be given to confining forestry development to cutaway bog in the future as against allowing forestry development&mdash;it has been the case over the years&mdash;to take place on virgin bogs? Trees growing on vast tracts of virgin bogs prevent extraction of peat from beneath the trees.  Perhaps when the growing cycle has been completed, when these forests are harvested, the peat which is under vast areas of forest at the moment could be successfully extracted. Because of the energy situation we face, consideration should be given to prohibiting the planting of forests on virgin bogs that have the capacity to providing turf.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that concerns me.  Perhaps in 20 years from now we will be talking of a vast area that will be under the control of Bord na Móna. During the Spring Show I took the opportunity to visit the Bord na Móna stand and I understood from what was on public view that while the present operation of Bord na Móna is taking place on a total area of about 62,000 acres, additional areas being acquired will take the area of land under the control of Bord na Móna to 80,000 acres. There is a target for the year 2000: the total area of land under the control of Bord na Móna will then be 200,000 acres.  We are talking of an area of land the size of some counties.  We are talking of a very substantial area of land under the control of one State agency.  I am not saying if it is a good thing.  Because of the vast area involved it is a matter that <Col N="720" /> deserves careful thought as to how this resource of cutaway bog could best be utilised in time to come.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have confined their activities to deep peatlands which are substantial in area.  There are two other types of bogland in the country the development of which would have a valuable contribution to make in the present energy situation.  I am talking about small bogs in terms of acres, and shallow bogs.  We have moved into the era of mechanised turf production, whether it is by Bord na Móna or by smaller operators.  I am not satisfied that we have yet arrived at a satisfactory method of extracting turf from shallow bogs by machinery.  In view of the contribution that shallow bogs could make to private operators and, indeed, to private householders, I am wondering if Bord na Móna could not devote greater research to devising suitable methods, suitable machines, for extracting turf from shallow bogs.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a point which one or two other Senators have raised, the desirability of encouraging private householders to harvest their year's supply of peat.  From the national point of view and the point of view of the people who would harvest the turf, this would be very rewarding.  For those engaged in cutting the turf it would be a happy, healthy and worthwhile exercise.  The major disincentive to private development of the smaller, shallow bogs is poor access roads.  If proper access was available there would be a remarkable upsurge in the number of persons harvesting their own fuel.  I welcome recent developments by some county development teams and the central development committee in providing finance for this purpose.  It is a step in the right direction. I should like to see it extended and I am satisfied that if the Minister can see his way to encourage this by ensuring funds will be made available for the improvement of access roads to bogs, there will be worthwhile and rewarding development. I fully support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides for the expansion of the activities of Bord na Móna in development and production of energy from indigenous sources.  That is a very welcome decision. I, with all the other Senators who welcomed the Bill, wish to congratulate the Minister and Bord na Móna on having taken this decision.</P>
      <P>It is a rather extraordinary change in the social conditions of our country that we should be talking so frankly and generously about the importance of turf as a source of energy.  It is not so long ago that people would have disliked being identified as having come from or near a bog.  They would have much preferred to say that they came from other areas.  People are glad now to say that they are closely associated with areas where bog exists because it is such a great source of power and energy and is so vital to the national economy.  This is a good change.</P>
      <P>Before dealing in general terms with a few points I wish to make, I want to record my appreciation and the appreciation of the people of my constituency of the decision taken by the Department some time ago to erect and develop a briquette factory in Ballyforan, which is on the border of Galway and Roscommon.  It was a very important decision, one which will greatly benefit that area.  It is a distressed area, and the employment which that factory will provide when it is fully in operation will be a Godsend.  The people of that area and of the constituency generally are very appreciative of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> The decision being taken by the Minister and by Bord na Móna to develop and take over more of the smaller bog areas brings me back to 25 or more years ago.  At that time many requests were made to Bord na Móna to take over the bogs of West Roscommon, to develop, harvest and use them for the production of turf.  Although these bogs were surveyed on more than one occasion, the report always came back that acquisition would be uneconomic.  That was understandable in the context of the economic situation at that time.  But it is a case now of the old proverb, nuair is cruaigh don chailligh caithfidh sé rith. Tá an cailleach ag rith go tréan anois. Tá ganntanas fuinnimh ann.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh dóthain fuinnimh ag an gcailligh sar i bhfad.</P>
    <P>Private production of turf has been mentioned today and I do not want to cover many of the points that have been made.  There are two kinds of producers. There is the domestic private producer, the man who had a bank from the Land Commission or had a bank on his own land and went out with his sleán and shovel and produced his own turf by manual labour.  That type of production is gone and there is no point in talking about it.  That producer has changed over to employing a machine to cut his turf and he harvests it himself.  There is room and need for that type of producer. He should be encouraged and every assistance should be given to him to continue to produce his turf in a combined, co-operative way as people are doing nowadays in areas where bogs are in close proximity.  There is a second type of production.  People have formed small companies and have bought machines like the machines Bord na Móna have.  I know them because they are operating in the bogs of West Roscommon, the area in which I reside.  They are operating machines and producing on a semiprivate scale in a co-operative way.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look ino the question of what will become of these producers, both the domestic, private producer and the other type of producer, when Bord na Móna takes over these <Col N="723" /> regions of bog and starts to produce on a large scale?  Will they be pushed aside? Will the areas in which they have got permission to produce, for instance, be opened up in a massive way by Bord na Móna and will the private producers be pushed aside?  What is going to happen to the man from the neighbouring towns or the farmers who have allotments from the Land Commission?  Will they be inconvenienced or discommoded by this massive take-over of Bord na Móna? These are questions which are causing apprehension and some unease in the minds of people at the moment.  I know, because I have been in consultaion with them, and I have heard them talking. These are practicalities that deserve consideration. In West Roscommon there are some 3,500 acres of bog that are capable of production.  They have been neglected in the past and I urge the Minister now to ensure that they will be included in the scheme envisaged by Bord na Móna to develop these bogs and to take over the smaller bogs for development.  I urge the Minister to see to it that the bogs of West Roscommon will not be left out this time but will be included in the expansion programme.</P>
    <P>One could talk for very much longer about these matters.  I welcome the decision to take over the bogs.  I hope the private producer particularly will not be inconvenienced in any way but will be helped, if at all all possible, to continue as he is.  I know, in consultation with the Land Commission, that there is a great demand by private people in small towns and in small villages for allotments of bog areas.  The Land Commission officers in the local office have told me that for the last four or five months they have had a great demand for allotments of bog.  I agree with Senator Howard, when he said that the greatest necessity in this case is the improvement and the opening up of access roads.  I want to finish on that point.  If access roads are not opened up to these bog areas, private producers operating on the bogs cannot produce, and that is the main difficulty they have.  I know the Minister will say it is not the responsibility of his Department <Col N="724" /> to open up these roads, that it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, who will say they have not got sufficient funds to open up and maintain these roads in good condition, to be of use to the turf producers.  Between the two, the private producer is at a loss.  I welcome the decision to develop the small bogs.  I hope that, as a result, we shall have much more turf produced in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the privilege of belonging to a Joint Committee of this House and the other House to review the operations of State-sponsored bodies. Quite recently, this committee published their report following a review of Bord na Móna and their activities.  I am a bit disappointed that the report has not received more attention from Members in the course of this debate, when one bears in mind that for many years there was a lot of agitation by Members of both Houses for some forum to enable the Oireachtas to oversee the operations of State-sponsored bodies.  That report touches on one matter which is directly relevant to this Bill today.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to increase the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna for the purpose of financing their future development and the most important and significant part of the Committee's report was that which touched on the future pricing policy to be adopted by Bord na Móna. Being a member of that Committee gave me and the other members a very valuable opportunity, denied to most people, to obtain insight into the operations of Bord na Móna.  We had the opportunity of seeing their operations on the ground.  We had the opportunity of studying their finances and their administration in detail and we had the privilege of examining witnesses from Bord na Móna on the various things we had seen and read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the general if not the unanimous feeling in the Committee that we were very impressed by many things about Bord na Móna.  We were impressed particularly by the high morale that pervades that organisation at all levels.  This confirms something that I <Col N="725" /> was conscious of, coming from an area where Bord na Móna operate to a considerable extent and, because of that, I know many of the operatives of Bord na Móna at various levels of their operations. The morale, the <i>esprit de corps</i> that those who work for Bord na Móna feel about themselves and the pride they have in their operations has always struck me as being remarkably commendable. I think it is worth putting that on record when we are discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>But to get back to the point I was making concerning the future financing of Bord na Móna which this Bill is all about, the Joint Committee's report, in essence, accepted the view of Bord na Móna that their future pricing policy should represent the current commercial value of their product, commercial in terms of comparing it with other sources of energy.  That view was put forward very strongly to us on the grounds that, unless it were to be accepted, the financing of the future development of Bord na Móna would be left in an unsatisfactory position, it would have to depend&mdash;not entirely but to a very large and disproportionate extent&mdash;on external sources for funds.  If a change in pricing policy were to be permitted they would, as a result of that change, be able to generate the bulk of the funds they require to finance their programme of development.  In terms of pure commerce that is an argument that has much weight.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another side to it. One of the biggest inflation-making factors that we are faced with at the moment is the high cost of imported energy. It does seem slightly illogical if we have an indigenous fuel that we should proceed to cost it on its calorific value comparable to the value of the imported fuel and, therefore, seek a price for that on the home market equivalent to what we have to pay for the imported fuel.  We are thereby undoing the benefit of having a native fuel by making it as expensive and as inflation-making in its own, possibly smaller, way as the imported fuel.  Again, too, I was apprehensive that <Col N="726" /> if the arguments of Bord na Móna in this regard were to be acceded to, while it would apply only to their products, nevertheless it would have the effect of establishing a higher price plateau for all turf products.  The effect of that would find its way right down through the whole turf producing scene.  Consequently, I should be glad to hear from the Minister what his attitude is in relation to this factor.  It is significant that in his introductory speech where he is seeking increased borrowing powers to finance the Bord na Móna development he makes no reference whatever to his attitude towards the future pricing policy of Bord na Móna.  He should let us know what way his mind is running in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat apprehensive of acceding entirely to the policy of raising the price of Bord na Móna products to the equivalent of other energy sources because of the effect that that would have on other parts of the turf producing scene.  The Minister very rightly is emphasising the importance of home produced fuels in substitution for those we import.</P>
    <P>Possibly our greatest economic difficulty at the moment if one can pick one difficulty as being greater than another in the present economic climate, is the balance of payments problem.  The only way I can see a significant improvement being made in that is to reduce our imports of fuel.  If home produced fuel can significantly substitute for some of our imports, every energy must be bent towards increasing the production of home produced fuel.  If that is going to be done at a cost to the consumer that makes it no more attractive to him than the imported fuel, which may have other attractions and convenience, then the policy may be self-defeating.  Turf for private consumption is produced in a number of ways.  It is purchased from Bord na Móna.  It is produced by people who own large areas of bog and who cut those areas with machines and sell the cut turf in spreads to customers to harvest themselves.  It is also cut by people for their own domestic consumption and there is a further category of person who <Col N="727" /> cuts on a small scale by hand and sells and delivers it.</P>
    <P>If the price of sod turf that Bord na Móna sells to the fuel merchant is significantly increased, it is going to have a spill over effect on the prices that will be charged by all the other people who are cutting turf privately for sale.  The price of turf will rise significantly and this is going to have an adverse effect on many individuals.  It is also going to have a cumulative adverse effect in terms of factors that tend to produce pressure for increased wages, and thereby fuel being inflationary cycled.  It may seem a comparatively insignificant thing but, in terms of the domestic economy of thousands of householders, particularly in the midlands and west, it is of considerable significance.  I would be very interested to hear from the Minister how his mind is running with regard to the pricing policy that should be adopted by Bord na Móna in the future.</P>
    <P>I have adverted to the importance of more turf being produced for consumption in substitution for imported fuels. This will involve some positive action by the Minister.  Many who have spoken already have referred to the need to improve access to the bogs.  I cannot emphasise this point too much because, up to now, access to much area of bog in private hands is just not there.  The turf cannot be produced until people can get into it and can get the finished product out.  This is going to require finance from somewhere.  The county councils do not have it at the moment and are resisting any pleas from local representatives for improvement in this regard.</P>
    <P>Again, if there is going to be a change in emphasis towards burning home-produced turf, the Minister is going to have to persuade his colleague in the Department of the Environment to restore the grants for the conversion from oil burning systems back to solid fuel.  It is retrograde that when the reconstruction grants were abolished, all went including that particular one.  If that grant is restored, the incentive to make use of home produced fuel will be much greater.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> I want to refer to the problem of dealing with cut-away bogs which was referred to earlier.  I had the opportunity of seeing work that is being done, still at an experimental stage, on a large area of cut-away bog, referred to by my colleague, Senator Howard, near Rochfordbridge.  It is quite clear from what we learned on the occasion of that visit that the way in which cut-away bog is going to be used is still far from being solved.  Experimentation at a high, sophisticated level is going on with great energy under the supervision of very dedicated people.  Problems are constantly being experienced.  Many people think it is a simple matter of transforming the cut-away bog into fertile land, but there are great technical difficulties and they vary from one part of the country to another arising from the fact that the sub-soil in different parts of the country differs.  It is not consistent over all the bog area.  This different sub-soil produces different effects on the subsequent agricultural use of the ground.  New problems are recurring all the time and we are still a considerable way from knowing the final use to which cut-away bog is going to be put.</P>
    <P>It is time now to consider who is going to farm this cut-away bog when these technical problems have been eventually overcome.  There is a strong view that, because the cut-away is in the hands of a State-sponsored body, there should be no question of it going back into private hands for future use.  For many years I was sympathetic to that point of view, but when I consider the stranglehold that organised labour has established over the areas of operation of many of our semi-State bodies, I have second thoughts about handing over vast areas of cut-away for use to an organisation that would be unionised from top to bottom. Private enterprise or a mixture of private enterprise, through the co-operative system, is possibly the best way to ensure that the cut-away bogs of the future agricultural land that will replace them can be best utilised for the good of the country.  I have some hesitation in having the farming of these done on a semi-State basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The last point I want to make is that in our push to utilise our bog lands to the maximum degree possible, we must not lose sight of the fact that they have a high environmental value.  Many people who are interested in this area are worried by the fact that, in cultivating our bogs, we are necessarily destroying the habitat for a great variety of birds and plant life.  I know that Bord na Móna are conscious of this and are anxious to leave pockets of high bog untouched so that there will be examples and nature reserves present in various parts of the country.  There is some worry on the part of environmentalists that the amount of untouched bog that is being left is not sufficiently large.  We come slap up against a serious dilemma as to how much we can leave and how much we can afford to leave in terms of commercial viability.  We will have to be generous towards the environment and leave areas that might appear to be substantial, areas of the size of 700 acres. An area of 50 or 60 acres is not big enough to serve the needs of the environment and larger areas will have to be left in every part of the country where new bog is being developed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I refer again to what I think is the most critical part of the Bill and to which the Minister has not adverted and that is his view on the board's pricing proposals for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CLambert" hpid="Mr. Lambert Mr. Lambert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that we are all very conscious of the necessity to develop our own resources now, but it was not so in the past.  The Minister has referred to the foresight and courage of those who were involved in the development of Bord na Móna.  I should like to put names on those&mdash;the late Seán Lemass and the late Erskine Childers.  If it were not for their commitment to the development of our natural resource of turf for electricity generation, we would be even more dependent on imports of oil and possibly looking for a lot more finance under this Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former member of the Electricity <Col N="730" /> Supply Board, I remember in particular the determination of the late Erskine Childers as Minister for Transport and Power, to proceed with another Shannonbridge station although, at the time, it seemed uneconomical to the board compared with generation of electricity by oil.  It is important to refer to this because Senator Cooney has referred to the good morale within Bord na Móna at the moment.  Much of this is due to the inspiration of Erskine Childers that gave the confidence to the board in their future at a time when they were both unpopular and unfashionable.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy is always critical of the private sector and, therefore, I must recall the association of my own industry with Bord na Móna in the development of burning turf for steam raising in our factory some 20 years ago which, at the time, was of great significance for the turf industry and for Irish industry generally.  At first we used brickeens and then we went on to use milled peat.  I suggest the possibility of adapting such a system, particularly when the IDA are setting up industrial estates for small industries in the west. They could have essential turf burning installations for heating and for hot water.  We experienced the fact that oil burners were readily convertible to the system.  It could even be done on a temporary basis and this might cover some of the points the Senators have made about the utilisation of the smaller bogs. With those thoughts in mind, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. First, I should like to join with my colleagues who welcomed the Minister to the House.  I want to congratulate him sincerely on the energetic drive he has initiated to bring a sense of urgency&mdash;not just as an awareness&mdash;to the need for greater fuel economy in the Republic, a sense of urgency in our efforts to find alternative sources of energy, and our responsibility as individuals to embark, in our own homes, or cars, on energy conservation through sensible usage and proper insulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Bord na Móna are the largest employers in Counties Laois and Offaly.  As a public representative for over 20 years, I cannot fail to be aware of their work and progress.  There is no doubt that the board have made tremendous progress since they were established in the forties. Their contribution to the industrial development of the midland counties has been significant.  I am very pleased that this Bill is introduced to enable the board to continue that drive, especially in a area which is so vital and important to the industrial development of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The board's undoubted success in developing techniques and new technology put them among the world's foremost experts in peat development. Bord na Móna have been singularly fortunate in their dedicated work force from the board right down to the professional, skilled and semi-skilled workers.  This more than anything else has been responsible for the success of the board to date.  Their's is a huge and successful commercial operation and I am often amazed to find a lack of enthusiasm about prompt, or even reasonably prompt, payment of a few pounds to some unfortunate farmer&mdash;and in the peat areas farmers tend to be poor.  The amount of money may seem quite small to somebody in the super-tax bracket but, nevertheless, I fail to understand why we cannot have a little more promptness in finalising some of these land transactions.</P>
    <P>I have held the view for many years that the powers in the 1946 Act are too strong.  I do not think a semi-State organisation need the strong acquisition powers the board enjoy.  On previous occasions I have advocated that the board should embark on a leasing programme. They offer £100 for an acre of bog and, even where the owner who is either the victim or the vendor has not utilised his acreage to its full extent over the previous two or three generations, that is not enough for those of us who believe in the right to private property.  If the board, especially in the small peat areas, were to lease the land for £100 per acre, <Col N="732" /> for ten or 20 years or whatever time the board feel they would require to take the peat off it, we would not have the problem in those small pockets of peat land of finding uses for the cut over bogs.</P>
    <P>In the entire land settlement and resettlement programme many people have toyed with the idea of trying to have a greater usage of long-term leasing. In the farm retirement scheme, the first opportunity came when one could lease land not just on the 11 months basis but on a 12 year lease basis.  The Minister might suggest to Bord na Móna that they might look at this in the small isolated areas where there are possibly a few hundred acres of bogland.  Farmers might part more readily with property they were under-using for many years.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Murphy and Senator Keating dealing in much the same way with this matter.  I hope that the board will introduce a sense of urgency into it.  I remind the Minister of the urgent need to have a national policy to deal with the land bank the board have built up.  It is useful to have a land bank.  The board bought thousands of acres at around half a crown an acre back in the forties.  There is nothing against that.  Their assets have certainly improved.  No finer outfit could have a bonus like that to fall back on und it is there for utilisation and enjoyment of the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have been interested in this problem since the early seventies.  I regret I have not had the opportunity of visiting the board's operations for some years now, although I keep a constant eye over the hedge.  I have had the opportunity of seeing at first hand State farming as it operates in Israel, as it operates in one or two African countries, and I have studied the problem in detail in parts of Russia.  I hope it will be possible to utilise this money not just to find a solution, but to study the problem in depth as part of the third and even into the fourth programme of Bord na Móna.  There should be no illusion that any State Department or any Minister can take on the responsibility of creating a black <Col N="733" /> desert in the heart of Ireland.  This is a serious problem.  Since State farming has not proved tremendously successful anywhere&mdash;and certainly not in any part of the world where it has been introduced either voluntarily or compulsorily&mdash;I cannot see any great prospects for it here.</P>
    <P>Reading very carefully the board's annual reports for the past few years I have not been able to see an isolated figure for the amount the board have spent on agricultural experiments.  Therefore, it is difficult to assess either the problems or the difficulties they have experienced. On the other hand, I suppose there is a strong lobby that would say that perhaps more of this work should be entrusted to An Foras Talúntais.  I know they had been working hand in hand for a considerable number of years.  Nevertheless, listening to the car radio coming up here a few weeks ago, I heard a spokesman for the board speak for at least half an hour on the biomass experiments, without once mentioning the work that An Foras Talúntais have been doing in this field, and some others.  So it leaves a question mark there.</P>
    <P>On the question of the cut over bogs which is one of the major problems we should be thinking about, the State must and should take a long hard look at the options, not just at State farming, but more closely at the biomass experiments in Georgia, USA and, indeed, in Georgia in the Soviet Union where significant advances have been made.  I hope the board will send their experts out to these places to look at them.  There is, even within this House, a number of people who could be sent to have a first-hand look at the problems and the solutions and report back to the House.  This is a job the Seanad could be usefully asked to carry out.  When it comes to agricultural experiments and the responsibility for them, I do no think the State can afford the luxury of having more than one semi-State agency engaged in depth, but I would hope that the greatest co-operation would be there at all times between all semi-State organisations <Col N="734" /> which were established to serve the common good.</P>
    <P>When you look at counties such as Laois, Offaly or Westmeath where there is an industry provided by Bord na Móna, or the ESB, or any of the other semi-State organisations, the mere availability of work transforms and improves living standards in such a way that one cannot but be impressed.  When I look at Clonsast in the Portarlington area which may be coming to the end of its turf-harvesting life, I am quite distressed to think of the drop in income and living standards in that area which will occur when the board cease their operatons.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will put his full weight behind the board and perhaps even provide additional finance to boost the experiments which are being done on fuel conversion. There ought to be sufficient land in that catchment area to ensure that the powerhouse in Portarlington and even an additional one will continue tooperate either as a gas fired station or fuelled by biomass.  This is something we should advocate at all times.  There must be the greatest amount of co-operation between the ESB and Bord na Móna to ensure that that industry will continue there.</P>
    <P>In the past, the big multi-nationals set the pace.  They had the power&mdash;and a certain amount of the glory&mdash;to suggest that there is no great alternative to oil.  If a fraction of the amount of money which was allocated to research into nuclear energy had been allocated to either wind power on solar energy&mdash;either solar through biomass or direct&mdash;we would have had better results.  The present thinking that we should try to get a percentage of our requirements from various alternative sources is a very good policy.  I wish the Minister well in his energetic drive to advance it.  I hope his efforts will be successful.</P>
    <P>I hope the board will continue to have a long-term national responsible outlook. While there is a tremendous drive to find home-produced energy at present, there is a need&mdash;and we should record it especially on this Bill in which we are financing the board to press on with their <Col N="735" /> turf-development programme&mdash;to have it recorded that the board should consider for posterity suitable areas for each type of bogland.  It has taken millions of years for these bogs to develop.  There must be a place for ecology, even if it has to be a minimum place.  I hope the board would be conscientious in tackling matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>We cannot just blindly pursue a policy of taking the last ounce of peat or turf from the bogland areas and just leaving the marl.  First, we should have some areas of conservation.  Secondly, the board have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that the residue left on the cutaway bog is adequate to ensure that a wide variety of cropping can be undertaken in the cutaway bog when it is reclaimed for agricultural, horticultural, or forestry purposes.  It must be versatile. The planning stage must be now before the turf harvesting operations begin.  This is important.  In the past the board gave guarantees that they would leave a minimum depth of peat over the marl or the gravel.  In many cases, if one walks across a cutaway bog one will find that one is walking on stones and gravel. This is deplorable.  I know that the technicians working the machines cannot be inspired to know exactly where the depth is, but nevertheless it is important.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the board success.  I read with interest the Eighth Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which dealt with Bord na Móna.  We are fortunate in having working in the State and for the State and for the people the expertise that Bord na Móna have built up and their dedication to the task with which they have been entrusted.  I wish them continued success.  In saying that I hope they will ensure that the best possible return will be available to the public at all times.</P>
    <P>On the question of the increase in fuel prices.  I am not convinced that the price of turf must be related to the price of imported fuels.  It never was in the past and I do not think it is necessary to do it now.  By doing that, you are penalising <Col N="736" /> the people especially in the midlands who over the year have been the board's hard core of customers.  Last year the board introduced a rationing system for fuel merchants, especially in the midlands and, in some cases, merchants from outside the jurisdiction of the State appeared to have secured a priority over some of the local people who have been the board's best and most constant customers since the establishment of the industry in the midlands in the forties. That was disappointing for those who had been queuing up for hours with tractors and lorries waiting for supply.</P>
    <P>I hope that the briquettes will be reserved, to a considerable extent, for use by the health boards.  All the health boards have a fuel scheme and the easiest fuel for our senior citizens to handle, and the most suitable, are briquettes.  I hope the health boards and the people who supply those contracts will be given priority. The board have increased the tonnage and have done a tremendous job.  Our senior citizens are entitled to a fire in their own hearths during the winter months.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success and I wish the board's activities continued success and I hope the projections of the board and the chief executives will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me join in welcoming the Minister and congratulating him on the vigorous efforts which his Department are making on the question of the conservation of energy.  I should also like to join in complimenting the founders of Bord na Móna and those who initiated that unique development in a native industry at a time when it was very badly needed.  Mention has been made of what is described as the energy crisis.  That crisis is nothing compared to the disastrous situation which will develop if a world crisis develops and we are deprived of our necessary oil supplies. It is important to stress that, because the affluent society which has developed here has given rise to a wastefulness and a carelessness in our approach to the use of energy and to unnecessary burning up of energy.  This is a <Col N="737" /> very serious question because, if we were to be thrown back on our own resources in relation to the use of energy, the situation would be unlike what it was during the emergency in the Second World War when Bord na Móna provided much needed fuel and badly needed employment. The technological developments during the past 40 years and the sophistication of industrial development have left us very much dependent on outside energy sources.  The closing down of many hundreds of factories with consequent unemployment of many thousands of workers would indeed be a disaster.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill and the proposal to increase Bord na Móna's capital, I would urge the Minister to put as much fuineamh as possible into the conservation of energy.  Mention has been made of the insulation of houses.  This requires some improved regulations from the Department of the Environment.  Much can be done in the control of the use of transport and private cars.  In one European country there is control over the use of electricity.  When you have exceeded your ration, the price per unit of the excess used is taxed.  If we cannot develop a public consciousness of the need to conserve energy the additional motivation of an increased cost over and above a necessary ration may be a useful means of encouraging us to conserve.  I would encourage the Minister and his Department to put all the vigour possible into that area in the interests of the community as a whole.  There are a few points the Minister mentioned on which he might give us a little information. What are the proportions of the total production of turf for domestic use and electricity generation.  I welcome the information that the board will be relying for most of its future borrowing requirements on Europe.  Could the Minister indicate the extent, over and above the £40 million which money may be available to Bord na Móna and the rate of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the economic use of cut-away areas.  Could he give any information about the experiments being carried out by An Foras Talúntais and <Col N="738" /> his Department in biomass?  Will it be necessary to wait until the rotation period has expired to get any information? Is there any evidence available to the Minister or can his Department get any evidence from any other country as to the viability of the biomass experiment? Bearing in mind that there should be all possible development of alternative means of providing energy, such as windpower, solar power and so on, since we have such a large area of cut-away bog and such a large area of relatively unused land and a young population coming on stream over the next five to ten years, all that is needed if the biomass system is an economically viable means of providing energy is the drive to harness that energy using that system.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned nuclear energy.  One of the great disadvantages I see in the nuclear proposal is the very high capital cost.  I hope the proposal has been suspended for the time being.  If we can develop our own resources to a greater degree through the use of the land a far lesser capital cost would provide employment and produce the same result as we would hope to get out of nuclear development if it became necessary.  I commend the Bill to the House and wish the Minister and his Department the very best results in the future in the interests of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are good times for Bord na Móna.  One can think of many other semi-State bodies for which times are not so promising.  But Bord na Móna can find themselves in a situation where they are confronted with a challenge which presents a real opportunity for them to show their paces.  That challenge results from our having to look to something to take us out of the deplorable mess in which the western world particularly has found itself through not having an adequate reserve of alternative energy resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate here today confirms the attitude of people who are clutching at last straws to take us out of a bad situapulsorily&mdash;<Col N="739" /> tion.  While there can be good times for Bord na Móna, they have to be cautioned that time is not on their side in this matter.  When one reads either the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies or the inter-departmental committee's report, one finds that turf, on which our whole future would seem to depend, will be exhausted by the year 2030.  So we are talking today about a resource which is very much a finite one.  Time is of the essence in a situation like that.</P>
    <P>There is enough information on hands from the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on the workings of Bord na Móna and from the inter-departmental committee on the future usage of cut away bogs and from the Bord na Móna reports on which the Government can and must base clear directives to Bord na Móna as to how to spend their efforts in the next two decades.  In the report of the Joint Committee there are certain recommendations in regard to matters which can affect the financing structure and the funding arrangements of Bord na Móna.  These recommendations should be acted upon by the Government.</P>
    <P>If there are anomalies which prevent or inhibit Bord na Móna from financing themselves from alternative sources other than what they are confined to under legislation or Government directive, then the Government should act on the recommendations.  For instance, the Joint Committee state that a change must be made in regard to the pricing policy of Bord na Móna; that the stock valuations do not leave them in a commercial and viable situation for future financing and future accounting procedures; that the method by which they have assessed depreciation over the past two or three decades is not at all appropriate to their situation; that Bord na Móna express grave reservations about the constraints on them in regard to funding; that they express concern at the requirement which confines their financing to non-Exchequer resources and to foreign currency resources and they would prefer such <Col N="740" /> constraint to be removed almost immediately. They believe that that constraint leaves them open to a risk of possible currency exchange losses and certainly in the present situation that is something that should be attended to by the Government immediately.  In relation to the usage of cutaway bogs, the inter-departmental committee stress that more research must be done.  Research, of course, means more funding.  We have a situation where there are plenty of recommendations on which the Government are given the opportunity to act in the most specific manner, namely, by providing more resources for Bord na Móna for their essential work.</P>
    <P>Much has already been said on the various matters pertaining to Bord na Móna.  I do not want to repeat them.  I just want to make one or two points.  The inter-departmental committee deals quite comprehensively with the question of the future usage of cut-away bogs.  This is something on which a start can be made immediately, whatever about the need to carry out more research into the potential of cutaway bogs for agricultural purposes.  In the fields of amenity, forestry and biomass, something can be done.  Indeed biomass is something which none of us here knew anything about perhaps six months ago.  To many of us it conjured up visions of something like &ldquo;Quatermass&rdquo; and we had to find out what it all meant.  In the field of amenity Bord na Móna can provide a much needed asset in the rural community. It is particularly deplorable that local authorities do not seem to pay much attention to the potential of boglands to provide amenities.  I have had what I can only regard as a woeful experience where a local authority could think of nothing else to do with a small local bog than to use it as a dumping ground for domestic and trade refuse. That sort of situation leads one to conclude that Bord na Móna and the various State authorities should recognise the potential of cutaway bogs for amenity purposes and should instruct all local authorities as to procedure in the matter of utilisation of these valuable lands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> The forestry potential of the cutaway bogs has always been recognised.  There are difficulties in regard to the agricultural potential.  Experiments have been carried out which show that grass lands need further investment, further financial commitment, to make them durable on boglands.  These are matters which can be got over and successfully concluded given the will and the financial backing by the Government.  Time is of the essence in this.  We are told that the turf resources will exhaust itself by the year 2030.  That is not so far away. We have those few decades in which to utilise to the fullest potental the wonderful asset that Providence has given us.</P>
    <P>These times are a challange to Bord na Móna.  It is all very well to pay tribute to the board for past achievements but the people that we pay tribute to are the very people we lash across the back if something goes wrong.  Nobody should be complacent because of past performance. Bord na Móna experimented initially and then developed vast boglands. But let us remember that we were forced to do that due to external circumstances, principally, the second world war.  It would have been held always to our shame had we not done so.  We should not be complacent.  Bord na Móna have a good record but the challenge which lies ahead of them is something which we cannot be complacent about.  I am quite certain of the high morale of the staff which many people have spoken about. Let me say at this stage that I do not think there is one Bord na Móna employee in Louth.  So I am not speaking from experience or knowledge of any employee of Bord na Móna.  From the national point of view Bord na Móna have great opportunity.  Reading between the lines of the examination by the Joint Oireachtas Committee I thought I detected the feeling that, given the resources, they are capable of much better things.  If they are not given those resources, they will like many other State bodies, decline in initiative and efficiency. We have had too many experiences of semi-State bodies contracting rather than expanding.  Bord na <Col N="742" /> Móna, given the goodwill and the political commitment to expand at a much faster rate than hitherto expected, will be a real entity which can do what we want them to do.  We are talking about something on which dependence will increase.  We cannot adopt a leisurely pace.  We are like drowning men clutching at straws.  We must find alternative sources of energy.  We cannot look to the Arab States.  We cannot look to the Middle East or even further afield, or even perhaps to our near neighbour for energy supplies if anything goes wrong in the future.  We must look more and more to ourselves to provide that alternative energy.  We have it in our boglands.  Cutaway boglands provide great opportunities for amenity and forestry development and even for agricultural development.  If Bord na Móna are given the money by the Government, they will do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In taking the opportunity to make a few general comments on the Turf Development Bill I am very conscious of the fact that at this time of the year I would infinitely prefer to be out in the bog cutting turf than in here talking about it.  I am mainly concerned with the possible increase in the price of turf.  Turf is and always has been the poor relation of solid fuels.  It is often of inferior quality needing an awful lot of stoking and care to give out any heat at all.  Its only advantage is that up to now it has been comparatively cheap.  If the inevitable consequence of this Bill is to increase the price of turf then the quality must also be improved.  Quality depends largely upon harvesting conditions, upon the weather and, indeed upon storage conditions.  Quality can vary considerably not only from year to year but from load to load.  It is a very common experience to order a load of turf and to have to wait for a long time until the supplier can be assured that he will get a load of good quality.  He will often come and tell one that he has been to the bog and that he has come away empty handed because what was on offer was only dust.  It seems logical that, with care and research, we could ensure a constant <Col N="743" /> supply of good quality turf.  This is the least the customer is entitled to if he is to be expected to pay more for it. Also if turf is to be marketed on a competitive basis then it will have to be of the best quality.  If people refuse to buy inferior quality coal what is the use of offering them inferior quality turf?</P>
      <P>One area where Bord na Móna have been enormously successful is in the production and development of peat briquettes. I hope that any plans the board have to spend their increased money will include the expansion of this part of their development to cater not only for the present scarcity but also for future demands. Briquettes in the country are as scarce as hens' teeth and I cannot see why, if the demand is there, they cannot be supplied.</P>
      <P>Another area where Bord na Móna have done great work is in the production of peat moss.  That, too, is often in scarce supply at certain times of the year.  The report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies seemed to suggest that we should feel some concern at depriving posterity of some of its precious heritage if we were to work out our bogs.  Whatever our children will be using for fuel in the next century, they will hardly be cutting turf.  So, let us make full and intelligent use of this unique indigenous fuel while it lasts.  Then let us concern ourselves with making the cutaway bog productive in some other way.</P>
      <P>One could not finish talking about the development of indigenous fuels without mentioning our coal mines.  Coal has been neglected in recent years.  I am sure the House would welcome some indication from the Minister as to the potential of our coal mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that we are not sufficiently aware of the amount of fuel and energy that we are wasting. There is still too much waste, waste of fuel, waste of heat.  There is also a lack of a cohesive conservation policy from the EEC.  The experience of last years' so-called petrol shortage shows that we should have a national conservation policy and that the campaign must be <Col N="744" /> directed from the top, from the Government. I welcome this Bill.  It is a logical development in the progress of one of our most successful State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcomed by every Member of this House.  It is an indication of a continuation of a very commendable industrial effort.  It coincides with the provision of energy from a native resource which could be the means of eliminating foreign imports which use up a considerable amount of the wealth of the country.</P>
      <P>I have witnessed mechanisation in the production of fuel by Bord na Móna over the past 30 years.  I come from County Longford which the Minister referred to as being one of the counties where the boglands of the central plain of Ireland are, to some extent, located. At present there is a serious shortage of fuel other than imported fuel at considerable expense in the form of oil or coal.  For that reason we welcome native fuel from turf production.  Many people not directly acquainted with bogland and not directly aware of the circumstances of its coming into existence have the impression that all one has to do is harvest this fuel and that it is an indestructible quantity with no risk of the day coming when it would be exhausted.  That view was very prevalent 30 or 40 years ago. Today most people are aware that we have reached the half way mark in relation to the resources of bogland.  We have got to the stage where Bord na Móna have to think in terms of procuring smaller machines to exploit the smaller bogs.  While this mechanised national effort by Bord na Móna over those years was welcomed and what they propose to do is, in principle, welcomed, it is an indication that in 20 or 25 years there will be no need for Bord na Móna because there will be no bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural areas of Ireland and on the edges of the west bogland here Bord na Móna are at present serving notices with the intention of intruding on those rights. This means that families, who for <Col N="745" /> generations had three or four acres of bogland and had been winning turf by hand to accommodate themselves will, in the very near future, find that their means of fuel production have disappeared. These are people with small patches of bog.  In some cases the Land Commission allocated these bogs, as a means of getting fuel for the homestead, to particular farmers, householders or even town dwellers who were not actually resident in the rural area.  The rights of these people are now threatened.  Bord na Móna are not doing a good thing in setting themselves the giant exercise of eliminating these facilities from the rural population, the people from the small towns and villages and the rural households in the vicinity of small bogs.  It is planned to take over many of these bogs.  It is not right that Bord na Móna should deprive these people of their rights to fuel which the nation recognised by allocating turbary rights and which God provided as one of the amenities for the people in rural Ireland. The people have that right and it should be respected and not interfered with. Some may say that Bord na Móna have supplied turf cheaply and, by using a mechanised system, have met a demand that could not have been met by using manual means of production.  That was true five, six, seven, eight or ten years ago.  For that reason and because of the lack of drainage on these small bogs, many people turned to mechanisation in winning turf.  Five or six days cutting turf would yield enough fuel for the next 12 to 18 months.  Ordinary people winning their own turf and bringing it home are discouraged by the lack of drainage in the smaller bogs.  I know that Bord na Móna have plans for the drainage of larger bogs but these bogs will not be available to the local people.  On the bog where I work I saw 15 or 16 families come back this year to cut turf and it was impossible to get access because drains and water courses were completely blocked up.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to exercise his authority to make available, either through local improvements schemes or through a direct bog development grant, <Col N="746" /> as obtained back in the thirties, forties and fifties, funds to open those water courses and repair the smaller bog roads connecting to public roads to enable people to win their fuel and to take it home at the least possible cost.</P>
    <P>The present trend is for Bord na Móna to take over the bogs.  Not only will these people have the difficulty they are experiencing at present in trying to win turf in the wet and get access to bogs, but they are going to lose the right to cut turf altogether.</P>
    <P>If Bord na Móna as a semi-State authority can bring in machines to carry out drainage, I think the State could spend money, equally properly and in keeping with the local interest of the people, on the smaller bogs by accommodating these people with a grant for drainage.  I would appeal to the Minister to exercise his authority in that direction.</P>
    <P>Another problem about bog development is that by the time the development is completed the bog lands will have disappeared and while I have seen the reports in relation to the appropriate laying of an undercourse of bog for development so that the land might be converted to agriculture or to horticulture, it appears that a big problem exists in regard to the wide areas of bogland that will be left behind by Bord na Móna.  These are matters that should have the attention of the Government and of the Department of Agriculture.  So far as the use of the land has been regarded as being appropriate to the rural population, to the people who were living on the land and who had been reared on it traditionally, that land should be allocated, as the Land Commission allocate holdings, towards sites for houses rather than having it as a vast social prouductive authority or State-controlled institution which some people who were making observations on it during the past two or three years seem anxious to promote.  I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister to recognise that if the rural population of Ireland are to be kept on the land, land should be <Col N="747" /> made available to them and that their rights to whatever fuel they need be protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House have spent a very long and productive day on the bog, and the old slane is good, truly sharp and bright by now. While the debate itself did not generate a lot of heat, the Members' contributions were extremely valuable.  This is an indication of the seriousness with which the House treats the present energy situation. Also, the excellent attendance here during the afternoon is an indication of the importance of the Department which the Minister heads and of the work which he is now doing in such a very effective manner.  There is no doubt, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, that the Department of Energy will now have to become one of the most important Departments in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is almost 6 o'clock, which is normally the leaving-off time for anybody working in the bog, I do not propose to delay Members of the House because so many people have spoken that almost everything has been said in relation to this important Bill.  I join with the other Members of the House in welcoming the Bill because it is a pleasure to vote money for a body as successful and as enterprising as Bord na Móna.  The board have made a very significant contribution to the economic and social advancement of the nation, and their role today is greater and more significant than ever before.  The changing world energy situation has made it all the more imperative that we develop to the maximum our natural resources and that we plan as far as we can for the replacement of these resources when they are diminished.  Energy supply and cost are factors that are reflected in almost every facet of our economic development. Therefore, we must take every possible step to reduce energy consumption and to eliminate its waste.  Indeed, one of the earlier contributors here today, Senator Whitaker, in his usual objective way, dealt very effectively with the need to eliminate waste and he suggested many <Col N="748" /> practical ways of doing that.  I am not being cynical when I say this, but he even referred to the need, for instance, to wear heavier clothing and I could not but help thinking when he was making this reference that another way of conserving heat would be to resort to the electric blanket instead of the radiator, because we are all, perhaps, overanxious to spend unnecessarily on the production and generation of heat.  Let me say that even in this House during the cold winter days and nights Members have complained about the fact that the House has been over-heated.  If we are to set a good example in relation to heat conservation one of the obvious places to commence is right here where we have found, on so many occasions, the place to be uncomfortably warm.</P>
    <P>I should, therefore, like to say as my opening comment in this debate that the valuable peat deposits, much of which are in the process of being harvested and quite a lot of which are undeveloped, are an extremely valuable national resource which now needs to be used sparingly and wisely and that pending the provision of alternative sources of energy we need to have a very definite policy as to how we are to use that particular resource.  When one bears in mind that within a period of 50 years there will be no turf left in this country, one realises that we will then be dependent totally on imported fuel such a situation would have serious social consequences because of the resulting unemployment.  I agree fully with the provisions in the Bill for the increased allocation of finance but I would caution against any programme of rapid harvesting of our peat resources to meet short-term needs, particularly in the absence of alternative resources like oil, coal or biomass.  The latter product raises the question of the future of our cutaway bogs.  I should like to see an expansion of research into the production of biomass.  The Minister in his opening comments referred to this fact and expressed the view that this research would be continued.  I believe from my own observations of what is happening in relation to the experiments that biomass has potential and that it <Col N="749" /> could be produced on our cutaway bogs. I come from a county where Bord na Móna have extensive operations and I wish publicly to acknowledge their contribution in the provision of employment. It is indeed one of our greatest industries in County Laois, providing a very valuable income for families in the county and I am pleased to learn that the Bill makes provision for a further expansion of these activities.  The production of moss peat at Portlaoise is an important part of the board's activities and contributes substantially to our exports and balance of payments, not to speak of its economic value by way of employment to the local town of Portlaoise and to the surrounding countryside.  Regarding Clonsast, which is near Portarlington and is one of the board's earliest operations producing sod peat for consumption and ESB generation, there is now considerable concern in Portarlington in relation to the future of that generating station because the peat reserves in the area are now running out.  It is important that as soon as possible we find an alternative source of fuel for the Portarlington generating station.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to move away from the terms of the Bill but I would make the point that the location of Portarlington close to the Leinster coalfield&mdash;and I am glad that Senator Cassidy referred to coal&mdash;would make it an obvious choice for the conversion of coal and makes the case all the greater for the development of these coalfields where surveys have revealed the existence of millions of tonnes of unmined anthracite.  The Tánaiste is very interested in this project and it would be good to see it in the hands of a body as successful and as enterprising as bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two further points that I wish to make before I conclude and one of these has been referred to by almost every speaker, particularly speakers from bogland areas.  It is in relation to the acquisition of land by the board for future development.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to the farmers in all of the areas where Bord na <Col N="750" /> Móna have been operating who very generously and patriotically in very many cases made their land available to the board for very, very small compensation.</P>
    <P>An investigation into the level of compensation is proceding but it can fairly be said that farmers are entitled now to a higher level of compensation.  I should hope, too, that whatever legislation is necessary in relation to it would take into consideration land which has been given already at minimal cost to Bord na Móna. It is important in relation to this aspect of Bord na Móna development that the farmers, if you could call them farmers, who down through the years tried to survive on limited incomes from poor land in contrast with farmers who were living on more productive land should get a level of compensation now that their land has become more valuable which would compensate them for that situation. I am confident that the Tániste and the Government will keep that point in mind.</P>
    <P>At a time when peat deposits were not as valuable as they are today the Department of Lands purchased large tracts of land for planting.  There was a very worthwhile and very useful development but a lot of that land is still unplanted. The Minister should initiate a survey of the land acquired by the Department of Lands for planting which might at this stage be developed for the production of peat in the light of the changing energy situation.  In County Laois there are very large tracts of land in the hands of the Department of Lands.  There is an onus on us to make maximum use of any energy resources available and if there are unharvested peat deposits which are to be planted, the situation at least bears further investigation on the part of the Department.  At some later stage the land could be planted productively.</P>
    <P>A couple of months ago at a meeting of Laois County Council I proposed a motion asking the Minister and his Department to consider making grants available to local authorities to enable them to embark on the creation of bog roads and on bog drainage in counties <Col N="751" /> where there are bogs with potential for private development.  We all know of fairly large areas of bogland which is not a commercial or viable proposition for Bord na Móna but which, as the Minister rightly said in his interview yesterday, could be harvested by thousands of families.  This would make a considerable reduction in the national fuel bill.  I hold strong views on this and I have made the case on many occasions that such investment on the part of the Government by way of special grants to local authorities would not only provide valuable employment in each local authority area but would develop a valuable resource which is lying dormant and will lie dormant unless it can be brought into production by way of drainage and the provision of suitable roads.  With that final comment I welcome the Bill and I give it my full support.  I wish the Minister every success in the important mission which he is now embarking on in relation to energy and energy conservation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I also welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome the increase of 2,500 in employment in this turf development programme which will include turbary which has not been fully productive.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to his statement today regarding the production to date of 32,000 tons of briquettes. I think that should read 320,000 tons.  Later the Minister said that the production of the five factories at 750,000 tons would be twice as many tons as we are now producing.  So I take it that there was a clerical error in the Minister's brief in regard to the 32,000 tons.</P>

      <P>I hope there is no significance in Mayo being the last county to be mentioned in the speech, having regard to the potential of the county in terms of bog development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like a definite answer from the Minister as to whether bogs are being <Col N="752" /> acquired compulsorily.  My view was that bog acquisition was on an optional basis but there seems to be some concern among some Senators who spoke today that land was acquired by way of some measure of semi-compulsion.</P>
    <P>There should be undertaken a national survey in order to ascertain the amount of turbary bog we have in our possession and how much of it should be utilised either for turf development or for forestry.  I have seen long and large tracts of blanket bog being acquired for afforestation which could have been used for turf production in the first instance and for afforestation in the after bog condition.  I would like to see some type of national survey undertaken which would permit zoning of regions that would be allocated and preserved for turf production in the future.</P>
    <P>It is an urgent requirement for us to be self-sufficient in fuel, and peat is something that is not perishable.  It can be produced and over-produced and stored and held over for many years. This is something that we should think of now when it is possible to have outdoor storage of the finished product without any great expense because of the new plastic coverings that are available.  The over-production of turf will never be a liability.  Rather, it will be a capital reserve to the nation.  My only concern is that in this period of panic-purchasing of turf-cutting machines in the west of Ireland, there would not be overproducing to the extent of creating competition with farmers and co-operatives in the west who are going into turf production on a fairly large scale at present. I should like to see some protection for the young operators who are putting their money down in order to give a service in the smaller fragmented holdings and where it is now hard to get manual labour for turf cutting.  That type of operator should be protected against over-production which might force him out of the market.</P>
    <P>There should be some examination of the furnace requirements in institutions and in industry.  The IIRS or some other group who are now in a position to advise <Col N="753" /> on proper installatios in hospitals and institutions might be asked to undertake such a survey, especially in respect of those places in which there is about to be conversion to large furnaces for timber and peat burning.  Something should be done in that field in the line of giving advice to local authorities and health boards in order that they might provide the proper installations and re-organise their heating systems.  This is necessary in order to bring about efficiency in the provision of energy in these institutions in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a need also for the expert advice of Bord na Móna to people purchasing turf-cutting machinery.  I have had experience of being very close to the working of some new machines that have been purchased by co-operatives and individuals this year.  Some of these machines are not suitable in their design and in the method in which they operate. Some guidance should be forthcoming from the people in the board to give some advice to first time purchasers of large machines which involve a big input of capital.  It is necessary to buy the right type of machine in order to get the maximum output.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Keating's submission in connection with the utilisation of our after bogs and with the ownership of such bogs.  My view is that these tracts of bog should be used for two purposes, one for forestry and the other for grass development.  The only people geared to give advice in field and grass production on after bog are An Foras Talúntais.  In view of the capital investment that would be involved, they should be the people to take over the after bog.  Such boglands would make a worthwhile contribution to the national economy and to our farming sector if properly seeded and manured and if their water level was dropped so that they might be used for livestock production in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of ownership, the position is that people who own the turbary rights in the west still own the after bog when turf production is completed <Col N="754" /> but where acquisition by Bord na Móna takes place, the only people who should get the after bog after it has been laid down in grass should be the farmers who are adjacent to these areas.  The system of distribution would be something that would have to be worked out.  It would eventually have to go back for continuous production.  An Foras Talúntais are the people to bring it up to the standard of grass production for the livestock industry.  This is our first opportunity to ventilate our views on this matter and I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister every success.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise one or two points.  It would be a sad day if I could feel personally that it would not be wrong not to contribute to a debate like this.  Literally, I found the report of the Joint Committtee on State-sponsored bodies and the inter-departmental committee report on the question of cutaway bogs interesting.  Bord na Móna have taken on a special role in our society and have shown leadership in many ways. They have gone from a target of one million tons of milled peat to a target of six million tons.  It was in 1950 that an ESB station first began to operate from this material.  I was studying engineering at the time and I remember the discussions as to whether this was a good thing, was it what we should be doing, and the question about relative costs of fuel.  There were some silly lines of thinking then in the light of what we know today. They are going from 860,000 tons of oil equivalent in 1973 to more than one million tons now and moving towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is what the rate of development should be.  This is the big <Col N="755" /> policy question for the Minister.  Some people talk about the need to keep turf for times of emergency.  It would appear as if there is enough to carry us in time of emergency in our times.  My own view, and it may be proven to be wrong, is that technology will eventually solve the problems of fusion and we probably will have alternative ways of generating energy.  The world is held together by energy and it is just a matter of finding the secret that will unlock it in a way that is manageable and non-threatening. Bord na Móna through peat moss are contributing something like £5 million towards our balance of payments.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I am working out the Joint Committee report.  On the question of financing, there is a feeling that the Government are giving finance with one hand and taking it away with another.  I am uncertain as to whether the policy is clear in that partnership.  Two figures have been given in the Joint Committee's report of loans of £45 million being given over a period and £12.7 million being redeemed.  Obviously we are to have more loans.  The question of how the equity capital should be structured was debated in the Joint Committee, but I did not feel satisfied with the outcome.  I am sure the Minister will be having a look at it.</P>
      <P>Clearly the big thing is that the costs have turned around.  We have gone to a situation where the cost of electricity generation by oil is now at least 1.25p compared to milled peat at .77p.  Those figures are not precise.  That information came from a parliamentary question. This brings up the question of pricing policy which was discussed in the Joint Committee report.  I asked if there was something unreal about saying that the market would determine the price.  I would quickly admit the market will determine the cost of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unreality came from the fact that the ESB are taking one-third of the sod turf output and something like three-quarters of the milled peat.  It is a question of the old argument between the <Col N="756" /> ESB and Bord na Móna&mdash;that what is extra income for the board will be extra cost for the ESB.</P>
    <P>I was a bit surprised listening to Members on the other side of the House talking on this.  Senator Cooney spoke about this aspect.  He put a question to the Minister.  I gathered from the Joint Committee report that he had advocated increasing prices.  If that is the case let us accept that that is what the Joint Committee agreed, that prices should be increased. I accept they said they should be increased gradually rather than in big jumps.  Interest cost was of the order of 5 per cent in the past.  That will not be the case in the future.  Therefore price adjustment is needed.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to note in the report that the Joint Committee agreed that there is not any scope for productivity improvement, that it is a matter of income or revenue.  As somebody who has spent a good deal of his life devoted to the development of management and managers, I do not accept that it is not possible to improve and I put it to the Minister and to Bord na Móna that there must be room for improvement.  If there is not room for improvement maybe we should get rid of a few managers.  That is what they are there for.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House with methods of accounting.  Details of the breakdown over the four product groupings should be shown in the accounts.  It was mentioned that this was being shown in aggregate.  I do not see any reason for that.  I do not know if that is a fair criticism or not.  If it is, we should go back to showing actual outputs and turnovers for each of the four product lines. Whether it has anything to do with the fact that milled peat output was very high in 1974, 1975 or 1976 and then fell off afterwards is another matter.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a problem about depreciation policy but I wonder whether it is worthwhile being too concerned about it.  It occupied a fair deal of the time of the discussion when the Joint Committee met the officials of Bord na Móna.  In a time of high inflation, working out the present value or residual <Col N="757" /> value of a wasting asset seems to be an exercise in stargazing.  As long as you are amortising your assets and your capital you will be doing all right.  Bord na Móna seem to have been doing that in the past.</P>
    <P>Another heading I should like to make a few comments on is industrial relations. I congratulate the board on a history of relatively good industrial relations. And on the figures mentioned in the reports.</P>
    <P>There will always be a question about the fair distribution of the added value produced in a State body of that kind. When one looks at the submissions by the trade unions one can sympathise with them if they feel that the price of their product has been kept down in order to make things easier somewhere else, because eventually that means that the added value taken at that point in the cycle is less and therefore the percentage of it available for distribution to the workers is less.  It looks as if something like 60 per cent of the wealth generated goes in remuneration, varying a little depending on weather and things.  It is a very significant contribution to employment in this country, some 5,000 people and, as the Minister told us, 2,000 more to come through this expansion programme.</P>
    <P>Another point which was raised in the discussion was the right of the management of a concern of this kind to remunerate their staff.  I know from historical discussions between us that the Minister does not agree with me in this, but the question keeps cropping up and if that is so it must be causing a problem. If Bord na Móna are losing good people because they cannot pay them, then it means one of two things.  It means all of the payments levels are too low or else it means that persons with particular skills are not being paid enough, which means that the relativities are not right.</P>
    <P>I said it before in this House, and I will say it again, if the technologists are not paid for the skills they have got, we will have problems.  We cannot follow the procedures that are followed in the <Col N="758" /> UK in this regard.  It is a bad place to learn.  If there are problems with Bord na Móna at that end they should be looked at.  People will have to have the freedom to get the skills and must be kept reasonably well motivated&mdash;money is not the only form of motivation&mdash;by the rewards which would come under the heading of money.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of industrial relations which struck me is the obvious need to watch what may happen to local employment as various bogs are worked out.  A bit of creative thinking is needed in that regard.  Use of cutaway bog is one point to make on it.  I notice the inter-department committee report refers to 14 headings of different kinds of research that need to be carried out as to the best use of cutaway bogs, headings like deep-clawing, uneven subsidence, often the use of nitrogen, and so on down to, as other Senators said, biomass production and conversion.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a great deal of work to be done yet to determine how these should be used.  We are talking at the moment about something like 4,000 hectares being available and in the context of the release of 80,000 hectares of cutaway bogs in a period of 50 years, I would not like, without having the research work done, to rush into something which might give rise to some social problems, the kind hinted at in the debate already, that need not be created. Therefore, I do not see the problem as an immediate big problem.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see the figure that cutaway bogs might give employment for 4,000 in afforestation.  Obviously it would take some years for such a programme to be developed.</P>
    <P>This is a good day for Bord na Móna, as somebody said already.  The value of their basic resource has improved in the world market place.  In the process, because of that improvement, mainly through the increasing cost of oil, world growth rate has come down.  Bord na Móna are in the position now to have high growth at a time when economic growth in other countries has been depressed by the cost of energy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> I welcome the extra money that obviously will be expended in this.  I am very pleased that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in 1977 got the inter-Departmental committee going and also that the Joint Committee have come up with some information that enables us to appreciate the excellent work being done in Bord na Móna.  I am thinking back to the days of people like Todd Andrews, when the type of thing that was going on was not that popular, and to the days of people like Dusty Miller when they were helping to develop the new technology for this scheme.  There is something about necessity being the mother of invention, that when your back is to the wall, you will develop.  Bord na Móna are one of our prize pieces in this regard and it gives me great pleasure to support the Bill.</P>

Ba mhaith liom thar cheann Bord na Móna buíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí go léir a labhair i dtaobh an bhoird sa treo inar labhardar ag moladh an obair atá déanta ag an mbord agus an súil go leanfaidh siad leis an deá-obair atá ar siúl acu le fada an lá.</P>
      <P>A surprising number of Senators contributed to the debate.  I found it heartening. The whole tone of the discussion was constructive and inevitably a number of people made similar points.  I will not go through the comments made by each Senator in turn but rather will try to take the themes that were selected and deal with them, except where there were specific points at issue which should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point brought up by a number of Senators was the suggestion that Bord na Móna are in some way acquiring land and turbary rights from farmers. Nobody said that they were actually using compulsory purchase methods but, nevertheless the suggestion was that they seem to be taking not alone the turbary <Col N="760" /> rights they require but leaving households with no rights at all, so that they have to go out and wait in the queue for a very long time to get turf in the towns.  It may be that that has happened in some cases but I must confess to a certain scepticism about it.  My information is that Bord na Móna try at all times to ensure that there will be enough turf left to serve the households from whom land is bought.  If there is any case that a Senator is aware of where Bord na Móna acted unfairly&mdash;indeed somebody suggested that they even have acted illegally&mdash;I should like to hear about it and get details.  I want to ge quite frank and tell the House that I do not think it is very likely that such evidence will be forthcoming, but if it is I should like to hear about it.</P>
    <P>On this question of the amount Bord na Móna pay, I am a little mystified about some things that were hinted at rather than said.  As I understand it, the position is that while Bord na Móna have compulsory purchase powers, in fact the acquisition of bogland by Bord na Móna is on a voluntary basis.  It may be, as some Senators suggested, a small farmer cannot afford to go into arbitration with Bord na Móna or thinks he cannot anyway.  In that connection I want to say that Bord na Móna welcome any attempt to bring test cases to the official arbitrator so as to determine the value of turbary in a particular area. Once that is determined it can operate for all the other cases in the area unless there are some exceptional circumstances. In particular, a grouping of cases, something of the kind suggested by Senator Connaughton for the IFA grouping together, would be welcomed by Bord na Móna as providing a reasonable measure on an area of what should be paid.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that Bord na Móna are not, of course, trying to act as Scrooge in relation to the small farmers of this country.  That is not their role.  On the other hand, they have an obligation to this House and to the taxpayers not to allow themselves to be taken for a ride.  They are doing a reasonable job in difficult circumstances <Col N="761" /> but where there is any doubt about the price being paid, the procedure is there and it is used, and Bord na Móna would like to see it perhaps used a little more in certain areas whereby the official arbitrator would determine the value of holdings in particular areas, or maybe a group of holdings, and that can hold and be a guide and enable the acquisition to be done quickly, for which Senators were pleading, and to be completed without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I was urged by some Senators not just to step up the conservation campaign, which will be done, but Senator Whitaker in particular urged that certain aspects of it should be made compulsory and mandatory and that it is not sufficient to rely on exhortation.  He used a number of other phrases to describe what is going on.  I cannot just remember them at the moment but that is what it amounted to.</P>
    <P>I believe that the first thing that has to be done in this area is to arouse a consciousness among people of the degree to which all of us are wasteful of energy. There is not one person among us who, if telling the truth and examining his or her conscience accurately, would not have to confess that he or she is wasteful of energy.  If we can get people conscious of this that is the first step.  The next step is to indicate to them ways in which energy can be saved.  There are numerous ways in which all of us can save energy without creating discomfort or difficulty for ourselves.  There is a very considerable area of phasing to be effected in the balance of payments figures by doing that.  First stage is consciousness, the next stage is action.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker said that increasing price&mdash;these may not be his words but I think this was the sense of it&mdash;is not a sufficient inducement to make people save energy.  I will have to confess that he is right, to some extent at any rate. The evidence is that people do not save energy as the price goes up, particularly in the field of petrol.  The evidence is that they tend to go on using petrol whatever the price.  That is a theory that obviously cannot be tested until one reaches the limit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> It may be that we are in the area of limitation at the moment.  Certainly it is my belief that people are very conscious of the amount of money petrol is costing them at the moment and, indeed, the cost of various other areas of energy.  If they can be shown ways in which without undue inconvenience to them they can save money, and in the process save energy, I think they will respond.  Their primary motivation may be to save money for their own pockets and that is not a bad motivation for anybody to have, but if it works that is all for the good.  I am not saying that in no circumstances do I think there should be any mandatory or compulsory steps taken in the field of energy conservation.  There are certain steps in fact being taken at present in regard to insulation requirements of new houses, for instance, which are in effect mandatory although not officially.  But, in fact, they are mandatory because you cannot get a grant or a certificate of reasonable value unless the house complies with them.</P>
    <P>It may be that certain other steps will have to be taken and that the field will have to be extended, but there is very great scope, quite apart from any mandatory actions, and I want to give that voluntary approach an opportunity before we get into the kind of areas that Senator Whitaker has in mind.  One in particular he mentioned is rationing.  I know from the way he said it he recognised that he was saying something that would shock some people.  I recognised the motivation behind what he says but I am not at all convinced that this would be an effective approach. There are numerous difficulties in connection with rationing which suggest to me that it would not be effective except in circumstances in which there is a genuine shortage, but rationing simply to save energy and thereby reduce the deficit in the balance of payments I doubt is a real proposition with the general public.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating made reference to understimates by State boards.  I want to make it quite clear in case there is any misunderstanding, that nobody is blaming <Col N="763" /> Bord na Móna because of underestimation. I mentioned in my introductory speech the factors which have increased the estimate of the cost of the third development programme.  Some of them were Government decisions like, for instance, the decision to construct a briquette factory in Ballyforan.  It was a very big addition to the sum.  There were others that I mentioned.  There may be other State bodies which have been blamed for grossly underestimating the capital cost of what they were engaged in but nobody is talking about Bord na Móna when that is being said.</P>
    <P>Another area that concerned a number of people was the question of the use of cut-away bog, the ownership, and the manner in which it should be disposed of if it were to be disposed of.  There were a few Senators who seemed to be of the opinion that it should be disposed of, if not to the original owners or their descendants, at least to persons, in the area, in the same way as land acquired by the Land Commission is disposed of.  I want to make it quite clear that I do not subscribe to that view.  It may be that that view would prevail in a certain limited number of cases for particular reasons which would apply locally or even for the reasons that Senator Keating advanced if one accepts it, that you need to get some very tough, hard, known farmers in there to apply the results of the research, in order to show that you can make it pay.  On general principle, as far as I am concerned, the original owners have no claim whatever on this.  First of all, Bord na Móna have acquired in fee simple from them.  So they have no legal claim.  Secondly, Bord na Móna have worked for years to produce something which is not what they bought, but which they are now finished with. Furthermore if they hand over the cut-away bog, having done nothing to it except cut away the turf, then whoever gets it is going to have to work hard and spend a good deal of money to make anything of it or it will go into a wilderness in a matter of a couple of years.  We should not imagine that we <Col N="764" /> are talking about vast areas of the best land going abegging.  That is not the situation.  As far as title is concerned, Bord na Móna holds it and until we make decisions on what we are doing with cut-away bogs, should continue to hold it on behalf of the State.  The Joint Committee adverted to the difficulty of consolidation of title and what had been achieved by Bord na Móna's acquisition of this land and was against complicating the issue by going back on that consolidation.  As regards the use, we should understand that there is still a great deal of experimental work to be done and it will be a considerable time before there are significant quantities of cut-away bogs available.  There are possibilities of use as regards grassland, cereal production, vegetables, flowers or amenity area or biomass.  We will probably end up using some areas for one thing and other areas for something else and so on.  There is a lot more work to be done before we can really gauge what is most effective.  One plug for biomass is that as long as we are short of energy this is producing a source of energy, a renewable source of energy, which is vitally important to us.  A spin off from that is that it is providing employment in an area where the turf has been cut away.  The people employed by Bord na Móna are, in the absence of other action, going to lose their jobs.  I am putting that in simple terms.  Bord na Móna is not going to leave it like that, as the House will understand.  The point I want to make is that we are not in a position, and will not be for a considerable time, to make decisions on what is likely to be the best use for cut-away bogs.  But we are making considerable progress in reaching the position where we can make these decisions.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern and a matter to which I adverted in my introductory speech is the question of the exploitation of small bogs.  Bord na Móna have, of course, exploited the large bogs, particularly in the midlands, which nobody else could have done.  They are now engaged, particularly in the west of Ireland, as part of their third development programme, in the exploitation of <Col N="765" /> much smaller bogs than they had been concerned with before.</P>
    <P>Although we are still talking about what people other than Bord na Móna would regard as fairly sizeable bogs, Senators were talking about something smaller still.  I am very concerned about those, too, because there is a huge area, a tremendous number of natural resources, available.  We simply have to find a way to exploit them.  Private enterprise, co-ops, and perhaps Bord na Móna partly&mdash;but that has to be examined&mdash;may be the way forward in exploiting this resource. Certainly Bord na Móna are prepared to provide, and at present do provide, advice and assistance to persons engaged in this activity.  I am trying to draw the whole thing together to produce an overall workable scheme for the development of small bogs.  My Department is at present engaged in consultations with various groups of people who are able to contribute in this area.  What I am seeking to do is to see how best we can engage in the surveying of small bogs, drainage, in providing access roads, and in the avoidance of perimeter cutting.</P>
    <P>Is there any way we can handle the problems that arise in regard to the title to some of these and the turbary rights held in commonage and the problems that arise there?  Machinery and technical problems arise.  The object of the consultations going on at the moment is to see how we can provide a programme that will best tackle these problems, at the same time giving assistance and encouragement to the kind of groups I have mentioned, to develop small bogs.  I hope to be in a position in the not too distant future to announce a programme which will be designed to do just that.</P>
    <P>The other major question which was raised was the Bord's pricing policy. Like Senator Mulcahy I was a little mystified at something Senator Cooney said about this.  Senator Cooney is a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and, listening to him, it did not seem to me that he believed that there ought to be any <Col N="766" /> change in the pricing policy of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In the report at paragraph 39, page 14, I find the following sentence:</P>
    <P>In response to these arguments the Joint Committee concludes that the price of turf is currently too low and recommends that Bord na Móna be permitted to raise its prices.</P>
    <P>It goes on in some detail as to why and how this should be done.  I believe it is necessary for Bord na Móna to be allowed to charge something at least approaching an energy related price.  That will involve an increase in price.  Senator Cassidy was concerned that, if that happened, the quality should be increased.  If the quality is not increased then it will not sell.  It is a simple fact.  If the price goes up and the quality does not and if people can get better value otherwise, then they will.  It is important that we should not, in effect, have Bord na Móna subsidising the general consumer of turf. Apart from other reasons&mdash;I do not wish to delay the House by going into them&mdash;there is the question of capital development of Bord na Móna.  The manner in which that capital development was financed in the past is changing. It has to be changed.  It was primarily done by the Exchequer.  In future it is going to be done primarily through the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha asked a question about that.  In 1978-79, 77 per cent of Bord na Móna's milled peat went to the ESB and the balance went for briquetting; 29 per cent of sod peat went to the ESB and the balance for institutional and domestic purposes.  As regards the interest rate payable to the EIB, I think it would be changed from time to time depending on current rates.  It is an amalgam of a number of rates.  At the moment it is in the region of 13 per cent. The basic requirement is that Bord na Móna should be able to operate on a commercial basis provided they have the capital they need and remunerate that capital.  Anybody who examines the history of Bord na Móna will find that, on the one hand, they have not been allowed to operate on a purely commercial <Col N="767" /> basis but, on the other hand, they have been assisted by the Exchequer in regard to capital and the rate of interest they have had to pay.  Bord na Móna have been misrepresented or are capable of being misrepresented as not being a viable operation.  They should be and should be seen to be and, indeed, are, a viable operation.  The only way that can be achieved is to allow the board to operate on a proper market basis as regards the price of the goods they sell.</P>
    <P>No doubt, I have omitted a number of points made by Senators but I hope I have dealt with the major themes raised by a number of Senators.  I appreciate and fully agree with all the tributes that have been paid to Bord na Móna in the House by Senators.  The board have done a wonderful job.  I want to join too with the Senators who paid tribute to those who had the vision to set up Bord na Móna.  I was a little disturbed to hear Senator Markey say&mdash;no doubt he believes, but I think he is mistaken&mdash; that what really forced us to develop the bog was the second world war.  If Bord na Móna had not existed when the second world war broke out and if the effort had not been made, if the vision was not there, if the money had not been sunk in it to get it going, it would have been too late.  It was because they were there that they were able, with a lot of difficulty, to function when the second world war came along.  That was due to the fact that there were people of vision before that.  They were marvellous people. I wish today all of us were equally capable of that kind of vision.  At least we are capable of recognising what was achieved and of pointing the way forward.  That is what Senators on all sides of the House have tried to do in their contribution to this Bill.  For this I thank them.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that debate on the Second Stage of this Bill should be along the lines of a budget type debate in the Dáil.  It is confined to taxation, general expenditure and financial policy and other matters in so far as they are connected with financial policy. Matters of administration and details relating thereto should not be raised.  Opportunities for debating the latter subject will arise in due course on the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before you gives statutory effect to the various taxation changes which I announced in the budget and it also incorporates a number of other changes designed to achieve a more equitable and more effective system of taxation.  The principal elements of the Bill are the arrangements for income splitting, the package of farming taxation and the introduction of a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing concerns.  In addition there are provisions dealing with the administration of the taxation system, the application of excise duties and the implementation of new allowances and reliefs.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the Bill itself, I would like to refer to the aims and objectives of this year's budget and the economic background against which it was framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time we are facing a difficult and discouraging external economic outlook.  It seems certain that international growth this year and in 1981 will be markedly lower than last year, and lower still than the average of the sixties and early seventies.  Oil price increases have almost stopped economic growth in its tracks; as recently as last week the OPEC countries have decided to raise prices once again.  The oil-importing <Col N="769" /> world as a whole is significantly poorer because of the movement of wealth to the oil-producing nations and our economic prospects are diminished as a consequence.</P>
    <P>In 1979 our oil import bill was just over £500 million.  For 1980 the latest estimate is that this bill will rise to about £800 million, in other words a massive increase of virtually 60 per cent in one year.  This, I hope, illustrates dramatically the scope of the problem which we have to face because of the changing energy environment.</P>
    <P>There is a general shift towards more restrictive economic policies in the western world generally and this obviously has undesirable consequences for us.  Export markets will grow only slowly this year and international competition will be extremely tough indeed.  Because we are a small open economy and because we must make exceptionally rapid progress in employment creation, we must have a buoyant and rapidly increasing export trade.  We must, therefore, maintain our existing outlets in adverse trading conditions and at the same time win new markets.  The slow down internationally will also hamper our efforts to attract foreign industry here.</P>
    <P>This in brief is the discouraging external background against which the Government had to devise their budgetary policy.  Added to this was the necessity for domestic reasons to set about bringing greater balance to the public finances and to the balance of payments position.  The remaining important budgetary parameter was the need to maintain momentum in the Government's pursuit of equity in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>In the event, we have made a significant start this year towards bringing our finances into balance.  As I indicated in the budget statement, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1980 has been calculated at 10.4 per cent of GNP compared with borrowing last year equivalent to 13.7 per cent of GNP. Such progress, however, will have to be <Col N="770" /> continued and built upon in the coming years.  We have not attempted to remedy our balance of payments in one move; such a radical course of action would mean forcing the economy into marked recession, with adverse effects on output and employment, and this the Government were not prepared to do.  Our economy, like others, needs time to adjust to the direct and indirect effects of the huge increases in oil prices.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to adopt a phased approach to balancing our finances had regard to the continuing pressing need for economic development as a means of increasing employment and adding to the potential for a sustained development.  In determining Government expenditure, priority has been given to investments which will expand the productive capacity of the economy and also to the development of national infrastructure.  Of a Public Capital Programme of £1,154 million&mdash;15 per cent above the 1979 outturn&mdash;the proportion devoted to infrastructural development has increased from 29 per cent in 1979 to 33 per cent in 1980 while some 42 per cent of the programme expenditure will go to improving the productive capacity of the economy, including an increase of £30 million or 22 per cent in the provision for industrial promotion.  The bulk of this increase is being made available to the IDA to enable it to achieve its job approval target of 30,000.</P>
    <P>The level of expenditure on the non-capital services for 1980 was set at £3,367 million&mdash;up by 16 per cent on the 1979 outturn&mdash;before adding on the additional provisions made on budget day.  This level of expenditure was set following lengthy deliberations by the Government, the aim of which was to ensure that taxpayers would be called upon to contribute only to absolutely essential expenditure, concentrating on the areas of greatest need and potential so that the maximum economic and social benefit is derived from it.  The process of curbing expenditure, however, is not painless and involves making difficult decisions. Because of virtually fixed commitments <Col N="771" /> in the short-term on such substantial expenditures as pay and debt service costs and because of the overriding need to protect the less well-off, the scope for curtailing expenditure is much more restricted than people may generally realise.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the budget and the Finance Bill in Dáil Éireann, I emphasised the crucial importance of successful policies in relation to incomes if we are to surmount the economic difficulties which surround us and to continue to make adequate progress.  As I have already stated, we still have a worrying balance of payments position and an Exchequer borrowing requirement that needs to be reduced.  We are being faced with increasingly high bills for imported energy and the slow down in international trade has added to the problems of exporting.  Despite our best efforts, we are not achieving the progress we would like to make in providing higher employment and this is perhaps the most difficult problem facing us in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Given this background, we must be ready to make some sacrifices now if we are to continue to make progress and all sections of the community must contribute to this.  It is no use if those of us who are already reasonably well provided for&mdash;whether in business, in agriculture or in employment&mdash;insist above all else that we must sustain and improve our own standard of living no matter what the consequences are for others and for the community in general. Unfortunately this tends to be the starting point for debate on incomes and it is an entirely unrealistic approach in the longer term.  If we are honest with ourselves, we must recognise that we cannot at this time improve living standards for those of us who are relatively well positioned already and at the same time provide more employment or improve the lot of the lower paid and of those who must rely on the social services.</P>
    <P>The creation of more employment is of crucial importance for us.  We are in a unique position in that nearly 50 per cent <Col N="772" /> of our population is under 25 as compared with 36 per cent for the EEC generally.  This provides us with a great potential but it also makes extra demands on us which we must fulfil if we are to exploit this great advantage.  We have to provide for an expansion of jobs and we have to move at a faster pace then other western countries generally. This is a great challenge and our young people will not thank us in future years if we do not succeed.  An essential precondition for success is that we do not overprice ourselves by insisting on a higher standard of living than we can afford.</P>
    <P>The negotiations for a further national understanding provide an opportunity for reasonable agreements on pay and related matters which will take account of our difficult economic position and acknowledge that there must be some trimming of individual expectations in the interests of the more vulnerable and needy sections of the community.  I sincerely hope that this opportunity will not be missed and that we can conclude a further national understanding that will provide a realistic basis for higher growth and greater equity.  I must stress, however, that we cannot succeed and that we cannot have an understanding if the parties concerned refuse to recognise that we have to keep a very tight rein on income increases.  There is no virtue in arriving at an understanding which leaves the way open for excessive rises in incomes and does nothing to correct the unsatisfactory trend of leap-frogging with claims and counter-claims for special treatment.  I appeal, therefore, for moderation on this occasion.  I also ask that the parties give due recognition to the generous reliefs in personal taxation announced in the budget when they are determining a new pay policy.</P>
    <P>I have focussed attention on the national understanding because it is an active issue at this moment.  In calling for moderation I want to make a similar appeal to those other sections of the community who are not parties to the understanding and are not immediately affected by the outcome.  All sections of the community must appreciate that we <Col N="773" /> have been paying ourselves too much, and that, if we continue in this direction, we are behaving irresponsibly.  It makes no sense to be critical of undue demands by wage earners if at the same time we turn a blind eye to excessive gains by other groups.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer briefly to the overall taxation strategy in this year's budget.  The Government saw an immediate necessity to move towards greater equity in personal taxation through measures which would also support economic growth to the maximum possible extent.  Given the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement, any reliefs in the interests of greater equity clearly had to be at least balanced by increasing taxation in other areas. This was the only realistic course open. In the event, the Government took innovative and imaginative decisions. They went well beyond the requirements of the Supreme Court in relation to the taxation of married couples by introducing full income splitting for all married couples, which was not required by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Taxation bands were widened, tax exemption limits were introduced for low earners, and a special allowance was introduced for the PAYE taxpayers who had been obliged to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the overall tax burden.  In short, the personal tax changes in the budget mean that 83,000 taxpayers are placed outside the tax net and nearly two-thirds of those who were liable previously to higher rates of tax will now be paying tax at the standard rate.  The total package will cost the Exchequer £227 million in a full year and this has to be made good by other tax receipts.  The Government decided that the bulk of this should be borne by indirect taxes on oil products and discretionary items of expenditure.</P>
    <P>There have been some criticisms that indirect tax increases raise the cost of living and that this is undesirable. However, the increases in this year's budget added less than 4 per cent to the <Col N="774" /> cost of living index and this increase must in fairness be seen in the context of the exceptionally generous improvements in take-home pay generally as a consequence of the income tax concessions. The CPI increase consequent on the budget changes does not take account fully of any consumption fall-off that may arise but is in strict numerical proportion to the increase so that an increase of 20p for instance on a pint of beer would be four times that of 5p even though the level of consumption and therefore effect on the cost of living would be very much less.  The income tax concessions on the other hand apply to every taxpayer and while they represent a real increase in pay, do not show up at all in the CPI.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my budget statement, it may appear that the distribution of tax relief resulting from this year's budget unduly favours married couples with higher incomes.  This aspect, however, is an unavoidable consequence of observing the Supreme Court decision and of implementing income-splitting in full.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the budget proposals, the Government were faced with a situation in which the income of the average single male industrial worker had in many cases brought him into the 45 per cent tax band.  To remedy this, it was necessary to widen the standard rate tax band for single people, with a consequential double benefit for married couples. In addition, the exemption limits and the special PAYE allowance will be particularly significant for young people just starting work.  For example, a young person earning £2,000 per annum will obtain a reduction of over 45 per cent in his income tax liability; if the earnings were £3,000 the percentage reduction would be over 23 per cent.  The net result of the budget proposals will be that the burden of income tax for the vast majority of single people will now be less than it was in 1977-78.  In the case of all married couples on PAYE, the burden will now be less than at any time since 1974-75.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn your attention <Col N="775" /> to the specific provisions in the Finance Bill before you.  For the most part they deal with the taxation changes which were announced in the budget. Before I deal with them individually I would like to highlight a number of provisions which were not included in the budget.  On the income tax side provision is made for implementation of the Supreme Court judgment of 25 April 1980 on the operation of single assessment for married persons.  The court ruled out repayments for 1979-80 and earlier years except in cases where constitutional proceedings had been initiated. To preserve equity, provision is contained in the Bill to ensure that those who had not paid their taxes for those years will not now be put in a more favourable position than those who had paid in time.  The limit on interest relief for married couples has been raised from £2,400 to £4,800.  This extension of relief will reduce income tax payments by an estimated £1.3 million in 1980 and £2 million in a full year.  It means that for married couples interest on loans up to £33,000 approximately will be offset against tax liability.</P>
    <P>The exemption limit on interest paid on deposit accounts with the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks is being increased from £70 to £150.  Provision is made whereby widows will be eligible for the married allowance for the year of bereavement and the limit in interest relief for widowed persons is being raised from £2,400 to £3,500.  The tax exemption limit on lump sums paid on termination of an office or employment is being raised to £6,000, with a further exemption of £4,000 for first-time claimants who are not entitled to any tax-free superannuation capital payment, and loopholes whereby persons in receipt of very substantial &ldquo;golden handshakes&rdquo; could avoid tax are being closed.</P>
    <P>A number of adjustments have been made in relation to the taxation arrangements for farmers and I will deal with these at some length later.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other new <Col N="776" /> provisions as well to which I would like to draw attention.  In accordance with the intention expressed in the budget statement an excise duty is being imposed on dances and discos and late night drinking generally.  There is a concession in relation to VAT whereby the minimum limit for compulsory registration for traders supplying services will now be £3,000 in respect of a 12-month period rather than £500 for a two-month period.  This will be especially welcome to those who operate a seasonal business such as bed and breakfast for tourists for the summer period on a small scale.</P>
    <P>The Bill is long and complex and I do not intend to deal with each section individually. I propose to comment briefly, however, on the more important sections.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 exempt from income tax those with low incomes and the elderly.  The limits are £1,700 for single and widowed persons and £3,400 for married couples.  For those aged 65 years or over but under 75 years the limits are £2,000 for single and widowed persons and £4,000 for married couples. Persons aged 75 years or upwards will qualify for exemption from income tax if their income does not exceed £2,500 in the case of single and widowed persons and £5,000 in the case of married couples. Marginal relief is available for those whose income does not greatly exceed the appropriate limit.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 contain amendments to the personal reliefs.  They (a) adjust the personal allowances to take account of income-splitting for married couples, (b) increase the one-parent family allowance to £500, (c) grant widows, in the year of bereavement, the married allowance of £2,230, (d) implement the special PAYE allowance of £400 as announced in the budget, and (e) reduce the child allowance to £195.  As I mentioned in my budget statement, this reduction is taking place in association with improvements in the social welfare children's allowances and will ensure that resources are directed to those most in need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> These sections also improve the allowances granted in respect of handicapped persons.  The incapacitated child allowance is being increased to £390.  The allowance in respect of blind persons is being doubled and the allowance for a housekeeper taking care of an incapacitated person is being increased from £165 to £330.</P>
    <P>Section 6 increases for married couples who opt for assessment on their aggregate incomes the limit on life assurance premiums which qualify for relief from £1,000 to £2,000.  Section 7 refers to loan interest.  Where a married couple elect to be assessed on their combined incomes the maximum amount of interest which may be claimed for income tax purposes is increased to £4,800.  The limit for widowed persons is increased to £3,500.  Section 8 contains the income tax rates and rate bands announced in the budget.  Married couples who elect to be assessed on their aggregate income will be entitled to rate bands which are twice those applicable to single persons.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the provision in section 10.  This effectively increases the exemption limit for certain lump sum payments made as compensation for loss of employment.  Changes are also being made to correct a defect which allowed tax to be avoided on very substantial compensation payments.  The provision in section 13 increases the exemption limits in respect of deposit interest with the savings banks.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill deals with taxation of married couples.  These will now have the choice of&mdash; (a) assessment of each spouse as a single person, (b) assessment of the aggregated incomes of both partners, and (c) where the option of aggregation is exercised, the couple will have the further right of separate assessment so that each spouse may be separately responsible for his or her share of their total tax liability.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that a husband and wife, unless they both otherwise elect, will each be taxed as a single person. Where they elect for aggregation the <Col N="778" /> husband will be charged to tax in respect of their combined incomes.  An election for aggregation may be made at any time in the year of assessment and will apply for subsequent years unless it is withdrawn by either spouse.  As aggregation will be to the advantage of most married couples, including couples where both partners have separate sources of income, it is provided, to facilitate these couples that, unless notice to the contrary is given by either spouse, married couples will be deemed to have elected for aggregation.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides, in line with the Supreme Court judgment of 25 April, to which I have already referred, that there will be no general repayment of tax, in response to claims of overpayment in earlier years, as a consequence of the aggregation of the incomes of husband and wife.  The purpose of section 21 is to provide for the full payment of taxes for 1979-80 and earlier years by those who have not yet done so.  Where assessments are made for those years, the amount of tax payable under those assessments will correspond to the amount which would have been payable if the taxpayer had been assessed for the relevant years at the proper time.  This will ensure equity of treatment as between those who have already paid their taxes and those who have not yet done so.</P>
    <P>Chapter III provides for the changes in the taxation of farming profits which I announced in the budget.  Since then the Government have had useful consultations with the farming organisations concerning the present state and future development of agriculture.  Arising out of follow-up discussions between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners, I have decided that there should be some modifications to my original proposals.  The necessary amendments were made to the Finance Bill in its passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Firstly, in order to help farmers increase their livestock numbers 100 per cent relief is provided on the amount of the increase in stock values over 10 per <Col N="779" /> cent of profit rather than the existing 75 per cent relief for increases over 20 per cent of profit.  Also, the normal claw-back of stock relief which operates where stock values fall will not apply where stock is disposed of because of disease.  Another amendment which I introduced will exempt fixed plant from the 30 per cent restriction on capital allowances.  This is in addition to the exemption of farm buildings and farm works from the restriction which was announced in the Budget.</P>
    <P>A further modification which should provide an incentive to farmers concerns the farm buildings allowance.  Expenditure on farm buildings may now be written off over four years, rather than over eight years, with up to 30 per cent being claimed in any one year.</P>
    <P>Section 22 lowers the threshold for liability from £50 RV to £40 RV. Marginal relief will apply between £40 RV and £49 RV.  Section 23 allows the option of assessment on the basis of the current year's accounts rather than the previous year's accounts to farmers between £40 RV and £50 RV who become liable for the first time and section 24 abolishes the notional basis of assessment. From this year those liable to income tax will be assessed on their actual profits as shown in accounts.  Section 25 amends section 28 of the Finance Act, 1974, which restricts the personal allowances of a farmer between £20 RV and £40 RV where there is non-farm income. It now provides that where the non-farm income is that of the farmer's wife she will be assessed as a single person. The wife will, of course, be able to claim child allowances which will not be claimed by the farmer since his farm profits are not chargeable to tax.</P>
    <P>Section 29 amends section 17 of the Finance Act, 1974, in the light of the Supreme Court decision on the taxation of married couples.  That section was introduced to prevent the division of holdings for the purpose of avoiding liability to tax.  The present section provides that, where land is owned and occupied by a wife in her own right or is <Col N="780" /> leased by her to a third party at a commercial rent, it will not be aggregated with that of her husband for threshold purposes.  In the case of joint ownership each joint owner will be deemed to occupy all the land for the purposes of the threshold although the actual tax charge will be determined by each party's share of the profits.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV provides for the resource tax.  This tax will apply at a rate of £3.50 per £RV on all holdings of £70 RV and over with marginal relief to apply between £70 RV and £79 RV and will be payable on 1 October.  The tax will not be deductible as an expense against income tax.  I have also provided that charities will be exempt from resource tax.  As I have said before, it is not the Government's intention that this tax should be a permanent feature of the farm tax system.  It will be reviewed at the end of the year in the light of the operation of the farm income tax system and the yield from that system.</P>
    <P>Chapter V contains one section and this provides for the continuation of the special 25 per cent corporation tax rate for manufacturing companies which achieve certain employment targets.  As announced in the budget, the scheme is to continue to end-December 1980 after which the new 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will come into operation for manufacturing generally.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of industrial incentives, introduced in Chapter VI, is broadly intended to replace our principal existing incentives of export sales relief and Shannon relief which, under EEC requirements, must be phased out.  The scheme consists of a new rate of corporation tax of about 10 per cent in respect of income to companies from sales of goods manufactured by them within the State.  In contrast to export sales relief and Shannon relief, the new scheme will be applicable to goods sold in both export markets and the domestic market.  It is intended to operate from 1 January 1981 until 31 December 2000 and, while continuing our very attractive package of incentives to foreign industrialists, will also provide Irish entrepreneurs <Col N="781" /> with a climate most favourable for further investment in our manufacturing sector.  It goes well beyond what our competitors generally offer in the way of tax incentives for industry and emphasises the determination of the Government to provide the best possible incentives for a vigorous expansion of industry.</P>
    <P>Section 39 defines goods for the purposes of this chapter and brings manufacturing activities which do not include the actual sale of goods within the scope of the relief.  Following the existing practice in regard to export sales relief, it is proposed that sales into intervention be excluded.  Intervention is only a second-best solution and, if we are to have a flourishing food industry, we must establish and maintain more export markets.</P>
    <P>The technicalities of operating the new scheme are incorporated in section 41.  It provides for a reduction of seven-ninths&mdash;that is, from a rate of 45 per cent to a rate of about 10 per cent or, in the case of the &ldquo;small companies rate&rdquo;, from 35 per cent to about 7.78 per cent&mdash;in the corporation tax arising from income from the sale of goods.  The relief will be subject to an application being made within a specific time limit.  The section also prescribes the method by which the relief is to be computed.  The principal feature is that tax falling to be reduced is to be quantified as the same proportion of the corporation tax payable by a claimant company on its total profits, exclusive of capital gains, as its income from the sale of goods, arrived at by reference to its sales, bears to its total chargeable income.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 and 43 terminate the existing industrial incentives of export sales relief and Shannon relief with effect from 1 January 1981.  However, a company which has already benefited from those reliefs, or which, by 31 December 1980, establishes an entitlement to them, may continue to benefit until 1990 or until their allotted span of relief expires.  Such a company can at any time up to 1990 opt irrevocably to avail of the new 10 <Col N="782" /> per cent scheme.  In this section I am also making provision for the granting of assurances in relation to eligibility for export sales relief and Shannon relief in certain cases where the conditions relating to such relief have not been fulfilled by 31 December 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that a reduced tax credit will attach to distributions out of income which has borne tax at the new reduced rate of about 10 per cent.  It also specifies the manner in which relevant distributions are to be identified.  Where distributions by a company exceed the aggregate of a company's income which has borne tax at the new reduced rate, less the reduced tax thereon, and of relevant distributions received by it, the excess will be treated as a separate distribution carrying the tax credit, normally three-sevenths, applicable under the existing law.  That aggregate will constitute what is to be known as the primary fund.  Provision is also made in this section for a reduction in relief granted to a company if the amount of a tax credit is overstated by the company in any statement accompanying a dividend warrant or cheque.</P>
    <P>Chapter VII contains a number of miscellaneous income tax and corporation tax measures.  The present taxation arrangement for building societies, whereby they pay income tax at a special composite rate, will be continued for a further two years.  As I announced in the budget statement, the deduction for tax purposes allowed in respect of business entertainment is being limited to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Chapter VIII deals with tax evasion. Section 59 re-writes section 516 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to ensure that it will apply to a person who knowingly and wilfully aids or induces another to evade tax.  Section 60 extends the power of inspection of business records to professions.  The Revenue Commissioners' power in this respect is limited to an examination of the financial records only and the person carrying on the profession will not be obliged to disclose information of a confidential nature which passes between himself and <Col N="783" /> his client.  He will be required to produce only such documentation as is relevant to his own liability.</P>
    <P>As a consequece of the changes in the income tax treatment of married couples, the capital gains tax legislation is being amended in Chapter IX to allow married couples an annual exemption of £1,000 for their net gains instead of £500.  In addition, each spouse will be able to qualify for the relief granted in the case of a dwelling house occupied by a dependent relative and owned by that spouse.  These changes were not included in the budget.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with customs and excise matters.  The individual sections 64 to 70 confirm the budget increases in excise duties on beer, spirits, tobacco products, wine and made wine, cider and perry, table waters and hydrocarbon oils.  Section 71 increases by 5 per cent the rate of excise duty chargeable on motor cars and motor cycles. As I indicated in my budget statement, this represents an increase of the order of 3½ per cent in the retail price. Sections 72 and 73 provide for increases in the excise duties on televisions and gramophone records.</P>
    <P>Section 74 confirms the increases in the rate of excise duty on gaming machine licences.  The main rate has been doubled to £100 a year for each machine.  The reduced rate licence has been increased to £66 a year but it now allows the machines to be operated on Saturdays as well as Sundays and public holidays.</P>
    <P>Section 75 imposes a new excise duty of 20p on mechanical lighters and provides the legal and administrative framework, including penalties, which are required to implement the duty.  Sections 76 and 77 increase the rate of duty on various licences.  I referred to these in my budget statement when I said that I was having them examined with a view to increasing the duty, where appropriate, in order to bring them up to a realistic level in present-day terms or, at least, to cover the present-day cost of administering them.</P>
    <P>In my budget statement I said that dances, discos, cabarets, dinner-dances <Col N="784" /> and the like comprise one area which could bear an additional element of taxation. Section 78 imposes new excise duties accordingly.  The duties are structured to tax public dance halls and after-hours drinking which is more often than not associated with dancing.</P>
    <P>Parts III, IV and V of the Bill relate to value-added tax, capital acquisitions tax and stamp duties.</P>
    <P>Section 80 provides for the increase to 25 per cent as and from 1 May 1980 in the 20 per cent VAT rate previously applying to certain goods and services. Section 81 eases the requirement to register VAT in the case of small traders with an annual turnover of not more than £3,000 a significant element of which is accounted for by services rather than goods.  I have referred to this earlier and pointed out that it should be of considerable benefit to those who are engaged in tourism on a very small scale.</P>
    <P>Section 82 places beyond doubt that the exemption from VAT for betting is restricted to bets liable to excise duty and to bets placed at race meetings which are subject to a levy.  Section 83 increases by 50 per cent the maximum limit for agricultural relief in capital acquisition tax.</P>
    <P>The last part of the Bill, Part VI, contains several miscellaneous provisions. Sections 90 to 92 are concerned with increases in various motor vehicle duties. Section 93 increases the rate of interest on unpaid estate, legacy and succession duties to 15 per cent per annum, which is the rate generally chargeable on other outstanding taxes.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset the Bill is long and complex.  I hope that the explanations which I have given will help Senators to have a better understanding of the various provisions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak at enormous length not necessarily on Second Stage but certainly when we get to Committee Stage. At this stage I intend to be rather unpleasant to everyone.  I regard it as my duty <Col N="785" /> to take up&mdash;and I thought it was the Minister's duty to take it up on behalf of the Executive in the other House or in his address on this complex Bill to this House&mdash;the question of the implications of the Supreme Court decision in the well-known Murphy case.  There is no one in either House with a greater respect for the institution of the Supreme Court, with more regard for the desirability of its total independence, than I.  I am as friendly with all members of the court as anyone in this House or in the other House.  Nonetheless, and because I am a Member of this House, I feel obliged to refer to their judgment in this matter as constituting a very dangerous intervention.</P>
      <P>Legislation by decision is always suspect, and I always suspect it, but legislation by a decision which puts at question the taxing power of the people's representatives should be looked at by the people's representatives with very anxious care.  I am not going to address myself at this point or, indeed, at any point, to the question of the social merits of the Supreme Court decision in this matter of the taxation of married women.  I am concerned with the fact that the Supreme Court is choosing to determine a matter of social merits which primarily is a matter for the representatives elected to Dáil Éireann with regard to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government were wrong in reacting as the Government and the Minister did by going beyond what the Supreme Court decided.  At the time the budget was introduced in Dáil Éireann by the Minister, all the court had found, and found in a manner which I shall have to criticise, was that sections 192 to 198, inclusive, of the 1967 Act in so far as they provide for the aggregation of the earned incomes of married couples, are repugnant to the Constitution.  I would have thought it the Minister's duty and the Government's duty to defend very energetically the decisions of parliament and, very particularly, they should not have gone beyond what the Supreme Court had determined with regard to this <Col N="786" /> matter.  A conclusion of any body, whether it be a council, the Pope, the Supreme Court, or anyone else, who pronounces on a matter is as good and only as good as the arguments which support it.  Because I cannot make my points unless I do so, I have to read the last part of the judgment of the court delivered on 28 January by Mr. Justice John Kenny.  He quotes Article 41 with regard to family and he points out that it has three sections.  Section 1.1º reads:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>He said it is because of those fundamental features that the State gives the guarantee in Section 1.2º which reads:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and is indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Judge Kenny said the section stresses the importance of woman in the home and pledges that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>Section 3.1º must be read not only in the context of the whole of section 3 but of the whole Article.  It says:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>The judge said this means that the pledge I have just read is a guarantee that this institution in all its constitutional connotations, including the pledge given in Article 41.2.2º as to the position of the mother in the home, will be given special protection so that it will continue to fulfil its function as the basis of the family and as a permanent, indissoluble union of man and woman.  He proceeds:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> The onus is on the plaintiffs to establish that the higher income tax liability which may fall on the husband is a clear breach by the State of its pledge to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>Counsel for the Attorney General conceded that in some cases, but not in all, marriage, as a result of s.192 of the Act of 1967, could have the consequence that the husband could become liable for more than the total sum of income tax which husband and wife would have to pay if they were assessed separately on what each of them earned.  They argued, however, that to decide whether the State had failed in its pledge, the whole of our law in relation to married couples should be looked at and that when this was done, it would be found that in many respects, numerous benefits are given to the husband, wife and children.  They submitted accordingly, that when the court took account of the many advantages and privileges given by the State to married couples and their children, they outweighed the disadvantage of the increased income tax liability of the husband created by s. 192 of the Act of 1967.</P>
    <P>The court accepts the proposition that the State has conferred many revenue, social and other advantages and privileges on married couples and their children.  Nevertheless, the nature and potentially progressive extent of the burden created by s. 192 of the Act of 1967 is such that, in the opinion of the court, it is a breach of the pledge by the State to guard with special care the institution of Marriage and to protect it against attack.  Such a breach is, in view of the court, not compensated for or justified by such advantages and privileges.</P>
    <P>It then declared as it did.  I would like to say that the court, in pronouncing on this matter, makes an assessment where it has not the capacity to reach the conclusion which it has reached.  It has no apparatus or system of calling evidence <Col N="788" /> which would enable it to make this judgment as to whether a section or group of sections which have been on the Statute Book of this State for 22 years were to be regarded as unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Let us look at how they are regarded. They are regarded as injuring the ability of the woman to spend her life within the home.  Sections which are going to aggregate her income with the income of her husband are supposed to damage her ability to spend her life in the home.  This is the subsection to which they referred. The State has pledged itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage.  Yet these sections which had been there for 22 years were to be regarded as an attack on the home.  I am perfectly entitled, in this place more particularly, but in any place, to express my dissent&mdash;and I shall appropriately &mdash;with a conclusion of this kind.</P>
    <P>My particular point at the moment is that the Government ought to have seen the extreme importance of this matter in terms of the balance of power within this State.  I rate the independence of the Judiciary as enormously important.  I submit that the Judiciary may abuse its powers every bit as much as the Oireachtas may abuse its powers, every bit as much as the Executive can abuse its powers.  I am not going to call this abuse of power but I would say that the Government's duty was to give the court every opportunity for further reflection on this matter of reversing itself on the whole affair.</P>
    <P>Consider what we have suffered.  In a year in which some people are of the opinion, and at least the Minister will accept it, that the budget deficit is too large, the Minister has told us that the measures he has taken in reaction to the Supreme Court decision will cost us £220 million. It is extremely dangerous that the position is that every time the Minister for Finance presents a budget he has got to sit down with his last word on the words &ldquo;subject to the Supreme Court's approval&rdquo;. How can a State be run on these terms?  It cannot be run on these terms.  It is obviously wrong, and there <Col N="789" /> are a whole lot of consequences which are embodied in this Bill which are costing this country, immediately, considerably. There is the very greatest doubt, a doubt which I shall express when I come to deal with it, as to whether these provisions are in fact just. Just immediately, for example, let us take the case of a man whose wife is dead. He is not merely faced with that grievous experience, but he finds, after he has taken benefit that the Minister has included in the Bill for the year of his widowhood that not merely is he without his wife, the partner of his life, but, when he was the person who was earning all the income, has to pay thereafter additional thousands of pounds more tax.  That kind of consequence coming from the finding of a Judiciary seems to me of a kind on which the Government has a duty and this Parliament has a duty to consider their position.</P>

      <P>The Cathaoirleach received notice from Senator Cooney that he proposed to raise the following matter on the Adjournment: the award of a contract for a new vocational school at Ballinahown. Senator Cooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  In effect, I have taken the opportunity of this Adjournment Debate to make a special plea to the Minister for immediate sanction to a tender <Col N="790" /> for the erection of a new school in the village of Ballinahown on the borders of Westmeath and Offaly.  I want to take this opportunity to give the Minister some reasons as to why he might give this matter his urgent attention.  It is common case between all sides that there are many national schools in the country that are in poor physical shape. But I would venture to bet a fair sum of money that the village school in Ballinahown is the worst of the lot.  It was built in 1863&mdash;117 years ago.  It was renovated in 1930.  The year 1930, in terms of 1863, sounds quite modern but we have to remember that 1930 was half a century ago.  The school consists of a two-storey building with two classrooms and two store rooms off them.  The building, as to its age, is totally unsuitable, it is dark, it is overcrowded. Especially, it has not proper sanitary or extra-curricular facilities for the children.  The playground outside the school is on the small side.  A portion of it is clay and a portion of it is concrete. The concrete is badly cracked, it is uneven and in wet weather it is subject to flooding.  The clay, as one can imagine with a school of 78 pupils, in wet weather becomes a morass of mud, and parents are constantly complaining of children coming home from school with their clothing in a filty condition because children will play irrespective of the underfoot conditions and, in the nature of things, they will slip on the mud, and if they are not playing on the mud they will trip on the concrete.  On the boundary of the mud and the concrete there is what passes for sanitary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited that school about a fortnight ago and was taken in to inspect it.  When I was 15 yards away from the lavatory the stench of urine was positively overpowering. In wet weather the approach to the lavatory is under water and, if younger children want to visit the lavatory, older children have to carry them piggyback to the lavatory.  That is in relation to those of them who will visit the lavatory.  I want to be frank about this: the conditions in the lavatory are so bad that many of the children refuse and fail to use it and parents have complained <Col N="791" /> to me that children have come home to them with their clothing soiled because they were unable to use the lavatory.  That is the condition of this school in 1980.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why I am begging the Minister to give sanction immediately to the tender which he has received for the building of this school. The parents down there are coming to the end of their tether and the teachers equally so because one can imagine the frustration of trying to discharge a professional obligation in those appalling surroundings.  Pressure is on the teachers and on the parents.  There is pressure on the teachers to withdraw their services and pressure on the parents to withdraw their pupils and to go on strike, the modern remedy for every grievance.  I must say, in credit to both teachers and parents, they have both refused to do so, being conscious of the bad example that such action would be to the children in their care.  They have shown a responsibility and a discipline here.  I would ask the Minister to recognise their sense of responsibility and their sense of discipline by taking them out of their predicament.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I want to make about this to emphasise what I am saying.  This school is in the nearest village to the monastic settlement of Clonmacnoise.  It is indeed ironic that just down the road from this village we have these majestic remains in which we take tremendous pride, remains from centuries and centuries ago.  Then up the road where we are educating the next generation, we are educating them in a most appalling slum.  I know the Minister is a humane man, a man of rural background.  He knows the importance of a good rural school in an area.  I would appeal to him, on the facts that I have outlined, to give sanction for the tender which he has in his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm an bealach seo bheith agam labhairt faoin scoil seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had representations from all the Deputies in the area about it already and <Col N="792" /> from Dr. Daly, the Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise.  I know the circumstances of the school and the Senator very rightly points out that the need for a new school in the centre is an urgent one.  I am in total agreement with him that the conditions of the school are very bad indeed.  I am not in dispute with him at all.</P>
    <P>As far as the Department are concerned there was no unwarranted delay in dealing with the question of this central school.  Its replacement was considered first in 1965 and the context was the establishment at Ballinahown of a central school which would also serve Bloomhill and Roshina.  The policy of the amalgamation of smaller schools where the distances involved for the children were not unduly great and where local consent could be obtained for such procedure, has been pursued by successive Governments.  The <i>rationale</i> behind this policy was essentially educational in that it provided better and more structured teaching circumstances for the children.</P>
    <P>If in the event it also secured a better distribution of teaching services throughout the school system this was seen as part of the question of equity in treatment.  There was no evidence then, nor is there now, that such a policy was embarked upon to bring about any kind of economy in educational expenditure. The decisions that were taken were taken purely on educational grounds.</P>
    <P>Agreement regarding the amalgamation of Ballinahown and Bloomhill which would permit the planning of a central school to proceed was not achieved until July 1976.  In fact, when it was first mooted it was rejected.  The main reason for the delay was the necessity to consult with the school authorities and parents. It is my policy not to inflict an amalgamation where there is not a reasonable degree of consensus in the community.  Following the decision to amalgamate the schools in question the accommodation requirements were assessed, a site was offered, found suitable and accepted and planning work proceeded through sketch plan and <Col N="793" /> working drawing stages and the preparation of a bill of quantities&mdash;these are the normal gradations&mdash;to appoint where tenders were invited and received at the end of 1979.  Such delay as had been experienced in the acceptance of a tender and placement of a contract has been due entirely to the fact that the tenders received were considerably in excess of the cost limits for a school building of this kind.  In these circumstances there rested an obligation on my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, to examine the lowest tender and explore the ways and means of bringing this within the cost limits.  This work is proceeding.</P>
    <P>I want to state that the priority attached to the provision of this school has not in any way lessened.  I fully accept Senator Cooney's thesis with regard to the school.  It would not be at its present level of development as a project had it not been given a very high priority.  I am fully conscious of the need to proceed with building as soon as possible.  It must be appreciated, however&mdash;and I would like to stress this&mdash;that in the interests of proper management of public moneys and the interests also of all other school projects which have to be given consideration I could not authorise proceeding with building at any price. The Senator and the House will appreciate this.  To do so would lessen the share of capital available for other projects and the concern to provide the maximum number of new school places consistent with reasonable education and building standards which must be a consideration of fundamental importance to Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann and the Oireachtas generally.</P>
    <P>Last week on the occasion of a debate on the Adjournment in Dáil Éireann discussion took place in relation to the case of another school where the same difficulty has arisen because the tender price was in excess of the cost limits of the Office of the Public Works.  The advice offered was that the Minister should forget about cost limits and accept any tender that a contractor, in his wisdom and experience, should decide is appropriate <Col N="794" /> to the project.  This, of course, I cannot do.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not see to it that the State gets the best possible value from such building projects.  It would be a lot easier for me, as Minister for Education, if I just simply said, &ldquo;Build a Taj Mahal here, or a Taj Mahal there&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not an unlimited supply of finance available and if a Minister is to get the optimum return from financial expenditure on school building at all levels by way of maximising the number of school places to be provided annually, he is obliged to have regard to the various regulations and procedures including insistence on reasonable cost control.  It is in the general interest of school authorities who desire to place contracts in the current year that strict control should be exercised over the cost to be approved in the case of each individual school.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would stress again, that the only delay involved in the provision of the Ballinahown central school at this stage is occasioned by the efforts to bring the lowest tender within the cost limits appropriate to a school of this size. That this work is proceeding as quickly as possible and that the date of signing a contract to enable building to commence is dependent on its successful completion. I am hopeful that it will be possible to authorise the placing of a contract in the near future.</P>
