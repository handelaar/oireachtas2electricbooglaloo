      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit worried by the <Col N="826" /> definition of &ldquo;market right&rdquo;.  By virtue of section 2, selling at a fair or market held in pursuance of a market right is exempt from the Act as I read it.  We then have to see the extent of the market right and we find that the definition confines it to &ldquo;a fair or market&rdquo; that arises under a franchise or statute.  One that arises under a statute is fair enough.  One that arises under a franchise &mdash; I am a bit more puzzled by what exactly that means. I presume it means that somebody with legal power made a grant of a fair or market.  Normally such a person would be either the Crown or the landlord.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what precisely &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; means.  I should also like him to deal with another worry I have with regard to this.  There are many fairs and markets throughout this country that have grown over the years, where no specific grant by Crown or landlord will be forthcoming.  Persons engaging in those fairs and markets will be able to maintain that they have a prescriptive right to do so.  Such fairs and markets would arise in towns generally that were not boroughs so as to attract a royal grant.  If those smaller towns and villages and that particular type of fair and market are not included in the exemption here I think it is a bad thing.  They should be included.  I would ask the Minister to explain exactly what is meant by &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; in the definition and to let us know the position with regard to markets and fairs that have been established by prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come in on the same points, specifically on the definition of &ldquo;market right&rdquo;.  There are late amendments, I understand, being circulated and there are even later amendments possibly in the pipeline because I had proposed to put down an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;market right&rdquo; here. I have just put it in this morning.  It is too late for circulation on Committee Stage. It is an amendment which proposes to extend the definition of &ldquo;market right&rdquo; so that it means a right conferred by franchise, statute, charter or letters patent.  As I understand it, there are markets operating here at the moment which <Col N="827" /> derive from charter or letters patent.  If so, I think that the market right as defined in the Bill should cover these markets.  It is a little on the same lines as Senator Cooney's right merely by prescription, by passage of time, but it is not an area that I would claim any specialist knowledge of.  So perhaps the Minister could indicate how many traders at the moment would be exercising their rights under old charters or under letters patent and whether this has been considered by his Department.  If necessary I am prepared to table this amendment on Report Stage but at this point I would like to hear the view of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>In a somewhat similar vein, before the Minister replies I should like to have clarification of the situation. I think I can be specific in this query in relation to my local town.  The urban council there acquired the market rights in 1926 and attempted subsequently to regulate the markets within the urban area.  They subsequently discovered that there was another market there operating under charter or some other form of right which entitled the public, as distinct from traders, to set up market stalls.  The terms used were, &ldquo;within the meets and bounds of the borough area&rdquo;.  This is the one which has caused problems ever since and which has left the local authority powerless.  Does the term &ldquo;market right&rdquo; we have in the Bill cover that particular situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>A market right or franchise to hold a market or fair derives from statute law and derives then perhaps from the prescriptive right referred to by Senator Cooney and by Senator Robinson.  We are advised that the markets to which Senator Robinson has referred are covered by the definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to what has been raised by Senator Howard, a general right to the public to engage in buying and selling is provided by charters and letters patent in Thurles, Ennis, Carlow, Dungarvan, Longford, Mallow, Navan, Michelstown, <Col N="828" /> Kenmare and Wexford.  Markets and fairs in other places are authorised by statute and by the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, local legislation such as the Bray Towns Act, 1866, Dublin Markets Act, 1899 and so on.  The royal grants usually entitled the grantee to collect tolls or other fees.  The local authorities in Thurles and Ennis acquired the rights of the original grantees, but we are advised that in other areas these rights are very restricted and cannot readily be altered by existing legislation.  The Department of the Environment advised that, with suitable amendments section 10 of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, and parts of the Housing Act, 1966, could be extended to the acquisition of market rights.  Such provision is proposed in section 8 of the Bill.  The owners of market rights may be entitled to compensation for loss of tolls, fees and so on and it may be necessary for local authorities to borrow to pay compensation.  Section 4 of the 1960 Act authorises such borrowing with the sanction of the appropriate Minister who in this case would be the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt very quickly with the point I had raised and I would like if he would just explain it a little bit more.  Am I correct in thinking that, if at the moment a market right arises by virtue of an old charter or letters patent, that is in the view of his Department covered by the definition here which refers to a market right established by other statute or franchise?  Perhaps if the Minister would explain what the scope of the word &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; is in this context it might be clearer.  I am disposed to feel that it is necessary to add in the words &ldquo;if the market right is acquired by charter or letters patent&rdquo; expressly.  But if the Minister is satisfied that that is definitely covered then it would not be necessary to move that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been assured by the Attorney-General's Office that the matter is covered as is stated in the Bill at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hear that with some surprise because franchise, as far as I could imagine, is something that would have to be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning.  I am not aware that it is a word that has any particular specialised legal meaning.  But apparently it is being used here in a specialised way to mean not what it normally means, a privilege, but it is to mean something specific &mdash; the grant of a market right by a charter or by letters patent.  I am surprised to hear that the Minister's advice is as he has told us.  We have to be guided by our betters in these things, though the history of advice in regard to certain State officials is not very happy.  However, we will have to be guided to some degree.  But, even if the situation is as the Minister tells us, what is the position with regard to markets or fairs that have been established by prescription?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we were concerned to ensure that these markets are covered and we are advised that the definition adequately covers them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we share the same concern to ensure that these types of traditional market rights are covered, would the Minister be prepared to accept an amendment which covers them expressly rather than accepting the advice given that it is implied?  In other words, would he accept an amendment to cover rights acquired by charter, letters patent and, as Senator Cooney wishes, by prescription?  Certainly I would find it not necessarily an obvious interpretation of the word &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; but it would cover markets acquired in this way and &ldquo;franchise&rdquo; would normally have a rather narrower meaning. Obviously, the Minister has sought advice from the Attorney-General's Office and, in principle, I am prepared to accept that.  But it is particularly important because of the provisions of section 2 (2) (<i>h</i>), because, if a person is selling at a market or fair held in pursuance of a market right, that will not include casual trading and all the other provisions of the Act will not apply.  It is extremely important for traders that the matter be crystal <Col N="830" /> clear as to what the definition of &ldquo;market right&rdquo; is and what kinds of market rights, exercised at the moment, are covered. Since a genuine doubt is raised about this I would ask if the Minister would be prepared to accept the amendment, to spell it out expressly in the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of our advice, the definition is accurate and I am not prepared to accept an amendment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister spell out what he means by &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;? What kinds of market right does the definition comprise?  Will the Minister list them for us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights are set out in section 8 &mdash; a general right to the public to engage in buying and selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I mean.  I refer to the scope of the words &ldquo;market right&rdquo;?  Do they include a market right acquired by charter, by letters patent, or by prescription as well as by statute, all encompassed in the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; or &ldquo;franchise&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On subsection (2), which gives the exemptions to casual trading, one of the exemptions is in paragraph (d), the selling of sweets, chocolates confectionery and cooked foods.  Would the Minister explain what that is intended to exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying to this query will he consider this observation?  The section refers to the selling of sweets, chocolates, confectionery and cooked foods other than those cooked at the place of sale.  Chips and <Col N="831" /> burgers provided in stalls would obviously be cooked at the time of sale. Would it be permissible as the subsection stands for sandwiches to be sold?  What would be the situation with regard to Bovril?  Is Bovril a cooked product for instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The selling of agricultural or horticultural produce by producers we are told is almost a thing of the past.  We have no complaints about it and it is not the type of trading that could reasonably be confined to designated places.  To do so would mean that we would catch people, often children, selling strawberries, vegetables and so on by the roadside.  That would be going too far.  It should be noted that the exception applies only to the producer of the crops or the livestock or his servants or agents. Anyone else selling agricultural or horticultural produce would be caught by the Bill.</P>
      <P>Selling to a person at or at a place adjacent to the place where he resides or carries on business is intended to cover all door to door selling.  This Bill applies to selling which can properly be confined to the greater trading areas.  The bread man, the milk man, the coal man and other door to door sellers could not serve the community if they were restricted in the way that is contemplated in the Bill. There are objectionable aspects to door to door selling, notably the type of selling which induces a person to contract to buy something fairly expensive which on reflection he decides he does not want. The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, which will come into force on 1 January 1981 provides that the Minister may by order provide that for certain contracts negotiated away from business premises there shall be a specified period within which the consumer shall be entitled to withdraw from acceptance of the contract.  There is an additional EEC proposal to provide the consumer with somewhat similar protection from door to door sellers.  There may be other aspects of door to door selling which people may feel should be regulated, but this Bill is not designed to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> People who attend public events, sports meetings, pilgrimages, circuses and so on, expect to be able to buy sweets, chocolates, refreshments and so on listed in this paragraph.  Foods cooked at the place of sale are excluded from the exceptions at the request of tourist interests.  The places where public events take place could not appropriately be designated by local authorities because if they were designated trading areas less desirable forms of trading would be carried on.  The sale of ice cream, newspapers, periodicals, pious and religious objects, are other categories of goods which could not be confined to designated places.  The selling of fish by persons by whom they were caught or by a member of the crew of a fishing boat is being accepted for much the same reasons as we are accepting the farmer selling his own produce. Does that cover everything?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  The Minister has given me part of the answer to a thing that has puzzled me and it takes up what Senator Howard raised about cooked foods being exempt but food cooked at the place is not exempt.  I have in mind a point to point meeting, or a similar situation where a refreshment caravan is specifically asked to attend to prepare refreshments for those working on the day and for those attending the meeting and helping with its organisation.  Part of the refreshments provided are things like sausages and hamburgers which are cooked there and then.  It is daft for the tourist industry or whoever asked the Minister to put in this exemption, to put it in.  I would like more explanation as to why the Minister accepted it.  It is a crazy exemption which means that people at-functions such as point to point sports meetings up and down the country will not be able to prepare hot foods for the spectators and for the persons attending. If they do, and do not have a casual trading licence they would be liable to all sorts of penalties.  That is crazy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, that type of thing would take place on premises at a race meeting, for instance, and would not come under the terms of the Casual <Col N="833" /> Trading Bill.  The fact that the cooking would take place on premises means that it would not actually come under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be premises to which the public would not have access as of right &mdash; is that the Minister's point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that we would be talking about private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some decisions under the Road Traffic Act that says that offences can be committed in car parks attached to publichouses notwithstanding that that is private property and that they are areas to which the public have access of right.  The types of function to which I refer is a point to point meeting which is open to the public, and it is not allowed under regulation.  There is no charge to individuals, only for cars, but as of that day because of that invitation I submit that the public would have access as of right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to the basic situation that exists in certain areas, in tourist areas and seaside areas there are often vans serving food and as I see it, the serving of a sandwich from such a van is not prohibited while the serving of a burger is.  I find that rather inconsistent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 3, which is the section dealing with restrictions on casual trading, subsection (2) provides that a person shall not engage in casual trading in a casual trading area unless he is, or is the servant or agent acting as such of, a person who holds a casual trading licence and a casual trading permit that is for the time being in force, and the casual trading is in accordance with the licence and the permit.  I find it very difficult in the Act itself to know what conditions the Minister is likely to impose on the trade licences.  It would be helpful if he could explain what this means in practice, what kind of restrictions there will be and what kind of limits will be placed on the licences, so that somebody who is applying for a casual trading licence will know what the factual situation they will face will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) applies to a person engaging in casual trading in the area of a local authority which is not designated as a casual trading area.  He will be obliged to have only a licence issued by the Department and to observe the conditions attached to the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are those conditions likely to be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority designate a casual trading area, and a person may not engage in casual trading elsewhere other than that authority's functional area, or in any part of the functional area of another local authority, which is within five miles of the casual trading area, if the other authority has not designated the casual trading area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> Let us suppose Wicklow Urban District Council designated a casual trading area but that Wicklow County Council had failed to do so.  Subsection (3) (a) (i) confines the casual trading within the urban district to the casual trading area, and subsection (3) (a) (ii) prohibits a casual trading area anywhere in the county council area that is within five miles of the urban district casual trading area.  The reason for this provision is that the urban district council might find itself denied many of the benefits of the designated and regulated casual trading area if, because of the failure of the county council to take similar action, streets and roadside traders could set up stalls just across the border in a county council area.  The conditions then may relate to hours of work, disposal of refuse, noise and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said is fairly clear from the rest of the section.  It would be helpful to have some idea of what would be likely to be the conditions attached to a licence for casual trading under this subsection.  I find it very difficult to get a sense of that from the bare words of the thing, because it does not particularise at all.  So far, the Minister has talked about territorial restrictions and mentioned questions about conditions in relation to removal of refuse.  Perhaps it would be helpful if the Minister would specify more particularly what these will be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the local authorities, in designating areas, will lay down fairly rigid controls in relation to all these matters.  We will be dealing with that under another section of the Bill.  We assume that it will not be just a question of defining an area for trading, that there will be other regulations which will be necessary for the local authority to introduce in order to ensure that all the irregularities relating to this business will be dealt with in a fashion which will be acceptable to everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <P>This applies to a person engaged in casual trading in the area of a local authority which is not a designated casual trading area.  He will be obliged to have a licence issued by the Department and to observe the conditions attached to the licence.  Subsection (3) says that if a local authority designates a casual trading area a person shall not engage in casual trading elsewhere than that authority's functional area or in any part of the functional area of another local authority which is within five miles of the casual trading area, if the other authority has not designated a casual trading area.</P>

      <P>Suppose that Wicklow Urban District Council has designated a casual trading area, but Wicklow County Council has failed to do so, subsection (3) (a) (i) confines casual trading within the urban district to be a casual trading area, and subsection (3) (a) (ii) prohibits casual trading anywhere in the county council area that is within five miles of the urban district casual trading area.  The reason suggested for this provision is that the urban district council might find itself denied many of the benefits of the designated and regulated casual trading area, if, because of the failure of the county council to take similar <Col N="837" /> action, street and roadside traders could set up their stalls across the border in the county council areas.</P>

      <P>Would it not have been another way of approaching it to place some sort of onus on all local authorities to designate in their functional area a casual trading area?  Was this considered by the Department, rather than to leave it totally to the discretion of the local authority, that there would be some onus to designate a casual trading area?  It would have avoided a lot of the problems this section is endeavouring to meet at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 4, between lines 33 and 34 to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) An applicant for a casual trading licence shall be required to obtain a bond of not less than £5,000 from a licensed assurance company, for the protection of consumers purchasing goods or property to which the licence relates.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> I would like to apologise to the House if putting down these amendments at this late stage caused inconvenience to the House.  Effectively this amendment deals with an issue of considerable consumer protection interest.  Obviously when the consumer is purchasing goods from established traders with properties in towns, villages or cities there is an inherent protection which does not always obtain in the purchase of goods in the market place from casual traders.  It is simply to ensure that the consumer is protected and has some come-back in so far as the purchase of goods is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides that before a local authority issues a permit an applicant should be obliged to furnish a bond to the authority setting out that there is some form of protection for the consumer.  There are two basic objections to this amendment. Firstly, shopkeepers are not required to take out such insurance and it would be unfair to impose this requirement on casual traders.  It is almost certain that no insurance company would bond a casual trader and, if it did, the cost of the insurance would be excessive.</P>
      <P>There are provisions in the Bill and other legislation which go a considerable way towards protecting the consumer. But it must be recognised that, unless one is trading with a big, well-financed company, one can never be sure of compensation.  People should be choosey when it comes to buying particularly something like a television set which is likely to need service.  They should do their buying from traders they know and trust or from traders who have good reputations and the means of satisfying decrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister, I take quite a number of his points and certainly there might well be difficulty in getting such bonds.  Possibly a lesser figure might be apt.  At the same time that inherent protection is necessary.  I do not think it is altogether valid to suggest that, because shopkeepers are not required to give these type of assurances, casual traders are in the same category. <Col N="839" />  I do not know that that is necessarily a valid argument.  I take his point about the difficulty in arranging such insurance, possibly at a lesser level.  We have had the example of the collapse of a travel agency in this city in the last two to three days.  We find that, under a certain protection scheme in Northern Ireland, customers there are protected under this assurance scheme whereas they are not in the Republic.  It is just a small example of a very sensitive area in which we should seek to protect the customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill &mdash; because the casual trader has to display a licence &mdash; will provide some kind of comfort for the customer in that he will now be able to identify the trader. This does not apply at present.  If we were to go as far as Senator Staunton is suggesting we would be accused of discriminating against one type of trader as against another.  We might be going too far in implementing the suggestions made by Senator Staunton.  We could find that it would be prohibitive and could well kill casual trading entirely.  This is not the purpose of the Bill.  We recognise &mdash; as was mentioned on Second Stage &mdash; that there are people who have engaged in this type of business for a long number of years, who have been providing a service for the public.  They are not the fly-by-night people who have come in recently.  They have been there over a period of years and, traditionally, have been providing a service to the public.  I do not think it would be fair to go as far as the Senator suggested.</P>

      <P>The Minister shall not grant a casual trading licence to a person who was convicted of two or more offences (each offence being either an offence in relation to the importation, possession or sale of goods committed while the person was the holder of a casual trading licence or an offencce under this Act) if the latest conviction occurred less than five years before the first day on which the person proposes to engage in the casual trading to which the application for the licence relates and, two, at least, of the convictions occurred after the expiration of the last period (if any) of disqualification by virtue of this subsection for being granted a casual trading licence.</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) reads:</P>
      <P>A casual trading licence, if not previously revoked, shall continue in force for a period of twelve months and shall then expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point made by a number of people in relation to this Bill is that this arbitrary decision by the Minister, or by the local <Col N="841" /> authority, may not necessarily be fair to the person involved.  The amendments seek that, added to each of the subsections, is the sentence: A person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Minister under this subsection shall have a right to appeal against such a decision to the Circuit Court.  Effectively it is the right of appeal by the casual trader in circumstances in which the Minister makes the arbitrary decision in each of the subsections of section 4.</P>

      <P>By way of brief reply to the Senator, we are advised that, in common law, everybody has a right of appeal against a decision of the Minister. There is no provision in the Bill but we are told that the Ombudsman Act 1980 provides that such decisions are subject to review by the ombudsman.  We are advised that an ombudsman will be appointed &mdash; in order to implement that Act &mdash; early in 1981 by the Minister for the Public Service.  That would cover the matter raised by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply which is obviously very accommodating.  The Minister states that, under common law, an individual has the right of appeal.  I take his point in relation to that.  However, I should like to ask just one question: whilst appreciating that the Ombudsman Act is coming into force, apart from the ombudsman issue could the Minister tell me what right of appeal the citizen has under common law, independent of the ombudsman issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read this section if a casual trader applies for a licence, pays £100, supplies the information sought by the Minister and has no previous conviction the Minister has to grant a casual trading licence under section 4 (1).  A case could arise where an undesirable casual trader would seek a licence.  If he fully complies with the requirements, he must get the licence.  There also could be a situation where undesirable items would be put on sale.  Yet as long as the person has no previous convictions, pays £100 and supplies the information sought by the Minister the licence must be granted.  That is rather strange.  I would prefer if it was left to the discretion of the Minister to decide whether or not casual trading licences should be given.  Perhaps the Minister would say if he has that discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may refuse to grant a licence to a person who has been convicted of an offence in relation to the importation, possession or sale of goods while he was the holder of a casual trading licence.  He may revoke a casual trading licence if he is satisfied that any condition of the licence has been or <Col N="843" /> is being contravened or if the person to whom it was granted is convicted of an offence in relation to the importation, possession or sale of goods committed while he was the holder of a casual trading licence or an offence under section 3 of this Bill.  Perhaps that does not cover the points raised by Senator Markey in that he was referring to a person who applies for a licence for the first time.  If the person appears to be bona fide, the Minister would find it very hard to refuse the application.  I do not know what criteria one could apply.  If the applicant and his application seem to be in order there is no way that the licence can be refused.  On the other hand, if it emerged after the licence had been issued that the applicant had offended in any way against the terms of the Bill, the Minister could take action as stated in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied to the case I put.  It still permits the possibility of an undesirable character getting a licence.  A person who sells undesirable products must get the licence once he complies with the requirements laid down in this section, namely, that he pays £100, supplies the information sought by the Minister and has no previous convictions.  That is taking a risk because we could have a situation where a casual trading licence could be sought on a blanket basis to cover a number of areas.  Damage could be done before the question of revoking the licence arose. The Minister should have discretion on this.</P>

      <P>I do not know how Senator Markey wants to define an undesirable character.  If there is evidence available to the Minister that an applicant may not be a suitable person, that would be looked at.  It would be very hard to expect him to have detailed information about every applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this strange.  There should be a scale of fees in a situation where licences are sought for more than <Col N="845" /> one area.  We could have a situation where a very large corporation or company would apply for a casual trading licence to cover every town and county. We could have a situation where a small trader who operated for years in one local authority area would have to pay the same amount as a large corporation or company.  That is unfair.  A scale of fees would have been desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to make traders contribute to public funds in lieu of rates and other charges they may evade or not be liable for.  This is to offset partly some of the competitive advantages they enjoy over shopkeepers and to cover the cost of administering the Bill.  We have no reliable figures about the number of casual traders but our guess is that there are about 600.  In the 1971 census about 1,000 people described themselves as outdoor traders. This included news vendors, pedlars and some classes of hawkers who would not be casual traders.  While there may be some &ldquo;chain store merchants&rdquo;, our impression is that most outdoor traders could not be so classified.  The ideal fees would probably be related to the volume of trade or profits.  However, even the Revenue Commissioners, who have wider powers and resources than would be appropriate in this case, cannot always be satisfied with the trading figures returned by even the largest and most sophisticated businesses.  A fee in excess of £100 would be an intolerable burden on many itinerant traders and people who have no other means of livelihood.  When a local authority designates a casual trading area, a trader will have to pay £20 per year to trade in that area.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a local authority from charging something extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a local authority provides a roof-market place, a paved-market place, water, toilet facilities, weighing machines or some other facilities or amenities there is nothing to prevent the local authorities charging a reasonable rent to cover the overheads or cost of maintenance.  The Minister has power to vary these either generally or in respect of specified classes of traders.  When we have better information <Col N="846" /> about the number of traders and some means of identifying the classes of trader who should pay more or less than the £100 per annum the Minister has the power to vary them.  As I said earlier when the Bill comes into operation that will be regulated in a way that we can take a closer look at the whole scene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that but it is no harm to mention that if the intentions, as outlined in this Bill, are operated I can see a situation arising in future years where local authorities will provide casual trading areas with plenty of suitable facilities, sewerage facilities or even public lighting.  That is the desirable end result we want to see.  I could not agree with the Minister that it is unlikely in that instance that either supermarkets or large companies would not consider attempting going into such casual trading areas.  I imagine they would. I was anxious to prevent a situation arising where one casual trading blanket licence would cover the whole country for £100 while the small casual traders have still to pay the same amount.  I accept what the Minister has said: that the matter can be kept under consideration and that local authorities have a discretion to apply additional fees if they so wish.  A close eye should be kept on this because if the end result is casual trading areas with good facilities a lot of large companies will move into those areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A person engaging in casual trading shall display on his person an identification to the effect that he is engaged in such trade.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to an issue which was debated very keenly in the Dáil.  Very strong views were put forward by Deputy Enright, representing our <Col N="847" /> party, regarding what in his judgment was the desirability of the traders being obliged under this section to have personal and visible identification.  He mentioned experiences he had in other countries in casual trading areas where, apparently, it was always the case that in addition to a permit being visible on the stalls those operating the stalls and involved in this trade also carried identification.  I support his views with some conviction.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the Dáil the Minister made the point when defending the Bill that this did not happen in shops or supermarkets around the country so why should it apply to casual traders?  I do not think there is any comparison.  A shop is a fixture but we are talking about the movement of people in casual trading. While the permit may be displayed on the stall there are problems relating to people because it is possible a different person may be on the stall to the person named on the licence.  That person may be a fly-by-night.  The carrying of such a badge would be in the interest of the serious traders involved in casual trading and would, effectively, be a protection for them against abuses that might occur in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to require a person to display on his person some sort of sign to convey that he was engaged in casual trading.  We do not see the point in this. Section 6 states that a casual trader shall display his licence or permit wherever is appropriate and the licence or permit will contain the trader's name and postal address.  We made inquiries and we were told that all itinerants have postal addresses for social welfare and other purposes.  I am giving instructions that save in the most exceptional circumstances a licence is not to be handed out to an applicant but will be posted to whatever address he gives.  It will be recommended that the local authority will act in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that this will not guarantee that the trader will always be available at that address but one way of identifying <Col N="848" /> him at the moment is by having the licence displayed.  We know that some of those people are constantly changing their addresses but we are going as far as we can to try to identify the trader so that the general public will have some postal address.  They will have some way of tracking down these people if it is necessary.  We believe that having the licence displayed will help to protect the consumer.  We would be going too far if we were to accept the amendment put down by Senator Staunton.  We would be discriminating against those people as against what the ordinary trader is expected to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's case.  I do not think it is valid to say that there is a comparison between the casual trading position and the established traders in properties in towns, villages and cities.  It is because of the nature of casual trading that the Bill was introduced.  One might say it is discriminatory against shopkeepers up and down the country or against casual traders to bring it in but it is to protect the public because of the unusual nature of casual trading. It is because of that that certain measures are being taken that do not affect the shopkeeping community as such.  It is not acceptable to say that it would be discriminatory against casual traders because it is not being done against the shopkeeper. I do not think there is any validity in that particular argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as security of the public is concerned, I do not feel there is adequate protection with the licence displayed on the stall.  As was pointed out many of the people involved in this area are, in a sense, of no fixed abode.  They may have an address for social welfare purposes but there is a lot of movement of people and those licences may be abused.  For example, whilst the Minister or a local authority might issue a permit or licence for those people to trade, that licence can be abused.  A licence may be displayed on a stall which may not belong to the person who is trading under it.  If the person in question does not have identification the public is not protected.  If the owner of the permit is going loosely to allow somebody <Col N="849" /> else to use the licence or if it is stolen what protection has the public that the person operating the stall has been granted the licence by the Minister?  In the circumstances it would be reasonable to seek that this amendment be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We have power under the Bill to control the type of operation those people carry out.  If we find any irregularities we can revoke the licence.  We have a great deal of authority in the Bill to take the necessary steps to guarantee the consumer against what Senator Staunton has been talking about. On the question of identity, I think that it would be necessary to have a law covering the whole country where everybody would be asked to carry some form of identification.  I would not like to see control to that extent.  I am not so sure that constitutionally we could introduce the measure that Senator Staunton is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection 5, page 11, line 33, to delete &ldquo;without a warrant&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on the production of a warrant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 11 (5) of the Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>if a person fails, refuses or neglects <Col N="850" /> to comply with a requirement of a member of the Garda Síochána under this section, the person may be arrested and any goods which he is selling or has in his possession for sale at the place where the member believed him to be engaged in casual trading and the receptacle, vehicle or stand on or in which the goods are and all utensils, boxes and other articles (including money) thereon and any draught animal attached thereto may be seized, detained and removed by the said or any other member of the Garda Síochána without a warrant.</P>
    <P>The amendment which we have introduced here seeks to delete the last three words of that subsection, namely the words &ldquo;without a warrant&rdquo; and to substitute the three words with the following words &ldquo;on the production of a warrant&rdquo;. In simple terms this means that we take the view that the authority to seize, detain or remove matters or goods by a member of the Garda is very strong, and in cases where a person fails, refuses or neglects to comply with the requirement of the member of the Garda under this section the Garda may act arbitrarily without a warrant.  I have not got a legal background but my understanding of the legal process is that authority to arrest without a warrant can apply in very serious cases.  This matter under this subsection would not seem to be in that area.  I am informed that the public will be much better served in this instance if the authority to arrest given on a warrant from a peace commissioner or a justice, which would be much more normal in relatively minor matters like this, rather than be the power to arrest without warrant which could be abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In this we are giving the Garda powers similar to what they enjoy under the Street-Trading Act, 1926, powers to arrest without warrant in certain circumstances and powers to seize and detain vehicles and goods used by people contravening the Act.  The Street-Trading Act applies to Dublin and 26 other urban areas that have adopted it but the Bill will extend the powers of <Col N="851" /> arrest and seizure to the whole State.  The Garda asked for these powers and the local authorities who made submissions to the Restrictive Practices Commission urged the Garda that they should be involved.  I am reasonably satisfied that these powers are needed in certain circumstances.  For example, if a casual trader or a group of them and their customers are creating a traffic hazard that will have to be dealt with immediately. Another case could arise where the owners of vehicles and other goods were not immediately identifiable, and arrest or seizure would solve this problem.  We think that it is absolutely necessary to give these powers to the Garda.  For that reason we cannot accept the amendment that Senator Staunton has put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point the Minister made, if traffic hazards are being created or there are disturbances, for example, in the squares or streets of our towns, it seems that the Garda have power to act there under Acts other than the Casual Trading Act and that the passing of the Casual Trading Act is not necessary to give the Garda authority in that area.  Do I understand the Minister to say on this issue of arrest without a warrant this Bill is effectively extending the power that up to now had obtained only in certain urban areas in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>This then is effectively a new measure to give the Garda power which until now they have not had.  That the Garda seek this power does not necessarily mean that it is in the national interest that they should have it.  There is a strong view that in this relatively minor area this power of arrest without warrant is simply too strong a power.  They have <Col N="852" /> not had this power up to now and there has not been any significant reason that at this stage they should be granted these powers which some would think as excessive in this relatively minor area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This authority is enjoyed already by the Garda in certain areas and the Act will entitle them to the use of this authority in the rest of the State.  We suggest that it is reasonable and it will help the general public, and it will help us in the implementation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems we have stalemate here because I cannot really accept the Minister's argument that this increased power given to the Garda to arrest and act in this area without warrant in relatively minor cases is desirable.  The power the Garda have had in this area up to now, that is, authority to arrest with a warrant from a peace commissioner or justice, is adequate.  Under other sections relating to traffic, disturbances and so on they have certain existing powers.  This additional power without warrant is unwarranted.  I did not intend to use a pun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will accept that there would be times when it would be necessary for the Garda to act very quickly and take immediate action. Having to go and do the roundabouts of getting a warrant might mean that you would be tying the hands of the Garda and leaving them in a position where they would not be able to take the necessary action.  This power, I imagine, would only be used in extreme circumstances.  We feel that it is necessary.</P>

      <P>Would Senator Staunton not agree that, if the powers exist in relation to some areas, there should not be an objection to extending them to those areas to which they do not apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply because these powers have existed in certain urban areas in the country does not necessarily imply that it is a good thing.  One might argue the reverse, that when they do not <Col N="853" /> apply in other parts of the country, why impose them in certain urban areas?  That is a two-way argument.  This subsection gives individual members of the Garda Síochána very strong powers which would normally, under law, apply in cases where we are talking about much more heinous offences than these involved here.</P>
      <P>Talking in terms of protection of the public, there is also the protection of the trading public involved in this instance. It means that in certain instances this subsection could be abused and a casual trader might, for the wrong reasons, fall foul of an individual officer of the law.  It is for reasons such as this that, legally, apparently this whole question of a warrant being necessary before a certain action is taken is there to protect the public and the casual traders in this particular instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking yesterday evening about land policy and the White Paper.  I said that the policy on land restricted farmers' second sons and daughters, members of the veterinary profession and people who have been traditionally part and parcel of the land scene in this country and people who have always enjoyed the use of certain acreages of land.  I think that the new restrictions contained in the Land Bill will certainly cause a certain amount of hardship.  Also, of course, it affects the three F's, the freedom of people either to sell or buy land.  We do not need restrictions of this kind at the present time. There are many more urgent and pressing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking my own constituency, if you look at the Castlecomer plateau, which is roughly the area from Castlecomer in Kilkenny up almost to the town of Athy and over to Carlow, you will find a very strong loam there &mdash; difficult, heavy soil. <Col N="855" /> This soil, according to a land soil survey carried out by An Foras Talúntais some years ago, is identical in all respects to the soil found in County Leitrim.  It is quite evident that the farmers in that particular area of Laois suffer the very same disadvantages as their counterparts in County Leitrim, but the great exception is that they do not get the benefit of the EEC Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</P>
    <P>Similarly, on the west side of my constituency in County Offaly, the farmers on the west bank of the river Shannon benefit.  When you talk about the west bank you think about the Middle East, but there is a west bank to the River Shannon.  The water floods to the same depth on the east bank for five months of the year and yet only the people in Galway have the advantage of the EEC Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  They have the advantage of significantly higher rates of grants.  It is downright unjust that the farmers in my constituency in County Offaly are not treated in the same way and that their disadvantage is not recognised as it is on the other side of the river. It is time that this should be rectified. Again, I am not blaming the present Government because during the term of the last Government I made on a number of occasions the very same case.  Unfortunately, it fell on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>Now that farming is in a more precarious and difficult situation, I would ask the Government, in their introduction of a policy which is badly needed, to have a sympathetic look at the problems and at the operation of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  As a matter of fact, in the review of the Government's White Paper on land policy the only point that has not clearly emerged in the national newspapers is the fact that this land policy proposes a 50 and 60 per cent surcharge or new tax on certain categories of people who traditionally were in the market place to buy land.  In addition, it introduces a new land tax of £5 for poor law valuation.  Having regard to the present state of agricultural incomes we should object to this.  My own belief is that the farming community is incapable of absorbing more taxes at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> It is true to say as we move towards Christmas and come to the close of this year that very many people will be glad to see the end of 1980.  I believe that this has been a disastrous year for very many people.  In January of 1980 there were 86,200 people registered unemployed, in February the figure rose to 86,900, in March to 88,200, in April the figure of unemployed rose to 90,600, in May to 94,300, in June it rose to 99,600, in July we had 103,400 unemployed, in August 107,000, in September 110,000, in October 115,000 and now the figure is in the region of 120,000 or 125,000.  This affects every part of the country.  I think it is going to take a united effort on the part of all sectors of the community to reverse that trend.</P>
    <P>For some inexplicable reason, at least to me, it seems that people who are unemployed, or too many of the people who are unemployed, are quite complacent about it.  The loss of job opportunities is not looked upon with the same fear it evoked some years ago.  It is not uncommon to meet people who are distracted by the prospect of either redundancy payments or pay-related benefit and in the short term they do not object to the loss of their jobs.  This is very short-sighted and it is a point that has to be corrected. The country cannot continue in the present trend where unemployment figures are rising rapidly.  It is not just affecting any one particular sector of the community.  There are all kinds of industries and job opportunities involved.  In Laois and Offaly we have somewhere between a 7 per cent and 11 per cent industrial labour force &mdash; a very low rate &mdash; but seven or eight places of work or factories have closed in the past six months.  This is most distressing.  The number of opportunities for the school leavers is indeed again a very severe problem.</P>
    <P>Looking at the economy as we move towards Christmas we have this spectre of unemployment, we have severe difficulty in finding jobs for school leavers and we have high prices.  We recall the many promises but we are still left with prices that are rising.  There is also the major problem of interest rates.  Many <Col N="857" /> people will say we should be proposing solutions.  Our party have looked at the problem and we have advocated that the Government should embark on a short-term policy for agriculture which was enunciated by the leader of the party last week.  It called for the abolition and refund of the resources tax, the repeal of the bovine diseases levy, the abolition of rates on agricultural land, the introduction of capital allowances for breeding stock, an interest subsidy for farmers and for the reduction of stamp duty on the transfer of agricultural property to young farmers.  We believe that that package, in the short-term, will go a long way towards alleviating some of the stress, strain and hardship that the present economic difficulties are creating for the rural community.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of very clear and concise policies the country is just barely ticking over.  Last night Senator McGuinness spoke about apathy, that young people are wondering whether studying for exams is worth while when there are not sufficient job opportunities for them.  Politicians, and indeed the Government, must clearly indicate the way.  There has to be a solution to the economic problems but it can only be brought about by clear, determined and brave measures by the Government.  The Government are elected to rule and to govern the country. Nobody can deny that they certainly have a mandate, if you are to count the number of seats in the Dáil and yet we have not got the policies.  The policy document, the manifesto on which the Government got their mandate has, I suppose, been shelved.  At least the promises have not been kept.  We need policies which take into account the present situation, which clearly recognise the problems of the eighties and which will enthuse a young population.  A large percentage of the population will be in the younger age group.  They will have new priorities of their own and they will be looking at things from a different perspective. Therefore, there must be a reordering of the priorities of the Government and this must reflect the views and the aspirations of the younger people in the community. I ask the Government, starting in the <Col N="858" /> New Year, to give priority to a set of proposals that acknowledge, first of all, the grave difficulties that people find themselves in &mdash; which I hope are in the short-term &mdash; and secondly, which will give leadership to the entire population, whether they are in the private sector or in the public sector.  They should encourage people to put their backs willingly into the task of getting the country moving, so that we can sustain, with a reasonable amount of comfort, our increasing population and that the infrastructures necessary to bring about that kind of Ireland will be provided without gimmicks and without the present showmanship.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no problem in getting one of the 30 Ministers to open a new factory or a new place of work &mdash; I know that there were not many &mdash; over the last number of months.  It is more difficult to get a Minister or a Minister of State to meet a deputation from an industry or work place that is under severe difficulties.  This is something that should be rectified.  Instead of celebrations, the Government should take on the heavy task of supporting the work places that are in difficulties.</P>

      <P>This debate traditionally gives us an opportunity to range very widely over the whole political and economic scene.  There are so many things that could be discussed.  It is very difficult to make a choice so as to confine one's contribution within limited time, especially mid-day on the last day of the sittings in the week before Christmas.  One is very conscious that, possibly, at this stage of this debate, the only person not bored by the contribution is the speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing that in mind, I will be brief.  What depresses me most on the present political scene is the failure of the public to realise the dire economic straits of the country.  This failure is due to the deliberate Government policy of masking the truth from the people.  That is an understandable political stand but I suggest <Col N="859" /> that it is not a responsible political attitude for the Government to take.</P>
      <P>The country can only come out of its economic difficulties with the full co-operation of all the people and that full co-operation can only be forthcoming when the people are really aware and, indeed, painfully aware of the necessity to give that co-operation.  I do not think that they are so aware, and that is a deliberate tactic on the part of the Government.  The present economic difficulties are constantly being played down. No later than yesterday in the Dáil, the Taoiseach, in opening the debate on the Adjournment of the House, made a speech that was &mdash; one might nearly say &mdash; optimistic, with regard to the present state of the economy and its prospects for next year.  He is the only economic commentator who is optimistic in that regard. His colleagues in this House who have spoken have pursued much the same line of looking for rays of sunshine, or even of less than dark sky, grey sky, in the economic scene and presenting that in the general nature of the economic position.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, all the indications are that the economy is in a severely depressed state.  The balance of payments is seriously wrong.  Inflation continues to run at a rate that will put our competitiveness into serious jeopardy.  The rate of investment has fallen, without any sign of an upturn, though the Taoiseach, in his speech, said that the economic common sense of the Government &mdash; and it took a nerve to say that in the present time &mdash; enables our economy to maintain levels of investment which are among the highest in the Community and the OECD area.  He was shy of giving the figures, and I do not know what they are.  I understood, however, that the rate of investment generally in the western world has not been proceeding at anything like a satisfactory rate and that the present lack of investment will prolong the present recession beyond 1981 and into 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued in somewhat contradictory terms later in his speech. In speaking of the growth in unemployment which he was constrained to <Col N="860" /> describe as &ldquo;a sharp rise&rdquo;, he said that this is a symptom of the lack of sufficient investment in the past to generate the level of jobs necessary.  That was coming nearer the mark, because one of the depressing indicators in the present economic scene is the lack of investment, the unwillingness of people to invest and unless people invest, the source for our future growth is missing.  It is understandable that people do not want to commit funds, possibly borrowed funds, to a new plant, a refurbished plant or buildings, when there is no clear indication that they will get a return on this investment.  There is a vicious circle of lack of confidence, lack of investment, and this will maintain the economic recession for longer than is possibly thought at the moment.  That brings with it the hardship of increasing unemployment which, in turn, can bring with it dangers of social unrest though that danger is, to some extent, obviated by the pay-related system of social benefit.  That system has been criticised as being, to some extent, a disincentive to harder work, an incentive to milk the system and, undoubtedly, there are some unscrupulous people who will take advantage of a generous social welfare regime and use it dishonestly.  On the other hand, a society that should have the proper measure of compassion for those out of work has a duty to cushion those people against the rigours of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The principle of providing proper benefits for unemployed people cannot be quibbled with.  It is very important in this day and age, the age of the agitator, in so far as generous levels of benefit can purchase social peace.  I take some pride in the fact that the Government of which I was a member introduced the principle of pay-related social benefits.  Socially it was a good thing.  It is a pity that some people abuse the system but it would be wrong to condemn it because a minority abuse it.  The system can only continue to act in case of the unemployed when the Exchequer is in a position to fuel it and the Exchequer can only finance it when it, in turn, can get contributions from the part of the community gainfully employed.  All the signs are that the <Col N="861" /> downturn in economic level will leave the Exchequer finances in a perilous condition next year.</P>
    <P>One very important economic indicator is the level of cement sales.  I do not know the up-to-date figures but in the NESC report it was disclosed that the level of cement sales was down 15.4 per cent between the last quarter of 1979 and the first quarter of 1980.  I believe that trend of dropping cement sales is continuing.  This again shows a downturn of basic infrastructural activity which is a very bad omen indeed.  Building output in 1980 is down 2.5 per cent on 1979.  This is beginning to have effect in areas of expenditure where people have high expectations.</P>
    <P>The education expenditure this year is down substantially on last year.  Capital expenditure on health is down 15.4 per cent this year on last year.  I believe next year we will see a continuation of this downward trend in social spending because the country cannot afford it.  The expectation for a high level of spending in these areas is still there.  That expectation is there because the Government have failed to make the people aware of what is the true state of the country's economy.  I blame the Government for this because they have a duty not to hold on to office by any means.  They are entitled to be political but not at the expense of concealing the whole truth from the people.  They cannot rectify the country's economy without the full co-operation of the people and they cannot expect to get that if they lead the people to live in a fool's paradise, lead them to believe that everything would be all right if the Minister for Finance, whoever he might be, was not so mean and if the Government were not so obdurate in refusing to spend what they secretly have.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I believe the serious times will continue is because of the unusually depressed state of agriculture. Many economic commentators do not give sufficient importance to the place of agriculture in the Irish economy.  The money earned by Irish farmers, which will be spent by them finds its way into every corner of the country.  Every town, village and crossroads in Ireland benefits <Col N="862" /> from agricultural money and from farmers spending.  It is defused right through the economy in a way that no other sector's earnings can be.  Consequently its accelerated effect on the economy is that much greater because it fuels the purchasing power of the shopkeeper, increases the demand on the wholesaler and increases what the manufacturer has to manufacture to meet that demand.  At the moment farmers do not have money to spend.  That will lead to an even worse position next year because the forecasts are that the agricultural economy will not take an upturn next year.</P>
    <P>A frightening statistic, and one which has not got the attention that it deserves, is that cow numbers are now at their lowest level since 1972.  We breed cattle from them and it is our exports of cattle and meat that contribute so much to our economic health.  They contribute to the well-being of farmers.  Their purchasing power is spread throughout the community.  Even more significantly, cattle form such a significant part in our exports that any serious downturn in cattle, as a percentage of our exports, will put our balance of payments position into a very difficult state next year.  That will impose economic restraints on growth.  I do not know how we will come out of that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said there will have to be a major programme of investment.  I do not know where he will get the money because there does not seem to be any will to get it from the only place it can be taken with economic sense at the moment, from within the economy.  That would be politically painful, but having regard to the life of this present Oireachtas and how near an election must be, obviously the Government, whose one ambition is to remain in power, will not do anything that may be politically painful even though all the indicators are that it is the only economic way forward for us.  It seems there will be more borrowing.  I suppose the sleight-of-hand whereby borrowing abroad will contribute to our reserves and give them an unreal but more healthy appearance may be the tactic.  If that money is to be borrowed and invested and this investment creates more demand, and that demand <Col N="863" /> has to be satisfied by increased imports, what way will the balance of payments be next year, bearing in mind that one critical part of our exports, cattle, will not be there in the same value as in the previous year?  Will we find ourselves locked into a vicious circle?  I fear that we will.</P>
    <P>I blame the Government for not making the facts abundantly clear.  I can understand why the Government do not want to do that at this time but there are other voices in the community that have been remarkably silent about our economic plight.  I recall the last recession in 1974-75, a short lived recession, and a NESC report.  The NESC issued another report on the present state of the economy, a most gloomy report, advocating belt tightening.  There is a great contrast between that report and the report which they issued in late 1974 in which they urged Government spending and indicated that borrowing externally was feasible and was the proper thing to do.  The NESC at the moment and the ERSI are about the only two bodies which made efforts to draw attention seriously to the plight of the economy.</P>
    <P>I recall during the last recession that captains of industry, princes of commerce and mandarins of the banks, every time there was a dinner or cocktail party in a chamber of commerce, were making speeches about the mal-government of the country and the dire state of the economy.  I find it puzzling that these people are not now fulfilling their civic duty of drawing attention to the state of affairs in this country, the failure of the Government to run the economy in a proper way and why they are not trying to alert the people to the serious state of the economy.  Perhaps they got tired or perhaps there are other reasons.  Perhaps there are political reasons influencing them, also.  Of course, the Government are not united.  I think that this divisiveness and lack of unity in the Government must have the effect of enervating the will of the Government to do what has to be done.</P>
    <P>We all know that there was a <i>coup</i> this time last year when the present Taoiseach acceded to office.  Indeed, it amazes me <Col N="864" /> why the Fianna Fál Members of this House do not have votes in elections within their parliamentary party.  Are they not full members of the parliamentary party?  I venture to suggest that if they had had votes at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Deputy Brugha taken the shilling too?  There is no doubt that the disunity within the Government is notorious and it must be enervating on the will of the Government to tackle the problems that are here.  The present incumbent in the office of Taoiseach wants to hold on to that office and will not do anything that would be in any way politically inappropriate no matter how economically desirable it might be.  He makes no secret of his contempt for some of his colleagues in the Government. There are others in the Government who make no secret of their intense dislike for him and who are prepared to articulate this dislike.  That is the state of the administration in charge of the country at this critical time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people, for their own political reasons &mdash; the Taoiseach and his followers want to maintain office &mdash; do not want to be the ones to lose.  They will not reveal the true facts to the country.  Those who uphold the Taoiseach and who in their hearts would dearly love to see him lose the next election are afraid to strike, and consequently they find themselves locked in a hypocritical position in which they prefer to be bondsmen in Government rather than be honourable in Opposition: they prefer to serve with some- <Col N="865" /> body whom they not merely dislike but detest.</P>
    <P>That is the personality of the present Government; full of divisions, full of enmities, full of dislikes.  They are the Government who are charged with running this country at this time of economic crisis.  It is no wonder that the facts are being concealed from the people for differing reasons on different facts.</P>
    <P>I hope that the election on the horizon will be brought forward as soon as possible.  Something has to be changed in this country: something has to be done to get across to the people the serious state to which their affairs have been let drift. There are people in the Government who would dearly love to see an election in the dear hope that they would lose it, because at this stage it is the only way in which they can get rid of their Taoiseach. But they are not prepared to make that move because they are prepared to continue in a false position in Government rather than adopt an honourable position in Opposition.  That is their choice but it devalues them personally.</P>
    <P>Possibly I am not being fair to them. Maybe they have other tactics pending. We will have to wait and see.</P>

      <P>That is something we are waiting to see.  One reason why the voters like Fianna Fáil is that Fianna Fáil have bribed them over the years with goodies and as a result, we are in the economic difficulty we are now in.  Unemployment is rising, our inflation is high, our exports are dropping, many of our farmers are in poverty as a result of Fianna Fáil policy which obviously commends itself to Senator Dowling.  If the result of the policy is to buy power, so be it.  No other end matters.  That is the ethos of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very thorough debate on the Bill, but there are a few points I should like to make.  Opening the debate, the Minister said he looked forward to a constructive debate.  I am sure he must be very disappointed with some of the contributions from the <Col N="866" /> Opposition who have painted a picture of gloom and doom so far.  Senator Cooney must not think very much of the Irish electorate when he said they were capable of being bribed by Fianna Fáil.  That is a very sad reflection on the people who go out to vote in general elections.</P>
      <P>I am very happy that yesterday the Minister for Education published his White Paper on the future development of education in Ireland.  Unfortunately, during the years of the Coalition, it was not possible to produce a paper of this nature because we did not have census figures on which we could decide, or know, the number of people involved in the different sectors of education in the future.  I am happy that the Government have now put forward their ideas in a constructive way on how they foresee Irish education will develop in the next decade.  I am very pleased, at a time when our economy is changing and developing, that we are putting an emphasis, in our educational system, on the technological area, that preference will be given to students who want to pursue courses in any of the technological skills.  This is something that is necessary if our young people are to have secure futures and some chance of employment, because the old traditional areas of employment are changing.  We are a new and developing economy and we must be able to take our place among the other economies of the world.  We cannot do that unless our educational system provides us with the type of people who have the necessary skills and training to take up the jobs.</P>
      <P>This has been all part and parcel of Fianna Fáil policies since the sixties when the late Donogh O'Malley introduced free post-primary education.  We have continued along these lines to the development of the regional technical colleges. Yesterday the Minister announced his hopes that he will be able to build four more of these colleges in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this is part and parcel of our desire to make sure that we achieve the desired goal of the Fianna Fáil Party, that of full employment.  Unfortunately in the past year, due to the world recession and the increases in the price of oil, the unemployment figures have not been as good <Col N="867" /> as we might have wished.  We must realise that we now have a very fast growing population.  Many of the people who in the past took to the ships and the aeroplanes to go abroad to find their future in foreign shores are now staying at home looking for jobs.  They are presenting us with many new social and economic demands, problems we did not have in the past.  This means that we must look to new ways to provide them with some chance of employment and a secure future in the next decade.</P>
    <P>Not only must we look at new ways of developing our economy but the Government and all political parties must look at the many social problems that are currently confronting us.</P>
    <P>In particular, in the next decade, alcoholism, now of major proportions, must be tackled seriously, whichever party are in Government.</P>
    <P>Allied to this is the very serious problem of marital breakdown.  Marriages are breaking down at a very fast rate, particularly among young people.  This is putting tremendous pressure on local authorities to provide housing for deserted wives, separated wives, unmarried mothers and so on.  Through the educational system, the State, not just the Church, has a role to play in making sure that our young people are adequately prepared for the equal partnership that marriage should be.  We must make sure that the most important decision that any two young people make in their lives, that of deciding upon their marriage partner, is made only after getting all the expert professional advice that should be available to them so that when they get married and come up against the many problems they will obviously come up against &mdash; because marriage is, after all, essentially about human relationships and they will obviously come up against many problems &mdash; they will have open to them, through the State, the professional counselling that should be there to help them in difficult situations.  Unfortunately, in the past that role has been left to the Church.  It is not good enough in the Ireland of today, with such a large young population, to leave the <Col N="868" /> Church to look after this very important area; it is the responsibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>Allied to this is the whole role of women in our society.  I hope that many of the areas of employment, which in the past have been closed to women due to financial restraints, will now be open to them.  I hope many of our young girls will pursue courses in mathematics and science in our schools and go on to develop these and enter the technological area which they have been reluctant to do in the past.  It is the duty of the people involved in education to encourage young women to think in different ways about their future.  In the past a girl's future on leaving school was seen in terms of a very short period in employment and then to take on the responsibilities of marriage and parenthood.  It is no longer necessary for a woman who gets married to give up her job.  Thankfully, she can combine a very successful career with that of being wife and mother.  In fact, the two can benefit as a result.  Women must take a more active role in the fields that have been traditionally closed to them.  Women have been very reluctant to take any role in any of the decision making bodies of our country.  Many people have criticised this.  But if the Government do not provide the facilities like <i>crèches</i> and so on so that married women can have their children looked after if they go out to work, women are not going to make the contribution they are capable of making to our society.</P>
    <P>There is legislation on the Statute Book that has been criticised by many men and women involved in social affairs.  That is the legislation known as the tort of criminal conversation.  In 1980 this is a degrading piece of legislation to have on the Statute Book.  It is an insult to Irish women and a stigma on them.  It implies that they are second-class citizens and merely the property of their husbands.</P>

      <P>I will end by saying that I hope that, in all aspects, the Government will continue to pursue the policies they have pursued in the past to make sure that men and women have equal status in our society, that they are capable of taking their place in our economy and of giving to Ireland the type of imput that will be necessary if we are to continue to grow as a small open economy in a very difficult world that is suffering from recession.  We must tackle not only ecomomic problems &mdash; we most provide jobs. In addition, we must tackle the very serious social problems that are now confronting our new young population.  If we do not, the problems that we will be discussing in the Seanad in 1990 will be of gigantic proportions and we may not be able to solve them.  Unless we set the plans forth now to make sure that they do not, the problems may grow to such a serious extent that we will not be capable of tackling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor Doolan Professor Doolan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Doolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá sé de pribhléid agam, mar Bhall nua, labhairt sa Teach seo don chéad uair.  Tá ceithre pointí agam le lua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I would like to refer to the political matter of greatest priority in the opinion of myself, my party and the Members of this House.  That is peace and reconciliation, and looking towards new structures of this island which may give expression to the unity of our island <Col N="870" /> and the bringing together of our people. Initiative lies with and has been taken by our Government.  In many ways they have more freedom to act than other parties in relation to this particular problem.  In the first instance, such initiatives taken by our Government in Dublin, are with the other sovereign Government in the situation, the British Government. The record shows that, increasingly over the last decade, the Government of Ireland has been recognised as having a role to play in the resolution of this problem. Indeed, last week this proper approach to the problem has been taken one important step further.</P>
    <P>At the same time we must not neglect the development of contacts at every possible level with the North, in the political area, in the economic and social areas, in the cultural, educational and sporting areas.  Such contacts have been inadequate in the past.  All of us must endeavour to strengthen them with a view to the resolution of this first and most important national problem which is the concern of the Oireachtas.  Over a year ago I derived great personal satisfaction and pleasure from my own work with North-South Committee of the then Taoiseach in examining the problem and in making contact at many levels with the North.  We must take every opportunity to build those bridges.  On this, the first opportunity I have taken to speak in the Seanad, I want to stress the primacy of this matter and my personal dedication to so all I can to contribute to its resolution.</P>
    <P>As to the news of the termination of the hunger strike, we can only express profound thankfulness that this dark cloud which hung over the North and over this island has passed.  One prays that it has passed for good.  One adds a prayer too that all the men of violence will permit this country constitutionally to advance to a solution to this problem as we look towards the new year.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to refer to economic matters.  I would like to link the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; with this.  The whole purpose <Col N="871" /> of economic policy is to achieve social betterment for all our citizens. Countries throughout the world are going through a serious recession at present, triggered off by one factor more than any other: the oil crisis.  Even though we in Ireland are suffering economically from this, I believe that ours is a country of great potential in different economic sectors.  It is certainly true in the field of agriculture which is better organised than it has ever been, notwithstanding current depressions in price, and I believe it is poised to take advantage of improvements that will come.  The agricultural sector has within it the seeds of great growth and perhaps that is proportionately more so in the west than in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>In the field of industry we have had a remarkable record of growth in output and employment in recent years.  It can truly be said that as far as Ireland is concerned, in the economic and particularly in the industrial sphere, small is beautiful.  It means that we can increase our output and gain markets for it internationally without disturbing in almost any way the international price system for those products.  Perhaps our record, notwithstanding the recession, is proof of our capacity to advance industrially. There is further room for development in the field of agricultural processing.  We have a great foothold, and in some ways lead Europe, in certain spheres such as electronics.  We have had significant developments in the field of pharmaceutical products, as also in the medical and para-medical fields.  The interest that has already been taken in the field of biotechnology will give us, first of all, a toehold and then a proper footing in this new area of industrial development which will be one of the important industrial sectors of the eighties and nineties.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this potential that one sees and our capacity to meet it confidently, the state of our economy at present is, for reasons external and other, not as we would like to see it.  We have been living beyond our means; we are suffering high inflation; we have levels of unemployment that we wish to reduce.  In order <Col N="872" /> to bring this about we may have to tighten our belts.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of inflation is concerned, we may need to look more carefully at the operations of the Employer Labour Conference and the role therein of the public sector representatives.  A very high proportion of employees are in the public sector&mdash;I am one of them&mdash;and gain benefits of almost automatic application as a result of national wage rounds and also enjoy parity of pension rights which many in the private sector do not enjoy.  It may well be that one has to look again at the public employees during the negotiations with a view to mitigating, if one can, the rate of inflation we have experienced to the extent to which it has been fuelled from this source.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, referring to educational matters, it is true that a growing industrial economy needs more applied skills than we have provided so far.  I do not think we should or can take a narrow view of education.  I would propose a far broader approach to it.  Education is for life as well as employment.  Speaking as one who has spent almost half his life in business before going into academic life, I say firmly that a narrow view must not be taken of our educational system.  While developments in the technical and technological fields are desirable, necessary and to be encouraged, we must not lose sight of education for the whole man or woman.  Regarding development in technological education, as someone from a university I assure this House that from my experience there is a willingness among my university colleagues to play their full part in meeting the nation's needs technologically and in every other way.  The publication of the White Paper yesterday gives us all an opportunity to look at this problem with a broad view, looking to the future and the needs of our country in the decades ahead.</P>
    <P>Fourthly and finally, I refer to international relations.  When that ringing phrase that with independence Ireland would proudly take her place among the nations of the earth, a new era arrived in the history of our country and we have an extremely good record in the role we <Col N="873" /> have played in different international organisations.  Our current membership of the Security Council bears witness not just to our capacity to win votes to secure such a seat but to the respect in which we are held internationally.  Those of you, like myself, who have been around the world know that the name of Ireland is held in respect all over the globe and this is something which permits us to play a meaningful and appropriate part in the community of nations to secure world peace and co-operation.  We are rightly preoccupied with the problems in our own island between North and South, but were we less preoccupied with them we might more clearly see the role that we could play in the international scene, first in Europe, where we are playing it very fully but in the world at large as well.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the underdeveloped part of the globe&mdash;the South as it may now be called&mdash;we have a role to play. The work that voluntary organisations have done has been admirable and is to be encouraged in every way.  So, too, is the work that is financed out of public funds, and I welcome the undertaking given by our Minister for Foreign Affairs that by the end of this decade of the eighties we will increase our contribution to attain the target of 0.7 per cent of 1 per cent of GNP which has been set as a target for contribution to the underdeveloped world from Government or public sources from the more developed countries, of which we are one.  I suggest to my fellow Senators that there be an all-party committee of these Houses on aid to the underdeveloped world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim) Thomas (Jnr.) McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill gives Senators an opportunity for a wide ranging discussion of Government expenditure and financial policies, and this year Senators have undoubtedly made full use of this opportunity.  The issues raised cover a very wide area and it would not be possible for me to deal adequately with them in my reply.  However, Senators can be assured that the points which they have <Col N="874" /> made will be brought to the attention of the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>Many Senators, including Senator Connaughton, Senator Whitaker and Senator FitzGerald, have raised the question of Government borrowing.</P>
      <P>First, I should set the record straight about the level of borrowing for current purposes in the early seventies for Senator FitzGerald.  The current deficit in 1972-73 was £9 million and in 1973-74 it was £10 million.  The first year in which a substantial current deficit was incurred was 1974 when in the nine-month period from March to December 1974 the current deficit was £92 million.  It rose to £259 million in 1975.</P>
      <P>As regards the level of Government borrowing at present, this Government's attitude has been clearly stated.  The present level of borrowing, particularly borrowing for current purposes, is too high and must be reduced.  The 1980 budget was designed to make a start towards this objective.  The actual budgetary developments which have emerged during the year diverge somewhat from what was envisaged at budget time and the level of Government borrowing will exceed the budget target.  There are a number of factors which have influenced this developments which could not have been accurately foreseen at budget time, particularly the extent of the global slowdown in activity, rising international unemployment and a set-back to confidence internationally.  Since we, in particular as an open energy-dependent economy, could not hope to insulate ourselves from the effects of international developments, the Government's aim was to minimise the damage.  We saw our main tasks in the economic area this year as being to preserve to the greatest extent possible the significant economic advances of recent years, and also to strengthen the productive capacity of the economy, so that it would better be able to take advantage of the renewal of worldwide economic growth which we believe will come during the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government could have chosen the course of pursuing inflexibly the budget objective of reducing the level of Exchequer borrowing in isolation from <Col N="875" /> the underlying economic situation.  We could have maintained severe restraints on public expenditure or increased taxation when the drift from the budget targets emerged.  But this would have added to the deflationary forces already at work in the economy.  The Government have to take an overall view and strike a balance between the various factors.  In the short-term, given the economic difficultties which we face and the greater room for manoeuvre which the improved balance of payments gives, the Government consider that the higher level of borrowing which is emerging is a more acceptable alternative.</P>
    <P>We have sought to give priority to capital investment, as evidenced by the recent announcement of additional capital expenditure of £97 million this year, but we recognise that this will continue to be possible only if we can reduce our borrowing to finance current expenditure.  The gap between current revenue and current expenditure is undoubtedly too high at present and it limits the Government's scope for engaging in productive capital investment.  There are no easy ways of narrowing this gap &mdash; it will require either curbing the growth of current expenditure or raising additional taxation, or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we must accept that we cannot continue to enjoy the rapidly increasing level of public services which we have experienced in recent years without paying for them through taxation.  If we do not accept this and continue to seek rapid increases, it will damage our potential for future growth, as the resources which should be channelled into productive investment will, instead, be diverted to paying for current services.</P>
    <P>I cannot anticipate what the Minister for Finance will do in his forthcoming budget.  He will weigh up all the issues, including the underlying needs of the Irish economy and the likely economic prospects, and make a judgment on the desirable level of Government borrowing for 1981.</P>
    <P>Some Senators implied that housing development has ground to a halt, which is completely untrue and incorrect.  In the <Col N="876" /> area of private housing, the success of various Government measures is reflected in the fact that the number of completions steadily increased from 18,215 in 1977 to 19,371 in 1978 and 20,330 in 1979 and indications are that completions may be even higher this year.  In contrast, completions fell under the previous Administration, that is the Coalition Government, from 19,510 in 1974 to 16,737 in 1976.  As to local authority housing completions in 1977, there were approximately 6,300 houses completed and the programme has been maintained at a steady annual level of approximately 6,000 to 6,200 local authority houses since then.  Thus, total house completions have increased from 24,548 in 1977 to 26,544 in 1979, and are likely to be even higher this year.</P>
    <P>As to local authority house purchase loans, in which Senator Connaughton showed particular interest, expenditure on these loans will have increased from approximately £17 million in 1977 to £65 million in 1980.  This involves a substantial increase in real terms, as Senators will see from the fact that while 4,800 loans were advanced in 1977 it is expected that over 7,000 loans will be paid out at the end of this year.  In addition, the loan and income limits were increased on three occasions in that period by a total of 166 per cent and 134 per cent, respectively.  By contrast, the loan and income limits remained static between September 1973 and July 1977 under the Coalition Government despite the fact that house prices and earnings more than doubled during this period.</P>
    <P>I would also remind Senators that under the present Government a temporary subsidy was introduced this year which enabled building societies to increase their investment rates and let mortgage rates stand at 14.15 per cent. With the general downward movement of interest rates, there is now no need for the subsidy.  Furthermore, the amount of personal interest, including house mortgage interest, qualifying for income tax relief has been increased from £2,000 to £4,800 for married couples and, of course, the increase in expenditure on housing grants has increased dramatically <Col N="877" /> since 1977, from about £4 million in 1977 to £27 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>Finally, as an indication of the enormous commitment of the Government to housing since 1977.  Senators might like to note that total public expenditure in relation to housing will have increased by 105 per cent since 1977 from approximately £130 million in 1977 to about £266 million in 1980.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Connaughton's point about the publication of planning papers, the Minister for Finance stated in the Dáil on 18 November &mdash; as reported at column 658 of the Official Report &mdash; the Government's intention to have an investment plan for the economy for 1981 ready to be published soon.  This investment plan will be followed by a paper dealing with economic development over the medium-term.  The Government's continued commitment to planning will be quite evident from these papers.  I would say, however, that, as regards planning papers in general, both the kind of papers that it would be useful to produce for planning purposes and when they should be published will be decided by the Government at the appropriate time.  There is nothing immutable about the previous time table of the cycle of Green and White Papers.</P>
    <P>Some Senators spoke adversely about the amount of money allocated for roads. In fact, however, expenditure on roads by this Government has increased substantially since 1977.  The total allocations granted by the Department of the Environment to local authorities increased from £31.6 million in 1977 to £58.5 million in 1980, and this represents an increase of 85 per cent over a three-year period.  The Government recognise the importance of an adequate road network as part of the State's infrastructure, and Senators can be assured that it is the Government's intention to provide resources to improve this vital national asset.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker suggested that there is a need to modernise the way in which the Government's finances are published in documents such as the Appropriation Accounts and the Finance Accounts.  I agree with the Senator that it can be <Col N="878" /> difficult for the public to follow the intricacies of the various areas of Government.  While there are no plans to change the present system, the Government finances could perhaps be made more accessible to the general public by issuing, in addition to the present documents, new publications which would convey information in a more simplified form. This is something which we will bear in mind.  Senator Connaughton, Senator McDonald and Senator Cooney remarked on the poor state of Irish agriculture at present and the need to help this sector.  The Government have announced an extensive series of measures to aid agriculture in recent months. These followed close and frequent consultation with the farm organisations. The Taoiseach has met the farming organisations six times this year.  The then Minister for Finance, in speaking on a motion in the Dáil on agriculture last week, gave details of all of these measures but there is no harm in listing them once again.</P>
    <P>The Government have announced the abolition of the resource tax with effect from 1981.  The second moiety of rates for farmers in the £40 to £60 PLV category has been waived, with the Exchequer making good the loss to local authorities.  In fact, the Government have instructed the local authorities that no farmer in temporary financial difficulties should be pressed for rates this year, and that interest should not be charged on outstanding amounts.</P>
    <P>The Government also authorised the ACC to borrow £50 million abroad for on-lending at low interest rates, at present 12½ per cent, with the Government covering the exchange risk.  Despite what Senator Connaughton said, the take up of these loans is most satisfactory.  Similar approval was given to the associated banks for an equivalent amount of borrowing &mdash; making £100 million in all.  In the case of existing borrowings, both the banks and the ACC, following discussions with the Government, have indicated their willingness to take a positive and constructive approach to the restructuring of loans where farmers are faced with serious repayment problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> A whole range of additional expenditure measures, totalling some £36 million were also announced.  These included an additional £23 million for capital grants under the farm modernisation scheme, bringing the total provided this year for the scheme to £59½ million.  Substantially increased grant rates under the disadvantaged areas scheme were also announced. On 1 August last increased rates of £22 and £18 were announced.  Some two months later these were increased by £10 each, bringing them to £32 and £28 respectively.  The extent of the increase can be gauged by the fact that the corresponding rates in 1979 were £17 and £13. The increased rates are expected to increase annual expenditure on the scheme by some £11.3 million.</P>
    <P>As a further incentive to increase the breeding herd a new beef suckler scheme has been introduced.  Under the terms of the scheme a grant of £13.18, financed by the EEC, will be paid on cows in beef suckler herds in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In addition, a further £12 will be paid out of national funds on each cow in a beef suckler herd at the two inspections under this year's scheme over and above the number at the time of the 1979-80 round test for TB.  Also, under next year's suckler scheme, a national grant will be paid on extra beef cows over the number at the inspections under this year's scheme.</P>
    <P>These measures represent a further significant encouragement to expand the suckler herd.  They represent a grant of £25.18 on each additional beef cow outside the disadvantaged areas and, with the increase in the rates of headage grants which I have previously mentioned will bring to as much as £57.18 the grant in the disadvantaged areas for each additional cow that also qualifies for these grants.</P>
    <P>During the past several months a number of other measures over and above those which I have already mentioned were also announced.  A sum of £1 million was made available to finance incentive payments to farmers for fertiliser usage and first-time silage making.  Exchequer grants were made available to maintain <Col N="880" /> the cost of warble fly dressing at the level applying in 1979.  The Mountain Lamb Extension Scheme was reintroduced and grant rates under the scheme were increased while the period of operation of the Lowland Hogget Ewe Scheme was extended to the end of the year.  State finance was made available for a new Agriculture Exports Co-Ordinating Group.  The annual grant to Macra na Feirme was increased substantially in the current year, with a commitment to provide further moneys in subsequent years, in order to enable Macra to organise and co-ordinate the establishment of local farm relief services on a group basis.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national measures which I have outlined, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, with the approval of the Government, has presented a package of further measures to the EEC, and these are being discussed at present.</P>
    <P>By the additional measures which the Government have introduced, the additional finance which they have made available to farmers, their continuing efforts to promote farmers' interests at EEC level and their commitment to maintain consultation with farmers' organisations on all aspects of agricultural policy on both the domestic and EEC planes, the Government have made crystal clear their view on the importance of getting agriculture moving again.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson and other Senators also questioned the Government's policy on combating poverty.  Fianna Fáil have a long tradition in providing for the least well-off members of our society and this commitment is reflected in the present Government's wide-ranging programme for increased investment in job opportunity together with specific welfare programmes on health, housing and social welfare which absorb a growing proportion of available resources.  The major improvements in recent years, particularly in the level of social welfare payments, are an earnest of the Government's commitment in this regard.  For example, the average level of welfare payments have increased by almost 5 per cent per annum in real terms since 1977. <Col N="881" /> This is far higher that the annual increase recorded in the 1973 to 1977 period.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to funds for school building.  The provision for capital expenditure on education in 1980, including Supplementary Estimates, is £59.5 million, the highest ever.  At primary and post-primary level contracts were placed or tenders invited during 1980 in 176 cases.  In the case of primary schools, the provision of £23.25 million is an increase of more than 36 per cent on the 1979 out turn of £17 million.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald seemed to imply that higher income groups could recoup the full cost of their medical expenses from the Revenue Commissioners.  This is not so.  Along with all other taxpayers, where their medical expenses exceed £50 for a single person and £100 for a family and where these expenses are not reimbursed by the VHI or otherwise, a tax allowance may be claimed for the excess. The amount that can be recovered depends on the taxpayers marginal tax rate, so the maximum amount that can be recovered from the Revenue Commissioners is 60 per cent of the excess over £50 or £100.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey spoke about accommodation problems for members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are all very conscious of these problems and an outline scheme has been drawn <Col N="882" /> up for the utilisation of the College of Art premises to provide additional accommodation.  The Oireachtas authorities have been asked to have the scheme considered by a committee comprising representatives of both Houses and the Office of Public Works.  Progress will of course depend on the speed with which the college vacate the premises but I am hopeful that part at least will be released in the near future.  This will enable some relief to be provided fairly soon and hopefully a solution to all the overcrowding in the longer term.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the problems raised and I should like to recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>
