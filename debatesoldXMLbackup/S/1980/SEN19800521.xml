      <P>On the Order of Business, I am disappointed that motion No. 22 is not being taken.  It appeared on the Order Paper for the last two sitting days and we gave way by request to permit legislation to be brought forward and concluded.  We understood it would be taken today and I would ask the Leader of the House to ensure that it will be taken next week.</P>

      <P>On an entirely different matter, I should like to ask how we can possibly discuss item No. 2 when we do not have the debate from last week available to us.  We spent the whole of last Wednesday discussing the Second Stage of the Prisons Bill.  I consider that the efficiency of this House is totally impaired by this extraordinary inefficiency. I do not know which Minister is responsible, I gather it is the Minister for Finance, but the printed debate should be available to us by the Monday after a debate.  This is ludicrous; I do not see how we can take item No. 2 today.  The situation is absolutely appalling.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Hussey raised this point and I would agree with her.  We spent many hours last Wednesday discussing the complex issues that arise out of this brief Bill.  I asked today in the General Office for a copy of the report of last week's debate and was told that it was not available.  I would ask that the Committee Stage of this Bill not be taken until the Official Report is available&mdash;at least for some hours.  I understand and I appreciate that there may be some urgency as far as the Government are concerned, but could we take the Bill tomorrow? Could the House sit tomorrow for the Committee Stage of the Prisons Bill?</P>

      <P>As the business has been ordered as I understand it, we have the Report Stage of a Bill which probably will not take very long.  The Bill has been very fully debated.  There have been a number of amendments and there is a further Government one arising out of discussion on Committee Stage.  The Bill is at the last stages of Report Stage. If that is the case and the Prisons Bill is ordered after that, we may not have an opportunity of looking at the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Hussey.  There should be a break in order to enable us to read the report of the Second Stage debate.  There were very <Col N="363" /> complex issues raised.  The Minister made a very long replying speech in the context of the Bill itself and I should like an opportunity of reading what the Minister said before we take the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a compromise and as the Leader of the House envisages that the Bill might not be taken until 6 o'clock and even if the Report Stage of the Sale of Goods Bill finishes before that, perhaps the House could adjourn until 6 o'clock so that the point raised by Senators Robinson and Hussey could be met.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator Cooney has said with regard to motion No. 22.  That was listed for last Wednesday and in order to facilitate the Minister for Justice we agreed that it be left over but I questioned the matter at the time and I thought the motion would be on the Order of Business for today.  I should like to know when it is likely to be taken.</P>
      <P>I think that motion No. 25 dealing with the proposed changes in school transport is a matter of great importance. It is a cause of great concern at the present time to parents and to principals of schools.  It is a motion that should be discussed before the end of this session because the changed system of transport will be in operation from September on.  I should like a promise from the Leader of the House that this motion will be taken before the end of this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that as far as the motions are concerned, unfortunately the Minister is not available today for No. 22 but it is proposed to take it next week.  In regard to the other motion that is mentioned, it would not be Fine Gael's turn again until the fourth next one so that unless we are sitting all through the summer I cannot hold out any possibility that it will reach Fine Gael's turn again during this session.  All I can say is that No. 22 will, I hope, be <Col N="364" /> taken next week and certainly if not next week the week after.</P>
      <P>As far as the business for this afternoon is concerned, the Prisons Bill must be taken this afternoon.  There is a time limit on it but I would not object if the House wished to alter the order and take No. 1 first, No. 3 second and No. 2 third but No. 2 to be taken not later than six o'clock.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday the Senator was prepared to take all Stages of this Bill at 7.55 p.m.  She had no report at that time so what is the reason for the change?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Robinson's suggestion that time be given because there were quite a number of questions that I asked on Second Stage of the Prisons Bill and I would certainly like to have the opportunity to look back on some of those before we come to Committee Stage of the Bill.  I also believe the Minister said on that occasion that he would reply to those points and I think it is best that in order to have a proper discussion we should at least ensure that the Bill be taken not before 6 p.m., given that the report is available to us, say, by 4 p.m. That <Col N="365" /> would give us just two hours to look at it.  That is an hour and twenty minutes away now.</P>

      <P>I should like to make the more general point that I can remember a number of occasions in this and in the other House when the record has been hard to obtain within what should be considered a normal lapse of time.  It seems to me that there are very many ways in which the servicing of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not serious and, in fact, is worse than being not serious.  It proceeds on the basis that it looks as if the people responsible for the servicing of the Houses of the Oireachtas are not concerned that they should work efficiently.  This is a pathetic and ridiculous situation as are many other aspects of the working of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I simply want to put it on the record&mdash;I do not want promises because I have got past the stage of believing them&mdash;that this is serious and is making the work of Senators more difficult than it ought to be and, in fact, is a disgraceful situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I again ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible for us to take the Committee Stage tomorrow?  As I understand it, the Bill would still be in time for the purposes of renewing the three-year extension which has been agreed on Second Stage.  Is that not the position, that we would be in time if we sat tomorrow?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also contributed to the Prisons Bill and I accept its importance but Senators who, in addition to having contributed were prepared to listen to the debate, should not be in any great difficulty now dealing with the Committee Stage.  I make that point in addition to the point made by Senator Willie Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the observation of Senator Donnelly&mdash;I say this as someone who on this particular debate stayed with a lot of the debate&mdash;I was quite prepared to go beyond the Second Stage last week when matters were fresh in my mind.  That applies to other Senators.  If we were there we did know and we could proceed to the next Stage but a week later I think it quite normal that people do not recall the detail with the same precision and are therefore disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we accept the suggestion of the Leader of the House that No. 3 be taken secondly and see what the position later is in regard to the Official Report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but No. 2 would have to be taken not later than 6 o'clock. As the House is well aware, I am not responsible for the printing of the Official Report.  I am only responsible for proposing how the Order of Business should be managed and I do that particularly at this time of year knowing that there are going to be a great many Bills coming within the next few weeks and if the Seanad wants to rise in or around the middle of July it is imperative that we use every Wednesday at least and use the full time available.  Consequently it would be most undesirable that we should adjourn early this afternoon without completing the business on the Order Paper.  My purpose is to ensure that we get through the business as quickly as is reasonably possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, whereas I appreciate that a point can be made that it is difficult to discuss the Committee Stage without having the report of the Second Stage before us, this has never been a rule of the House.  There have been many Bills over the years where all Stages were taken the same day.  Usually if there is a gap between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage it is a question of one week and the point that the report was not available may have been made now and again but there is no rule of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and neither is there any precedent for <Col N="367" /> saying that a Committee Stage cannot be taken because the report of the Second Stage is not available.  If the House thinks this is a matter of importance it is something which should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On this Bill I could not, in the light of the pressure of business, agree to adjourning this Bill until tomorrow.</P>

    <Title>Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, 1978: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 30:</P>
    <P>In page 17, lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;to a hirer dealing as consumer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Molony).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we propose would have the effect of broadening the liability for persons conducting negotiations antecedent to a hire purchase agreement.  While on several occasions I have acknowledged that the purpose of the Bill is to help the consumer, I have voiced concern also that the definition of the consumer in the Bill is extremely narrow and would only apply to circumstances in which a person who is acting, not in the course of business, buys a domestic product.  This would cover a housewife buying a washing machine but would not cover a farmer buying a tractor or a business person buying an item of office equipment. In relation to very many of these types of contracts&mdash;whether it is a farmer buying a tractor or an office owner buying a piece of equipment&mdash;in buying these items these people are acting as consumers.  The farmer is not a mechanic in relation to the tractor and the professional person or the <Col N="368" /> businessman is not expert in so far as the workings of a typewriter or a photocopying machine are concerned. They require protection.</P>
      <P>There has been a development in recent years, particularly in relation to the sale of office equipment and in relation to the sale of cars, or the transfer of ownership of cars, for people to adopt these agreements in order to avoid liability. We are left in a situation where the person who has possession of the goods is not the consumer, if one relies on this Bill for a definition of consumer, but he is a consumer.  He is left in the position where he cannot enforce rights against the supplier of the goods.  Our amendment seeks to remove that inhibition and give him access to the courts to enable him to take on a supplier where a supplier has treated him badly.  I am familiar with very many cases in which people have been left without legal remedy because of this quirk in the law.  I do not believe it was ever intended that a supplier should be able to avoid liability simply because of the introduction of a method of financing the deal.  I would urge the Minister to consider the amendment. I know he is going to tell me that the Bill is there to protect consumers.  I accept that but I say that the definition of the consumer is too narrow and also that there are very many aspects of this Bill that change the law so far as contracts that are not consumer contracts are concerned.  The whole area of misrepresentation is being changed.</P>
      <P>There are several other instances in the Bill where the law has been changed in relation to contracts that are not consumer contracts in the sense that the Bill describes consumer contracts.  This is one area in which we could usefully advance the position of all consumers whether they are persons in business or whether they are consumers in the narrow sense of the word.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment, as described by Senator Molony, would <Col N="369" /> be that the liability created by section 32 would apply whether the hirer is dealing as a consumer or not.  I regret, however, that I cannot accept the proposed amendment for the following reasons.  It must be remembered that section 32 places a liability on a party, that is the dealer, who up to now could escape liability for faulty or defective goods. Previously the hirer's only recourse was against the finance house.  The section, therefore, extends the options available to the hirer.  However, in extending these options a deliberate policy decision was made to confine the liability to situations where the hirer dealt as consumer. Because of the new or extra liability created by this provision it was decided that this was as far as we wished to go and no further.  It must also be borne in mind that this section has been considerably strengthened already due to an amendment introduced in the Dáil on Committee Stage.  This amendment created liability for breach rather than for fulfilment of an agreement so as to make it clear that all remedies are available.  The word &ldquo;fulfilment&rdquo; might have been misread.  I was referring to the remedy of specific performance only. The amendment also had the effect of making both the dealer and the finance company statutorily liable for misrepresentation with respect to the goods passing from the dealer to the hirer.  At present, under common law, it is not normally possible to make the finance company liable for statements made by the dealer as the dealer is not regarded as the agent of the finance company so as to make them responsible for anything he says.  Furthermore, should the words &ldquo;dealing as consumer&rdquo; be deleted from this section, it would be necessary to do the same in section 14.  While section 14 does not, in fact, relate to hire purchase situations, these two sections complement each other.  It has been our intention that these sections should correspond as far as possible and we wish to confine section 14 to situations where the buyer deals as consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted also, that this Bill does not set out to amend existing hire purchase legislation.  The main objective <Col N="370" /> was to up-date the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, primarily to give improved protection to consumers in contracts for the sale of goods.  However, in doing this it was found that in order to be consistent in our protection of the consumer the position of buyers other than cash buyers had to be borne in mind.  We took the view that a hire purchase, in substance, is not a form of purchase and it follows logically that the benefits being given to cash buying consumers should be appropriately extended into the hire purchase area.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in Part III the Bill amends existing hire purchase legislation to the minimum extent consistent with the improvements and innovations introduced in Part II.  In any event, only one section of one of the hire purchase Acts is being changed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the Senator's amendment could well have substantial implications for the body of hire purchase law which would make it necessary to carry out detailed research. This research has obviously not been done for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the question of revising the law generally in relation to consumer credit is being considered separately by my Department in the context of the NCAC recommendations in this respect. It would be more appropriate to consider the general up-dating of the hire purchase legislation when the Department's proposals in consumer credit are being finalised.  The Senator's suggestions will be borne in mind at that particular stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, should the words &ldquo;to a hirer dealing as consumer&rdquo; be deleted from section 32 this would create an inconsistency in the Bill as the proposed Government amendment extending the Bill to letting agreements is confined to situations where the lessee deals as consumer. Also, it could restrict the availability of hire purchase in situations where the hirer is dealing in the course of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the exhaustive reply he has <Col N="371" /> given.  His last reason is certainly not acceptable as a reasonable one, given the fact that he had advance notice of our intention to table the amendment. However, I am pleased that the Minister has decided to extend the legislation to include leasing arrangements but I would not have any objection to an amendment of the Government's amendment to extend this beyond the narrow band of consumers defined in the Bill.  I accept a lot of what the Minister has said but I think that what he is doing is scratching the surface of a problem and doing no more than that.</P>
      <P>I tried to gather some information, albeit in a very unscientific way, on the amount of hire purchase transactions that will be affected by this Bill.  I have reason to believe that we are literally only scratching the surface of the enormous business that hire purchase companies engage in.  The vast majority of their financial interests are in semi-commercial or semi-consumer contracts. I use the consumer definition of the Bill when I say that.  Most of the people who really require protection are farmer-type people or business-type people who buy an item of equipment in the course of business.  A shopkeeper, for instance, starting out is buying shop equipment or whatever and that is the person who requires protection but we are losing an opportunity of affording him that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a difference between sections 14 and 32.  I accept that one complements the other but you have to look at it in this way: before we ever thought of hire purchase agreements or of leasing arrangements or of promissory notes and so on that we have nowadays to avoid liability, we simply had purchases and sales and in those circumstances the supplier had a liability.  The reality is that the introduction of these means of financing purchase transactions has taken the supplier on to a new plain where he avoids liability and I am trying to get over that problem.  I regret that the Minister has seen fit not to accept this amendment.  I do not accept his reasons <Col N="372" /> as being valid to the extent that the amendment should not be considered. Finally, I can only hope that when some Government Department at some stage manage to introduce some consumer credit legislation, something might be done about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate on the hire purchase provisions of the Bill, Senator <Col N="373" /> Molony raised the difficulty being experienced by Guinness-Peat Aviation and Aer Lingus in relation to the agreements which those companies enter into for the leasing of aircraft.  The Senator made the point that such leasing is always by way of an agreement which on construction of the agreement would fall within the definition of a hire purchase agreement and this he said raised major difficulties for Guinness-Peat and Aer Lingus since their leasing agreements would seem to be got by the extensive body of legislation contained in the Hire-Purchase Act 1946 mentioned in Part III of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I was not aware of the situation until the Senator brought it to my attention and I am very grateful to him for doing this.  At the same time, however, I am somewhat surprised that the problem surfaced in the way it did.  I understand that Aer Lingus who are 41 per cent owners of Guinness-Peat were asked for their views on this Bill <i>via</i> the Department of Transport and Power as long ago as 1977 but that at no time from then until Senator Molony raised the matter was the situation brought to the notice of my Department.  Indeed, since the Senator raised the matter in the House my officials have been in touch with the Department of Transport as a result of which contact was made with Aer Lingus and Guinness-Peat and we have received letters from both organisations outlining their concern that their leasing arrangements seem to come within the scope of the Hire-purchase Acts and asking that a provision be included in the Bill to exclude such transactions.</P>

    <P>While I am not convinced that exemption clauses employed by Aer Lingus and Guinness-Peat in such agreements would be found by the courts to be unfair and unreasonable, nevertheless I have decided to introduce an amendment in Part III of the Bill to allay their fears in this regard.  The effect of this amendment will be to preserve the efficacy of exemption clauses in relation to international hire purchase agreements.  This means that the terms implied under sections <Col N="374" /> 26 to 29 of the Bill may be effectively excluded in such agreements.  I have decided to limit this amendment to transactions of an international nature as it is mainly in the international field that the two above mentioned companies see problems arising.</P>
    <P>It will be noted, too, that the amendment covers all goods and not just aircraft. It would be unwise and unfair to single out aircrift for special treatment. In both these respects, therefore, the proposed amendment is consistent with section 24 of the Bill which provides an out for parties to a contract for the international sale of goods.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be seen to be questioning an amendment which I, in some way suggested was necessary but I have only been given the Government's amendment walking into the House today and I just want to ask if there is any possibility that a person operating, say, from a position outside this country, could operate a hire purchase business in relation to the purchases of goods within the country&mdash;if the Minister can follow that rather poor expression of what I am trying to get at&mdash;and because of this section avoid liability.  I am thinking of the sort of situation where somebody sets out to avoid liability under this Bill by ensuring that the owner of the goods in a hire purchase transaction is, say, from the United Kingdom while the hirer is in Ireland.  Would that be an international contract and if so could the owner of those goods avoid liability under the legislation?</P>

      <P>We know that most of the people who engage in hire purchase business in Ireland are connected with foreign companies. Take the situation where a company have a subsidiary in Ireland at the moment and they decide that they can use the section to avoid <Col N="375" /> their liability.  Let us say all their hire purchase contracts are operated by an English company.  It seems to me that the section proposed by the Minister merely provides for the parties whose places of business are in territories of different states and there is an English hire purchase company and an Irish consumer. Secondly, it states that the agreement involves the hire of goods which are at the time of the conclusion of the agreement in the course of carriage or will be carried from the territory of one state to the territory of another state. Most of the goods that are involved in hire purchase transactions are television sets, washing machines and so on.  Many of them are manufactured outside Ireland.  I wonder if there is a possibility that by tying the two of those conditions together hire purchase companies could avoid liability.</P>

      <P>Where goods are let, otherwise than under a hire-purchase agreement, to a person dealing as consumer the provisions of this Part, other than section 26, shall apply to the letting agreement as if it were a hire-purchase agreement and in every such agreement there is an implied warranty that the goods are free, and will remain free, from any change or encumbrance not disclosed, before the agreement is made, to the person taking the goods and that that person will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by any person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed.</P>

      <P>Senators will recall that there was substantial discussion on previous Stages of the Bill in this House as to whether contracts of bailment should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  The main emphasis in these discussions <Col N="378" /> was on the recent upsurge in leasing business.  Various Senators were keen to extend the protection being given by the Bill to consumer leasing and letting agreements.  Both the present Minister for the Gaeltacht and I maintain that the area of bailment contracts generally was too wide and complex an area to be included in the Bill at this point in its life.  We maintain that the bailment area would need its own separate study if it were to be legislated for in a general way.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht indicated on Committee Stage, however, that we were looking at the question of leasing to see if we could at least make some adjustment to the Bill to cover the aspect of bailment.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes, therefore, that the protection being given in Part III of the Bill to the hire purchasers will now be extended to consumers who enter other types of letting agreements.  The type of agreements mainly involved here are contracts of simple hire ranging from the hire of cars, do-it-yourself tools and other short-term agreements to open-ended television rental agreements.  Under the amendment the hirer would have implied rights that the good he hires would be of merchantable quality, that they would correspond with their description and so on.  While this is as far as I am prepared to go in this area at present I think that what the amendment proposes is a worthwhile advance in terms of the protection available to the consumer who enters into a rental or simple hire agreement for goods.  It also has the advantage of restricting the likelihood that various Senators pointed out of there being a swing to fixed terms consumer leasing by the retail sector to get around the increased responsibilities being imposed on it by Part II of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 34 and 37 which arise under section 40 and 47, are consequential to the proposal in that amendment.  No. 34 extends the scope of Part V of the Bill, dealing with misrepresentation, to encompass transactions related to consumer letting agreements and amendment No. 37 extends to such agreements the Minister's order making powers under section 47.</P>

      <P>This subsection as drafted provides that the implied terms in section 37 will not apply to internal as opposed to international transport contracts until the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Transport, so provides.  Such a provision, however, might prove unduly restrictive on both Ministers involved since the Minister could make a global order applying section 37 to all transport contracts without taking account of the difficulties attaching to various categories of such contracts.  The amendment proposes, therefore, to give the Minister power to differentiate between the various types of contracts, whether these involve carriage of passengers or goods, carriage by road or rail and so on.

    <P>(4)  It shall be an offence for a person in the course of a business to furnish to the recipient of a service goods bearing, or goods in a container bearing, or any document including, any statement, irrespective of its legal effect, which sets out, limits or describes rights conferred on the recipient or liabilities to the recipient in relation to goods acquired by him or any statement <Col N="381" /> likely to be taken as such a statement, unless that statement is accompanied by a clear and conspicuous declaration that the contractual rights which the recipient enjoys by virtue of section 37 are in no way prejudiced by the relevant statement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald suggested during the Committee Stage that it seemed unreasonable to create a criminal offence for sellers of goods displaying notices which purport to restrict or exclude the buyers' basic right, without making a similar provision for comparable practice in the area of services. As I mentioned in reply to the Senator, the coverage of services in this Bill is not as wide ranging as the provisions dealing with goods or, indeed, hire-purchase. Nevertheless this is one particular area where I agree that it would clearly be in the interests of the consumer to provide that a recipient of services could not be misled by means of notices which essentially take advantage of the consumer's lack of knowledge or inability to negotiate his or her legal rights.</P>

Senator FitzGerald also raised the point in relation to the broad manner in which the other section of the Bill was drawn, that was to display on any part of any premises a notice that includes any such statement.

He made a number of points in relation to the display on any part of any premises of notices that include any such statement in section 11. With the greatest respect to Senator FitzGerald, I believe these points are more academic than real.  I am advised that the meaning and context of these words are sufficiently clear in section 11 <Col N="382" /> and the pragmatism of the courts is such that the possibility referred to by the Senator will not materialise.</P>

      <P>During Committee Stage Senator Molony mentioned that an arbitration clause in a contract might be outlawed under section 43 as amounting to an exemption clause.  He contended that such a clause might be literally construed as restricting a remedy available by virtue of the fact that it has closed off the right to go to court at least until after the arbitration proceedings.  The point was made that this problem had arisen in England and that they had not been able to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the matter much consideration and I now see merit in the Senator's argument.  I feel that arbitration clauses should be allowed to stand because of their efficiency in terms of dispute resolution.  Consequentially, if there is any doubt or uncertainty as to their validity under section 43, I consider that it should be removed.  I have <Col N="383" /> decided, therefore, to introduce an amendment to meet this point.

On Committee Stage Senator Molony wondered why the Minister was not giving the same order-making power relating to the sale of goods or hire-purchase contracts. I indicated that while the main reason for providing as in the Bill was that the services area appeared to us to be where abuses are more prevalent. Nevertheless, I saw no strong reason against extending the order-making power as the Senator had suggested.

      <P>With regard to section 51, which deals with contracts required to be in writing, Senator Molony made the point that should such a contract not be in writing, this would mean that it would be unenforceable at the suit of the seller and the buyer.  The buyer would, therefore, have no implied rights under the contracts and, accordingly, no redress open to him should the goods purchased prove faulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by Senator Molony and I have decided to introduce an amendment to meet it.  The effect of this amendment will be to make such contracts unenforceable to the seller or supplier where the buyer recipient deals with the consumer.  This will mean that the buyer recipient who deals with the consumer will still be able to enforce the contracts in question whether they are in writing or not.  The <i>rationale</i> behind this lies in the fact that we are trying to protect the consumer here.  This envisaged that the provisions of this section will be used to suppress the use of prejudicial <Col N="385" /> clauses, for example, exclusion clauses, which, while they will no longer have legal effect may be used by unscrupulous sellers or suppliers.  I propose the amendment accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the section has been amended.  The Minister proposes to amend the section because as it stood it was something that would mitigate very much against a consumer rather than in his favour.  I can only say, having said that, that my inclination again would have been to delete the section altogether.  At least the narrow definition of the consumer comes to my aid coming to the very end of Report Stage.  There is a good case for certain consumer contracts to be in writing.  It is a dangerous thing to change law that has existed for years and years and years by one section in a Bill.  However, I trust that the Minister's advisers have considered this matter very fully.  I merely ask that the matter be kept under review lest it has some ramifications that I had not anticipated.</P>

      <P>There are a few general points I would like to make on the Bill. Before I do so I would like to go back to this new section introduced by amendment 30a on Report Stage.  I regret that I <Col N="386" /> did not have the opportunity to consider this fully, and I particularly regret that the Minister was not as anxious as I thought he would have been, given the spirit of co-operation that prevailed in both Houses on the passage of this Bill. Since he made his point I have managed to take a look at Part III of the Bill again, and I think it is section 36 that he feels would resolve any difficulty that I would anticipate in relation to this new section.  I will describe it as amendment No. 30a as it is the only reasonable means of reference that I can have.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that section 36, as I read it, proceeds on the basis that it will only apply where the proper law of a hire purchase agreement would be the law of Ireland.  I see no difficulty for people who wish to avoid the liability that is imposed upon them in this legislation avoiding that particular premise.  It is possible that this new section will be used to avoid liability.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 30a is very widely drawn, and I find it very hard to believe that section 36 would ensure the position of the consumer.  I merely ask that the Minister be a willing participant in a full discussion of this in the Dáil, because it is something that should be teased out fully.  I regret that that opportunity was denied to me today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to make a general point in relation to many of the difficulties we had over sections in this Bill, that is something this side of the House strongly suggested at Second Stage debate, that a select committee be appointed to deal with the Bill.  In the course of this debate I had the privilege of discussing the Bill with the Minister's advisers.  That was something I welcomed.  It certainly clarified for me many of the questions I was concerned with.  I believe a direct exchange like that can be extremely useful.  We could have used the resources of this House more efficiently had we adopted that as a general procedure from the very start.  I suppose these things do not often happen despite the fact that there is provision in our Standing Orders for them.  Perhaps <Col N="387" /> the reason is that it has got a little seized up, something that is not used and perhaps needs to be taken out, cleaned, oiled and let roll again.  It is very useful and beneficial.  I want to place on record my thanks to the Minister and his advisers for the manner in which the Bill was presented and has gone through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of areas in the Bill that could be a lot better.  We have on several occasions discussed the narrow definition of a consumer.  This is something that is to be regretted.  When I first read this Bill over a year ago I felt that it was far more wideranging than in fact it will be.  The reason for that is that most of the thrust of the Bill, the really useful remedies that exist in the Bill and the new rights being given, are given to consumers, but very narrowly defined consumers.  It will, in effect, only apply to circumstances&mdash;I give this by way of example but I think it is a very typical example&mdash;such as a housewife buying a washing machine.  It will not apply to all the transactions that we engage in all the time because we would fall outside the very narrow definition given to a consumer.</P>
    <P>The next point I would like to refer to is a point of particular regret that I have, that is in relation to the section dealing with spare parts.  I will not go back into the arguments again.  This was a matter of policy.  I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance to take a power that we were offering him.  He did not have to exercise it unless he wished to. He resisted.  Whether he was afraid of outside pressures falling on his Department afterwards or not I do not know.  It is a matter of regret that he did not take to himself the power that we asked him to take to ensure that in relation to items of equipment that are dumped on the Irish market the Minister could insist that spare parts be made available for any period he chose to specify himself.</P>
    <P>I want to echo words that were spoken by other Senators in the House on several occasions at different times during the passage of the Bill in relation <Col N="388" /> to consumer awareness in this country.  I believe that one of our big problems has been that consumers have not always been aware of their rights.  I do not believe that recourse to the law afterwards is a reasonable way of ensuring access to justice for consumers.  If when consumers go to buy their items of equipment or obtain a service they are aware of their rights their rights will not be blackguarded.  That is, to a great extent, the root of much of the consumer difficulties we have today.  I note that the Minister intends to publish a handbook in relation to the Bill in which the consumers' rights will be set out in layman's language or in consumer person's language.  That should help very much.  I urge him to ensure that that handbook is published very soon, and, certainly, published before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of comments that I would like to make on the Bill as it is passing into law.  The first is that it is a Bill of very limited scope. When it was first published, this Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, 1978 was greeted in the press as the shoppers' charter.  It is nothing of the sort.  Then, I do not think that it was intended to be. Its purpose is merely to extend and to amend the provisions of the 1893 Sale of Goods Act to bring them into line with modern day conditions.  We were not shopping in supermarkets in 1893 nor were we buying things on hire purchase.  Therefore, to describe this Bill as a shoppers' charter and, as was done in the press, to describe the 1893 Act as antediluvian, which implied that up to now the consumer was completely without any sort of protection is both an unfair comment and an uninformed comment on that Act.</P>
      <P>It has been said several times during the passage of this Bill that we might have gone further.  That we did not go as far as some of us would have liked is not due to any lack of good will on the part of the Minister, indeed far from it.  It is due to a lack of an informed and aware consumer lobby in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer needs to be informed <Col N="389" /> on two levels.  First he needs to be informed of his rights.  Here I feel that the Director of Consumer Affairs has a function.  The consumer also needs to be aware of what he should look for when he goes to buy something.  There are many motorists driving around the country who do not know the difference between a big end and a bicycle pump. When a person like that goes to buy a car he is not necessarily buying it from an expert motor mechanic, he is buying it from an expert salesman.  Until he knows what he is going to look for I feel that this is an area in which a great deal of work remains to be done.  We can see how well the consumer has been looked after in Britain with consumer advice bureaux and the magazines such as <i>Which.</i>  Indeed any woman's magazines or family magazines published in Britain have, as well as their beauty editor and fashion editor, a consumer affairs editor. They have a page devoted to problems of the consumer.  It is a very useful thing which we should copy.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail on what I consider to be a shoppers' charter.  That has been very well done by Professor Whin-cup in his report published by NESC which is the basis of many of the sections in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We need to provide for a more informed consumer, because legislation to protect the consumer is of limited value if we do not try to see that we have an articulate well-informed consumer.  This was very well put by the Consumer Association of Ireland in their report on the need for a consumers' advice and research bureau, which was presented to the then Minister in June 1977.  As far as consumer legislation is concerned we can legislate until we are blue in the face, but it is of limited value unless we are legislating for an informed consumer.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for the welcome they gave to this legislation, for the manner in which it was debated and for the co-operation shown.  Senator Molony made the point that this should have been in select committee.  The Senator admitted that he received full co-operation <Col N="390" /> from myself on this, to the extent of arranging for discussions with my advisers to clarify what is very detailed and complex legislation.  What has happened, as a result of this committee on Report Stage, in the debate in the Seanad is that this Bill has been improved even further.</P>
      <P>To refer to it as a shoppers' charter might be an over-statement, but this is major legislation.  It is part of the Government's overall package of legislation for the consumer.  Since this Government came into power we had the Consumer Information Act, and we now have this Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill.  We will have the Consumer Credit Bill.  We had the Occasional Trading Bill to be followed by the Casual Trading Bill.  We had a Pyramid Selling Bill, and we have a Trading Stamp Bill and a Packaged Goods Bill which went through the Dáil today.  All of this is part of an overall package for consumer legislation.  The country has never before seen such a comprehensive package of legislation for the protection of the consumer.</P>
      <P>I did not commit myself to introducing amendments, but many points were raised by various Senators throughout the course of the Committee Stage which I promised to look at again.  Rather than answering those points in the House I will communicate directly with the individual Senators who raised the points, none of whom is here today so it would be of no benefit to go through them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise at the outset that the sole purpose of this Bill is to up-date the Factories Act, 1955.  The Bill has, therefore, a limited&mdash;but nonetheless desirable &mdash;purpose.  It does not mark a radical departure in our approach to occupational safety and health.  That is not, by any means, to imply that wider aspects of safety and health at work are being neglected.  I merely wish to make it clear that they do not come within the scope of the Bill, nor would it be appropriate that they should.</P>
      <P>To be effective, an all-embracing Bill, one which was geared to the specific needs of this country, would entail a considerable amount of prior research to ensure that all relevant aspects were properly examined.  Consideration, too, would have to be given to existing institutional arrangements and to the question of departmental responsibility.  A period of several years for all this was suggested by Opposition members in the other House, and I would not be inclined to disagree with that estimate.  The Minister for Labour indicated at the time that it would not be justifiable to wait that long before bringing about the improvements which the Safety in Industry Bill could, and should, make to the existing primary legislation.  In the meantime, I assure Senators that an appropriate forum will shortly be provided for the purpose of giving due attention to occupational safety and health in a broader context than that of industry alone and arrangements have been set in train to establish a working party, and discussions will be taking place with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers in relation to their composition and terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Factories Act, 1955&mdash;which is now proposed to be amended by the Safety in Industry Bill&mdash;has stood the <Col N="392" /> test of time remarkably well, all things considered.  This is probably due, in large measure, to the enabling powers which the Minister has under it to make regulations, particularly special regulations in accordance with the Third Schedule to the Act.  These powers have been availed of extensively over the years, so that about 100 regulations in all now exist, and more continue to be made every year.  A list of those made to date is contained in the yearly Labour Inspection Report.  It cannot be said, therefore, that no action was taken in the interval between the bringing into force of the 1955 Act and the introduction of this Bill. More importantly, the output of supplementary regulations has made it possible to tailor safety requirements to meet the circumstances in individual industrial sectors and individual processes in a detailed and specific way.  That is something, incidentally, which primary legislation alone, by its very nature, could never hope to accomplish.</P>
    <P>The need for amendment to various provisions of the Act itself has become evident over the years, in the light both of the operation of the Act and of changes in technology and in industry generally.  As well as the question of amendment, there seemed, in certain instances, to be a case for the addition of some new provisions.</P>
    <P>Work place safety needs do not remain static, and experience in the administration of technical legislation would tend to suggest that an Act of that nature, which has now been on the Statute Book for close on 30 years, might conceivably benefit from a critical examination as to the adequacy of its provisions, particularly those which are not enabling ones in the present-day context. For all these reasons, a comprehensive review of the 1955 Act, in which technical and administrative staff participated, was undertaken in the Department of Labour.  The outcome of that review was the framing of the legislation which is now before Senators.  It might, with justification, have been entitled the &ldquo;Factories (Amendment) Bill&rdquo;, for that is precisely what it purports to do.  The <Col N="393" /> choice of &ldquo;Safety in Industry Bill&rdquo; as the short title instead was influenced largely by the desire to select a title which would be more positive, not to say more modern, than that of the 1955 Act. The Bill, when enacted, and the 1955 Act, will be construed together as one Act and they will be cited collectively as the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980.</P>
    <P>Apart from standard provisions, such as those contained in sections 1 and 2, the remaining provisions in the Bill could be divided into two categories; first, those which are designed to up-date various aspects of the Factories Act, 1955, by amending, extending or repealing existing provisions of that Act. They constitute those revisions&mdash;largely of a technical nature&mdash;of the 1955 Act which practical experience in the operation of that legislation for well over 20 years has shown clearly to be either necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Secondly, those which comprise entirely new provisions, with the aim of improving, where appropriate, on the 1955 Act.  Sections 3-8, 12, 14, 16-26, 28, 30-34, 40-48, 51-53, 56 and the Schedule, that is about 70 per cent of the Bill, fall into the first category.  Sections 9-11, 13, 15, 27, 29, 35-39, 49, 50 and 54-55 fall into the second category.</P>
    <P>Turning to the second category, to those provisions which are completely new, I should like to highlight sections 35-39 as being particularly significant. These sections, which comprise Part III, provide for the appointment of safety representatives, safety committees, and safety delegates, and for the preparation of safety statements.  While it is true that, under section 53 of the 1955 Act workers were entitled to set up safety committees, the fact is that they did not avail themselves to any great extent of this right.  There were, for example, only 274 such safety committees on record at the end of December, 1978.  The disappointing experience with safety committees under the 1955 Act has long been a matter of concern to the Department of Labour.  The Safety in Industry Bill presented an opportunity, therefore, to <Col N="394" /> take a fresh initiative in this area.  I am pleased to be able to tell Senators that the sections in the Bill about safety representatives and safety committees owe their present content to joint proposals in that regard from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  I am confident that, in being acceptable to both sides of industry, these provisions should thus have an excellent potential for successful implementation.</P>
    <P>Briefly, section 35 will entitle the workers in the relevant premises in which more than twenty people are employed to select and appoint a safety representative from amongst their number. He or she will be primarily concerned with preventive measures in the area of workplace safety.  Towards that end, the occupier of the premises will be obliged to hold consultations with the safety representative as regards co-operation in relation to all relevant statutory measures on safety and health, and will have to consider any representation which the safety representative makes in connection with the safety, health and welfare of the persons employed. The occupier will also be obliged to let the safety representatives know when an industrial inspector arrives for a regular tour of inspection.  Once the safety representative requests it, he will be entitled to accompany the inspector on any such tour.  Provision has also been made in section 35 to add to the functions of safety representatives by way of regulations, which will be made only after the ICTU and the FUE have been consulted.  Regulations, too, may vary&mdash;upwards or downwards&mdash;the number of persons that must be employed in a premises before the workers will be entitled to appoint a safety representative.  Again, regulations in that connection will not be made before the ICTU and the FUE have been consulted.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the setting up of joint safety committees in the relevant premises, where workers would prefer a committee as opposed to a safety representative.  The size of the committee will depend on the number of persons <Col N="395" /> employed in the premises, with the minimum number of members being three, and the maximum, ten.  In all cases, however, the number of committee members selected and appointed from among their number by the workers will be proportionately greater than the number of members appointed by the occupier.  The functions of a safety committee will be similar to those of a safety representative.  The possibility of adding to those functions by regulations, after consulting the ICTU and the FUE, exists in respect of the safety committee also.  A safety committee will be entitled, if so desired, to choose somebody from among the worker members to be the safety delegate.  The safety delegate will then be the person who will make representations on behalf of the committee and who will have the same right as has the safety representative to accompany an industrial inspector on regular tours of inspection.</P>
    <P>Should workers not wish to appoint a safety representative, or the worker members of a safety committee, within six months after the coming into operation of sections 35 and 36, then, by virtue of section 3, the occupier concerned has a further three months in which to make the relevant appointment.  In this way, it will no longer be possible for a situation to obtain whereby, out of somewhere in the region of 18,000 premises, only 24 safety committees are in existence.  It goes without saying that the fewer the occasions on which section 37 is brought into play, the better. Ideally, I would prefer the exclusive use of sections 35 and 36.  Worker participation in the vital area of occupational safety and health is deserving of every encouragement.  While the main responsibility for ensuring safety at work rests, as it should, on the occupier, workers have a positive contribution to make as well.  Indeed, it would be impossible to devise safety legislation which would decrease, or even eliminate, accidents at work if, at the same time, workers did not have due regard for their own safety and for that of their fellow workers.  So, <Col N="396" /> what I am hoping to achieve with sections 35 and 36 is a coming together, in a spirit of co-operation and co-responsibility, of occupiers and workers in the common interest of securing a safe and healthy workplace.</P>
    <P>The two remaining sections of Part III are in keeping with this attitude on safety matters.  Under section 38, an industrial inspector may be asked by the Minister to investigate a danger in the premises to the safety, health or welfare of the workers where the safety representative or safety committee or safety officer, in the case of building operations or works of engineering construction believes such a danger to exist and requests the Minister to have it investigated.  Section 39 will require occupiers to have a written safety statement prepared for relevant premises in which ten or more persons are employed.  The safety statement will have to specify how the safety and health of the workers concerned will be secured and safeguarded.  If the statement is not adequate in that regard, the Minister has the power to direct its revision in the manner specified by him.  As soon as the statement has been prepared or revised, a copy must be given to the safety representative or the safety committee, whichever is appropriate.  Where neither a safety representative nor a safety committee has been appointed, a copy must be given to every person employed in the premises.  The intention behind section 39 is to stimulate occupiers into formulating a safety policy which would be suitable for their particular premises.  This would not, in any way, be a substitute for the statutory safety requirements with which they have to comply, rather it would be a question of supplementing those requirements on a non-statutory basis.  In many cases the safety statement may well articulate in a formal way the steps which are already being taken by the occupier and by management.  In other cases, the preparation of the safety statement may cause occupiers and management to give consideration to the steps which need to be taken in addition to those already imposed on them by legislation.  Either way, both occupiers and workers stand <Col N="397" /> to gain from the focus placed on the need for internal safety policies by the provisions of section 39.</P>
    <P>Despite all the good intentions behind Part III of the Bill, it is only realistic to envisage that, in certain circumstances, ministerial intervention may be necessary.  I would single out, in this connection, sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Bill, in ascending importance.</P>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate of the Department of Labour make use of an administrative device, called a contravention letter, whereby the attention of the occupier is drawn to any contravention of existing safety legislation which an inspector has observed in the course of an inspection of the premises concerned, and to the need to remedy the matter giving rise to the contravention if the occupier wishes to avoid having legal proceedings taken against him. It was felt that power should be taken in law to improve on the position at present obtaining where the occupier chose to ignore the contravention letter&mdash;particularly since legal proceedings can sometimes turn out to be a somewhat lengthy process, thereby enabling the contravention in question to continue during that period, to the probable detriment of the safety and health of workers. That is the background to the inclusion of section 11 in the Bill.  Section 11 will permit the Minister to serve a prohibition notice in relation to activities which, in his opinion, involve a risk of serious bodily injury to persons employed in the relevant premises.  The prohibition notice will direct that the activities, involving a contravention of safety legislation, to which the notice relates, may not be carried on unless the contravention has been remedied.  If necessary, the dangerous activities will have to cease immediately, where the Minister believes, and states in the notice, that the risk of serious bodily injury to persons employed is imminent.  In such event, the prohibition notice will take effect immediately it is served.</P>
    <P>Section 10 empowers the Minister to require an occupier or owner of plant to have such plant competently examined <Col N="398" /> and tested in the event of its having been the possible cause&mdash;whether wholly or partly&mdash;of an accident or dangerous occurrence in the relevant premises.  In addition, when the examination and testing have been duly carried out, a copy of the results must be given to the Minister by the occupier or owner within seven days of its receipt by whichever of them is involved.</P>
    <P>Section 9 imposes a duty on manufacturers, importers or suppliers of any plant for use at work in certain premises to ensure, in so far as this is reasonably practicable, that safeguards have been provided in relation to the plant to ensure its safe operation when it is being properly used.  In this connection, the Minister will be able, by way of regulations, to lay down specifications or other requirements with which the design and construction of plant must comply.</P>
    <P>Finally, before leaving the provisions of the Bill, I would like to refer to section 50.  This section has been shaped to take account of possible future developments in the Department of Labour in the field of occupational health, whereby the employment of specialist staff would facilitate efforts being directed towards identification and prevention, rather than treatment and compensation as heretofore.  Section 50 will allow there to be more than one registered medical practitioner designated by the Minister as industrial medical advisers for the purposes of the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, while permitting administrative arrangements to vary the name somewhat, for example in order to distinguish between differences in grade. The section will have regard to the possibility of a distinction being made by the Minister in respect of the tasks of industrial medical advisers in the event of there being more than one such adviser. As regards the task of advisers, it is important to note that section 50 will enable surveying to be carried out in the future where workers in the control group would not be exposed in the course of their employment to risk of danger to health.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the need to avoid breach <Col N="399" /> of parliamentary privileges imposes constraints on Ministers in relation to disclosing detailed information to interested bodies about the contents of proposed legislation, in advance of circulation of the relevant Bill to Members of the Oireachtas.  For that reason, the more substantive discussions with the ICTU and the FUE on the Safety in Industry Bill were held between its Second Stage and Committee Stage in the other House, given that the text of the Bill was then publicly available.  Arising out of these consultations, ministerial amendments subsequently effected numerous changes to the Bill, to the extent that certain provisions were completely re-worded and others revised substantially.  In addition, the opportunity was taken to perfect the drafting of some provisions of the Bill and to accommodate some of the suggestions put forward by the Opposition spokesmen.  In all, amendments were made to sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 50, 54, 56 and to the Schedule. Thus I think it should be apparent that the two years during which the Bill was before the other House were beneficial in terms of improving on the content of the Bill as originally presented.  Bearing in mind, particularly, that the Bill in its present form has accommodated, to the greatest extent possible, the proposals made by the ICTU and the FUE, I have no hesitation in commending it to Senators, who, I trust, will facilitate its speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his recent appointment.  I welcome him to this House and extend to him our best wishes for success in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this Bill it is interesting to draw a contrast between the Minister of State's speech today in introducing this Bill in the Seanad and the Minister for Labour's introductory speech in the Dáil as far back as 25 April 1978.  The tenor of both speeches conveys a realisation on the part of the Ministers concerned that perhaps this Bill might not have <Col N="400" /> been approached in the best possible manner at the outset, to derive the maximum benefits for safety in industry.  The Minister on 25 April 1978 winding up the Second Stage said that he had considered the question of replacement of the Factories Act, 1955.  The Minister of State says today that it might with justification have been entitled the Factories (Amendment) Bill.  In his last paragraph the Minister of State tries to hide under the excuse of not being the cause of a breach of Parliamentary privilege in regard to disclosing any consultations prior to legislation being introduced, for the very long delay experienced between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage in the other House. This alone justifies the accusation that there was a rather blurred preparation by the Department of Labour for such an important measure as this and that there was all in all a rather unclear idea as to what exactly was the objective of the legislation when it was brought in.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this Bill instead of being entitled Safety in Industry Bill could with very good justification been entitled Factories (Amendment) Bill, 1980.  There is no doubt that the delay experienced between the conclusion of Second Stage in the other House in May, 1978 and the Committee Stage commencing almost two full years later requires some explanation in the light of the Minister for Labour's comments on Second Stage that it was not justifiable to wait too long for an all-embracing study.  Also an explanation is required in the light of the many amendments which have surfaced in that very long interim period.  The Bill, as it were, went into a state of limbo for almost two years and surfaced only three months ago with considerable amendments, most of which were introduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>This matter of safety in industry is so important and crucial for our economy that far from there being any fear of danger to parliamentary privilege in not disclosing any prior consultations before the Bill was introduced, it could well have benefited from very comprehensive <Col N="401" /> consultations with all interested parties before any Bill saw the light of day.  I am convinced that the Minister has realised that perhaps the approach in the first instance was not as good or as constructive as it might well have been.  Be that as it may, we are left with a Bill which goes into law after its passage through the Seanad leaving a certain amount of lack of confidence on the part of everybody concerned that perhaps a better job might have been done on it.</P>
    <P>When we consider the scale and complexity of safety measures in industry, when we consider the thousands of accidents that have occurred over the past decade, when we consider the number of fatal accidents experienced each year, the number of man days lost, the cost to the economy, apart from any human cost in terms of life or economic terms to any family, as a result of occupational injuries, when we consider that the Factories Act, 1955, in regard to its provisions about the establishment of safety committees, has not been satisfactorily responded to, we are justified in asking with whom were consultations held before the Bill was prepared in the first instance?  Are we worse off for not having had adequate and comprehensive consultations before the Bill was first put into print?</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that a certain input into the Bill came from his own Department's medical advisers.  The growth and variety, for instance, of occupational diseases has been so immense over the past couple of decades that surely the Department's medical advisers do not have a monopoly in regard to knowledge or expertise in this matter.  I wonder why the Government went it alone, as they appear to have done in preparing this important legislation.  It had little to gain, and much to lose, from that solo individualistic enterprise.  It has lost out and it is not as all-embracing as it could well have been.</P>
    <P>The two years which have elapsed would have been a sufficient period for all-embracing legislation to be prepared by all the interested parties.  The two <Col N="402" /> years that were lost by the Department in considering the shortfalls in the legislation which they introduced and in bringing in the numerous amendments on the Committee Stage in the Dáil would have been a sufficient period for any committee of experts, departmental advisers or interested parties such as the trade unions and the employers' federation to be involved in and to have concluded with very comprehensive legislation which would furthermore have had the confidence of all the parties who will have to work the legislation and who will be depending on its measures as a safeguard for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>It has been a case of an opportunity lost.  It is also a case which presented an ideal opportunity for the social partners to get together and produce a fine example of what they can do.  In regard to the Bill which is before us, there are certain improvements on the 1955 Factories Act.  If those improvements were not there, it would have been a futile exercise from the outset.  Section 3 is to be welcomed for its addition to the definition of what a factory is: it now includes the agricultural processing sphere.  This is an area which contains great potential, which has not yet been realised in this country.  The fact that there has been quite a large number of fatal accidents in the agricultural sphere over the years means that, in the agricultural processing industry, we must pay far more attention in the future to safety matters.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is very important because it puts a responsibility on employees to pay attention in a far more constructive manner than hitherto in regard to their own safety.  The 1955 Act was less positive than the present section&mdash;it was more or less left to the occupier of the factory to ensure that safety measures and safety committees were established. Now the employees themselves have a responsibility imposed upon them.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which places a responsibility on the manufacturers of plant to ensure that that plant is in a safe working order and condition, is also a commendable section.  Section 12 is better <Col N="403" /> than section 37 of the 1955 Act.  It makes it obligatory on the occupier of the premises to keep in a safe condition any place of work.  Even here we have seen changes since the Bill was first introduced in the Dáil.  A period of three years allowance whereby such safe conditions can be brought about has been introduced into the Bill.  There was no such period within the terms of the Bill as it was first introduced.  I would like the Minister to explain why this period of grace of three years has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The working party to which the Minister again refers today and which really only came along as a belated suggestion by the Minister for Labour in winding up the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, will have very important work on their hands.  They will have to ensure that this Bill contains the safeguards that exist in other EEC countries, even in Northern Ireland.  How do we stand in regard to the EEC countries and Northern Ireland in regard to safety measures?  The working party will have to consider any current and intended EEC programmes in the safety field. Very importantly, they will have to make sure that whatever measures or provisions are put into legislative effect in the future will be quite comprehensible and simply understood by the workers.  There have been far too many instances where workers were more or less given a copy of the Act.  That was what covered them.</P>
    <P>I remember experiencing a case where there was a fatal accident, and all that concerned his immediate supervisor was going to the files to ensure that that worker had signed a copy of a receipt document indicating that he had been given a copy of the safety document on his first day of work.  We should get away from that attitude of playing safe by occupiers, employers and supervisors in industry.  There must be a continuous process of study and explanation for workers in industry so that they know and are conscious, from day to day, of what the safety measures are and whether there are any shortfalls in regard to the implementation and operation in the plant where they work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The working party will also have to consider the fields which are not specifically referred to in this legislation. This is where a great amount of preparatory work would have been beneficial if the Department, in preparing this legislation had considered the safety measures so necessary in many other fields such as in hospitals, hotels, even places of entertainment, and particularly the agricultural sphere.  On our farms there are quite an extensive number of fatal accidents&mdash;too many.  I have not got figures but we read about them so frequently in the newspapers that one could almost say perhaps we have the same number of fatal accidents on the farms each year, as are recorded by the Department's inspectors as occurring in industry itself.  The working party must study and produce findings to cover safety in all of these fields which seem to have been excluded to an extent that could have been more specifically referred to in this legislation.</P>
    <P>We all agree that it is rather disappointing to find that approximately only 270 safety committees are in operation as a result of the 1955 Factories Act. This is a very disappointing ratio <i>vis-á-vis</i> the number of industries. Notwithstanding that, we learn from the Department of Labour's annual report that 93 per cent of the permises are inspected each year, which is a commendable inspection rate, and carried out by certainly fewer than 50 inspectors. However, it is obvious that we cannot rely on inspection alone.</P>
    <P>It is indeed commendable that the Bill be seen from its compulsory aspect.  Employees will have to pay far more attention in future to safety measures which are provided for their own welfare.  If safety committees that have been established to date are disappointing in number, they have done a certain amount of good.  That is where they have been given active and positive encouragement by the occupier and the employer, but I believe that we will have to tighten up the regulations to ensure that the employers do not stop immediately after encouraging the setting up of safety committees.  There must be <Col N="405" /> an ongoing process whereby the committees meet on a regular basis with the occupiers of the premises and have before them all available up to date information from the Department which they can study to ensure that the most recent and current safety measures are implemented in the factory.  In too many places the employers have not actively encouraged the safety committees that have been established. They fulfilled the requirements of the Factories Act of 1955 to the very minimum extent and they have not gone much further than that in ensuring that those committees were briefed on a continuing basis and encouraged financially and by means of time off to attend certain committee meetings to ensure that safety measures were operating properly in industry.</P>
    <P>Safety measures are something in which AnCO have an important part to play.  AnCO increasingly find themselves as the first body in which so many young workers find themselves experiencing at close hand the requirements of operating and working in industry.  It is an ideal forum to inculcate in young people the best measures and the best advice available in the safety field.  AnCO should be encouraged positively by the Department to increase their work in regard to safety education.</P>
    <P>This voluntary body that we have read so little about and yet which has done so much over the years for promoting safety awareness, namely NISO, is something which must be given teeth for itself.  I do not believe that it can operate any longer on a voluntary basis as it has in the past.  It must be given some financial subvention, it must be given the best of advice and expert official help to ensure that it can, by publications and demonstrations, extend to workers everywhere the most up to date information in regard to safety.  We have in AnCO and NISO two bodies existing today which can do much more than they have been doing in the past to extend the benefits of safety education.</P>
    <P>There are a few comments I should like to make about disability pensions which occur as a result of occupational <Col N="406" /> injuries.  These are traumatic experiences for the people involved.  It is necessary that the cases be heard promptly and sympathetically.  It has been a sad feature for me to find that, in reviews carried out by the Department concerned in regard to the percentage pension which these unfortunate people have received, that the reduction in the pension rate appears rather harsh and does not appear to be given with the amount of sympathy that I would like to see.  Appeals made against such reductions go on for too long a period.  The wage earner of a family has, perhaps, lost a certain amount of income earning capacity and the Department should ensure that he is treated with the utmost sympathy, both in regard to the hearing of the claim in the first instance, and particularly in regard to any review of his case.  Where an appeal has to be made by him as a result of a reduction in his pension that appeal should be concluded very sympathetically as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>To the Minister of State I say that this Bill is, as expected, an improvement on the 1955 Factories Act.  It is to be welcomed, but it does not take away from the fact that a great opportunity has been lost whereby this field of safety in industry could have been tackled in a most comprehensive manner.  As it appears to date the legislation on the stocks is incomplete and the working party must immediately get down to the task of ensuring that the very many fields which appear to have been left out, which are not covered adequately if they are referred to at all, must be given far greater coverage by safety measures for the future.  It was regrettable that the social partners were not brought in.  It was one field where there would have been nothing but the utmost co-operation and it would have been a great opportunity for the Government to let it be seen where the social partners could give of their very best in improving a most crucial part of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Safety in Industry Bill as it comes before us is welcome.  It will not be opposed unduly on this side of the House, but in welcoming it we continue <Col N="407" /> to maintain that the Minister could have done in much better job in regard to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill updates and makes immediate improvements on existing legislation in industrial safety. While employers clearly have a responsibility, successful industrial safety is not a one-sided affair.  Workers themselves have an interest in safety which should be reflected in active involvement with their employers in promoting and achieving appropriate industrial safety standards.  In this connection, as emphasised by Senator Markey the experience of the Factories Act 1955 has been disappointing.  Workers have availed of the right to set up safety committees in about only one in 65 of the premises on the Factories Register. Safety committees can serve to promote safety at work, thus reducing preventable accidents.  Clearly industrial accidents can be costly in financial terms to all concerned not to mention the untold human misery that can be caused from time to time.  Moreover, in the context of worker participation safety committees provide an opportunity for workers actively to participate in this vital area of working conditions.</P>
      <P>On a more positive note I welcome the Minister's initiative on the proposed working party to study safety and health in a broader context than in industry alone.  This should bring about the comprehensive study that Senator Markey is advocating and clearly it is going to take several years to complete.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself contains many desirable features, and I wish to refer briefly to a few of them.  Section 3 has been substantially changed following proposals submitted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers. This is certainly a desirable development and it augurs well for the effective implementation of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 39 obliges the occupier of a premises to provide a written safety statement.  This should act as a stimulus <Col N="408" /> for the formulation of a safety policy and is certainly a step in the right direction. Section 11 permits the Minister to serve a prohibition notice.  The position up to now has been that where equipment or processes could cause a risk of serious injury, it has been necessary to go through the courts before such activity could be halted.  In addition to the time involved in going to the court, the dangerous activity could continue until the court decided otherwise.  Under this Bill the Minister is empowered to stop a dangerous activity immediately if the circumstances warrant it.  This will avoid unnecessary and potentially dangerous delays where the risk of serious injury is concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his officials for the very considerable effort that has obviously gone into this Bill and I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Minister, Deputy Brendan Daly, on his first visit to the Seanad.  I wish to congratulate him warmly on his appointment as Minister of State and wish him every success in his new and onerous position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  I appreciate fully the reservations that have been voiced on this side of the House about its shortcomings.  Its general thrust and intention are altogether commendable.  I want to give my full support to it, particularly to the aspect that allows for a long review by a working party for well considered legislation on this very important area of our lives.</P>
      <P>The one question I would like to ask is in regard to the public conscience in relation to safety in industry and hygiene in every area of our lives.  The track record of the Irish in this respect is very poor. Senator Hillery quoted statistics that the workers in only one factory out of 65 bothered to set up a safety committee in order to look after their affairs.  That bespeaks a deplorable apathy on the part, not just of workers, but of the country at large.  I wonder to what extent the management encouraged them to do it in these cases.  What general communal concern was there about safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> We need massive education in this area.  We have been rather slipshod and makeshift in our attitude towards a matter that should be of very great humane importance to us, that is the safety of people when they work, the resultant effectiveness of their work if they are safe, and the pride they take in their work if they are thinking actively about how well their work proceeds, their equipment serves them and the hygiene&mdash;I mean hygiene in the largest sense&mdash;surrounding their operations.</P>
    <P>This last point is one that everybody in Ireland should take cognisance of.  We are probably the dirtiest race in Europe. The symptoms of this are obvious, not just when one moves into a factory or a garage or into places where people are working, where one sees the deplorable unconcern about the most basic decencies of hygiene, but when one moves through the country.  If one calls into some of the more vainglorious roadhouses, say between Dublin and Limerick, one can see what the lavatories are like, see that the floors have not been swept for days, see the ashtrays piled high, see the marks of spittle on the counters, see the absolute contempt for basic hygiene in the way the glasses are washed and the way drinks are served.  It is a matter of utter disgrace to the country.  If one is to experience culture shock in the real sense it is to move from Ireland to France or to anywhere in northern Europe and suddenly realise that one is in an environment where cleanliness is a major priority and where people are proud of their premises, all kinds of premises including industrial and catering premises, where people work.</P>
    <P>This situation can be cured in two ways.  It could be cured with punitive legislation and I would be all for punitive legislation.  If I had plenipotentiary powers I would have inspectors call on these roadhouses and if they did not live up to signs outside the door as being pleasant and habitable I would start by refusing them the right to advertise.  Let people find them out but do not let them advertise what they are not supplying.  A <Col N="410" /> few sharp inspectors could raise the standards of hygiene in the country very rapidly, by a number of these punitive swoops.</P>
    <P>On a larger scale, an increased drive towards education in this matter of hygiene should be instituted.  Wherever people work, whether on the factory floor, in the pub or in the large catering premises, if these basic levels of hygiene are not observed our whole sense of dignity as a nation suffers.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I would like the Minister of State to take cognisance of the fact that we have a long way to go before we have a sufficiently alert and alive conscience on the matter both of safety and of hygiene in practically every area of our public life.</P>

      <P>In presenting this excellent Bill this afternoon, the Minister is probably unduly reticent and humble in his approach. I refer to his statement where he said that the Bill does not mark a radical departure in our approach to occupational safety and health.  That is not by any means to imply that wider aspects of safety and health at work are being neglected.  I wish to make it clear that they do not come within the scope of the Bill, nor would it be appropriate that they should.</P>
      <P>The Safety in Industry Bill, 1978, is an excellent one.  It has dealt with the vital aspects in so far as they can be dealt with at the moment.  Part II of the Bill mentions practically everything one can think of, from the duties of persons employed right through prohibition notices, noise, temperature, accommodation for taking meals and so on and washing facilities, cleaning of machinery and protection of eyes get honourable mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> To my mind the most important section in the whole Bill on which the efficacy and the success of the Bill depends is in Part III.  That is the section dealing with safety representatives, safety committees, safety delegates and safety statements.  To write or to frame a comprehensive Bill on safety would require the best brains we have in this country.  In addition, such a job would require many years, and no matter how well the job would be done there could still be failures and more accidents and deaths, that is, unless we come face to face with what I think is absolutely vital in our approach to this question of safety, because whatever may be in our mentality as a race, we have three situations to contend with.</P>
    <P>First, in industry we have no tradition. By tradition I mean the sort of tradition that obtains in countries that have been industralised for many years.  It is in the comparatively recent past that industry has been developed here and problems are arising that we never had to deal with in our history.  Along with that&mdash;again the question of race comes into it&mdash;we have a false idea very often of what courage is.  Courage may not be equated to carelessness, and unfortunately in our mind it very often is.  I remember how often when we were going to school we dared each other to do this, that or the other, and the person who, for instance, would not jump off the highest pier we could find in the locality was more or less branded a coward.  So we just did it in order to keep our dignity and our status.  Unfortunately, as far as the Irish race is concerned we are inclined to let that attitude continue into manhood.  We run extraordinary risks, and it was only recently when I was reading some of Aristotle I came to a remark of his where he was dealing with foolishness in behaviourism and he mentioned that he had heard that even the Celts at that time often undertook to roll back the waves single-handed.  We are apt to be very careless, to equate, as I say, carelessness with courage and to despise any safety precautions of any kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> Finally, the third fault we have to find with ourselves is simply that we are very often satisfied with half measures.  If, say, there is a question of erecting a scaffolding, how many people except the real professionals will erect it in a kind of way that is not ultimately safe?  When somebody draws attention to the fact that all the precautions have not been taken somebody will come along and brush aside the objection and simply say &ldquo;it is all right.  It will do.  It might not fall down at all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before we can say to ourselves that the implementation of this Bill will be even 50 per cent effective we must, by every means in our power, by the educational process, at first level, second level, and third level, in all our dealings with factories and with employees, with employers' organisations and with trade unions, keep on emphasising that we cannot get the work done until such time as we make sure that all safety precautions are attended to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He and I have been very good friends.  We have often stayed in the same hotel and discussed our problems. We were the best of friends and I should hope we would remain so.  Perhaps from time to time I will be knocking on his door looking for favours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is much improved on that introduced by the Minister for Labour in the Dail on 25 April, 1978.  That is nearly two-and-a-half years ago, and it has taken that length of time to bring the Bill to the state it is now.  Even though it has taken so long it was worthwhile to have waited for a Bill such as we have here this evening. I should like to compliment all those who helped the Minister.  He did not act on his own.  He was helped by the Opposition Deputies in the other House and by some of his own Deputies also.  He was helped also by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  This in itself showed that the workers through their unions and the employers through their unions felt that <Col N="413" /> there was a necessity to improve the Bill, a Bill that was out of date in 1978. Technological change in industry over that period has been great and more people were working in industry in 1980 than was the case in 1978.  Young people had to be protected in the workplace, and this Bill in one way or another seeks to protect them.  It is a Bill that should help to prevent many tragic accidents. Accidents will happen in the workplace, no matter how careful employers and workers may be, as a result of something other workers will do such as leaving electric wires loose and that type of thing.  Therefore, the formation of safety committees is a very important step. This Bill did not just set in motion the formation of safety committees.  The safety committees have been there for a long number of years.  I know that because I represent management on a safety committee.  I work in an industry where there are more than 2,000 people employed, that is the creamery industry in Mitchelstown.  I should like to compliment the inspectorate who have been visiting us from time to time there.  They have been very pleasant and because of their visits there have been improvements in the workplace in Mitchelstown Creameries.  When management and workers hear that there is an inspector coming to visit the place there is a rush-around in order to ensure that everything is all right.  I am sure the inspectors know all about what happens.  At the same time one must give due credit to the inspectorate for the role they play in helping to improve safety in the work place.</P>
    <P>Safety regulations are very, very important, and we can identify areas where most of the problems are.  In my opinion most of the problems, as has been said in the other House, are really caused by the workers themselves, not intentionally I may say, but unintentionally.  This is because of the pressure of work, or because of long hours, or because of rushing to get machinery installed so that production may start on the floor and that the machinery may be paid for as quickly as possible, and not enough interest is taken in the safety aspects of the machinery.  I see that the Bill covers all <Col N="414" /> of that.  It is a pity that there are only 274 safety committees in 18,000 work places or, has been said three safety committees to every 200 factories.  I would recommend that each of those 18,000 work places should have a safery committee. I think management should insist on the formation of safety committees.</P>
    <P>It is very important that accidents are reduced because of the effect that accidents have not only on the person involved but on his family.  If the father of a family is injured, the entire family are affected.  When notice is given by the inspectorate that improvements should be carried out on the factory floor, they should get notice within a short time that the work has been done.  When notice is sent to management that something needs to be put right, there is an obligation on them to see that the dangerous element in the industrial apparatus concerned is rectified.</P>
    <P>I would insist as a representative of management that not alone should management see that faults are corrected but also the safety committees should be notified that there is a dangerous section within the area of employment.  I would also agree that when the inspection is taking place both management and workers should be represented on the inspection team.  This would give greater assurance to both management and workers that the safety of the work place is being regarded as a top priority.  I attend safety meetings and I hear many complaints from the workers.  I investigate those complaints and, as I have said, many of the faults are caused by the workers themselves.  For instance, they are not very aware sometimes of the need to keep a place tidy.  Perhaps in rushing off to lunch they neglect to take proper safety measures.  Somebody in the process of wiring a motor, for instance, may be called away to do another job, thereby leaving the first job only half done.</P>
    <P>Naturally, such a situation creates a dangerous area within the work place.  It is a pity that it is allowed to happen, but no matter what legislation is imposed and no matter what the inspectorate say, <Col N="415" /> unless you have a live safety committee and management represented on that safety committee you will have this sort of thing happening all the time.  If representatives on the floor of that safety committee saw that happening naturally they would alert management very quickly of the danger.</P>
    <P>There is one area in which there is often carelessness, that is, where contractors are installing machinery or building factories.  Where I work the safety committee are adamant that contractors carry out their job as any safety committee would wish it to be carried out, to ensure that the scaffolding is erected in a very safe way, to ensure that the installation of machinery is carried out in a dry area, where there is sufficient light, where people can move around and where there is room to move around the machinery.  It is often the case where heavy machinery is installed in small areas that are dark that the movement of people around that machinery is very confined.  The safety committee should insist in that regard that they have something to offer, and that they would guarantee that the safety of their own workers is protected.  It is often the case that scaffolding is not properly erected, that loose planks are put across where people walk so that when you walk on one end the other end of the plank lifts up, thereby causing an accident.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of safety in the work place is that of fire safety regulations.  The causes of fire should be seen to be eliminated.  Anything can cause a fire, especially a worker smoking a cigarette, going into a corner and dropping the butt.  I have seen this happening, and the amazing thing is that when you speak to workers and chastise them and go back and inspect that area again within two or three weeks you find that the offence has been committed again.  It is amazing that some workers do not recognise the safety committees.  In cases of breaches of safety regulations, the safety committee should report immediately to management.  That is the procedure where I work.  Management <Col N="416" /> should then investigate what is happening. My personal opinion is that if after a worker has been warned on being found in breach of the regulations, he should be dismissed on being caught committing a second offence.  There should not be any leniency in regard to a worker who endangers the lives of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The provision of fire alarms, too, is very important.  All personnel should be made aware at the existence of such devices, and these devices should be examined periodically by the inspectorate. They should be examined at least every six months.  It is very important that people be trained as to what to do when a fire starts within a factory.  There should be periodical fire drills.  Breathing apparatus should be readily available and there should be suitable harness to allow people to escape.  I noticed when I started in this field that offices are very much neglected in this area, especially offices two or three storeys high where the exit of the office is only one door and then probably down a stairs and out the next door.  It often happens that people are trapped in such areas.  The inspectorate must ensure that people in offices have at least the same protection as those who are working on the factory floor.</P>
    <P>The placement of telephones within factories and within offices is also very important.  The safety committees should know where the telephones are placed. When a fire starts the telephone is the quickest way of getting the message across to people from one area to another, and also the quickest way of informing other workers of the easiest way to escape.  It is important in this context that there be a sufficient number of telephones available, regardless of the cost.  Management must ensure that sufficient fire fighting apparatus and water are available.  I must compliment the inspectorate in that they concentrate on all these points.</P>
    <P>Another area is noise and the wearing of ear muffs.  It is very strange that many people do not wear ear muffs regardless of how noisy a place is.  I often inspect areas where I would think ear muffs <Col N="417" /> should be used but it is amazing that one usually finds at least one or two people not wearing ear muffs.  There should be insistence on this sort of protection in areas of a certain level of noise.  The same might be said about goggles.  We know how important goggles are especially in the machinery section of the industry where, because of the type of work going on there are very bright lights that could harm the eyesight. There is also the danger of flying splinters. It is amazing that very often workers fail to take the advice of safety representatives in this regard.  Usually in my area management is notified and once the management goes there the eye goggles are on.  When the management go there the eye goggles are on again. When the management leave shortly afterwards the same people are not wearing the eye goggles.  I do not know what can be done about that.  I do not know if they can be sacked for not wearing the eye goggles.  I do not think that can be done because the owners would not allow that to be done.  Some stern warning should be given to them by the workers themselves.  The workers should see that those things are being worn.</P>
    <P>I worked in a food area where the machinery was six or seven feet up from the ground and it was necessary to wear caps because loose hair could get caught in the machinery.  You will get some people to wear them and others will not wear them.  Unless management insist on them being worn they are not worn.  The only people who can insist that those people carry out their instructions are the people on the floor working with them, even putting some type of penalty on them or informing the safety committee and the safety committee having the authority to penalise them in some way.  That would be one way of safeguarding them if they are not trying to safeguard themselves.</P>
    <P>Further areas in the work place which are very important are places where people can have something to eat or where they can wash up.  This is an area where there is carelessness, especially in <Col N="418" /> the wash-up area, where people half wash themselves and then dry themselves with a clean towel and after five or ten minutes the towel is very black. There is need for safety here, as any dirty towel is not a safe thing to have around.  Bacteria are carried.  This can cause rashes and skin disease.  Inspectors should insist that towels are kept clean, and the management should see that this is done.  Those people who are not obeying the rules should be chastised by the workers even if they have to notify the management.  Often when the workers notify management they are the worst in the world for coming along and spilling the beans on some other person.  For the safety of all concerned they should be brave enough to do that.</P>
    <P>Other areas that can be dangerous are areas where acids, caustics and dangerous materials are compounded. The fault for putting them in an unsafe way is not merely that of the workers but of the suppliers.  Often the supplier's driver is in a hurry and puts them anywhere he can get an open space. Management could do more in this regard.  They could stop the purchase of the caustics or acids from that company. That would quickly clear up that area.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas I would like to talk about but I would go on for too long and would repeat the same thing about different areas.  I would like to see what the Bill hopes to achieve being achieved.  It is very important that there be total safety at work.  The Bill will help in that regard.  I would like to compliment all those who helped in the production of this Bill.  On behalf of the workers and on behalf of management I would like to say again thanks to all those who helped in this regard.  I hope this is not the end.</P>
    <P>The quayside is another area at which a new look must be taken.  I know what happens at the quayside.  Even though I work in Mitchelstown I come from Dungarvan, which I am proud of, where boats come in.  It can be very dangerous unloading or loading boats.  There are not enough safeguards at present in the loading and unloading of boats.  When <Col N="419" /> lorries pull in there and the hoist comes up it can be very dangerous.  I am sure the inspectorate could look into it and see what can be done in that area.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural end of safety there is a lot to be recommended.  Recently I read of an accident where a young man was shifting a container by fork loader when the container slipped and killed the young man.  I do not know how we could safeguard that type of person.  At the same time, there is a need for alerting the people working on farms to what should be done in regard to their safety. Another area where it is also necessary to safeguard people on farms is where they are using poisons to kill weeds. These poisons can burn the hands.  They are not covered by the Bill.  Some other type of Bill should be introduced to cover those people, because not alone are we protecting the farmer or his family but there are a lot of other people who work for the farmer and who are hired by him who may, because of the negligence of the farmer, be in danger.  It is necessary to look at that and to see that those people who are working for others should have safeguards.  I hope the Minister will look at that aspect and see how it can be improved.</P>
    <P>There are many lectures and courses given on safety.  The National Industrial Safety Organisation give courses and it is amazing how few people attend them. The main reason may be because management do not encourage people to attend them or do not pay their wages while they attend them.  These courses are very important to management but workers' representatives should also attend them because they can learn a lot from them and can help to make the work place a safer place.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about the statement Senator Martin made about dirty Ireland.  I do not believe him. I have travelled in many countries and through areas that were dirtier than Ireland.  Some of the other countries are dirtier than any place you would see in Ireland.  I am not saying that all of those places that are dirty should not be <Col N="420" /> cleaned up.  They should.  We are as clean as any other country in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of other Senators in relation to this Bill.  It was interesting to read at the end of the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>I think it should be apparent that the two years during which the Bill was before the House were beneficial in terms of improving the content of the Bill as originally presented.  Bearing in mind, particularly, that the Bill in its present form has accommodated, to the greatest extent possible, the proposals made by ICTU and FUE.</P>
      <P>When we look at another section of the Bill we find that these two groups for the past 23 or 24 years should have been charged with callous neglect when we see that in section 73 of the 1955 Act workers were entitled to set up safety committees.  The unions and the employers should have ensured that these safety factors were set up.</P>
      <P>At this particular stage it is a lot of rubbish for Congress, the trade unions or, indeed, the FUE to come along and indicate their anxiety in relation to safety factors.  I feel that 23 or 24 years ago, when an effort was made to ensure the protection of workers they should have made available the necessary machinery to ensure that the safety factors were installed. There are problem employers and problems with employees but this shows that there are two sides guilty of callous neglect over that period.  I wonder no matter what type of legislation is brought before these Houses no matter what type of legislation we pass here, if the same people are involved in the future, will they treat the new legislation with the same type of neglect as they did in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are working here from a base of 4,073 accidents notified to the Department plus the accidents that were not notified plus the coverups, which are very substantial in industry.  I worked in CIE, Aer Lingus and other industries and I know the situation very well.  I was <Col N="421" /> once a union representative.  I know the callous regard unions and employers have in relation to safety factors.  I hope the Minister, when this Bill is passed, will ensure that there is a follow-up to see that safety factors are installed and maintained.</P>
    <P>We have a number of undesirable situations at the moment.  From the workers' point of view we have a continuing situation of practices developing in industrial disputes where there is interference with machinery, plants and safety factors by the workers, putting at risk many other workers.  This is a dispicable action.  We must ensure that the trade unions and Congress are made aware that there are factors that have put the safety of workers at risk.  They have been named in this House by me and by others.</P>
    <P>This is a development taking place within the area of industrial disputes, where sabotage has been an undeniable factor in many disputes and workers put at risk by their workmates.  We must have a new look at the whole situation. Legislation must be updated.  The Minister is doing his job, but there is another job to be done.  Our voices should ring out loud and clear to ensure that these practices that are developing in industry are curtailed at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>We should bring it home to the trade unions that they have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their members.  They may think that that is the responsibility of somebody else.  They may feel that unless the employer moves they will not move, they do not want this additional burden.  It is a most important item, and it must be backed up by legislation that will impose fines on people who fail to play their part in protecting the lives of other people.  The accidents notified were: Factories 3,475, in the construction industry 487, electrical 60, warehousing 11, docks and quays 27, mines 5 and quarries 8.  There were 28 fatal accidents in 1978.  The number of cover-ups and the reasons for them are important.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, two cases came to my <Col N="422" /> notice.  The cover-up was because of the failure of the employer to pay insurance in one case and have his employees properly insured in another case.  There are hundreds of cover-ups in industry apart altogether from the notified number of accidents.  The position is more serious than is indicated by notifable accidents. For that reason the Department will want to take a further look at this situation.  After the accident happens we hear the Act quoted time and again by the employers and the trade unions concerned. It is too late at that stage; someone is the victim of neglect.  There is no solution to the problem when the factors are not installed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker, that where safety factors are provided, the abuse of the safety factors by workers on many occasions is responsible for very many of the accidents.  On the other hand, we have the employer who issues a helmet to a worker and thinks that is the be-all and the end-all and the preventive of all types of accidents.  There is much more in it than a helmet and a first-aid kit in relation to accidents.  If legislation is to solve anything, there must be a back-up to this to ensure that what we legislate for will be applied and that the personnel themselves will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>There are, many organised industries, where they are organised on a union basis, but there is a weaker section, the unorganised, where there is no union involved. Then we have another situation, and it is in this area that the Department of Labour will have to ensure that the regulations are applied to people who are unorganised.  There is a very large section of the community unorganised at the moment without the aid of the trade unions to see that their rights are protected. It is in this particular that there is a vast amount of neglect.  Any employer who does not instal the maximum amount of safety equipment should have a sanity test.  The trade unions who do not ensure that the facilities afforded by the Bill in the protection of their members are available should be charged with callous neglect of duty in relation to the safety factor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I hope that it is not the end of the line in relation to safety, because as the Minister states this is one aspect.  On every occasion he comes in here it gives the Members of this House the opportunity to project their views.  Some of these views may percolate back to the various organisations.</P>
    <P>I hope that some form of intensified publicity will be embarked upon by the Department of Labour to ensure that everyone knows their rights and everyone knows what their entitlements are in relation to the development of the safety factors indicated in the Bill.  I wish the Bill success.  I do not want to detain the House any more.  I have put my points to the House.  I hope there will be a follow-up to this, that when the Bill is passed it will not be left there for another 23 years until somebody else decides to amend this particular Bill, and the workers of this State are put at risk during that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the welcome of the Minister to the House.  He has been an extremely effective and energetic Deputy.  I have no doubt that he will be as effective and energetic as Minister.  I am delighted that he should bring forward this particular Bill, which is a very necessary one and brings up to date the old traditional safety measures introduced 100 years or so ago and now very much in need of updating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, in many ways, a totally non-partisan type of Bill and in some ways, therefore, may seem a little bit dull in that it does not provoke a great deal of across-the-House argument for discussion. That does not in any way diminish its importance, as the speakers on both sides of the House have so clearly indicated. It is of vital importance to anyone involved in industry today.  We are rapidly approaching the stage in which the majority of the population are included in some form of industrial process.  The Bill is necessarily limited. There are a great number of situations in modern life which, effectively, are comparable <Col N="424" /> with the industrial situation and yet which are not really covered by this Bill.  I am very glad to know that the Minister is setting up an appropriate committee which will look at these matters in much wider perspective that is encompassed in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>We have been, for many years, very far ahead in industrial safety.  It is very good to see that we are maintaining this situation.  We have a very active group of industrial medical officers, the Association of Industrial Medical Officers or as it is now called the Association for Occupational Medicine, because in fact, we have gone far beyond the very narrow and limited view encompassed by the phrase &ldquo;industrial medical officer&rdquo;. Nowadays we are more and more looking in terms of occupational medicine as a whole.</P>
    <P>We have also set up the first faculty of occupational medicine; we are leading the world in this matter.  I have no doubt, just as we have post-graduate schools in third year on medicine, which over the years has contributed greatly to this country's standing internationally, so also our new faculty of occupational medicine will play a leading international post-graduate role.  I do not doubt that in the new counselling committee that is set-up as well as discussing matters directly with industry, the trade unions and other interested parties, the Minister will also be including the Association for Occupational Medicine for the overall view and the general, not only safety but prevention and increase in health in all people involved in their occupations, whether or not it is in the factory, on the farm or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are specific aspects of the Bill that I would like to refer to very briefly.  I am particularly glad to see section 12 (1), the matter of safety and means of of access and egress.  This has been proved, again and again, over the years to be an absolutely critical factor in safety in the event of any accident, fire or other circumstances at work.  It has been neglected very often.  I am delighted to see it being emphaiised and brought up to date here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> Another factor which has, perhaps, only more recently been appreciated is the effect of noise.  I am delighted to see that under section 13 (1) and (2) the Minister is going to take specific action in relation to noise.  For far too long industrial workers in certain types of work have suffered from the effects of noise even to the extent of, perhaps, incurring permanent deafness.  Indeed it is strange in a way, when one looks back on these Bills which were brought in originally in relation to the cotton and textile factories traditionally associated with Lancashire, the docks, and so on, that one of the factors which was almost totally neglected was the question of noise, and yet if one has ever been in the old style textile factory one will know that the noise is absolutely deafening.  Indeed in Lancashire one could tell the people who worked in the cotton mills because even in their everyday speech they shouted at one another.  Yet this was very largely neglected.  There are many other aspects in relation to noise, and I am glad to see that the Minister is taking steps in this direction.</P>
    <P>Perhaps even more important is section 14 in relation to fumes, and indeed this is carried on in section 21.  More and more we are realising that noxious fumes can have effects both immediately, for example, in relation to an immediate escape of noxious fumes, in relation to a fire where people are usually killed by the fumes rather than actually burned to death, and perhaps, even more importantly and only very recently realised, long-term effects from certain types of noxious fumes.  It is excellent that this matter is being dealt with under the appropriate sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 18 (1) which relates particularly to young people and the question of cleansing of apparatus or moving apparatus is a very necessary aspect. The safety of young people at work has been something which has often been referred to but in practice has so often been neglected.  I am delighted to see this specific section here.  Another excellent section is section 19 relating to damage or possible damage to the eyes.  This is <Col N="426" /> almost always avoidable and yet again so often neglected.  It is very good to see steps being taken in this respect.  One could go on through many of these sections, but I picked out a few which I am particularly glad to see being emphasised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>To be truly effective all these measures require the co-operation of management and workers and indeed of the medical and nursing staffs involved. Unfortunately, all too often this is neglected.  The Department could have a specific campaign to bring to the attention to all industrual concerns the importance not just simply of setting up such a council representing workers and management but of specifically appointing someone, whether he be a member of the industrial staff or management staff or whatever, but one individual, who is charged as convenor of such a committee, seeing that it functions, that it meets.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see also that under the schedule a number of what were really very out of date measurements have been brought up to date.  Unfortunately certain other units being brought in may well have to be updated in a future Bill. One section here shows all too clearly that at the end of the day no matter what steps we take or what safety councils are set up or how much co-operation there is between workers, management, the various inspectors, who are doing an excellent job, and everyone else involved, it comes down to the individual.  This is shown all too clearly in section 29 (9) (a) where it states:</P>
    <P>Every signal given in relation to the moving or stopping of a lifting machine shall be both distinctive in character and such that the person to whom it is given can easily see or hear it, as may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>This in some ways might almost be comical, but in fact it emphasises that at the end of the day it is the individual who has to participate, who has to help in this way.  Again here, we could implement an educational programme.  We have, for example, health examination of workers <Col N="427" /> under a certain age, and we have health examinations for many types of employment. These routine health examinations date back to the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s when vast numbers of people were malnourished, or ill with tuberculosis and all sorts of other diseases and for one reason or another they could not undertake work.  Nowadays, very largely, with certain exceptions, these examinations are irrelevant, and I cannot help thinking at times that the provision of a safety leaflet emphasising the risks and responsibilities of him or her as an individual perhaps, to every worker taking on a job or every executive or anyone else coming into an industrial situation would be money well spent.  Perhaps the Minister might consider some form of education campaign in this respect.</P>
    <P>I join in welcoming this very necessary, very excellent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím an Bille seo.  As other Senators have said, it is extremely important that the emphasis be put on prevention rather than on blame afterwards. I am glad to see that the Bill incorporates the need for this safety statement, which seems to be a means by which we can contribute to the whole spirit of participation which the Minister is very interested in arising from the recent publication of Worker Participation. This is an area where the worker is talking about his own health and safety and the output from it, being a safety statement, seems to be a very sensible way of going about it and I commend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Senators have talked about the need to protect people sometimes from themselves.  I worked in industry for many years and I was very often embarrassed by the fact that while working for foreign industrialists it was difficult to get my fellow countrymen to look after themselves in terms of change of overalls, making use of showering facilities, to avoid conditions of dermatitis that could arise from the type of work they were doing.  As a humorous aside, one of the factors which managed to get workers to be a bit more careful in <Col N="428" /> this regard in the Minister's home county was the fact that workers had to travel on buses into Limerick from Shannon, and because the girls got annoyed when they found themselves going with chaps who did not change and get into nice suits we found that there was a greater pressure on for the use of the showers.  I suppose it helped in the marriage rate as well.  I just could not help making that point.</P>
    <P>There is another instance of where people have to be protected from themselves, not in industry, it is just a natural thing.  One notices the way the hurlers come out to play with their helmets on, but before the match is over they are throwing them off.  In the heat of the moment people will throw off shin guards and helmets, and so also in industry. When the pressure is on people will tend to be careless, and they have got to be protected against themselves.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that in the Bill there are proper provisions for machine examination by competent authorities. There are provisions for proper specifications to be laid down for importers of machines and equipment, and reference to the need for specialist staff. Senator Conroy talked about the role of preventive occupational medicine in this regard.</P>
    <P>I see that noise levels, too, are covered in the Bill and perhaps the Minister might comment on what criteria will be used to assess acceptable levels of noise for different types of equipment.  I will never forget the conditions I worked under with automatic lathes shrieking high frequency noise at me all day.  I wondered what criteria would be used to control that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general point on safety and health in industry, I notice that the EEC have produced a directive on major accident hazards in certain industrial activities which is on its way through the system, though it has not yet come up for consideration by the Joint Committee here.  It brings to mind the fact that this Bill is about covering workers in relation to accidents and the safety and health of workers at the work <Col N="429" /> place.  What about the public who might be affected by instances where things get out of control?  I look forward to further legislation which will look into those matters.  I am reminded here of the disasters at Flixborough, Beck, Sveso and Manfredonia and of the fact that in Ireland we do not seem to have any coordinated approach to handling situations where things get out of control in industry.  I am thinking here of explosive substances and highly toxic gases.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has it in mind to introduce legislation to cover this area.  As this country becomes more industrialised and more and more factories are set up the safety of the public becomes as important as the safety of the individuals at the work place.  In this case we are referring to the difference between routine risk which will arise on an on-going basis and which will give rise to regulations which will determine acceptable levels of toxicity, noise and so on, and exceptional risks which will cause the real damage.  We have got to take a look at this area in the future.</P>
    <P>I gather that some discussions about these exceptional areas and risks to the public are taking place within Departments. I look forward to seeing legislation which will protect the public in relation to processes that might go out of control in the industrial context.  I also look forward to seeing competent authorities set up to ensure contingency planning required to cater for situations like that.  Obviously, that is a further development as other Senators said and it is something that we will be aware of. Our participation in the EEC will provide us with access to any data banks of information available to ensure that we have the best practices here.</P>
    <P>I notice that Senator Butler mentioned the question of attendance at courses to ensure that safety is properly managed in industry, and I should like to support him in this regard.  This should not be seen as some sort of an activity that is confined to one or two people in a firm. If safety delegates or safety committees are to exist there should be a high rotation of people who act on these committees <Col N="430" /> so that this goes right through the whole of any industry.  I am very pleased to see that this Bill, following extensive consultation with the FUE and Congress has now reached the point where it is about to be passed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their welcome this afternoon on my first visit to this House.  As far as I am concerned I will endeavour to keep my door open and to be of any assistance that I can to Senators.</P>
      <P>This was a very constructive and worth-while debate and I have taken detailed notes of all the points raised and we will consider them and take the necessary action on them.  Senator Markey referred to the change in section 12 (3).  The insertion of this subsection in the Bill was made on foot of discussions which we had with the Irish Employers Confederation.  The case put forward by IEC was that given the physical alterations to plant and premises which would in many cases be required to ensure that they were safe, a phasing in period of two years would facilitate effective compliance with the section.  Subsection (3) is designed to accommodate this point by providing that proceedings for an offence under the section cannot be taken until section 12 has been in force for two years.  Section 12 relates to the means of access and exit to working places and safe working places.  This was put in after some discussions between Second Stage and the Committee Stage to facilitate the views expressed by the Irish Employers Confederation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made by Senator Markey <Col N="431" /> regarding the very long delay between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The period between these two Stages was used for the purpose of consultations with Congress and the FUE.  It took some months for both organisations to come up with their joint proposals on Part III of the Bill which then had to be approved by the Government.  I considered the time was well spent given that the provisions in the 1955 Act about safety committees had not worked satisfactorily.  The revision which we were making was in order to meet the wishes of both Congress and the FUE.  I am hopeful now that with the co-operation of the Congress and of the FUE and with the active involvement of ourselves we can make this far more important and get far more safety committees working than the 274 that we had out of 18,000 work places.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey also raised a point about the role of AnCO and the NISO, which I am sure will be the subject of discussions by the proposed working party.  It would be useful for the proposed working party to have copies of this debate, and we will certainly make copies of it available to them to ensure that the points that were quite rightly made are considered when the working party get down to meeting.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey also referred to the conditions in some factories and other premises.  In Part II of the 1955 Act, in section 10, there is provision about cleanliness in factories generally.  In fact there have been very few prosecutions under this provision.  There is provision for fmes for breaches of the factory cleanliness regulation in section 10 (2) of the 1955 act.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Senator Cranitch when he says that attitudes and traditions of employers and workers are of great importance.  It is provided by section 8 of the Bill that workers must take reasonable care of their own safety.  Obviously this would be a difficult section to enforce, but I would take the opportunity to ask employees especially to take safety seriously and not in the <Col N="432" /> fashion that Senator Cranitch described here.</P>
    <P>Seanator Butler expressed some concern about fire and fire hazards and the need to train people as to what to do by means of fire drills.  Several sections of the Bill deal with this area.  Section 23 provides for a fire drill involving total evacuation of the factory at least every six months, and section 27 requires suitable equipment for fire fighting and suitable means of alerting the fire brigade to be available in factories.  Section 22 requires the means of fire warning to be examined and tested at least once every six months to ensure that, as the Senator recommended, it is working properly.  This section also deals with the provision of adequate means of escape in the event of fire.  We have concerned ourselves with what was expressed. It is covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have also noted the detailed points made by Senator Butler, whose remarks obviously result from his long experience in this work situation, and they certainly deserve our attention.  I will draw the Senator's remarks to the notice of the industrial inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Some points made in relation to agriculture really concern the Department of Agriculture who have their own inspectors.  The working party will, I hope, consider this very important point, and if necessary new arrangements will have to be made.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy spoke about the need for an educational compaign.  I understand that the Department of Labour provides a subvention&mdash;it is £300,000 in the current year&mdash;for education to Congress, and the NISO also does some educational work as well.  We propose, when this Bill is passed, to issue a small handbook which will be readily understandable by management and workers.  It will be something like the handbook which was prepared with the Wild Life Bill, giving short, easily understandable details of what is involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised the question of noise levels and different equipment. There are already regulations under the <Col N="433" /> Factories Acts in this regard.  These are constantly under review, and regulations can be made within the Act to meet the problems that arise.  The general noise level will be 90 decibels, but this will be constantly under review.  If problems arise there they can be dealt with by way of regulations under the Factories Acts.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of other aspects about explosives, with which the Department of Justice would be involved.  We will certainly bring all the points raised here to the notice of the working party, which we are hopeful will get under way as soon as possible.  It is important that the contents of the Bill, when enacted, should work right down to the factory floor level.</P>
    <P>This is a detailed and difficult Bill to read.  Most of it is techniclal, and by its very nature it has to be.  We will arrange to draft a simple guide to the Act which will be easily understandable.  It is my intention to raise with Congress as well how best to bring the provisions of Part III of the Bill on safety committees and so on to the attention of all workers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the beginning only and not an end.  I hope to establish the working party on safety in the very near future, to consider safety in its broader aspects. Discussions in the matter are at present being arranged, by Congress and the FUE.  These discussions will also include some EEC involvement.  The findings of the working party should form the basis for further and more wide ranging legislation as well as other possible administrative actions.  I thank Senators for a very constructive debate here this afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage the point in the third interim report of the interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons relating to the treatment and care of persons suffering from mental disorder who appear before the courts on criminal charges.  I quoted from a suggestion in the report that there should be a special unit set aside for prisoners who are disruptive, the prisoners with whom the Minister is concerned in the Bill.  That report suggests that a special unit be set aside for them, but that in relation to orders transferring prisoners from regular prisons to the special unit the decision as to whether or not prisoners should be sent there should be made by the courts rather than by the Minister, which is at present the position under the 1972 Bill. I asked the Minister for Justice last week if he would consider amending the Bill to provide that the court, not the Minister, would have the right to transfer these prisoners.</P>

    <P>Everybody is concerned, obviously, in the first instance, to ensure that <Col N="435" /> prisoners who are disruptive should be kept away from prisoners who are anxious to rehabilitate themselves. Everybody also accepts that, putting prisoners in a military detention centre like that existing at the Curragh further penalises them in so far as discipline is tougher and the freedom, such as is available to any prisoner, is not as extensive for prisoners in the Curragh as it is for prisoners in other prisons.  The educational opportunities and recreational facilities in the Curragh are nothing like those available in other prisons.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's reply to the Second Stage debate he went through the services and facilities available in every single prison in the country&mdash;we like to hear about these things and it is encouraging to know that there are such facilities available&mdash;but if one reads through the report what is signal in the Minister's response is the absolute absence of information about the facilities available in the Curragh.  I interjected during the Minister's reply to the debate and asked him to refer to the Curragh. He said he would get to it.  In fact, he did not.  In fairness, I understand the Department's predicament and the difficulty under which they must operate.  Nobody can deny, and the Minister would not deny, that the living conditions at the Curragh, and the opportunities for prisoners in the educational sphere or in the sphere that might help prisoners to obtain work more easily when they are ultimately released from prison, are far more limited at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>Transferring a prisoner to the Curragh may be necessary because that prisoner is disruptive, but because it further restricts the limited freedom that a prisoner has, some third party, some other dispassionate and objective tribunal or court, should be the proper body to consider whether a prisoner should be transferred from an ordinary prison to the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The report that I refer to acknowledges the need for special units to deal with such prisoners, but it also <Col N="436" /> stresses the importance of having decisions as to whether or not prisoners should be sent there.  It emphasises the importance that such decisions be made by the courts.  It also emphasises the necessity that evidence be given to the court.  The report recommends that the evidence be that of two medical practitioners who can say that the prisoner is suffering from psychosis or whatever. The report suggests that it is very important that medical evidence be available.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that the Minister or his Department would be subjective in relation to decisions like this.  I am sure that they try to bring to consideration of what is a difficult problem as much objectivity as they can. It is important, so far as the public are concerned, and it is particularly important so far as we as Members of the Oireachtas are concerned, that that decision should be taken from the Department of Justice simply to ensure that we all have a say, that is it objective, it is dispassionate, it is away from the prison service and away from the administration responsible for the prison service in which those particular prisoners have caused difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether, in the circumstances, in view of the fact that this legislation has now been in existence for eight years and the Minister is seeking an extension of another three years, he would consider handing over to the court the power to decide whether prisoners should be transferred to the Curragh.</P>

      <P>First of all, the Henchy Report is under review at the moment.  The matters that the Senator has raised and the position of the Minister are an Executive responsibility. There is little that the Minister can do in that particular regard, it being his responsibility and so established.  The Minister has promised to write to the Senator regarding facilities in the Curragh.  I will give the Senator some idea of the recreational facilities and educational facilities that are available in the Curragh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> Prisoners engage in indoor games and hobbies on the ground floor of the cell block or in their cells.  The following equipment is provided: a table tennis table, chess sets, ring boards, draught boards, playing cards, a television set and video tape recorder.  There are facilities for such craft work hobbies as leather work, matchstick modelling and painting, which are popular among the prisoners.  Prisoners are also allowed to have their own transistor radios, cassette recorders, without microphones, musical instruments at the Governor's discretion and subject to proper use.  Those in possession of musical instruments are permitted to hold music sessions in each other's cells.  Film shows may be allowed once a fortnight.  The films are hired from commercial sources.</P>
    <P>A well equipped gymnasium is also provided and is used daily by the majority of the prisoners.  Equipment provided includes a cycling machine, rowing machine, medicine balls, bars with weights and overhead speedball and platform speedball, shirts, singlets and boxing mittens.  Additional equipment may be obtained on loan from the Army School of Physical Culture.  Physical training classes are held twice weekly by a PT instructor from the Army School of Physical Culture.  Classes in English and art are provided twice weekly by qualified teachers employed by Kildare Vocational Educational Committee. Text books and art material are provided.  Efforts are being made to secure the services of a music teacher. Mr. K. Warner, co-ordinator of education in the Department of Education, advises on educational matters at the detention barracks.  It is hoped to provide improved classroom facilities at the barracks in 1980.  There are comprehensive indoor facilities available, both from a recreational and educational point of view.</P>
    <P>Outdoor, an exercise yard is available. This area is used for playing football, volleyball, tennis, basketball and walking. The yard is also used for some of the physical training classes and a PT instructor organises games and competitions. <Col N="438" /> A small covered shed in the yard is used for handball.  Footballs and handballs are provided from public funds.  The prisoners are free to be themselves for 12 hours each day.  Exercise and recreation is allowed from 10 a.m. to 12 and from 14.00 to 16.00 with an extra hour for tea in the summer.  I imagine that the Minister on the last occasion here went into the disciplinary situation in the Curragh, and it does not differ from what obtains and exists in the other civilian prisons in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information which he has given us. First of all, I want to say that I do not accept that the facilities, so far as education and sports or any occupation are concerned, are comprehensive at the Curragh.  If one looks back at the debate in the House last week, if one compares the facilities available in the Curragh with facilities available in the other prisons, the Curragh comes out very very badly.  I do not believe for a second that the Minister present would suggest otherwise.  The Minister, Deputy Collins did not do so last week.  I do not hold that against the Government particularly, but we must acknowledge the fact that the regime at the Curragh is tougher, more difficult and that the facilities are far less than they are in other prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with what the Minister has said in relation to my request that consideration be given to removing the responsibility of the Minister to decide whether or not to transfer a prisoner from any prison to the Curragh.  I accept that it is the Minister's responsibility, but I question the equity of that eight years on from when the original legislation was introduced as a temporary expedient.  I would ask for some more definite and acceptable reasons why these decisions should not be made by the courts.  If this was the first time the Bill came before the House, fair enough, I think that we might have to say: &ldquo;It is going to last a couple of years and we are stuck with that&rdquo;, but the Bill has come before the Houses of the Oireachtas on three different <Col N="439" /> occasions and extensions have been allowed on three different occasions. I do not hold that against the Fianna Fáil administration.  All political parties were involved in it.</P>
    <P>Two extensions have been asked for by Fianna Fáil and two extensions by the Coalition Government, so I am not trying to apportion blame.  What I am saying is that just one amendment to the section would remove the responsibility for transferring a prisoner from the Minister's hands to the hands of the courts.  The desirability in that is to show everybody, including Members of this House, that the decision as to whether a prisoner should be transferred or not is made by a third party, or a body that is totally removed from the present prison structure and the administrative structure of the prisons.  The importance of doing that is because prisoners' rights are further restricted once they are put into the Curragh.</P>
    <P>It would require no big administrative change to do it.  The easiest imaginable amendment to the 1972 Act would effect this change.  I do not believe that any undue burden would be placed on the court system.  It would relieve the Minister, who I am sure is a very busy man, from responsibilities that he has at the moment, but I emphasise again the important thing is that the decision-making power in this respect is seen to be objective and prisoners would have the right to have their side of the story considered in open court.  That result would be extremely desirable, given the fact that all political parties have been involved in these extensions over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already said, it is an Executive decision, and I am satisfied that if given over to the courts the responsibility that the Senator speaks of would create an unworkable situation within the prison system and in relation to prisoners.  While I value the Senator's comments and appreciate the concern that he expresses in giving them, one must also realise that there is a particular <Col N="440" /> type of prisoner involved in this situation. It is not the usual situation and it is not the wish of the Government that we have to live with this fact.  The reality of it is that we do and, in the situation that we speak about, these prisoners, because they have disruptive tendencies and certain failings that are not commonly found in the normal average prisoner in this country, find themselves isolated in a different environment.  Were that not the situation there would be no problem whatsoever having them in the ordinary civilian prisons.</P>
      <P>There have been many statements about the unsuitability of the Curragh for long-term prisoners and I agree that conditions there are not ideal, although I understand that improvements are being made, but the conditions there, even now, are much better than they are in some areas of the civil prison system. Mountjoy Prison, which has about 150 long-term prisoners, is not suitable for them in its present condition, neither is St. Patrick's Institution suitable for juveniles, nor is the existing women's prison suitable for women.  There are many groups of prisoners in the civil prisons who have less congenial conditions than those in the Curragh.  That is not to say that I am satisfied about the conditions in any of these places.  I am not.  The extensive building programme that is under way shows that something positive is being done about the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I must get some more definite answer to this.  We went into all this last week.  I accept that these prisoners are difficult prisoners.  I do not dispute any of that.  I hope that the Minister is not suggesting for a moment that the Curragh is a more attractive place than other prisons because on no reading of any Minister's speech since this legislation was first mooted away back in 1972 could one take an interpretation like that from it.  Every single Minister who has come before the Houses, of all political parties, has apologised for coming before the Houses and has asked for understanding on all sides because they have had to introduce this legislation.  I think we should set the <Col N="441" /> issues clearly before us.  There are difficult prisoners involved, that is accepted. Circumstances at the Curragh are more restrictive, to say the least, than any other prison.  The big difference between the Curragh and ordinary civilian prisons is the fact that it is administered by the Defence Forces and not by the ordinary civilian&mdash;if that is that the correct expression&mdash;prison service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say that people are penalised by being put into the Curragh but prisoners' rights, limited as they are, are further restricted when they go to the Curragh.  I do not believe that the Minister denies that the disciplinary regime at the Curragh is tougher.  I think, inevitably, it must be tougher because the people who are running that prison are people who have been trained in military service, members of the Defence Forces whose ideas and notions of discipline are far different from the ideas and notions of discipline that are instilled in the officers of our prison service.  I do not blame them for that, that is their training and that is the way it must inevitably be.  I am merely saying that the Minister should have some better reason for saying that the courts should not decide who should go to the Curragh other than to say that it is an Executive decision.  The 1972 Prisons Act said that it was an Executive decision.  I want to know why that decision, made in 1972, should not now be changed, and I am using as my main reason for arguing that point the fact that it was originally intended, when that Bill was drafted in 1971 or 1972, that it would be an expedient that would last for only two years.  It has lasted eight years so far; it has had three extensions already and it is now proposed that it last a further three years.  In supporting the overall purpose of the Bill, as we do on this side of the House, we acknowledge the difficulties that the Minister has in relation to the provision of this extra accommodation that is now being undertaken in Portlaoise. However, we have a responsibility to ensure that prisoners are not subjected to anything more than the civilian courts decide to inflict on them when they imprison them initially.  The passage <Col N="442" /> of the 1972 legislation takes things further.  Matters have been raised as to its constitutionality.  One prisoner challenged the constitutionality of the Bill and failed.  Nobody can deny that it is a further restriction on a prisoner's freedom when he is incarcerated in the Curragh, and I think that the decision over that should be taken by the court and not by the Minister's Department.  I would ask him to give some more comprehensive answer than that which he has given already.  Has the matter been considered?  If the Henchy Report is under consideration at the moment that is one simple recommendation.  There is no difficulty adopting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it is unworkable, he has not said how or why it would be unworkable. I do not see how or why it would be unworkable, and I do not accept that the Minister has given any reasonable argument why it should not be done.  I would ask him for some more comprehensive answer to my question.</P>

The Minister indicated to us that the punishments that were imposed there were in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down for civilian prisoners.  To imply that the military personnel are inflicting a different or a tougher type of punishment is a reflection on these people.  On the last occasion I raised this very matter and I did not think that Senator Molony was adopting the same attitude of trying to imply that the military personnel were inflicting undue hardship on prisoners.</P>

It was also accepted that it was on a temporary basis and the solution to the problem was the building of a prison at Portlaoise, which is being undertaken. It was agreed that there was no punishment inflicted, other than that being applied to ordinary civilian prisoners in other institutions, and that remedial measures were taken to relieve overcrowding and to ensure that the services and facilities were up to the highest possible standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occassion we had a discussion here&mdash;it is not proper to refer to Senators in their absence&mdash;and I am sorry that those who participated in the debate are not here.  There is much I would like to say in relation to their attitude, not on the last occasion, but this afternoon.  When this important matter come before the House it would seem <Col N="444" /> that it was so important that we were all to be issued with up-to-date reports, up to the minute reports and they had to be in our hands by 4 o'clock in order that we would be fully briefed to come into this House at 6 o'clock to debate the situation, and they still have not turned up.  I want to say that there is a lot of hypocrisy, and I quote what Senator Robinson said on Second Stage:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposed to the Bill on several important grounds of principle.</P>
    <P>I hoped that she would be here to either indicate her pleasure or displeasure, or have they now accepted in totality the Bill as it stands?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>What reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons stated, that it would be an unworkable prison system.  I do not intend to dwell any further on that particular aspect.  There is no foundation for the suggestion made by the Senator that there is an oppressive or a more strict regime in the Curragh.  The function of the Curragh is to hold in safe custody a number of prisoners who cannot be held in safety elsewhere, and that is all.  The basic conditions in the Curragh are, broadly, the same as those in civilian prisons.  The Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, have their parallel in the Prisons Act, 1972, and Military Custody Regulations, 1972.  Thus, for example, allegations of disconduct by prisoners must be dealt with by the governor of the Curragh in precisely the same way as they are dealt with by the governors of the civil prisons.  Prisoners who have complaints can seek redress through the same channels as other prisoners, including access to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the prisoners in the Curragh are known troublemakers and disrupters, and they have demonstrated in the past a capacity and a willingness to foment disorder <Col N="445" /> among the other prisoners.  Some of them have been involved in disturbances in the past while serving previous sentences.  Their objective is to create so much trouble in the civil prisons as to make them unmanageable.  It is in the best interests of the management of the civil prisons and of other prisoners that they should be separated from the general body of prisoners.  The Curragh offers the only means of ensuring such separation until a high-security prison is built.  There is in the Curragh a social welfare officer, through the Department of Justice, to cater for the welfare needs of the prisoners.  I am perfectly satisfied with the system that obtains at the moment. While we might like to have another situation in operation, that is not possible.</P>
    <P>Active consideration, as I have already said, is been given to the provision of an additional building which can provide a high security situation for this type of prisoner.  In the meantime, I want to assure the House that the prisoners in the Curragh are there for the reasons I have mentioned and there is no question of hardship or of any more oppressiveness being imposed because of the fact that they are there.  Broadly speaking, the conditions in that prison are the same as in the civilian prisons and, indeed, my reference today to the facilities, both educational and recreational inside and outside the prisons are certainly something that should give the House and its Members confidence in the concern that is being displayed by the Minister in ensuring that the proper and best interests of the prisoners are at hand and being constantly considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the question I asked?  Is he familiar with the report?  The Minister is suggesting now that the facilities at the Curragh are comparable with those of other prisons.  If one reads the speech of the Minister for Justice of last week, one finds that he detailed the facilities available in other prisons but if one compares these with the facilities that the Minister says are available at the Curragh, one must accept that there is a very great difference between the two.  I am not blaming the Government for this. I am simply using it as a reason to indicate why there is a difference between the two.  I say that given that difference some question should arise as to the tribunal or the body or the person who is responsible for transferring prisoners. The Minister has said that he has considered and has decided against the proposal that I make to him because it would make the prison system unworkable. He has not given the reason for this, and actually says that he is refusing to elaborate on what he means. Given those circumstances I am certainly suspicious as to what thinking is going on in the Minister's Department about this.  If the Minister were to elaborate and give some reasons why it would be unworkable, then if those reasons are compelling I would understand them, but the Minister is saying that he will not elaborate on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that as a former member of the Garda Síochána he has <Col N="447" /> visited the Curragh and was satisfied with the situation there.  This is fine, but I would like to tell him that the committee who have been appointed by the Government to visit the Curragh are dissatisfied and have been dissatisfied since the foundation of that prison.  I want to ask the Minister specifically whether he has read those reports or whether he is familiar with the recommendations and with the points they have made with regard to the inadequate facilities in the Curragh.  I must say for the umpteenth time that I am not blaming the Minister or his Department for that: force of circumstances has brought that about. What I am saying is that by any standard, facilities at the Curragh are different, are more strict, are worse than they are in other prisons.  I refer specifically to the reports of the prison committee to witness what I am saying. Given those circumstances, the Minister is entitled to answer my question as to why he would not consider transferring the power to transfer prisoners to the Curragh from the Department to the courts.  All he has said is that this is unworkable. He has not said why it is unworkable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The disposal of prisoners once sentenced is the function of the Executive, and the Minister responsible for the proper management of the prison system, in order to fulfil his responsibilities, must retain discretion to transfer prisoners from one place to another and in and out of military custody.  It would not be a workable proposition to hand over any of these powers to the courts.  Furthermore, I also make the point&mdash;and this has been made before&mdash;that it would be preferable if we did not have to have these particular type of prisoners in the Curragh.  It has also been said before and I am saying it again today that, broadly speaking, the conditions and the facilities in the Curragh are the same as conditions in the other prisons.  In some instances, you have better facilities in the Curragh than you have in civil prisons and in other areas you have better <Col N="448" /> facilities in civil prisons than you have in the Curragh.  If it were possible for the Minister to dispense with this method where the Curragh is concerned he would be only too delighted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr Molony Mr Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the last point the Minister has made.  I am not going to mention again the limited facilities in the Curragh.  I would just refer the Minister and every other Member of this House to the reply to the debate last week of the Minister for Justice in which he detailed the facilities available in other prisons. Unless there are fantastic facilities in the Curragh to which the Minister has not alluded, we must conclude that the facilities of the Curragh are more limited.  We are told that art and English are the two subjects in which classroom facilities are available in the Curragh. The Minister's speech was dotted with the tremendous facilities available in other prisons which cover a far wider range of subjects, including carpentry, cabinet making and so on.  None of those facilities exist in the Curragh, and I am blue in the face in trying to make the point clear that facilities are different there.  I will not make it again.</P>
      <P>I will go back to the major point that I am trying to make in all of this and I would remind the Minister that the responsibility he has to transfer prisoners from ordinary prisons to the Curragh arises through the operation of section 2 of the 1972 Prisons Act.  There is no power other than that.  The power to sentence prisoners other than that is given to the courts under the Constitution. The Minister has no power under the Constitution in this respect.  He is taking powers onto himself under the Prisons Act, 1972 which we are now been asked to amend.  I am asking the Minister why he would not consider amending section 2 (3) of the 1972 Prisons Act, and I want to say that I am dissatisfied with his failure to elaborate on his reasons.  I would ask him to detail the grounds upon which he says it would be unworkable.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Senator Molony would agree, that the <Col N="449" /> maintenance of order in prisons is a very vital necessity.  I would hope that he would also agree that one of the great difficulties of recent years in many countries has been the breakdown of effective prison administration and discipline.  We have all, on both sides of the House, agreed that this situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Curragh is for many reasons unsatisfactory and that we hope in time to change it.  But effectively the position at the present is that a Minister quite rightly the Minister for Justice, has responsibility for our prisons and for order and discipline in prisons.  I am sure that Senator Molony would quitely rightly be among the first to object were order or discipline in our prisons to begin to breakdown. This is a necessary measure for the time being to maintain this order and discipline, a responsibility of the Minister which he is carrying out and which he should continue to carry out and in no way should transfer into what could well be a very prolonged, inefficient and ineffective court process.  This is necessary for the discipline to be maintained in our prisons and it is a vital factor for the maintenance of law and order and discipline in this country, a law and order and discipline which is under very considerable threat at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not think it should be interpreted at all that Senator Molony is saying something other than what he has been attempting to say.  He is simply making the case that perhaps the final decision as to whether transfers should take place from civil prison to military custody should be put in the hands of the courts rather than in the executive hands of the Minister responsible.  We are talking about a principle in this whole matter which cuts very deep to the core of any democracy, namely the transfer of people from civil prisons into military custody.  None of us like that.  We do not like to see it happening but in such a Bill as we are presented with here we are going to postpone further discussion on this very deep principle involved for three years&mdash;until 1983.  We will not have an opportunity to discuss this principle. It is rather incongrous to me that <Col N="450" /> people who are in civil prisons for what can be ordinary criminal matters but who due to some mental disturbance or some quirk of the rule of nature or whatever, are regarded as being unmanageable, are transferred by decision of the Minister responsible into military custody, particularly without any accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would prefer to see a Bill such as this coming before us on a yearly basis until the need for it no longer exists rather than disposing of it here and not giving us the opportunity of discussing it for another three years.  If I felt that the high security prison on which construction has begun would be completed in a short time, that in other words it would be operational before the three-year period had expired, I would say well and good, but we have it from the Minister's own speech that the prison will not be ready for at least three years. I find it rather difficult to accept a situation where we will not be able to discuss this matter of transfer from civil prisons into military custody for another three years.  That is why Senator Molony raised this point that surely this matter of decision should be left to the courts. At least that would keep this problem in the public focus.  We may well be trying to cover up a very deep sore in our society by disposing of this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the crimes that these people have committed were associated with political violence which was pre-eminent in 1972 in an emergency situation and which could be said to give rise to the situation, one could say that we have to accept that as part of the emergency situation that continued to exist but we are not in the same situation that we were in in 1972.  I wonder in regard to these prisoners who have been transferred in the intervening years, what length they are serving.  Are they there for ten years or 15 years?  Would it be right to keep them in such an environment in the Curragh for a period like that without having further opportunities for discussion by the Oireachtas on the matter? The Minister has not answered Senator Molony's question as to what is wrong <Col N="451" /> with giving to the courts the right to determine transfers.  He is not trying to read anything else into it or say anything other than that.  We abhor the situation that we are presented with, whereby people are taken from civil prisons and put into military custody.  We are just trying to have it continually exposed to the public as well as to discussion and debate by the Houses of the Oireachtas. If we pass this legislation we will hear no more about it for three years.  There is no point in the Minister saying that we can talk about it on the appropriate Estimate each year.  That is not an appropriate occasion for discussion of the principle which is involved here and which cuts very close to the whole core of any democracy.</P>

      <P>In introducing the Bill to the House last week I think I detected in the Minister's speech a note of reluctance, an understandable reluctance and a reluctance that has been shared by almost everyone who has spoken on the Bill.  As the Minister said, the principle of the military custody of civilian prisoners is objectionable.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that it is not unconstitutional because at least while we are debating this Bill we will not have the spectre of the Supreme Court breathing down our necks to say that what we are doing is repugnant to the Constitution and thereby giving the citizens of the State another opportunity of pondering whether they are in fact being governed from the Four Courts or from Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers have spoken about the unsuitability of the Curragh as a prison. One of the minor facts that I should like to refer to about the unsuitability of the place is that since the introduction of this Bill the Curragh Camp has become a no-go area for civilians.  This is regrettable because it is a good thing to see a good relationship between the military personnel on the Curragh and the local community, particularly when in the local community there is a long tradition of careers in the Army.  There was a time when one could drive through the <Col N="452" /> Curragh.  One could go to the cinema in the Curragh.  One could go into the chapel there and say a prayer or have a drink in the Curragh, but not any more. However, while we all have our reasons for regarding this Bill as unsuitable, yet in the heel of the hunt, while we all know some of the facts, the Minister is the only man who because of his position and responsibility knows all the facts.  He is entitled&mdash;indeed he is obliged&mdash;to take any steps that he thinks fit to ensure that the citizens of the State and the institutions of the State are adequately protected. In that regard what Senator Molony suggests&mdash;the Minister should abrogate that responsibility by handling over his executive power to the courts&mdash;would not only be undesirable but it would be a very dangerous precedent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the point made by Senator Molony that the decision-making process should be transferred to the judiciary, there is a serious principle involved.  This responsibility rests with the executive branch of Government.  The Minister and the Department have this responsibility for our prisons and to seek this change seems to suggest that they are not suited to the job or are incapable of carrying it out in a responsible and impartial way.  I do not know whether that actually was intended in part or in whole by the suggestion but it is entirely without foundation. Indeed it is mischievious.  Apart from that point of principle I have no doubt that there are many great practical problems involved.  The circumstances in which it is necessary to have prisoners transferred to the Curragh arise partly from the absolute necessity to preserve order and a proper way of life and carry out rehabilitation in our civil prisons. This is a very serious job that goes on every minute of every day and very often there is a great deal of urgency and a great deal of decision making needed, and to refer that to the judicial process <Col N="453" /> as a matter of necessity each time a decision arises could be absolutely impractical and counter-productive as far as the preservation of good order in the interests primarily of the prisoners themselves are concerned.</P>
      <P>Whatever one says about the facilities in the Curragh, I see nothing wrong in the selection of art and English as subjects for study.  They have a very basic quality and a basic addition to make to a lot of the remedial education that is needed in those cases.  It is an essential part of the rehabilitation work that is done.  However that is not the main point I am making here.  My final point is that regardless of who makes the decisions as to whether prisoners should be transferred the facilities are going to be the same.  I do not see the relevance of that point in relation to the plea that this decision making process should be handed over to the judiciary.  I fully accept that the proposals the Senators on the opposite benches are making are impractical from the day-to-day point of view and in relation to criticising the facilities in relation to this point as to who should make the decision, they are basically illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to set straight a couple of points.  I do not suggest and I was at pains to point out that I was not suggesting, that the Minister was anything less than objective and dispassionate in making decisions in these matters.  The importance that I see in transferring the role the Minister now has to the courts is to ensure that all members of the community are satisfied that it is objective.  Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.  That is the principle behind my argument.  Secondly, I want to say again that I do not understand the preoccupation that Senators Cassidy and Donnelly and the Minister have shown in relation to this executive power that the Minister has.  The fact is that the Minister had no power to transfer anybody into military custody until the Prisons Act of 1972 was enacted.  That is the only reason the Minister has the power.  There is no well of authority the <Col N="454" /> Minister has that allows him to transfer people into the custody of the military.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution does not anticipate, except in the most extreme cases of emergency, the incarceration of private citizens of Ireland into military custody. It had to be done as a necessary expedient in 1972 and the Prisons Act had to be enacted in order to give the Minister the power.  That is beginning and end of his responsibility and power. I want to remind Members of the House that because the Minister had to seek the permission of the Houses of the Oireachtas in obtaining for himself what is called executive power we in effect are the people who are deciding it, not the Minister.  It is not a power that the Minister or the Government have.  It is a power that we are giving them, and we are giving it for the reasons that the Ministers says.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy says the Minister knows all the facts, but I say that if we do not know all the facts, we have no right to pass this legislation.  In fact our duty must be quite the contrary.  Our responsibility is to ensure that we know all the facts.</P>
      <P>In the Second Stage debate I diverted to the fact that the prison's committees reports are sketchy&mdash;they are very inadequate. The ordinary prisons report published by the Department of Justice includes no report on the Curragh.  It is a very different prison.  It is not a civilian prison.  It is a military prison.  The Minister has no power whatsoever in this regard other than the power bestowed on him in 1972.  He is coming in now and asking us to extend that power, and what I am saying is that it is no longer a temporary expedient.  It was a temporary expedient in 1972.  I accept the necessity for it.  I accept that the prisoners are disruptive but I say that the responsibility is ours.  We must know all the facts, and if the Minister says it is unworkable that the courts should operate this system, I say he should tell us why it is unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure Senators Donnelly, Cassidy and Conroy that there is no question of the courts being unable to <Col N="455" /> handle this.  In fact the suggestion from me that this matter be transferred to the courts is not an original one at all.  It is taken straight from the Henchy Report. They suggest that it be done.  In a draft Bill that they enclose in their report there is set out the manner in which the legislation might be drafted.  It is very simple and it could be done quickly and efficiently. I sincerely hope that Senator Donnelly's suggestion that the manner in which people are transferred to the Curragh is by way of split-second decisions is not accurate.  I understood that a full review took place before these people were transferred to the Curragh.  If I were to think for one second that split-second decisions were made about transferring people from Mountjoy or Arbour Hill to the Curragh, I would object most strenuously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the Senator made to the House was that the courts would not be quick enough in arranging the transfer of a prisoner to the Curragh.  There is no difficulty.  The application that is set forth in section 27 of the draft Bill proposed by the Henchy Committee Report is something that could be effected in a matter of a couple of days.  I hope that at least that length of time is given for consideration by the Department as to whether any prisoner should be transferred to the Curragh.</P>
      <P>I am getting away from the main point.  The main point is that it is our responsibility.  There is no particular divine right or responsibility that the Minister has.  We are giving it to him and we are giving it to him today.  I have asked a question that I still have not got an answer to.  Why is it unworkable? Why should not the courts have the right to decide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The military custody in this situation is something that results from the fact that these prisoners have to be isolated because of accommodation not being available.  The Minister exercises the power given to him under the particular Act we are dealing with and he is exercising it again because of the nature of the situation that is involved. The Senator says he does not like split-second decisions.  When an incident occurs in a prison, as has happened by these people who are destructive in many ways, a split-second decision must be taken to isolate that person.</P>

      <P>By the Minister, to transfer him.  If we did not have that situation quite clearly the prison system would become unworkable and would break down.  That, I think, is an answer that is understandable and clear.  I have hoped that the Senator would have identified that as a fundamental reason why this power must be retained in the hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Henchy Report, the Senator has given that as one of the only reasons why this executive power should be removed.  I want to state also that the Henchy Report, which is under review, refers only to mentally-ill and maladjusted prisoners.  There is a constant review and examination of the condition of these prisoners.  Any situation where there is requirement of that type of assistance or treatment from prisoners, I can assure the House it would be made readily available as it is both in civilian prisons and in the Curragh.</P>

      <P>I am horrified at some of the things I have just heard from the Minister.  He tells us that the Henchy Committee Report is under consideration in the Department.  He then tells us that a major section of it, paragraph 12 of the report, and section 27 of the proposed Bill are now, so far as the <Col N="457" /> Department are concerned, completely unworkable.  One presumes from that, certainly in so far as those suggestions of the Henchy Committee Report are concerned, that they have been considered by the Department, they will not be considered in future, they are out of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>M. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no question of misleading the House.  I am going to detail to the House the contents of that report.  The first point I want to make about what the Minister said last relates to the fact that the Henchy Committee only considered prisoners who suffered from some mental disorder.  I want to refer the Minister to paragraph 12 of that report which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill provides for a special category of persons who are not suitable for detention either in a prison or in a designated centre. Those are violent persons who come within a class sometimes referred to as psychopaths or sociopaths but which we consider it more proper to identify as persons suffering from a persistent disorder or disability or personality which manifests itself in abnormally violent or aggressive conduct.  Because of their propensity to cause injury to themselves or to others, such offenders create problems of security and therapy or care which prisons or kindred institutions are not equipped or staffed to cope with.  Nor would designated centres be suitable for the detention of such persons, for, as the committee has been advised, such persons are not generally amenable to any conventional psychiatric therapy and the conditions of high security which they require would be otherwise counter-productive in a designated centre.  As there is likely to be at any given time a small number of such persons requiring suitable detention, the Committee envisages the designation by the Minister for Justice of a unit, which the Bill refers to as a special unit, for the detention of such <Col N="458" /> persons.  The special unit should be designed and run so as best to deal with the special problems presented by such persons who, according to the expert advice available to the Committee, do not fit into any recognised category of mental disorder and who do not accordingly qualify for exemption from criminal liability by reason of mental disorder.</P>

      <P>I want to stress that paragraph 12 which I quoted is concerned entirely with the type of prisoner that we are concerned with here.  There is no question of any difference.  These are disruptive prisoners that everybody acknowledges must be handled in a special way.  I very much regret the Minister's indication.  Perhaps I misunderstood him.</P>

      <P>I will look at the record and see exactly what he said, because I am quite convinced that he said that the matter of the transfer of those prisoners being a power reserved for the Minister needs to be left that way so that split second decisions can be made in relation to them.  I want to point out to the Minister that the Henchy Report suggests otherwise.  The Minister tells me the Henchy Report is under review, but he seems to have indicated that that particular <Col N="459" /> question has been reviewed and that it has been rejected by the Department. I ask the Minister to comment specifically on the suggestion I made.</P>
      <P>I do not only rely on the Henchy Report as a reason.  I use that simply to show that it is not an original suggestion from myself.  The reason I would like to see it there is because I believe that it is desirable, in the circumstances, that the intervention of an outside agency would play a crucial part in the transfer of prisoners to the Curragh so that, as I already said, justice would not only be done, but would be seen to be done.</P>
