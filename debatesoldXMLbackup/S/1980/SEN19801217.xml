      <P>I would like to enter a <i>caveat</i> with regard to No. 5, the Casual Trading Bill, which proposes major changes in the law relating to that particular area.  So far as this party are concerned we would be objecting to taking Committee Stage of that Bill today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the idea of having a separate Committee Stage on the Casual Trading Bill.  It is a Bill that proposes considerable changes and it would be appropriate to have a separate Committee Stage on it.  I would also like to ask the Leader of the House whether he is in a position to give any indication with regard to No. 12.&mdash;the Domicile Bill, 1980&mdash;which I tabled on behalf of the Labour Group some weeks ago, I am not pressing for the Second <Col N="546" /> Stage of that Bill to be taken before Christmas but it has been circulated to Members of both Houses and it also has been available to the Minister and the officials of his Department.  What I would like is to have an early debate on it in the next session.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could say whether there is any indication of whether the Government are prepared to accept it and, secondly, if it will be possible to have an early debate on it in the New Year.</P>
      <P>My other question relates to the subject matter of the rest of this week: are we going to sit for the Appropriation Bill debate and, if so, what are the sitting hours proposed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to No. 12, I will make inquiries and I will let Senator Robinson know the position.  With regard to the Appropriation Bill, the intention is, hopefully, that we would finish the Bills on the Order Paper this evening and that we would have tomorrow and Friday to deal with the Appropriation Bill.  Perhaps it will be necessary to vary that slightly, but that is the intention. Obviously the Appropriation Bill must be finished before we rise for Christmas.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an enabling measure to raise the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund from £1,500 million to £2,500 million.  The fund is simply a mechanism for channelling moneys to local authorities.  Revising the statutory limit has no policy implications for the programmes financed through the fund; the financial allocation for these programmes are determined annually in the budgetary context.</P>
      <P>Exchequer loans are made through the fund to finance essential capital services of the local authorities, including vocational education committees and harbour authorities.  The Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, which set up the fund, imposed a limit of £5 million on total issues.  The limit has been increased periodically by successive enactments and was last fixed at £1,500 million in 1978.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have become increasingly dependent on the fund.  In 1979 almost 90 per cent of capital expenditure on services wholly or partially financed from the fund was met from the fund, such as, housing, sanitary services, vocational schools, harbours and itinerand resettlement.  Issues from the fund have increased substantially in recent years.  The level of annual issues has risen from £171 million last year to an estimated £222 million in 1980.  This reflects, in particular, increased provision for local authority housing, including the house purchase loan scheme, the loan and eligibility limits of which were increased by the Government with effect from 1 February 1980, and increases for water and sewerage schemes to service new housing development, to provide infrastructure for new industry and agriculture and to maintain the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 31 October 1980 total issues from the fund were £1,445 million, of which £729.5 million was for local authority dwellings, £360.9 million was for house purchase loans and supplementary grants and £247.2 million for sanitary services. The balance of £107.4 million was provided <Col N="548" /> for vocational schools, hospitals, harbour works libraries, itinerant re-settlemrnt, fire stations and so on.  At the present rate of issues from the fund the limit will be reached early in 1981.  It will be necessary to raise the limit substantially to provide for estimated requirements over the next few years.  Accordingly a new limit of £2,500 million is proposed in the Bill which I trust will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very necessary.  In his speech the Minister clearly states that it will be necessary to raise the limit substantially to provide for estimated requirements over the next few years.  Everybody agrees with that.  What local authorities want to know and what they should know in January after the budget, or whenever the Minister thinks suitable, is what amount of money will be available to them for the coming year. Over the last few years local authorities have been getting money piecemeal. Schemes have been submitted by every local authority to the Department of the Environment for infrastructure, for the building of roads, for new buildings, to provide the necessary services, water, sewerage and so on in a number of villages in my own county and I am sure also throughout the country.  Some of these villages have no water supply or sewerage scheme.  The larger towns are seeking extensions to water and sewerage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most substantial increase given since 1935 when the Local Loans Fund was initiated, an increase from £1,500 million to £2,500 million.  The big problem is that there is no guarantee that that £2,500 million will be utilised for the purposes the Minister has mentioned.   In his reply perhaps he would convey to the House what will be the situation.  We welcome the increase but it is necessary that the money be channelled through to local authorities.  The Minister and, indeed, everybody in the country knows that local authorities were never worse off for money, as anybody who applies for a loan from any local authority is aware.  The application must be processed and sanction given before work <Col N="549" /> commences.  When a house is half built such people make application to the local authority and find they are placed on a waiting list.  They could wait a month, two months, three months before being paid the loan.  This usually affects young married people who are then depending on bridging loans and who are being haunted by bank managers.  They are writing to them, calling to their houses; they are being embarrassed in every possible way, due entirely to the delay in the payment of the loan.  That is the situation obtaining in my county.  I know it is the situation obtaining in Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo.  I am sure the very same situation obtains in other counties.  I am sure other Senators will have something to say about their own counties.</P>
    <P>I shall be giving figures with regard to local authority housing in a few minutes. In my opinion the number of local authority houses being built this year will turn out to be much fewer than in any other year.  In recent years the trend has been for the number of local authority houses to drop.  This year I predict that the number will be even fewer, through no fault of the local authorities.  They have the machinery, the engineering staff and all the expertise required.  All they require is the necessary money and it is out of this fund that that money should be made available.  We all know that housebuilding in the private sector is coming gradually to a halt; it is slowing up.  I say this with some authority because I happen to be in the builders' providers business and I know how slow it has been over the past 12 months.  One has only to look at the drop in the sales of cement over the past year, and they are dropping continuously.  No matter which builders' provides one talks to they all have the same story.  The sales of damp-proof courses used in the early stage of building are dropping continuously also.  I do not know what can be done about the private sector because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could the Senator relate that to the Local Loans Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not see how he could not because it is all borrowed <Col N="550" /> money.  If one looks at the private sector, at what is being provided by the building societies the banks and so on, it is the same story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the number of houses built over the past few years, whether by local authorities or any other building agent.  The average cost of a local authority house in 1976 was £8,553.  In the third quarter of this year, according to the bulletin issued by the Department of the Environment, the average cost of such house had increased to £22,161.  That is a very substantial increase.  Indeed, it constitutes the highest overall increase.  The figures with regard to building societies, insurance companies and the banks are embodied in that bulletin.  This House is responsible for the provision of money for the Local Loans Fund and that is the net result. Ultimately that means that there is no way young married people can afford to borrow amounts of £22,000 or £23,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  They would be unable to meet such repayments.  The net result is that there will be more people in the higher wage brackets coming to local authorities asking them to build houses for them.  I hope this increased Local Loans Fund will be sufficient to meet this new and higher demand.  In addition, over the past six or eight months reconstruction grants were paid. These loans are still available to people but the grant has been withdrawn.  This has meant that there are now a number of young married people living in houses or in flats which are in a very dangerous condition.  Indeed, they may well be fire hazards, rat-infested and so on.  Local authorities cannot close their eyes to this type of person for whom a house will have to be provided.  Indeed, house prices are still escalating.  There has been the latest wage agreement which will push up the price of houses yet again. The price of materials escalates daily which means that young people will be unable to afford to buy their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to one other section <Col N="551" /> of the community, small farmers seeking rural houses.  There is not a local authority in the country who have not a substantial list of people who have gone through the processing machinery of local authorities and who have been recommended for houses.  From memory I would say there are approximately 60 to 70 waiting in my county to go out to tender but the money is not available. When replying I hope the Minister will be in a position to say when this money will be made available, be it 1 February, 1 March or whenever, or that it will not be made available.  These people are entitled to know whether they will get a house next year, the year after or if they will ever get one.  The Minister should be truthful about it.  Having said that, I have never found the Minister to be anything but truthful.</P>
    <P>In addition, money came from the Local Loans Fund for the development of sites.  Traditionally in the months of October and November a large number of extra people were employed by every local authority.  They were given employment for the Christmas period on the development of these sites and various other matters involving expenditure under the Local Loans Fund.  All of that has been withdrawn.  The position in every county since September is that the ordinary county council worker is being laid off.  At one stage I think there was a drop of some 55 in my own county.  Heretofore we had money available with which to employ extra people at this time of the year.  They required the employment to yield them an income and additionally they succeeded in getting stamps, which was of great benefit to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in, and the extra money being provided by, this Bill.  Any of us who is or has been a member of a local authority will appreciate the tremendous work the Local Loans Fund afforded local authorities, especially those in rural areas, Without the fund local authorities could not survive.  Therefore, the extra provision is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that I come from the <Col N="552" /> county adjoining that of my colleague, Senator Reynolds, I have seen no difficulties whatsoever being experienced in getting housing loans.  I should like to say to Senator Reynolds, with regard to the management in his county, that in any county in which there is good management there is no difficulty experienced in getting money to pay loans on houses, none at all.  In County Donegal we do not experience money to pay loans on houses, none at all.  In County Donegal we do not experience any difficulty in paying housing loans &mdash; and I am proud to be able to say that, We have a very high development programme.  As soon as the application conditions are met the loan is paid. There is no difficulty experienced, no problem of a bank not trusting an applicant about the amount of loan that will be paid or whether it will be paid.  It is a straightforward, simple transaction to obtain a housing loan.  It might call for some explanation or help from an elected representative &mdash; he may have a role to play in this &mdash; and that is the area into which Senator Reynolds might look.</P>
    <P>The extra provision of funds is more than welcome to any member of a local authority in a rural area because we see its full benefit on the ground.  In rural areas the local authorities are largely dependent on the Local Loans Fund. Unfortunately the building societies do not have the same interest in rural areas. They are inclined to spend their money where the very high value of property is maintained, where the increased value of property is likely to continue.  Therefore, the Local Loans Fund has a major role to play in helping the rural community. I would have strongly opposed a move not too long ago by the Government to subsidise the building societies, in so far as any such subsidy would help a very small section of the community only, those people in high-growth city areas, housing built on high development and of high value.  Certainly that subsidy would contribute very little, if anything, to the rural dweller, or those in search of houses in rural areas.  I am glad that that subsidy was discontinued and I hope it will never be resumed.  The proper way to channel money is through the provisions of the Bill before this House.  I compliment the Minister.  I know he comes from <Col N="553" /> a rural constituency and understands the plight of those living in rural areas.  I think that has enabled him to see the need, and I can see that as having played a major contribution.</P>
    <P>I do not want to answer all the points raised by Senator Reynolds.  I was surprised to learn that Senator Reynolds would advocate the building of small farmers' houses.  All of us realise that the reason we are not building sufficient houses is that our capacity to build them must be related to our capacity to pay for them.  Small farmers' houses carried a rent ceiling of about 50p or 55p per week in some counties.  This was scandalous, bearing in mind the cost of the site, site development, footpaths, lighting, water and sewerage and so on, with the house costing £20,000.  It would cost £60 to £80 per week to pay the interest alone.  Yet we were renting such houses at 25p or 50p a week.  Very often when the tenant was selected for a house it might have been justifiable to rent it to him at 50p a week.  But all too often &mdash; and I could name a hundred cases &mdash; we had tenants of SF houses paying 50p a week who had four members of their family earning £250 or £300&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, the Chair feels that the Senator is going too deeply into housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely respect your advice, a Chathaoirleach.  I will adhere to what I consider to be important.  If I do deviate it will be on account of the extreme interest I have in the provisions in this Bill.  I sincerely hope the Minister will not proceed along the lines suggested by Senator Reynolds.  No money should be provided from this Local Loans Fund for the building of houses the rent of which is ridiculous.  It all adds up to those on waiting lists, who are in desperate need of housing, being neglected and houses not being provided because there is a limit to the amount of money that the State can provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to voice my opinion as a rural Member of this House and as a member of a local authority in rural Ireland.  The provisions of this Bill are very <Col N="554" /> welcome in a vitally important area.  I hope the Minister will keep the extra provisions under constant and careful surveillance, that he will continue to improve and extend the provisions under this heading.  At the same time, I hope he will keep a careful watch on how the local authorities spend this money.  I sincerely hope that none of it is spent in providing houses to be rented at 25p or 30p a week, but rather that a realistic rent be charged.  I sincerely hope that none of it is spent on providing houses at 25p and 50p a week and that we are realistic about the rents being charged. Only by so doing will we provide sufficient houses for those who are in very bad need of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the opening statement by the Minister of State that this Bill is an urgent one in that the present ceiling of £1,500 million on the Local Loans Fund has almost been reached.  This Bill seeks to add a further £1,000 million to that fund for an unspecified time.  The Minister does not specify how long the period to be covered by this Bill will be.  Certainly, as a member of a local authority, I share with other Senators in a similar position an acute awareness of the financial crisis in local authorities and, therefore, we would do nothing to delay this Bill.  Indeed in the Labour Group we would wonder whether the proposed increase is substantial enough to meet the very serious crisis in areas of local authority jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular I should like to begin with the housing crisis.  It is impossible to consider this Bill without referring at least briefly to the way in which it is proposed to dispose of the moneys from the Local Loans Fund.  As I understand it, approximately two-thirds of this fund are allocated for local authority housing, for house purchase loans and for supplementary grants.  On Monday, 15 December, a special meeting of the Dublin City Council was requisitioned by the Labour Group because of the extent of the housing crisis in Dublin.  This is the most seriour challenge facing local representatives in the Dublin area: the fact that the housing <Col N="555" /> list reflects a very severe social problem, the fact that the population in the greater Dublin area has increased very dramatically over the past half decade, while the amount of money, particularly in the private sector, for house building and the amount of house building have declined.</P>
    <P>This is a very severe crisis for the local authority because we are dependent on the allocation of money from Central Government and, in particular, dependent on allocations from funds such as the Local Loans Fund.  If the Minister of State had been present at the Dublin City Council meeting the other right, it would have been clear to him that, right across the board, local councillors are extremely worried about the situation.  Again and again the point was made that it is impossible to get a local authority house allocation now, unless the family has special priority.  It is no longer possible under the points system to have a reasonable prospect of an allocation of housing.  That has put an allocation of housing.  That has put an enormous strain on the local authority.  One of the reasons for this strain is the high interest rate and the fact that the private construction industry has moved into the more luxury market, so that those families and those individuals who would like to obtain a mortgage and get their own house find themselves unable to do so and are forced to go on the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>Another very important factor is the cost of local authority housing.  This is deeply relevant to the question of the size of the Local Loans Fund.  The average price of a local authority house in 1976 was £8,553.  In the last quarter of 1980, the average price of a local authority housing is £22,161 and, in centre city areas, the price is higher because of the high cost of sites as well as other inflationary aspects in the construction industry.  That has seriously aggravated the housing crisis and yet this Government refuse to consider a Bill to control the cost of building land, to control the cost of sites.  That is a blatant failure to meet an important part of the housing crisis.  For so long as the price of housing can be exploited in an unfettered way on the private market, <Col N="556" /> and for so long as people can make profits out of the development of sites for housing, then the cost, both to the private builder and, more importantly, for the purposes of this debate, for local authorities trying to house families in their area, will escalate, not in small amounts, but double and treble over the years.</P>
    <P>For that reason I should like the Minister to be a little more precise about the period for which he thinks this Bill will run.  How long is it estimated that, under the present terms, the £1,000 million extra, which is being sought in this Bill, will last?  If there is to be any meeting of the real social needs, then the view of the Labour Group is that this is an underestimate at present costings.  The reasons are very clear.  We have no control over building land.  All Government policy is directed away from the availability in the private sector of cheap housing for people.  The Foras Forbartha report establishes this.  The construction industry has moved into the luxury market.  A much higher percentage of houses are now five bedroomed luxury houses, and freestanding houses.  Those who already have homes are converting a £40,000 home into a £60,000 or £70,000 home because of the advantages of high mortgage relief, the general taxation advantages and the increase in their assets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The Minister's speech introducing the Bill was very brief.  The Bill itself is brief in its terms but it is an extremely important measure and it is impossible to assess it unless one looks at how the present Local Loans Fund is being administered.  It is proposed to increase this fund by about 60 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Col N="557" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is not the proper occasion to have a full scale debate on housing policy.  As a member of a local authority, I have to view the Local loans Fund as being a very important facility for improving the extent of local authority housing, SDA loans and other grants for housing.  In that context, it is important to be critical of the present administration of the fund.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few more remarks on this and also to direct a few questions to the Minister of State which arise from the present administration of the Local Loans Fund and any attempt to increase that fund by a further £1,000 million.  This is the opportunity to do so, and I do not intend to do so at any great length.  It is proper to do so at this stage.  For example, I should like the Minister of State to give us a much fuller breakdown of the way in which moneys have been allocated out of the Local Loans Fund for the period 1977 to 1980.  Would it be possible to get specific figures of how much was allocated from the Local Loans Fund for house improvement grants, for SDA loans and local authority housing in the past year?  One has to see what the priorities are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House improvement grants, which are very important to people who wish to implement improvements in their houses, are nevertheless an allocation to people who already have homes.  They are certainly received gratefully by those who get them.  However, their needs are not as critical as those who have no home or who have totally inadequate housing, people who are living with in-laws, people living in mobile homes with leaking roofs, or whatever the situation may be. I should like to know what priorities at present determine allocations from the Local Loans Fund in the area of housing. Taking guidance from the Cathaoirleach, the Local Loans Fund is not entirely allocated to housing and I should like to know the figures for the past three years of the allocations for other capital expenditure.  The Minister gave very minimal figures for the amounts provided for vocational schools, hospitals, harbour works, and so on.  I should be grateful if <Col N="558" /> the Minister of State would give us a breakdown of those figures.</P>
    <P>The extent of the crisis in local authority funding has been dramatically aggravated by the removal of domestic rates. This is another subject and it is not appropriate to go into it now.  There is no doubt at all that it has left local authorities dependent in a crippling fashion on allocations from Central Government.  It has meant an immediate deterioration in many of the services provided by local authorities.  It has meant either very long waiting lists or an obscure position for those seeking SDA loans.  They no longer can get as quick or as definite a response to an application for an SDA loan.  It has meant a slowing down in local authority building.  It has meant a crisis in road building and a lack of capital investment in other areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are to increase the Local Loans Fund we should do it from a very detailed picture or profile of how the allocations are dispersed at the moment.  From the perspective of a local authority representative, I can speak for the frustrations felt by local authority representatives, of whichever political party.  Even Fianna Fáil local authority members cannot be happy about the strains being placed on local authorities, aggravated by numerous factors and, in particular, in the housing area by the refusal of the Government to control the price of building land and to bring a social dimension and a planning dimension into their housing policy.  I should be grateful for such information as the Minister of State can give on the allocation of the fund.  The Labour Group appreciate the urgency of increasing this fund.  We would like the Minister to be specific on how long he feels this Bill will extend, and when it is likely there will be a further Bill on similar lines looking for a further increase in this fund.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives permission to the Minister for Finance to increase the Local Loans Fund.  It does not indicate how much will be spent on the various categories.  From the figures we have been given so far, 50 per cent of the Local Loans Fund has gone to local authority <Col N="559" /> dwellings and 25 per cent has gone for house purchase loans and supplementary grants.  During 1980 there was an increase of about 33? per cent over 1979.  If we get the same amount over the next few years, then this will last us five years.  On the other hand, if we get an increase of 33? per cent every year, it will last us three years only.  That depends on the general economic situation and on what the Minister for Finance will decide he can afford to give.</P>
      <P>We would all like to get as much as possible.  Industry is asking sincerely for money to be spent on infrastructure. There is quite a development in the Cork area and in Cork harbour and this takes money.  Since the income limit for housing loans was raised in February last the demand has gone up considerably from all the various areas.  We welcome this Bill.  It is a big increase and we hope the Minister for Finance will be in a position to disburse as much as we would desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome extended to the Bill.  It is very necessary.  It is an enabling measure to raise the Local Loans Fund from £1,500 million to £2,500 million.  As has been said by other speakers, this is necessary because local authorities are dependent to a very high degree on the amount of money made available by way of loans.  At present the position of the local authorities is very difficult because of the delay in getting sufficient cash to keep the various services going and sometimes a blank refusal.  A protracted holdup might be a more accurate way of describing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said by previous speakers about the housing situation.  I do not intend to dwell on it.  I am sure the Minister is quite aware of the pressure from local authorities for more money for local authority housing and the need to keep the coffers reasonably well filled to meet applications for SDA loans.  In most counties there is a very long delay after the applications have been processed and found to be in order.  Payment of the money is held up because the council have not got it.  They have to wait for <Col N="560" /> allocations that come down in dribs and drabs from headquarters to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>People are forced to negotiate bridging loans with the banks and in some cases they are as high as £12,000.  The rate of interest charged by the bank is unbearable in some cases.  The pressure is put on.  When the time specified by the borrower runs out the bank loses patience. The borrower then approaches local authority members and the county council offices with a view to getting the loan speeded up.  I hope that, when this Bill goes through and the Department are legally in a position to raise more money, it will be channelled through to the local authorities as quickly as possible to keep the SDA loan scheme in operation.</P>
    <P>There are protracted delays in giving loans for schemes which are absolutely necessary.  For example, in Cavan town the water filter system is not adequate and for the past two years water for human consumption had had to be boiled. The urban council applied time and again for a loan of something in the region of £70,000 to have this matter cleared up.  In the past month or so word came through to the council that this loan would be available.  The case was equally good for that loan over 12 months ago. People in the town had to endure this because of the tardiness in meeting a request that was quite easily justified. The loan should have been paid at least 12 months earlier and this would have prevented a lot of dissatisfaction in the town.  It had to be given ultimately and it might as well have been done at first as at last.</P>
    <P>The very same situation arose with regard to money for an additional housing scheme of 20 houses.  The scheme was sanctioned but the money could not be made available.  The contract was given and the contractor had to stand idly by until the very last days of November or early December.  if this money had been put through earlier in the year, in August or September, better value would have been obtained for the money from the contractor's point of view.  He had to clear sites, and so on, in the winter.</P>
    <P>I come now to a major question. <Col N="561" /> County Cavan has been getting bad publicity lately with regard to water pollution.  The activities of intensive pig producers in the Lough Sheelin area are being very closely monitored and legal action has been taken against a number of them for alleged pollution of Lough Sheelin.  At the same time, untreated sewage from the town of Dowra in County Cavan is polluting the river Shannon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not develop it unduly.  I am simply making a case for urgent allocation of money for schemes that are recognised as necessary.  Nobody in the town of Dowra, nobody in Cavan County Council, nobody in the Department of the Environment could be happy about the river Shannon being polluted from a housing settlement in Dowra. Everybody agrees it should not happen. The case I want to make without developing it too much is that once it is admitted that this expenditure is necessary the money should be allocated as quickly as possible to get on with the job.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make concerns the regional hospital in Cavan.  It was decided, as a result of the FitzGerald Report, that Cavan should be selected as one of the sites for a new general medical hospital.  Work got under way and about £1/2 million was spent on preparing the site. At present there is a standstill, while another hospital in County Dublin that was to start at the same time will be opened in 1982 and the amount of money which was spent on it is about £6½ million. I hope when this Bill goes through and the Minister has authority to put more money into the Local Loans Fund this regional hospital in Cavan will not be forgotten and that the work which is at a standstill now will be speedily resumed. This hospital is very badly needed.  The surgical hospital in Cavan was condemned in the mid-thirties.  I hope the Minister will see to it that sufficient funds are allocated immediately to get the work under way again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but <Col N="562" /> I would draw attention, as has been done by other Senators, to the need for more housing in the respective local authority areas.  There is a list of towns and villages in Cavan where houses are needed.  Due to the business ability and foresight of the county manager large areas of land were acquired five or six years ago convenient to Cavan town and other towns in the county for housing and industrial development.  The council have not go sufficient money to service these sites and to proceed with the building of houses. Building schemes are necessary owing to developments in Cavan town in particular and in Redhills, Ballyhaise, Ballina, Bailieborough, and so on, all over the county.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I want to make.  I know that this is a big problem and one that has been growing for years. It did not all suddenly mushroom during the occupancy of the office of the present Minister.  I do no want to be unreasonable but it is a fact that there are large numbers of villages and towns all over the country where the water mains that were installed 15,20, 30, 40 and 50 years ago are not adequate now.  Therefore, a great deal of work is necessary in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I conclude by saying I hope that when this measure goes through the moneys will be made more quickly available.  The trouble in the past has been that although schemes were sanctioned and approved there were delays in paying the moneys.  I hope the present Minister will see to it that the allocations are made more speedily for schemes that are sanctioned.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local authority I welcome this Bill.  It does not surprise me at all that it is a Minister of State who has served at local authority level and who knows what exactly is needed in that area who should bring in this Bill.  I welcome the tremendous <Col N="563" /> increase and I do not agree with Senator Reynolds that we have to wait for three months for grants to be paid.  Perhaps I am lucky in the county I am serving in but the people in Clare have never had to wait for three months for their moneys to be paid.  In rural Ireland we depend on this loan fund in a very big way and I thank the Minister for the tremendous increase he has given us.</P>
      <P>A breakdown might be a help but only someone in Opposition would ask for some of the things that I have heard asked for today.  I also welcome the moneys being provided for our vocational schools and for hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather chastening to find that in less than two years we have to increase the limit by two-thirds.  There are reasons for this.  It is as well for everyone to be honest and to face up to the fact that the figure now being set is more a mirror of the effects of inflation than any indication of progrss in real money terms by local authorities in regard to their various statutory responsibilities. Anybody who is a member of a local authority knows that in 1980 more than in any other year we have had a process of stop-go in regard to the funding of many of the local authority services, particularly housing.  It is amusing, if not interesting, to find such a wide gulf and I do not mean in terms of the space in this Chamber between Members on the opposite side of the House who say they have no problems in their own elected representative areas and the Members on this side of the House who maintain they have tremendous problems in their own elected representative areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we on the wrong side of?  Is it the House?  If so, it indicates something of which I would be very hesitant to accuse the Government. If it is coming from that side that we are on the wrong side it means that certain local authorities are being favoured at the expense of other local authorities and <Col N="564" /> that I put to the House, is completely wrong.  In the stop-go situation of 1980 county managers have had to defer making decisions on housing loans and even after making decisions, when pressurised to do so, because of the time which had elapsed since the applications were made originally have had then to tell the successful applicants that the moneys were not available for them.  That is a rather shameful position in such a serious matter as housing and in respect of applications submitted by young married couples.  The situation has become so bad that bank managers have begun to look with more than a slight amount of doubt on successive letters issued by local authorities to applicants as security for bridging loans. Apart from having to wait for a couple of months to have an application processed, applicants have then to wait further for the money.</P>
      <P>The cost of housing has escalated beyond a tolerable level.  The house which in the space of only four years has increased two-and-a-half- times in price is very much beyond the capabilities of any young married couple to purchase irrespective of what increases might have been made in the upper income limit.</P>
      <P>The statistics issued for this year show that there has been a reduced number of houses built and completed in the past year.  We have had fewer houses but costing more money than ever before.  If that is not an indictment of something or of somebody I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only in the housing field we find this experience.  We are told that the Local Loans Fund is the source for financing new schools, libraries, fire stations and also the provision of necessary sanitary services and harbour works. Every vocational education committee in 1980 have had to face up to cut-backs in their budget.  Every local authority have had to defer sanitary works.  I know of schemes in County Louth which were ready for tender 12 months ago and which have had to be deferred because the moneys will not be available.  I know of cases in Louth where, in regard to small but very necessary harbour works, the money is not available.  Clogherhead, which five or six years ago was approved in principle <Col N="565" /> for the expenditure of money to keep the pier in being &mdash; not only to repair it but to keep it in being &mdash; is still awaiting the allocation of moneys for the works.</P>
    <P>This is a rather strange situation.  Inflation may well be regarded as the main cause leading to the increase in housing costs and therefore to the increase that is necessary now of almost two-thirds in the Local Loans Fund but inflation was a very heavy headline, one might say, in the Fianna Fáil programme of only three-and-a-half years ago.  We still have a rate of inflation which is, with the exception of our nearest neighbour, without parallel among other EEC members.  We have not got the resources that Britain has to withstand the rigors and the havoc that such a rate of inflation causes.  We continue merrily on the way but promising and spending more moneys than ever before.  Senator McGowan said that in Donegal there is no problem whatsoever in regard to money.  They certainly have had no problem in regard to promises of money but the actual result is another matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement says that the local authorities have become increasingly dependent on the fund.  How could the position be otherwise?  No other means of fund raising has been granted to them by the Minister.  We have many local authorities in the position of mendicants seeking funds from day to day because they have no statutory authority to raise funds of their own accord.</P>
    <P>This is something which the Minister and the Government must have the courage to face, though courage may not be all that obvious in regard to introducing measures which are going to mean extra funds for local authorities, particularly if these funds are to be raised at local level. But it will take courage to introduce some measures to give local authorities extra funds and extra finance.  When we have a Government of Ministers who continuously look over their shoulders for fear of making some unpopular decision which might lose a few votes, I do not think we will ever face up to tackling this situation.  It is wrong that local authorities should have to depend almost completely <Col N="566" /> on the Local Loans Fund because that in turn depends completely on how the Government are able to cope with their responsibility in tackling inflation.  The experience in that area during the past few years has not been good.  If the only bucket which is to be available to finance all the necessary local authority responsibilities is the Local Loans Fund, I am afraid we are going on the path of the health boards whose only source of revenue is what the Government give them. We have seen in the case of the health scheme that we are indeed looking into a bottomless bucket as regards demands which are made continuously on the scheme.  The Government must face up to a certain amount, albeit a very minimal amount, of unpopularity in giving local authorities the means to provide funds for themselves.  That would be giving local authorities financial resources as well as restoring to them the pride and the sense of independence which were so evident up to recent years but which are lacking now.</P>
    <P>I expect that within a couple of years a further increase will be sought.  If I thought that any increase such as that being sought today represented an advance in real money terms for local authorities in their necessary work I would welcome it, but I know that the figure we are talking about here is merely to cover the havoc created by inflation which in itself had been the result of Government negligence.  Unless the Government face up to the task of providing local authorities with means to provide funds for themselves there will be a continuing, never-ending drain on the Local Loans Fund and we may well arrive at a situation even worse than we have experienced in 1980 in terms of a shortage of finance for local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the raising of the limit which allows extra funds to be made available for local authority purposes.  I would just like to address myself to the principles of local authority funding which this Bill is about. We all know that the State is being asked increasingly to carry the cost of infrastructural development and we know that with the rapidly expanding population <Col N="567" /> and a rapidly expanding industrial base there is an increasing demand for infrastructural facilities.  If this trend continues the Minister will be back again raising the limit and looking for more funds.  Earlier speakers have made the point that there are problems.  We all know that there are problems but the fund is not limitless. Just raising the fund by way of a Bill does not necessarily make the money available.  The money has to come from somewhere.</P>
      <P>Those of us on the Government side are just as aware as are the Senators on the Opposition benches of what the difficulties are.  We have made our point to the Ministers over the years and we know the difficulties they are up against.  For instance, I said here that I know that the minimum building requirement in the Dublin area should be 2,000 houses per annum if we are in any way to bite into the backlog.  I accept that.  But to do that would mean that the Government would have to spend another £10 million per annum in the Dublin area alone and that raises questions about the allocation of the available funds.</P>
      <P>Whether you are talking about drainage, or about water schemes, or any other schemes, it is a question of what the criteria are for the allocation of available funds.  This raises the whole question about which the Taoiseach has been speaking in his contribution on the economy, that is, the necessity for private investment as a means of reducing the demands that have to be made on State resources.  Recently we have had examples of that.  We have examples, for instance, of toll roads and toll bridges and there is examination going on of the possibility of private investment in infrastructural projects as a means of reducing the demands on the overall fund.  We have to face up to this &mdash; that the pressure on the fund has to be reduced by more creative partnerships with private funds as a means of providing the infrastructural means that we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not just saying this in public as a member of the Government party to raise issues for the Minister, but I am bringing it forward as a means of communicating <Col N="568" /> this need widely because it would have to get acceptance.  There is a certain tendency for people to expect that the Government can provide money out of the air for anything and we will end up with a nation of people with their hands out saying: &ldquo;Daddy, look after me&rdquo;, to the Government all the time.  No matter which Government are in power we have to stop that if at all possible.  So it is in that context that I am making this contribution.</P>
    <P>For instance, I was in a hotel in London over the weekend and I noticed in the lift a news-sheet which entertains you while you are being brought up to the sixth or seventh floor, or wherever else it is, and one item of news on the news sheet was that &ldquo;Wimpey goes for timber frame housing&rdquo;.  As I read it I found that Wimpey in the UK, who build about 10,000 houses a year, have now gone on to produce 80 per cent &mdash; that is 8,000 houses &mdash; in the timber frame design.  Now there is reaction in this country to timber houses, as we call them.  But there is a difference between timber frame houses and timber houses.  The cladding and all the sections are made of brick or block or whatever else but as a means of speeding up the building of the house the frame is put in in timber.  The advantage of this is that you can build twice as many houses in the time that you can build them by traditional means.  In case the Chair is getting worried about my going into details of housing, I am talking about the funding.  We cannot ignore the method of house production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go into detail on the Appropriation Bill on other matters. I am now talking about the source of money.  We are today raising the limit for local authority funds by two-thirds.  This is a colossal increase and I am just saying that fundamental strategic measures have to be taken to reduce the demands on that fund.  As we know &mdash; the Minister himself told us &mdash; £700 million out of the <Col N="569" /> existing amount has been spent on housing.  So the strategy for housing is fundamental to the pressure on the fund.  We cannot ignore it.  I promise you I am not going to go into details on housing but I am talking about the funding.  Erecting timber frame houses is one way of speeding up this.  Therefore, a fundamental shift in the approach to this and the thinking about it in the Department must take place.  I will not say any more about it than that.</P>
      <P>Another example of how one might get private funds into the housing area is by way of three schemes that are being used in the UK.  One is called joint venture housing, the other is called provision of homes by the cost sales scheme and the third is ownership in joint equity.  All of these involve private funding of houses that will take the pressure off the demand on local authority housing.  At the moment we are building about 6,500 local authority houses a year and we are helping to fund, in terms of loans, something like the same number of houses; maybe 7,000 houses.  This is the pressure.  So if three similar schemes to those I have mentioned could be introduced here it would take tremendous pressure off the system.  I will not go into the detail of how these schemes work.  I will leave that for the Appropriation Bill debate, but if 50 per cent of the housing bill could be transferred over to such schemes, through private funding, that would mean that we would save the best part of perhaps £100 million.  So there is a fundamental strategic shift required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we support this increase.  It may seem a very substantial increase but one must have regard to the fact that SDA loans have dried up in some areas, particularly in Waterford city, since July last.  Also, sewerage schemes and so on have been affected, causing great unemployment and in addition the situation is that we are running at about 18 per cent inflation. Because of these matters there are a lot of schemes half completed, for example the sewerage schemes that are causing effluent to run into the rivers, and therefore it is only right and necessary that we <Col N="570" /> should think in terms of passing the Bill as quickly as possible and get on with some of the essential work that has had to be postponed or is half finished.  Even if we do not get to finish the schemes that are half completed at least there will be no further fall back if the two-thirds extra is granted.  There is an obvious need for the increase, having regard to the reduction in housing construction.  For example, in regard to local authority housing, about 6,214 houses were constructed in 1979 but the figure for this year is only 3,265.  This represents an almost 50 per cent drop.  The whole question of home improvement grants had to be suspended, though these grants were very helpful in terms of our housing stock.  It may seem contradictory for someone like me to suggest that borrowing is good when in fact we very often criticise it. However, when we are talking about borrowing to deal with the whole area of essential services such as harbours, Garda stations, hospitals, schools, roads, housing and so on, we should not be too fussy about whether we have to borrow.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and I would just like to say that I was somewhat amused at Senator McGowan's remarks.  I hope I am not taking him out of context but in fact Donegal are doing well.  They requested £1,530,000 and in fact they issued only £1,470,000, so they do not seem to be doing too badly up in Donegal.  The Senator was probably correct in saying they were having no trouble with regard to loans.  But that is not generally the case.  As I said, the fund has dried up in Waterford and in other areas where many skills have been suspended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that many of the Senators who have contributed already to the debate have indicated some of the local problems that arise with local authorities.  In my county we have problems in terms of the availability of loans, particularly and tragically the availability of loans and grants for phsically handicapped people who are entitled to special benefits in relation to house reconstruction.  That is something we should try to avoid.  It is something <Col N="571" /> over which we do not have all the control we would like to have because we are talking about national public expenditure.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Mulcahy when he spoke about the idea of equipping as much private investment as possible in this area.  Although I have a decided distrust of Fianna Fáil having the opportunity to use their private business connections in the context of any public activity I like the idea of trying to get people to use their own resources to build their own houses.  I do not see why opportunities should be given to private companies to participate in some profit making schemes in terms of development or infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In relation to toll roads and toll bridges I agree that these ideas are fine and they should be encouraged, but I do not agree with giving the right to private interests to reap profits almost on an indirect basis, for contributing to infrastructural development such as toll roads and toll bridges.  I would be against it in the area of housing development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I said that I had a distrust of doing that.  I have a particular distrust in relation to housing development because it is one of the great necessities of life so far as any private individual is concerned.  We should adopt any scheme we can to encourage private individuals to contribute to their own homes.  The shocking increase in house prices has really been the tragedy in relation to development in this area since 1976-77.  I will not lay the entire blame for that on the Government, but only to the extent that they made no effort to control inflation in the context of their election manifesto.  We will have different dates to fight that battle.  I will not go into it right now.  In the context of the massive increase in house prices, there are many people who with some assistance from the local authorities, such as the provision of subsidised sites, could have been in a position to build their own <Col N="572" /> houses.  Those people are no longer in that position and we should try to redress that situation.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that Senator Mulcahy, did not make reference to the Fine Gael proposal which was recently published and which proposed to ensure that anybody would be in a position to obtain a mortgage to build his own house and be guaranteed that it would not cost him more than 20 per cent of his income in terms of repayments.  As Senators are aware at the moment, if an average person approaches a building society to buy or build an average house, it will cost him approximately 50 per cent of his weekly income to repay the instalments.  That is utterly prohibitive, and it is not open to younger people to pay that sort of money out of their salary.  Consequently they cannot be in the private house buying or the private house building business.</P>
      <P>People who purchased houses six and seven years ago and felt that the initial repayments were a heavy burden, now realise that the burden is very light because with inflation their salaries have increased and, relatively speaking, the repayments to the building society seem to have dropped dramatically.  The trouble is getting people started off.  Once people are in the situation where they own their own houses they can manage. The difficulty is to get people off the local authority housing lists and put them in the position where they can do that.  I would ask the Minister to give some indication of what Government policy is in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte made the point that local authority house building activities have dropped drastically, and that is the case.  It is not surprising in view of developments in terms of inflation and in view of the initial policy expressed by the Government in one of their earlier Green Papers where they refused to acknowledge that the problem existed in relation to housing.  Deputy Dr. Martin O'Donoghue would have been the author of that document at the time.</P>

    <P>The problem was put off in the great 1977 or 1978 era of spending.  Parts of the country may not have this problem to the <Col N="573" /> same extent, but in my own town I am tired, frustrated and depressed at the number of people who come to me with medical certificates from doctors describing living conditions of people who are surviving in mobile homes and who at this time of the year are living in damp rotten conditions.</P>
    <P>Children are suffering from chest complaints and husbands from kidney complaints all associated with the horrible difficult circumstances in which they have to live.  Those people would be glad of the opportunity to build their own houses but they cannot afford to do it.  They have no alternative but to wait for an average of about four years because of the shortage of funds in this area.  The problem in Thurles was the sanitary services rather than actual finance for housing. But the reality is that people are left in a situation in which they must exist in appalling circumstances.  It is an area of such necessity and such importance that most people would be quite happy to contribute an awful lot more than we give them credit for, to be in the situation where they can own their own houses or where they can build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I do not blame this Government because when this whole idea was adopted we perhaps abandoned the idea of people being able to help themselves at all.  We felt that people could rely on building societies, on banks or on the private enterprise that Senator Mulcahy referred to.  However more and more people cannot afford to use the building societies or the banks to provide themselves with their own housing.  I know that the vast majority of people on the housing list would prefer not to be there and would prefer to contribute out of their own salary to build their own house. I have been astonished at the enterprise with which some young people who, given a start at all in the manner in which I suggested for instance, in the provision of a subsidised site, use their own enterprise, their relations, their contacts and other means at their disposal to build a house.</P>

      <P>The Chair is very reluctant to interrupt the Senator but he is going fairly wide of a very narrow <Col N="574" /> Bill.  The Senator will have an opportunity to go into policy details on the Appropriation Bill, so I would be grateful if he would keep to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I apologise, but I respectfully point out that we are talking about staggering figures, and about increasing the Local Loans Fund.  In fairness, I would ask the Chair to understand the point I am trying to make, and that is that we should look at the Bill in the context of trying to reduce the cost to the State if that can be done.  People who need this money would prefer not to look to the State for the money but would prefer to be able to do it themselves.  But it is not always possible.  The Fine Gael Party published a very specific proposal three or four weeks ago to which there has not been any Government response.  There were some words of welcome but it seems to be glossed over.  We have not had a very positive response from the Government, although they now bring forward this Bill which proposes to extend more and more the liability of the State in this field, and it is on that basis that I am making my case.</P>
      <P>There are other points in relation to these local authority loans, but in view of what the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said, I will respect his ruling and hold my fire until the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances the timing of this Bill is almost 12 months out of date.  The Government seem to have had a problem in providing finance for local authorities to implement work or to make loans to builders or to private persons for the erection of houses.  In County Longford I have had the experience of the local authority having had schemes prepared for minor water works, for sewerage facilities and for building fairly extensive housing schemes, although they have not been able to procure the finance.  A considerable number of people associated with the building business are unemployed in County Longford and they have been pleading with the county manager and with the council to give them an opportunity to obtain employment on some of the subsidiary undertakings, <Col N="575" /> such as repairs to roads and on roads leading to housing schemes and they were unable to make any headway.  The county council are particularly anxious that the Minister should keep the programme of housing as planned and as approved in line with the financing.  In other words, the finance should come as soon as the approval is available, and when tenders are submitted to the Department there should not be a considerable delay in the provision of funds from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>In relation to water schemes carried out by the county council, the scheme known as the Lough Gowna Scheme Stage II, has now been associated with Stage III, and neither of them has been implemented.  Although the people involved have paid their contributions, the Government have not come up with the finance or the approval for the execution of the work.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that we will be able to procure an allocation for Longford at the soonest possible date from this fund.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reference here to the reconstruction of, or the addition to vocational schools, in Longford a scheme was prepared in respect of Saint Christopher's Schools and the number of rooms to be provided in that school was found to be very much in excess of what the Government are prepared to finance at this stage.  If the Government took into account what would have been appropriate to carry out this year, when nothing was done towards the provision of this extension, they might put the whole lot together now.  The population there is increasing and the parents and the vocational education committee are particularly anxious that this work would proceed.  I would like to see the Minister for Education implementing this scheme as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The same is true of Granard vocational school.  Four years ago I had the pleasure of meeting the Minister there when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, I am just laying the ground with a couple of remarks.  This merely enables the Minister for Finance to continue to provide the measure of capital necessary to maintain the infrastructure situation through local authorities and to maintain the programme of local authority housing, sanitary services, vocational schools, harbours and itinerant resettlement.  I am sure all sides of the House are in favour of this measure because we do not want to see this stopped.  Listening to both Senators Robinson and Molony about private development, one would be forgiven for pointing out that in this year alone under <Col N="577" /> the provisions of the building society loans, the Minister in the House here on the Building Societies Bill pointed out in reply to a question that the number of houses built through private interests arising out of the loans system for the first nine months of this year was 18,000. Naturally all of us would prefer that it was greater, but 18,000 for nine months, is a contribution to the whole system of housing in this country in the sense that every house built by a private individual is a saving to the local authorities and to the taxpayer.  There is an essential need to continue with the provision of the capital for local housing through local authorities but I agree with the other speakers that one should also encourage expansion in the private housing sector in order to save the taxpayer and the ratepayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions although they went outside the scope of the Bill a little.  Senators will have an opportunity to express their views on the Appropriation Bill which will be taken here tomorrow.</P>
      <P>This is a very limited Bill, merely an enabling measure to raise the statutory limit on issue from the fund which provides the mechanism for channelling funds to local authorities.  It has no implications for the amount of funds to be allocated for the various schemes financed from the fund.  These are matters for Government decision.  As Senators will be aware the Bill provides for an increase of £1 billion.  This, as some Senators pointed out, would be sufficient for five years at the present rate of issue. However, since it is likely that the rate of issue will continue to increase it will almost certainly be necessary to raise the limit again in less than five years.  This does not present any difficulty and Senators need not fear that the limit applicable to the fund has or will have implications for programmes financed from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Second Reading speech and to the increased provision for housing, I refute any allegation.  As Senators <Col N="578" /> will recall, the increase in issue from the fund in recent years reflects an increased provision for local authority housing including the house purchase loans issued from the Local Loans Fund for housing, in fact an increase of 22 per cent in 1979 over 1978.  When the limit was last raised by a further 30 per cent in 1980 the amount for house purchase loans actually increased by 123 per cent in 1979 and 50 per cent in 1980.  Despite the limited nature of this Bill, in view of the interest shown by the Senators I would refer to the general aspects of housing.  The Coalition Government could not afford to continue their 8,800 local authority houses which they built in 1975.  Under their stewardship completions dropped to 6,300 in 1977.  Since then the programme has been maintained at a steady level of 6,000 to 6,200 houses per annum.  About 6,000 houses will be completed this year.  Private housing completions dropped from 19,500 in 1974 to 16,700 in 1976 during the Coalition period.  Last year a record number of houses was built, 20,300.  Private and local authority house completions in 1980 are likely to reach an even higher level. The number of new house loans approved so far in 1980 do not support any Senator's views that housing starts and completions will collapse next year.</P>
    <P>Regarding capital allocations for housing in 1980, £202.53 million represents an increase of 20 per cent on the expenditure of £169.04 million in 1979.  In addition, in real terms the allocation shows an increase of 31 per cent on 1977.  In contrast, capital expenditure decreased by 57 per cent in real terms between 1975 and 1977.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to SDA loans. When the Coalition Government were in power the SDA loans were not increased and indeed the income limit was unchanged.  I would remind Senators that when the Fianna Fáil Government came into power we substantially increased the loans and the qualifying income for loans. We also increased new house grants to £1,000.  Expenditure on SDA loans will reach about £65 million this year compared with £17 million in 1977.  Four thousand eight hundred loans were <Col N="579" /> advanced in 1977.  This year over 7,000 loans will be paid.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators also referred to the increase in house prices.  Senators might wish to note that the trend in house prices since 1973 indicated that there is a close correspondence between the increases in house prices and the average earnings of adult male workers, taking into account the general improvement in standards of privately built houses.  In addition Senators will be aware that the introduction of the £1,000 new house grant and the building societies subsidy this year were of considerable help to house purchasers.  As far as the building industry generally is concerned, it is the firm objective of the Government, as is stated in the national understanding, to give priority to the maintenance of employment in this sector.  While the achievement of this objective must, as is also acknowledged in the understanding, take account of the constraints set by the need to contain the balance of payments deficit and the current budget deficit, the Government as recently as last month, announced an additional allocation in 1980 of £97 million in order to achieve a net improvement in the jobs situation, and £66 million of this package is directly related to expenditure in the construction area.</P>
    <P>Many of the matters raised here are not relevant to this Bill, and they can be dealt with in the Appropriation Bill which will be here tomorrow.  I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with <Col N="580" /> the reply on the figures given by the Minister.  This Minister was not present when I asked the questions but I assume that he has been advised on the questions that were asked about the present administration of the fund which we are seeking to increase by a further £1,000 million, as has been pointed out.  I had asked specifically if it were possible to have a breakdown over the last three years of the amounts that had gone for different aspects of housing policy.  I wanted to know specifically how much had gone on house improvement grants in the last year.  I was anxious to know then, apart from housing which is the area the Minister dealt with to some extent, what the position was in relation to other capital expenditure, a breakdown on the figures in different areas.  This is very important because we are not here in this House just to facilitate the Minister by authorising a further £1 billion increase in the size of the fund.  We are here to monitor and, if necessary, criticise the priorities in the policy approaches in the Local Loans Fund.  For the reasons I outlined in my speech &mdash; I do not intend to go over them again &mdash; these priorities are not good social priorities.  They do not meet the areas of greatest need.  In the area of housing, as I have illustrated, they are not meeting the need.  That need has been aggravated by existing Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his reply did not refer to the question of seeking to control the price of local authority housing.  He seemed to think it was satisfactory that it would automatically rise with inflationary tendencies and average incomes. House prices have clearly risen far in excess of incomes.  Is it a satisfactory situation that we do not attempt in the interest of families, in the interest of the basic human need for shelter and homes for families to assert a control over the price of sites and the price of housing? We seem to be prepared to control prices in other areas, of which I am very much in favour.  I would like a broader based income control.  Uniquely, as far as this Government appear to be concerned, housing is excluded from any form of control.  Therefore, the average price of <Col N="581" /> local authority houses between 1976 and 1980 has gone up from £8,553 to £22,161. That is an average price.  The price is much higher in the areas where socially, it is necessary to have housing, in centre city areas.  In Dublin city centre, the sites acquired by local authorities are uncontrolled and exploited.  Enormous profits are made on developing these areas.  I want to know whether the Government have any intention of asserting some control and standards in this area or whether they are just looking for a further £1,000 million, unrelated to any kind of policy in any set of priorities in this area.  I specifically asked for the figure on home improvement loans because these loans have been availed of very substantially by those who have homes.  I have great sympathy for people in the particular economic climate.  Why should they not avail of grants if they are made available to them?  It depends on how we use our public resources.  I have some doubts at the moment whether it is socially justifiable to allow a substantial proportion of a fund to be absorbed by home improvements grants to those who already have homes and who tend to be better off, when we have a very severe housing crisis, and people cannot get the basic shelter over their heads or a satisfactory minimum for themselves and their families. I also think this is an opportunity to get specific figures on the other capital allocations from the fund.  I appreciate that a number of the policy issues behind the distribution allocation of the Local Loans Fund can be raised on the Appropriation Bill.  That will be an opportunity to cover the whole range of Government policy relating to the various Departments.  It is more difficult to get specific information. I would ask the Minister if he could give a further breakdown of figures on section 1 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is no money from the Local Loans Fund for new house grants.  I would be glad to give the Senator a breakdown and supply information on the expenditure on house purchase and improvement loans.  In <Col N="582" /> 1976 it was £26 million on house purchase and improvement loans.</P>

      <P>No.  Money is not provided from the Local Loans Fund for house improvement grants.  Expenditure on house purchase and improvement loans in 1976 was £26 million.  In 1980 it will be £66 million.  Grants from the Department paid in 1976 amounted to £6.5 million.  In 1980 the corresponding figure is £27 million.  Expenditure under the capital programme on local authority housing was £65 million in 1976.  The allocation from the programme for local authority housing in 1980 is £107 million. The total amount spent from the fund in 1978 for housing was £100.3 million.  In 1979 it was £122.34 million.  In 1980 it was £159.04 million.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide authority for the Minister for Finance to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Shipping Limited by ten million additional ordinary shares of £1 each.  In addition the Bill provides for an <Col N="583" /> increase of 10 million in the amount of borrowing by the company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and for the guarantee of the company's borrowings by the Minister for Finance in currencies other than the currency of the State.</P>
      <P>The Bill will raise the ceiling on the company's total authorised capital to £22 million and will raise the limit on guaranteed borrowing to £15 million.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the present Bill is necessitated by the need to make provision for the capital and borrowing requirements of Irish Shipping Limited in respect of a new bulk carrier and for the financial needs of the company over the next few years.  This vessel is one of the proposed contracts for Verolme Cork Dockyard which the Government announced on 30 July, 1980.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited will place the order for the vessel without delay and it is expected that the vessel will be completed about December 1982.  It is estimated that the final cost of the bulk carrier will be in the region of £25 million.</P>
      <P>The company has been in a position to fund the acquisition of vessels in the past without recourse to the Exchequer. Indeed 1959 was the last occasion on which the authorised share capital of the company was increased.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping's principal activity is the operation of deep-sea ships on the international tramp shipping market, and this vessel will be used in that trade.  This market has been depressed over a number of years because of an oversupply of tonnage and the reduced demand for it. Indications are that this position has corrected itself to a considerable extent and freight rates have improved.  In spite of this improvement, shipowners still have to contend with the problems arising from worldwide inflation and, in particular, the ever-increasing burden of fuel costs.  Irish Shipping, in consideration of its objective to operate within the framework of a commercial company, would have deferred the acquisition of this ship for some further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to the Government's concern to provide contracts from the <Col N="584" /> public sector for Verolme Cork Dockyard, it advanced its plans in this regard. The company is not, however, in a position to finance the building of the ship without Exchequer assistance at this stage.  It is, therefore, proposed that the cost of the vessel will be funded by a combination of equity to the company, borrowing by the company and the payment of subvention to the yard.</P>
    <P>When the company was incorporated in 1941, the mandate given to it was to maintain a fleet to meet national requirements in time of need and to operate commercially thereafter.  The measure of its success is that, for the past thirteen consecutive years, the company has made a profit and has financed its operations and capital programme entirely from its own resources.</P>
    <P>The company is involved in a number of ancillary activities which provide alternative sources of revenue to compensate for the inevitable slumps which are endemic in the shipping industry.  These activities have made a major contribution towards the achievement of the company's profit record over the past 13 years and have helped to overcome the adverse effects of a prolonged and severe recession in the worldwide shipping industry.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited is confident that it can operate the new vessel successfully and profitably when it comes into service. The company will also be bidding for the contract to carry the ESB coal requirements at the Moneypoint generating station.</P>
    <P>The recession, which has been affecting the shipping industry, has also in turn caused problems for the shipbuilding industry, Verolme Cork Dockyard has been facing serious financial problems and a lack of orders.  The Government took steps to alleviate the situation by arranging for contracts to be placed for the building of two new naval vessels for the Department of Defence, a fisheries research vessel and the bulk carrier for Irish Shipping Limited, in order to protect the jobs of the highly skilled work force.</P>
    <P>The continued development of Irish Shipping Limited is important in the furtherance of national development, and <Col N="585" /> its activities are of very considerable direct benefit to the economy.  It provides well-paid employment for 950 people and its total annual payroll is over £5 million. The present bulk carrier order will provide employment at Verolme Cork Dockyard for the next two years, which is a very valuable contribution at the present time to the Government's campaign to maintain existing employment and create new jobs.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present Bill will enable Irish Shipping to expand its deep-sea fleet.  I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this Irish Shipping Amendment Bill which is a simple matter of increasing the share capital by £10 million, in addition to provision for the borrowing of a further £10 million.  The matter is not controversial, and we agree with all of the reasons for the introduction of the Bill.  The reason the Bill is coming before the House has much more to do with the Verolme Cork Dockyard than it has with Irish Shipping.  I notice an anomaly from reading the Minister's speech in the Dáil.  I presume his speech to this House is somewhat similar &mdash; that Irish Shipping would have deferred the acquisition of this new bulk carrier due to the circumstances of trade and all that goes with that.  The Minister said he is confident that they can operate successfully and profitably.  The anomaly is that if Irish Shipping, without pressure from the Government, would have deferred the acquisition of this bulk carrier, was it due to commercial constraints or are they going to run into any particular difficulty by ordering it at a time sooner than their commercial judgment might have suggested that they should have done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as bulk carriers are concerned, they are on to a fairly gilt edged future. This bulk carrier of 70,000 tons can perform a very useful service, particlarly in the light of the series of energy crises which we have had in the last decade. There is a particular future for bulk carriers, in particular the possibility of carrying coal for the ESB for the Moneypoint generating station.  One of the <Col N="586" /> greatest untapped sources of energy for the future will be coal.  This country, in many areas, will be relying on solid fuels, and particularly coal, to provide a larger share of our energy than at the present time.  Especially with electricity generation, for the future possibly the most economic of all the sources of energy on which to base generation of electricity is in major ports geared for the automatic handling of importation of coal.  In that sense this bulk carrier has a definite role to play which is in line with the fundamental role of Irish Shipping as a company to protect the national interest of this State, founded at the start of the Second World War when we were in a perilous position, captives to the high seas.  The addition of a different type of vessel to the fleet is very sensible.  Irish Shipping have consistently made a profit for the last 13 years and have been self-financing, both in terms of operations and their capital requirements.</P>
    <P>The spin-off from the purchase of this is useful in the very difficult times in which we live.  Apparently, the placing of the order of this vessel with Verolme in Cork will provide additional employment there for the next two years, which is a most valuable contribution and is welcomed by this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping Limited provides us with a heartening success story.  Among our State-sponsored bodies, it is a particularly successful company with a low profile.  The company is run along strict commercial lines and has shown consistent profits over a 13 year period.  This profit record is truly remarkable in the light of the sharp fluctuations that occurred in the shipping business during the past two years.  Notwithstanding the very low level of freights in the international market, the company improved its profits from £3.027 million in 1978-79 to £3.508 million in 1979-80, with the likelihood of a further improvement in profits for the year 1980-81.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure of the company's financial success is the infrequency of recourse by the company for funds from the Exchequer.  It is now 21 years since the authorised share capital of the company <Col N="587" /> was increased.  The company, as a matter of policy, finances its operations and capital programme entirely from its own resources.  Since 1963, it has spent £53 million in the purchase of bulk carriers and car ferries, all financed from its own resources without any recourse to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In the national context, Irish Shipping has played an important developmental role.  It employs, as the Minister pointed out, 950 people and, very importantly, it has earned £11 million in net foreign exchange in the year 1979-80.  In line with the role the company has played in national development over the years, it is once more rising to the occasion by placing an order with the Verolme Cork Dockyard for a bulk carrier which will cost about £25 million.  This will avoid a potential unemployment problem at Verolme.  It will provide employment for a two year period.  Verolme is now a first class dockyard with a pool of highly skilled people, and it is in the national interest to preserve these skills and to maintain employment at the dockyard. Irish Shipping would not normally have chosen to expand its fleet at this particular time, because of its desire to reduce its borrowings.  In deference to the Government's wishes to preserve employment at Verolme, which in itself is a highly desirable objective, the company, as a State-sponsored body, is helping a private sector industry.  Irish Shipping understandably, is unable at this time to finance the building of the new vessel without assistance from the Exchequer. Hence the purpose of the Bill before us is to increase the authorised capital of the company by £10 million and to provide for increased borrowing by the company which will be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  The record of Irish Shipping speaks volumes for the enterprise and competence of its board, its management and its staff generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go as far as my colleagues Senator Staunton and Senator Hillery in positively welcoming this Bill.  The furthest I would go is to say I <Col N="588" /> have no objection to it for reasons that are social and political, the social reasons being its design to continue people in &ldquo;work&rdquo; in Cork.  The political reasons are that we have a duty to see that people continue in employment, as part of our overall brief.</P>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in paying tribute to the efficiency with which Irish Shipping have conducted their affairs over the years.  They are one of the few State-sponsored companies who are viable in a true commercial sense.  One reason why they have achieved that state of efficiency has been the very high level of productivity that has been obtained in that company over the years as a result of careful management and good <i>esprit de corps</i> in the workforce, which is prepared to give of its best for the company. It is ironic that this company, with that record and with that achievement of productivity, should now find themselves having their arm twisted gently but implacably by the Government to, in effect, subsidise a firm in Cork where the managing director has admitted their productivity is poor&mdash;&ldquo;poor productivity&rdquo;, in industrial jargon, very often covers the old fashioned vice of laziness.  It is ironic that Irish Shipping should find themselves in this position, having regard to their own record in their operations.</P>
      <P>I hope this development and the purchase of the ship by Irish Shipping in this context will not have any adverse effect on their balance of trading figures.  The company, as the Minister said, would not have purchased a further bulk carrier at this time, not because they could not operate profitably, which was a worry Senator Staunton had &mdash; the company are satisfied they would be able to do that &mdash; but rather because their financial position would not permit it to do so prudently, because they keep a careful eye on it and do not want to get involved in very high debts.  They are very proud in Irish Shipping that they have not looked to the taxpayer to bail them out and they do not want ever to get into that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the new financing that is going to be involved as a result of this Bill and the placing of this order <Col N="589" /> is going to have an effect on their financial position.  It is not going to improve it, because there is going to be more equity to be remunerated.  I understand that the financial package for this ship, speaking very broadly, will be 12 or so million pounds to be found by Irish Shipping from their own resources, £5 million additional equity coming from the Government as a result of this Bill and a direct subvention by the Government to the Verolme Dockyard.  Irish Shipping feel that they can tolerate such a package. What I am apprehensive about, and I would like the Minister when he is replying to reassure us, is that the extra equity, which will be part of the Irish Shipping contribution, will be forthcoming to be drawn by Irish Shipping when they need it.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious, as every other citizen of this country is, that the Exchequer is in a straitened condition and the demands on it for money for capital and other purposes are more than the Exchequer can meet.  I am apprehensive that there might be a temptation to postpone or delay the giving of this equity capital to Irish Shipping, to tell them they are in a healthy financial state, that there are lots of borrowing institutions that can accommodate them and to go ahead and borrow but to get the ship built.  The whole gearing of the Irish Shipping finances could be upset as a result.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the extra equity that is being proposed now &mdash; I understand the amount that is going to be drawn is £5 million &mdash; will be forthcoming when it is required by Irish Shipping and that there will be no delay.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also confirm that the broad package will be along the lines I have indicated &mdash; so much for Irish Shipping, new equity and the balance by direct subvention?  He might also indicate the timing of the various payments by way of Government subvention, whether they will be paid in such a way that Irish Shipping will not be called upon to pay their direct contribution otherwise than in the course of a normal contractual arrangement for the building of a ship.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that State-sponsored <Col N="590" /> companies do not operate entirely according to normal commercial criteria. The Government is entitled to use a State-sponsored company to maintain employment in an area where otherwise there might be unemployment.  If we do that, we must recognise very clearly that, should that have any adverse financial consequences for a company like Irish Shipping who pride themselves on their commercial and financial viability, and which pride is a big factor in their continuing success, that company are making a social contribution.  We must also pay attention to the problems that are in Verolme Dockyard and the problems to which the managing director referred &mdash; low productivity and high absenteeism &mdash; problems that are not peculiar to that particular industry but are manifest right throughout Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the work ethic has a very low priority in our national life at present.  One would hesitate to say that a good sharp shock is the answer, because there is no such thing any more, the welfare State has seen to that.  But one must question the soundness of a policy that in effect featherbeds inefficiency.  It is a dangerous road for a politician to embark on &mdash; and I do so hesitatingly &mdash; but I think it must be faced at some stage.  Unfortunately there is not a realisation or a will to recognise that nationally.  We are here, I am afraid, in accepting this Bill in the context in which it is presented to us conniving or collaborating at feather-bedding an industry which appears to be inefficient, manned by workers who are not prepared to give of their best.  My authority for that is the managing director of the firm concerned.  I do hope that, in engaging in this exercise, the Minister will ensure that it is carried out in such a way that the least possible damage, and if at all possible no damage whatever, will be done to Irish Shipping Limited which is rare among State-sponsored companies for its commercial and financial success and indeed is possibly unique.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by paying tribute to the personnel of that company, the board, the management and all the workers at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Bill.  Irish Shipping Limited certainly are unusual for a State-sponsored body here, or in any other country, for the successful way in which they have been run.  Indeed, it is interesting to quote from their last annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 March 1980 in which the Chairman, Mr. Greer, in the course of his statement said:</P>
      <P>...As I have said earlier in this statement, we decided many years ago that anything we do must not be a load on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Would that the chairman of all the other State-sponsored bodies were able to say that today, never mind several years ago, and to maintain it by a succession of annual profits to which my colleague, Senator Hillery, has referred.  The record of Irish Shipping Limited as a commercial concern has been of the highest order particularly so in view of the extremely difficult trade in which they have been involved.  Nonetheless they have succeeded regularly in making an annual profit and, indeed, at times quite a substantial annual profit, judged on immediate commercial considerations.  More than that, they have contributed in taxation from the relatively low contribution of £85,000 in 1971, through a steadily increasing amount until last year, when they contributed almost £1 million to the Exchequer in the form of taxation in the sum of £843,000.  This is indeed a highly unusual situation in a highly unusual company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I too should like to join in paying a tribute to Mr. Greer and his colleagues on the board of Irish Shipping Limited, to their very excellent General Manager, Mr. O'Neill, and indeed all the seamen and staff involved in Irish Shipping Limited.  However, let us not perhaps delude ourselves too much whilst paying this tribute to the excellent work all these people are doing.  The simple facts of the matter are, when we examine the full report of Irish Shipping Limited, that the number of ships available to us, as sole-owned ships, amounts <i>in toto</i> to six: the <i>Irish Rowan, Irish Cedar, Irish <Col N="592" /> Pine, Irish Maple</i>, the <i>Irish Oak</i> and the <i>Irish Larch</i>, as given in this statement, total 159,467 tonnes deadweight.  They have also a number of other ships chartered totalling another 232,000 tonnes, giving a total deep-sea tonnage for Irish Shipping Limited of 392,000.  In addition we have those two excellent ships in regard to which again Irish Shipping Limited have shown great initiative, the motor vessels <i>St. Killian</i> and <i>St. Patrick.</i> Finally of course there are the lightships which are managed.  Therefore, the company, in shipping terms, are relatively small.  They are an excellent, very well-managed, company, a company who have survived the great difficulties of the shipping industry over the last few years.  Still the facts are that we do not really have a major shipping fleet in this country as yet.</P>
    <P>What is excellent is that in Irish Shipping Limited we do have a company who have established themselves over the years and who have now perhaps an even greater international reputation than they have here at home.  One of my colleagues here mentioned them as being a little known company.  How very true; how very few Irish people are really aware of Irish Shipping Limited.  There is nowhere near the same publicity or attention given to their magnificant efforts are compared with those of, shall we say, just to give an example though an analagous one, Aer Lingus?  The work they are doing is certainly recognised internationally among the shipping confraternity just as much as is the excellent work of Aer Lingus.  Perhaps at times we do not fully appreciate this, do not pay full tribute to our shipping industry.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that amidst the many concerns, the many burdens which we have in government, we have been unable to date to give as much time, attention and support as one might wish to maritime industries.  Many years ago we had a great tradition at sea.  One of the most severe disabilities inflicted on us over the years was the deliberate destruction of this maritime industry.  Unfortunately this destruction was so successful, so complete, that we seem to have lost totally the tradition of a maritime industry. <Col N="593" /> Only now are we beginning to pick up the pieces and getting going again. Yet logically we obviously should.  Geographically our situation is most appropriate to a maritime industry.  We are an island nation virtually totally dependent on maritime connections.</P>
    <P>While paying tribute to Irish Shipping Limited, while supporting this Bill, I would like to think that we will begin to pay increasing attention to our shipping industry.  The sums involved here which have been mentioned are in maritime terms very small sums indeed.  I think it was Senator Staunton who referred to a large bulk carrier.  One of the really large bulk carriers would cost several times more than the entire subscription to Irish Shipping Limited, as I am sure Senator Staunton is also aware.  I cannot help thinking that if we were to place more emphasis on shipping we would provide far more than the 950 jobs which are already available.  That is a relatively trifling number in the context of the potential there, in the context of other similar nations.  Norway is the obvious example but there are many others.</P>
    <P>While supporting this Bill I would like to take the opportunity to suggest that perhaps we should give more attention to maritime affairs.  Our new Minister has shown tremendous industry and initiative in the telecommunications field.  May one respectfully suggest that he may find some time, at some stage, to develop maritime affairs as they should be developed.  Perhaps we should have an Irish Maritime Development Association, just as we have a very excellent Industrial Development Association.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and give it full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this is essentially a non-controversial Bill, I hope I will be pardoned, because of my particular background, for looking somewhat critically at the financial implications while recognising that other considerations enter into the matter as well.  Like all the Senators who have spoken, I am greatly impressed by the success of Irish Shipping Limited in keeping <Col N="594" /> afloat financially even in times of slump in the shipping industry.  Indeed I am greatly impressed by their enterprise in finding profitable ancillary activities to buoy them up in times of difficulty.  My earnest hope, therefore, is that they will not be sunk, or even temporarily submerged, by the Government decision that they must advance the purchase of this bulk carrier and place the contract for it with the Cork Verolme Dockyard at a cost of many million pounds above the open market price.</P>
      <P>As the Minister reminded us, the original mandate for Irish Shipping Limited was that it was to maintain a fleet to meet national requirements in time of need and to operate commercially in normal times.  I assume that the company could not operate commercially if they had to bear the extra capital charges on this new vessel which arise from the decision that it must be bought from Verolme Dockyard.  Presumably, it is to afford them the relief of a certain amount of capital without interest commitments that the provision is made in this Bill for £10 million of extra share capital to be taken up by the State.  It is important that we realise what the provision of share capital by the State, without any prospect of dividend, really means.  Ten million pounds is involved here.  Rates of interest at present on money the State has to raise are 14 to 15 per cent.  One could take it, therefore, that the interest subsidy to Irish Shipping Limited involved in providing them with £10 million of free equity capital is of the order of £1,500,000 per year.  We realise that it is not really intended to benefit Irish Shipping Limited but Verolme Cork Dockyard.  In effect, therefore, it means that, if 1,000 men are employed in the dockyard, the Exchequer and in the end the taxpayer, is going to have to continue paying out £1,500 a man in annual interest subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the whole story because a year and a half ago, in July 1979, we had a Bill before us in this House to provide extra finance for the sister company, the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited.  They were about to purchase a passenger car ferry at a cost estimated at about £21 million.  I asked the then Minister <Col N="595" /> for Tourism and Transport whether tenders from various shipyards were being invited for the new ferry or whether a Government directive had been issued to the B &amp; I to give the contract to Verolme.  The answer was that it was a Government decision to have the ship built at Cork, that it could have been acquired cheaper from a foreign shipyard, and that, for social reasons, the directive was given to place the order for the ship in Cork to ensure full employment there over the next couple of years. Very much the same story, the same explanation, as in relation to this bulk carrier.</P>
    <P>The Minister's own statement this evening mentioned three other vessels &mdash; two new naval vessels and a fisheries research vessel, also by direction of the Government to be built by Verolme, also presumably at a cost considerably in excess of the open market price.  I have no idea what all this tots up to.  It could well mean that in respect of these five vessels, a sum of the order of £20 million to £25 million of extra capital, over and above open market price, is being committed to their purchase in Cork.  That is being done for understandable social reasons, but we are not at all sure what exactly is the payment we are making from public funds for this social purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech a direct subvention to Verolme but he mentioned no figure for this direct subvention.  I am not against taking account of social considerations and I am not denying the importance in a general way of maintaining a skilled workforce built up in Cork or elsewhere.  But surely, if we are behaving rationally, we should at some point be able to draw up a balance sheet in this matter, to be able to assess what are the advantages, nationally or socially and what the cost is, and see whether we are getting value or are paying too much.  If in fact we are contributing for this purpose the equivalent of interest on £20 to £25 million of State borrowing, then we are contributing something between £3,000 and £3,500 a man to keep the Verolme Dockyard workers in employment.  At some point, <Col N="596" /> we must ask ourselves how much further can we justify going on social or any other considerations.  My main point is that we should know what the total cost of social policy decisions is, not have to derive it indirectly and inexactly in the way I have been attempting to do this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with most of what I have heard from the other Senators who have spoken in this debate, in what I take to be their concern and generally their attitude in the matter.  In a way it indicates some defects in the structure of our Seanad composition that we do not have representatives of the workforce listening to this debate or to many of them anyhow that the kind of points which have been made here, such of them as I have heard from both sides of the House, largely valid, as I am unable to make assessments of in detail that they are not here to hear the kind of point explicitly I want to make now arising out of these comments: that is this, that the record of Irish Shipping is an extraordinarily good example of the social benefits of profits by free enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to repeat &ldquo;made by free enterprise&rdquo; because this case about profits is so often made in terms of the activity of private enterprise. It is not a question of private ownership or private control.  It is a question of free operation by intelligent people acting in a flexible manner with regard to the entire market that they have to deal with, with the test for themselves as to the success of their performance to be found in the return on the capital that they are in fact employing.  We are talking about a company which was established &mdash; great credit being due to the late Mr. Seán Lemass who established it &mdash; in 1941 specifically to meet a social purpose and a national need at that time which later survived, in other circumstances, to do the same sort of thing in a different way. We are talking about a company which has not required an injection of capital over a period of 20 to 21 years; I think it was 1959 that the last injection of capital was made in the equity of this company and which has built up its balance sheet <Col N="597" />&mdash; I am indebted to Senator Conroy for the borrowing of it during the course of this debate &mdash; out of profits, after tax, to aproximately £40 million.  As a result of having these profits the company gives viable, well paid employment to 950 people.</P>
    <P>I understand the whole situation here, that we have this skilled force in Verolme Dockyard in Cork.  There is the social concern of maintaining it and not dissipating it.  On the other hand we have the observations quoted here by Senator Cooney.  I am less shy than Senator Cooney about following the implications to the Oireachtas of these remarks.  If there is feather-bedding for the feather-bedded some people who are not in feather beds are paying for the feather-bedding and other people who are enjoying poor incomes, who are perhaps engaged in intensely active employment are the persons who are, one way or another, paying for the feather-bedding.  I query very much the justification of this type of thing.  I am going to be following this line in other contributions in this house if I survive to make them.  Generally we are going to have to establish some sort of Party consensus with regard to this kind of matter.  We are going to have to have some kind of an understanding whereby advantage is not going to be taken of decisions locally which are necessary to make if they are necessary to make, and which are in the national interest to make.</P>
    <P>I understand the general situation here is that the operations of the free enterprise of Irish Shipping Limited have been allowed proceed freely by an intelligent Department over all these years and the various Ministers who were its political heads, one of whom is here now, and welcome he is too with his talents.  As I understand the position this bulk carrier would not freely have been acquired by Irish Shipping, that this is not an operation which would have been commercially decided on by Irish Shipping Limited now.  I understand the position would be that they would have regard, as another commercial concern would have to, to their cash flow in determining when they could afford to purchase this bulk <Col N="598" /> carrier.  I understand that the actual purchase of this bulk carrier is, in general, not something that Irish Shipping Limited object to provided they get it at the right price.  And I understand &mdash; I do not know what the precise figure is, or whether it is yet an agreed matter &mdash; that it is going to be something which Irish Shipping Limited is going to regard as a sensible addition.  They could get the same vessel purchased in Japan, a suitable adjustment being the giving of the additional standards which would be requisite for a ship built in the West and to the proper catering of the people employed in that industry here.  I am not sure that I follow the financial constructions of Senator Whitaker about this.</P>
    <P>If there is permission for an additional £10 million &mdash; I understand from Senator Cooney that the drawdown will be half that figure &mdash; this will presumably be costless to Irish Shipping Limited but not costless to the Irish taxpayer.  I understand the Irish taxpayer will pay the current cost of borrowing that money.  That may be all right as a social subscription. But, in commercial terms, this additional capital will appear in Irish Shipping's books and will be expected to be remunerated out of its activities.  Therefore it is important that it be applied in a manner in which the directors of Irish Shipping Limited regard as commercially justifiable.</P>
    <P>I sincerely trust that this whole matter of financing this operation &mdash; to preserve jobs which are enjoyed by people who are criticised by their own managing director for absenteeism and for low productivity &mdash; is not in any way to upset the commercial strength of Irish Shipping Limited, in other words, that the moneys flow in this way, that they do not necessarily flow through the Irish Shipping Limited balance sheet; that there be an explicit subvention to the largest extent judged correct to Verolme rather than that money should proceed through Irish Shipping Limited to Verolme.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy I think referred to the satisfactions of the persons concerned in the management of Irish Shipping, their attitudes to their work.  This is enormously important.  Their self-confidence <Col N="599" /> and the possibility of their being able to build up more profit out of which to finance more development and more employment &mdash; that ambition should be in no way negated or interfered with by any operation effected by this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I do not know all the factors involved but I understand that there is developing a trade in the carriage of coal and it is for this market that Irish Shipping Limited is going to put this bulk carrier into use.  Is the Minister able to give us any other assessment that he may have had made to him of any of the other operations of Irish Shipping Limited which he may be conducting at present which may be threatened by developments which might be anticipated in the next few years in respect of which a totally free board might be making its own cautious moves of protection?  I trust that this affair between the Minister and Irish Shipping Limited is one which is going to preserve complete integrity of the independence of Irish Shipping Limited with regard to this, that there is going to be no weighting down on them at all.  For example I think of the export of beef meat which I gather is a profitable operation at the moment. Developments in agriculture are such that we may see a downturn there.  Is this operation into which Irish Shipping Limited are being stimulated one which is allowing them to make appropriate provision for any adverse development of that kind?</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the board of directors of Irish Shipping Limited, all their management and all their employees on their performance during the years.  Indeed I should like to include in that the public service which in this case signally recognised the importance of their independence.  Let us hope we can learn from any study we make of the operations of Irish Shipping Limited the extreme importance of distinguishing the subscription of moneys through State-sponsored operations for social purposes from the subscription of moneys to companies for the purposes of earning profit on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the steps taken in this Bill to enable Irish Shipping to expand and to increase their assets level.  I see no reason why they should not continue to operate at a profitable level.  The rate at which asset accumulation will take place will be faster still.  In the process, the employment in the shipbuilding sector of Irish industry is helped.</P>
      <P>It is a critical problem.  It can be evaluated by sophisticated methods of investment analysis.  On the assumption that there is some rationality about this possibly people might conclude that certain steps might not be rational.  I would question this.  It depends on what your competition is doing.  Countries like Japan have not been operating rationally in terms of basic economic measures in relation to their investment policies.  I would suspect that, in times when the demand for shipping is down&mdash;and we have that at the moment with recession internationally, in terms of our international trade, and in the order level for these vessels&mdash;that other countries will maintain price levels which enable them to maintain their market share.  We know from the analysis in international trading and competitive structures that this is what is happening.  I certainly would not like to see our growing shipbuilding sector coming under threat because of simplistic investment criteria.</P>
      <P>We are not just dealing with Verolme in this regard.  Over the past few years I have been very concerned with the old Liffey Dockyard now owned by Solarship.  Time and time again I have raised the question of trying to ensure that this operation is kept going.  The traditional dockyard is part of the history of our city. I am not suggesting that the Minister should say anything about it on this Bill, but I should like to point out that we have a problem and it should be our endeavour to develop a healthy shipbuilding industry however small it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to say how impressed I am with the record of Irish Shipping and, in particular, the way they have gone about the training of their masters and their young executives. They have been very forward-looking in this regard over the years.  I hope this <Col N="601" /> effort will be co-ordinated in the sense that the Naval Service and the growing cadre of young people we have travelling in ships under the Irish flag will have the very best manpower development schemes.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate and I join with them in congratulating the chairman, the board of directors, the management, and the staff of Irish Shipping on their continued successful record in operating a semi-State company.  It is a shining example of what can be achieved in the semi-State sector.  Irish Shipping have had 13 consecutive years of profit and success.  I think it was Senator FitzGerald who referred to the foresight of the late Seán Lemass who set up this company in 1941. The proud record of this company over the years is indeed a tribute to the foresight and vision of that man in getting this enterprise off the ground.</P>
      <P>Many of the contributions made by Senators raised points which can be answered.  In the approach of the Government, myself and the Department to this, there was no question of the big stick being wielded over Irish Shipping.  There was no question whatsoever of any directive being issued to them saying, &ldquo;This must be done and that must be done.&rdquo;  It was a question of consultation.  I had many discussions with the chairman and the chief executive of Irish Shipping on the problem that existed at Verolme Cork Dockyard, on what their plans were for the future, on what they were likely to be ordering in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time they had been considering the acquisition of a Panamax carrier.  This would enable them when the opportunity arose to tender not only for the carrying of coal&mdash;for which there will be an urgent need in the future&mdash;to the new Moneypoint power station.  This carrier, which will be approximately 72,000 tons dead weight, will be a welcome addition to the fleet of Irish Shipping.  In years to come if we had foreign ships bringing in our coal to Moneypoint there would be many cries not alone in this House but from the public inquiring why <Col N="602" /> Irish Shipping had not got this business and why we were not in the position to carry our coal.  This is good forward planning.  The interim period between the planning of this ship and the time at which the board of Irish Shipping would like to have ordered it, because of a very good cash flow position and, indeed, their whole financial position, was not very long.  We did not have to lean on their shoulders to make them bring this plan forward once they were satisfied that the end result was that they would get this ship at the prevailing world market price.</P>
    <P>I followed these negotiations.  They were carried out between myself and the management of Irish Shipping.  Other Government Departments were involved, including the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Department of Energy.  Indeed, the proposal got very careful consideration right along the line.  I ensured at all stages that the commercial interests of Irish Shipping were fully preserved, that no damage would be done to them by this operation.  That is the way the final package is emerging.  The final price is at present under negotiation, because there are some extras being sought for inclusion on the carrier.</P>
    <P>In relation to the carrier itself, Verolme Cork Dockyard had the experience some years back of building a carrier of this tonnage and size.  There are some minor adjustments and some improvements that can be made in today's planning and sketching of that type of ship and it is in that particular area that negotiations are going on, but there will be no damage whatsoever done to the commercial integrity of Irish Shipping.  They will get the benefit of the prevailing world market price and equity from the Exchequer.  The vessel will be financed 50/50 equity and commercial borrowing. The equity will get drawn down first and then they will draw from the borrowings. For example, if the final figure is £13 million, it will be £6½ million equity first and then the £6½ million borrowings. There is no question whatever, and I want to assure everybody here, including Senator Cooney and others who have raised it, of Irish Shipping being asked to <Col N="603" /> resort <i>in toto</i> to commercial borrowing. The situation and the implications of it were considered fully by the Government and as soon as this Bill passes through the House and becomes law, arrangements will be made very early in January for the placing of this order and the draw down to which I referred will be carried out in the order which I outlined.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald and Senator Whitaker raised the question of what is the national interest, what is the social interest and how one qualifies in financial terms these indeterminate factors.  Let me say straight away that both Senator Whitaker and Senator FitzGerald accept that it is very difficult to quantify in strictly economic terms where the balance of public interest lies.  We should evaluate and look at the situation that faces the Government and the situation in which we live today.  Senator Mulcahy raised the point quite rightly that ship building across the world today is subsidised either visibly or invisibly and it is very difficult for any Minister or any Government to know precisely what is the total subsidy involved, be it visible or invisible.  It is very difficult because each country has its own policy in relation to its own shipbuilding industry on how to protect it either by subsidy or by cheap loan finance or whatever measure.  There are many ways and means, as we all know, of doing this.  That is the position that we must look at today.</P>
    <P>We have a very highly skilled work force here who have been trained in their particular skills over the years.  The position I and the Government have faced in relation to this work force is: do we scatter them to the four winds and destroy their skills?  In a very difficult time for employment, do we do that, or as Senator Hillery pointed out, do we use the public sector's resources to assist the private sector in such a situation?  The Government considered this at length and came down fully in support of it as it is in accordance with their strategy for tackling the problems of the recession.  It is well known to everybody that we did not choose to create unemployment to solve other economic ills at this particular time, <Col N="604" /> as some others far more developed than us, have decided to do.  Rather did we choose to put whatever Government resources were available towards the protection of employment.  We are a developing economy, an economy whose young well-educated work force is one of our great strengths.  It is the duty and responsibility of the Government to ensure in these particularly tough times that employment is protected as far as the Government can possibly protect it. If somebody wants to find fault with that course, so be it, but that is the Government's strategy, and when we look at the results and the human problems and the devastation that is happening to other economies because of the deep international recession, I believe we are on the right track.  The Government believe we are on the right track and the time will come when it will be put to the test for the people of Ireland to decide whether we are on the right track or not.  It is difficult to come down and compute accurately in every single aspect because we must take into consideration changing economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to cost factors involved in placing the order for the Department of Defence and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, I am not familiar with details and I am not in a position to give out information in relation to those two orders.  What I can say is that I was personally involved in every step and stage of negotiations in relation to Irish Shipping's order.  It was and is being done on a purely commercial basis.  Irish Shipping are getting this ship at the world price. The Government are stepping in with a subvention to make up the difference. There were questions raised inquiring if this was feather-bedding and if it was correct to subsidise bad workmanship or low productivity in the Cork Verolme Dockyard.  I am not in a position to pass judgement on that, nor do I believe is anybody here, but I took the opportunity in recent months of saying to the management and the workers of Cork Verolme Dockyard that the demand for shipbuilding in the world is stagnant.  We have an over-capacity in shipping in the world today and they need not be expecting <Col N="605" /> orders to turn up in the future which will take up their full capacity.  I used the occasion to point out to them that when we look around at developments in offshore oil drilling in Ireland today, there must be opportunities there for a diversification of some of the technical skills in the Cork Dockyard.  I urge them to take every opportunity they get to try to diversify.  In relation to the Government decision of last July to place those orders with the yard, I fully believe that they took the right decision in the circumstances.  There is now two years' guaranteed work at Cork and they can use the opportunity in the meantime to see what diversification can be done.  I read with interest the comments of the managing director of that dockyard when he called for greater productivity in the years ahead.  We all know that the word &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; has been bandied around but it is only when one is familiar with an industry that one can make a rational judgment as to what productivity improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>I have covered a number of the points made in general terms in my reply so far. Let me tell this House that Irish Shipping are quite confident that they can charter this vessel successfully on the world market and that they do not see it as anything like a millstone around their necks in the short period in which they will have the vessel prior to its envisaged use for Moneypoint.  Irish Shipping's experts are quite confident that they can usefully charter this vessel and have it earning more foreign exchange currency, as Senator Hillery remarked in the debate.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the envisaged payment schedule for the vessel.  I assure everybody that there will be no damage whatsoever done to the commercial accounts of Irish Shipping.  They have fully calculated the full effects of this and at the end of the day they are quite happy with the arrangements that have been made.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy called for more development of maritime activities.  Some years ago there was a scheme to try to entice more of the private sector into shipping activities.  But, as we all know, there is now an over-capacity in this area. <Col N="606" /> It is not an area that is attractive to private investment at this time.  But I would refer him to the great harbour development programme being undertaken by the Government in Drogheda, Cork, Foynes and Rosslare.  We are making great progress in the area of harbour development.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker questioned if we had approached this decision in a rational way.  As far as I am concerned, I classify myself as a rational individual, and I have approached it in a rational manner.  I would take the point that there is always scope for applying cost/benefit analysis to every transaction.  Taking all the social aspects into consideration, taking the national interest into consideration, I am absolutely satisfied that the outcome of the cost/benefit analysis to the Irish economy is positive.  We are always conscious in Government that social considerations can involve cost to the taxpayer.  But it is a very fine balance which must be struck. The balance in this situation came down on the right side.  We should be seen to provide an opportunity to keep the work force together to get this ship for Irish Shipping so that we can carry our own coal in the future so that it is available when we need it while at the same time providing for the diversification of a very skilled work force.  When one has seen the human deprivation that unemployment causes, for instance, family breakdowns creating social frustrations, the cost to society cannot be measured in economic terms.  It is right that the Government should have a social conscience. The Government have a social conscience and they made the right decision in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to ask him one question relating to his speech?  It is satisfactory to hear that Irish Shipping are getting this vessel at an economic price.  This was not mentioned in the Minister's speech in the Seanad or in the Dáil.  One thing I am slightly confused about is that if Irish Shipping are getting the vessel at the right price, the nub of the argument has been Senator Whitaker's attempt to get a quantification of the social price.  Did the <Col N="607" /> Minister refer to what he thinks will be the element of subsidisation?  Did the Minister say what the gap will be between the economic price which Irish Shipping will be paying and the subsidy over and above that which the Irish Government will be paying to keep Verolme floating?</P>

      <P>I understand from what we were told at the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies that the Verolme <Col N="608" /> people will not quote a fixed price contract and, consequently, it is not possible at this stage to know what the ultimate cost of this ship will be.  Guestimates can be made, but the Verolme people will not quote a fixed price.  I should like the Minister to be specific with us as to whether there will be a limit on what Irish Shipping will have to put into it.  Will it be a figure appropriate to the amount for which they could buy a ship abroad?  Will there be a limit and, if so, what will be the limit they will be asked to pay on top of that, (a) by using the extra capital, and (b) by using the extra borrowing facilities?</P>

Let me assure the Senator that the Irish Shipping people are the best negotiators in relation to the prices of ships today.  The Senator need have no doubt that, in carrying out and finalising negotiations with Verolme Cork Dockyard they will ensure that they get value for money, and that what they sign for on the day will be in their own interests.  They will protect their own interests fully.  We have been looking at prices from a Japanese yard and from a Korean yard which, of course, are in US dollars.  There are fluctuations in currencies.  Irish Shipping are requesting extras to be included in the plans of this new ship.  There will be no interference and no over-weighting in relation to what the commercial accounts of Irish Shipping can bear.  Irish Shipping are quite satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could help us by clarifying the matter a little further. He says that Irish Shipping will be charged the world economic price.  Does that mean that the amount of capital they will require is just that sum?  Will they not require that sum plus the £10 million extra which it will cost them to buy it from Verolme?  Does it really mean that, while they will be paying out £25 million, let us say, as against the £15 million it ought to have cost them, the Minister will arrange their finances by giving them free equity capital of £10 million so that, in effect, they only bear the capital charges on the £15 million which is the world economic price?  I should like the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>

In relation to the financing of this arrangement as regards Irish Shipping, and they are involved in it, I do not follow what confusion exists in the Senator's mind in relation to what somebody in Irish Shipping may have said in some particular case.  I made it clear that if the figure is £12 million or £13 million, 50 per cent of it will be by way of State equity into Irish Shipping and 50 per cent of it will be by way of borrowings by Irish Shipping.

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a fairly standard piece of legislation, the purpose of which is to provide for certain amendments to the Industrial Alcohol Acts, 1938 to 1947.  These Acts relate to Ceimicí Teoranta, a State-sponsored company currently engaged in the production of industrial alcohol, potable alcohol and glucose.  The main objects of the Bill are: to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of Ceimicí Teoranta from £500,000 to £10 million with, as a consequence, a similar increase in value of share capital which the Minister for Finance may take up; the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, of borrowings by the company up to a limit of £10 million; the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism; and the revocation of certain restrictive provisions in the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the setting up of this State-sponsored company is briefly as follows: Under the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1934, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was empowered to undertake the manufacture, distillation and sale of industrial alcohol so as to provide an assured outlet for potatoes surplus to market requirements and, at the same time, to provide employment in areas where it was not previously available. <Col N="613" /> Accordingly, five factories were established&mdash;one each at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; Cooley, County Louth; Corroy, County Mayo; Carndonagh, County Donegal and Labbadish, County Donegal.  That Act was superseded by the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938, under which Monarchana Alcoil na hÉireann Teoranta was set up to manage the undertaking.  The Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Act, 1947, changed the name of the company to Ceimicí Teoranta and under this latter Act the company were given wider powers for research in relation to the manufacture of substances by chemical process and the manufacture and sale of such substances.</P>
    <P>Although the original objective in setting up the company was to provide an outlet for surplus potatoes, from as early as the 1938&mdash;39 season sufficient quantities of this raw material were not available to keep the five factories going and the company began to use imported sugar cane molasses to supplement the available supply of potatoes.  Following a rationalisation of the company's activities in the 1950s the premises at Carrickmacross were disposed of and starch was produced from potatoes seasonally at Labbadish until 1971, when, owing to a lack of raw materials, this operation ceased.  The production of industrial Alcohol continued at Carndonagh and Cooley.  Ceimicí Teoranta now produce glucose at their Corroy plant, using imported maize starch.  The company diversified into potable alcohol production in 1971&mdash;72.</P>
    <P>Ceimicí's operations are currently, therefore, confined to the following areas of activity: Industrial and potable alcohol production at the Cooley, County Louth, and Carndonagh, County Donegal, distilleries and production of glucose at their plant at Corroy, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Industrial alcohol is sold to the petrol companies who, under the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938 are obliged to purchase it in quantities stipulated by the company with the consent of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism at <Col N="614" /> a price fixed by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance. The price is fixed at a level adequate to give Ceimicí Teoranta a profit on alcohol production.  A small proportion of industrial alcohol is also manufactured for use as a solvent and other related uses.</P>
    <P>Potable alcohol is sold to Irish companies which require neutral spirit for the production of vodka, gin, white rum and certain liqueurs.</P>
    <P>Liquid glucose is sold to producers of confectionery, chocolate, jams and so on, and Ceimicí Teoranta are the only native suppliers of glucose to this industry which employs in excess of 15,000 people.</P>
    <P>Employment by Ceimicí Teoranta is of the order of 150 persons and in addition imports of maize starch through Ballina harbour provide part-time employment for 33 men.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the company's activities by the IDA in 1973 at the request of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce the Government in May 1976 decided that the board of Ceimicí should be reconstituted and that the new Board would be instructed, <i>inter alia,</i> to phase out these activities found to be non-viable.  They would also be instructed:&mdash;to consider the possibility of association with another Irish firm in the field of potable alcohol; to study urgently the establishment of an integrated maize-glucose plant, perhaps in association with a major foreign producer; and to examine the prospects for producing fine chemicals.</P>
    <P>It was noted at that time that it could be necessary for the Government to give capital backing for any sound projects which might evolve and this would involve amending legislation to increase the share capital of the company.</P>
    <P>The board were reconstituted with the appointment of three new members in 1977 and 1978 and a new chairman was appointed in 1977.  Two new general managers were also appointed who are specialists in their own fields.  For various reasons, and despite the best efforts of the company, it was not possible for Ceimicí to secure the interest of a joint venture partner in either the potable alcohol or glucose fields.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> As the company were unsuccessful in their efforts to secure a joint venture in glucose, the board decided that the only realistic option was to refurbish their existing glucose factory at Corroy in order to maintain the company's position as prime supplier of glucose to the Irish market and to achieve viability in this product while providing time for a new project to develop.  The cost of the refurbishing, now £1.6 million, was approved in April 1979, to be financed by the means of an IDA grant of £445,000 and temporary borrowings by the company of the balance of the finance required pending the enactment of amending legislation which would permit an increase in the company's equity base.  This is necessary because, of the company's existing authorised share capital of £500,000, £495,755 is paid up and held by the Minister for Finance.  This equity participation is the only Government investment in the company.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the company expended £150,000 on the Corroy project all of which was borrowed and in order that the refurbishing of the Corroy plant can proceed with the utmost speed, the company have had to resort to further borrowings in 1980 to finance the project, which is expected to be completed at the end of this year.  A provision of £585,000 from Exchequer sources had been included in the Public Capital Programme for 1980 but this capital cannot be provided to Ceimicí without amending legislation. Meanwhile, with the present high level of interest rates, the company are finding these borrowings an unbearable burden which can only be relieved by an immediate injection of equity.</P>
    <P>In 1980 two major developments have occurred in relation to the future activities of the company.  One of these has been the consideration by the company of proposals to refurbish and modernise their two distilleries at Carndonagh and Cooley.  In considering the proposals account will be taken of the use of industrial alcohol in the context of gasohol production, which is a blend of petrol and alcohol.  Studies into the use of gasohol have been undertaken in several <Col N="616" /> overseas countries and in some countries, Brazil and the United States, for example, programmes involving the use of gasohol as a transportation fuel are already under way.  Information available to me at present would seem to indicate that such a programme would not be a viable proposition in an Irish context due to the large difference in price between alcohol and petrol, alcohol being considerably more expensive.  However, in the long term, with the ever increasing cost of petrol and technological improvements, this situation may change.  For this reason, further study of these possibilities appears to be warranted.</P>
    <P>The second development in the company during 1980 has been the commencement of negotiations with an Australian company with a view to a joint venture in a milling-glucose-dextrose operation based on wheat.</P>
    <P>The proposed new venture would be the largest of its kind in Europe producing starch and gluten for the home market and starch, gluten and animal feed for EEC and world markets and would provide a valuable spin-off benefit to the Irish farming community.</P>
    <P>Employment would be created for about 120 persons and the proposed new enterprise will be the first major manufacturer of gluten on the Irish market. The project will be of strategic importance in the development of the food industry, providing inputs for the flour and sugar confectionary industries, with the prospect of further downstream employment in these industries.</P>
    <P>This project is of particular significance in that it is a joint venture between an Irish State-owned company and a prestigious Australian public company and should be mutually beneficial.  Ireland offers to this company an experienced chemical company as partner and ready access to the lucrative European market. In return the Australian partner, a recognised leader in its field, will contribute valuable technological knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on this project are now at an advanced stage and while the details of equity provision and borrowings cannot as yet be finalised.  Ceimicí estimate <Col N="617" /> the main equity requirements at £4 million, £2 million for each partner.  Ceimicí have also indicated that there may be several further stages of development in the project involving a doubling of investment and employment.</P>
    <P>The company have also been actively investigating possible opportunities for the manufacture of fine chemicals particularly in terms of a joint venture with an overseas company.</P>
    <P>An increase in the authorised share capital to £10 million and provision for guarantee by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism of borrowings in a similar amount would allow for the financing of the Corroy glucose project and also provide the necessary financial backing for further projects which may be approved.  The company have found in their negotiations on joint ventures that the fact that their authorised share capital is only £500,000 is a minus factor; although this level may have been adequate in 1938 it could hardly be considered realistic in 1980.  In the circumstances it is clear that a more realistic share capital base for the company is now necessary.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity in this Bill to seek the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  These functions are mainly of an administrative nature and are being transferred on the recommendation of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.</P>
    <P>Finally, this Bill provides for the repealing of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Act, 1947.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Act prohibit the manufacture by Ceimicí Teoranta of certain chemical products except under licence from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  This provision was originally intended to prevent Ceimicí Teoranta cutting across any chemical manufacturing operations being carried out in this country by private enterprise, but this position can be achieved without these legislative provisions, which have been found to have an inhibiting effect on possible joint ventures <Col N="618" /> by the company with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Act, 1947, which provides that the Government may prohibit the importation of any specified chemical product is contrary to our EEC commitments and it is accordingly necessary to repeal it.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Bill, 1980, will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before addressing myself to the Bill I would first like to welcome the Minister of State to this House.  It is the first time I have met him officially, and I would like to congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>This Bill is non-controversial and has our support.  It deals largely with the necessity to increase the authorised share capital of Ceimicí Teoranta from £500,000 to £10 million.  In a sense the Minister's speech paints a fairly dismal picture of the very disturbing position in so far as potatoes are concerned.  We know that the Sugar Company and Éireann Foods have had great difficulty in getting sufficient quantities of potatoes grown.  We see it again in this particular industry which was established, I am sure, in very good faith in 1934 with a view to providing an employment based on the potato.  Yet we find that as early as 1938 and 1939 there were insufficient potatoes to feed these various factories and there was rationalisation apparently all along the line until there was only one factory in the end, Labbadish, which was based on potatoes and which closed in 1971.  It is remarkable in a sense that without this original raw material the company had survived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most satisfactory part of the introduction of this Bill is the necessity to do so because of the possibility of the joint venture with the Australian company.  It is particularly welcome if Ceimicí can use their existing resources to get into a joint venture in milling glucose and dextrose based on wheat.  It would be a major achievement and a particularly welcome type of industry based on a native <Col N="619" /> resource.  It is particularly satisfactory that wheat is the raw material, because the trouble with the wheat crop in this country is that to a large extent much of the grain grown here is unsuitable at least in 100 per cent use in the flour industry. The development of another major industry which will be based on Irish wheat, and I understand that Irish wheat will be suitable for this particular product &mdash; would be a boon not simply to exports, not simply to the employment within the factory itself but to the spin-off and the additional employment and revenue to the farming community.</P>
    <P>The other matters contained within the Bill are relatively minor matters.  The transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the repeal of sections 5, 6 and 7, the prohibition of the manufacturing of certain chemical products except under licence by the Minister for Industry and Commerce will go along with this.  Section 8 apparently deals with the question of the importation of chemicals being prohibited.  That is apparently against the EEC commitments and has to be taken out.  We take no exception to its going.</P>
    <P>The only point I note from reading the Minister's speech and from looking at the debate in the Dáil is the question of propriety in so far as State finances are concerned.  It concerns the question of the refurbishing of the Corroy factory, which the Minister has stated was unsuccessful in efforts to secure a joint venture in glucose.  The board decided that the only realistic option was to refurbish the existing glucose factory at Corroy in order to maintain the company's position as prime supplier of glucose for the Irish market and to achieve viability in this product.</P>
    <P>I support fully the refurbishing of that factory, particularly since it is happening in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Having said that, one of the things that is a little bit disturbing about the principle of the matter is that apparently the cost of the refurbishing, estimated at £1.6 million, was approved in April 1979 to be financed by an IDA grant of approximately £500,000, namely leaving about <Col N="620" /> £1.15 million to be found by the company.  This was to be found by way of temporary borrowings of the balance of the finance required pending the enactment of amending legislation which would permit an increase in the company's equity base.  What is happening is that we are having legislation introduced today retrospectively to make valid a decision of a semi-State company which hardly had the authority to make that decision at that time due to the limitations on their finance under legislation. The only point there is that it would seem desirable that in the first instance finances are in shape in so far as the Minister's Department are concerned and that the function of these companies is to act within the limits of that legislation.  This in a sense would seem to be pushing us to go along with what is a <i>fait accompli.</i> Again I am just talking about the principle of the matter in so far as the Auditor General is concerned.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words about this Bill.  It is welcome to see this far more pleasant financial base being given to Ceimicí Teoranta, particularly in view of the fact that they have entered and will enter into further negotiations with regard to possible joint ventures.  In my own county we have had a small industrial factory in the Cooley peninsula for about 40 years.  Certainly the refurbishing contemplated in this Bill will be welcome.  Ceimicí Teoranta employ a rather small number of people, something in the region of 150 but they have done a very good service at the locations in which they have had factories for the past four or five decades.  This was because of their being able to fulfil their original purpose to take up the potato supply in those areas.  The original reason no longer is the case.  Research programmes are being carried out in Ceimicí Teoranta and the possibility of new ventures in the future is being explored. Being studied also are the implications of the gasohol business which we may have to entertain some time in the future. These will provide future employment opportunities in the couple of locations in which Ceimicí Teoranta still have factories. <Col N="621" />  In County Louth the factory in Cooley has long been established there and has always been a reputable factory in that locality.  I know that the people of the Cooley peninsula and indeed of the county generally will welcome the additional injection of money being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a brief word on the Bill.  The Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies reported on this company some time ago.  It would have been good for the morale of the members of that body if the Minister in either House or indeed any Member in either House gave at least a nod in the direction of that report.  It has not happened.  That report raises some matters that I think the Minister might advert to when he is replying. He is asking for a substantial increase in the capital of the company and has indicated the direction in which the company propose to expand by way of a joint venture with an Australian company, that is, in processing wheat for the production of glucose.  The Joint Committee in their report felt that even the utilisation of a cereal grown in Ireland, while it is an attractive idea, raises the question of the economics of it for reasons which the report went into in some detail.  I presume that the economics of this projected joint venture have been thoroughly gone into and have come out satisfactorily, but in view of that question mark raised by the report on a venture of this kind I would like the Minister to be more specific with regard to his projections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly the company, Ceimicí Teoranta, also engage in the manufacture of alcohol, both industrial and potable alcohol.  I suppose some of the increased capital may be used in improvements to be made in the two distilleries.  The Minister indicates that in his speech, but deals with it very briefly.  I would like to know what are the long-term future plans for these two distilleries and the plans for the production of alcohol in greater quantities and how it is proposed to be sold or what generally is the thinking of the Department with regard to these factors.  The Committee asked that the full role of the company would be reassessed and reappraised <Col N="622" /> within the Minister's Department.  I would be glad to know how that reappraisal stands at the moment and if any conclusions or any signposts with regard to the future of the company have been thrown up by the reappraisal.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad who have contributed for their reception of this legislation.  In relation to the point raised by Senator Staunton in relation to the moneys being provided for the refurbishing, first of all it is necessary to retain Irish customers.  In order not to give customers over to imports and to help to get the joint venture under way, there was a certain urgency about the matter.  For that reason, the thing had to proceed on the lines that it did.</P>
      <P>On the question of the joint venture which was raised by Senator Cooney, all I can say is that the whole thing has been fully assessed by the IDA and that we rely on the confidence of these people who, generally speaking, went into all the details in connection with these matters and who are slow to come down with the decision unless they are absolutely sure that the matter is one which should be proceeded with.  I would certainly rely on their judgment in this, and I feel that they have given the correct decision.  I have mentioned the question of the future and the potential of the industry in my speech.  I have given a fairly detailed outline of the manner in which the company has been operating and the need to have this legislation introduced. I again thank the Senators for their contributions and for their reception of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) (No. 2) Order, 1980 which I made on 11 December 1980 under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>This order extends for a further two months the currency of a statutory ban created by the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972 on the operation of new company owned motor spirit stations by oil companies.  That order, as amended, is due to expire on 18 January 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of concern throughout the sixties at the growth of the number of retail outlets directly operated by the petrol companies the then Minister requested <Col N="624" /> the Fair Trade Commission in 1970 to hold an inquiry into the growth in the number of such outlets.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission, in their report of that inquiry, argued that the growth of the control by the oil companies over the retail market needed to be halted for a time in the public interest as it felt that this development would lead to dominance over the retail trade by the petrol companies and increase the risk of such restrictive practices as price fixing and market sharing. An order made in 1972 halted this development for three years.  The order was reviewed by the commission in 1975 and on their recommendation it was extended for another three years until the summer of 1978.</P>
    <P>In their report of the 1975 review the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended that they should review the operation of the relevant orders as a whole before the expiry date in 1978.  I, therefore, requested the commission in March 1978 to hold an inquiry into the operation of the current Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Orders, into any matters germane to the operation of these orders and also into the conditions which obtain in regard to agreements under which petrol stations, which are company owned but not company run, are operated.  This latter aspect was included in the commission's terms of reference because of concern that the agreements in question were unfair to the operator.</P>
    <P>To enable the inquiry to be held and pending examination of the report and decisions on the commission's recommendations I extended the ban for two and a half years to 18 January 1981 by means of orders made in 1978, 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>I received the commission's report some months ago.  I had hoped to have had an Order made implementing those of the recommendations in the report which I accept and to have had a confirming Bill before the House before the expiry of the current prohibition.  However, because of the complexity of the Order I propose to make and the necessity for careful drafting some further time will be required to finalise this lengthy <Col N="625" /> Order which, I should add, will also consolidate all relevant legislation.  I have accordingly extended the currency of the statutory ban on the operation of new company owned motor spirit stations for a further two months to 18 March 1981.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 provides that Orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the Order.  The Order, however, may not be amended but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>
    <P>This is an uncontroversial measure and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a non-controversial Bill.  I note that the Minister received the Commission's report some months ago in relation to this matter.  The Minister is not responsible for the delay since he has only been recently appointed.  It is a pity that fuller legislation is not being introduced at this time, but what is being sought is merely an extension.  The Minister had previously extended it for two-and-a-half years to 18 January 1981 by Orders in 1978, 1979 and 1980 which were debated fully on each occasion in the House.  This is merely the seeking of a further ban up to 18 March to give the Minister sufficient time to draft the necessary legislation in the light of the commission's report.  We support this extension until that date.</P>

I am glad that the Minister asked the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out an investigation into the manner <Col N="626" /> and form of the agreement under which a lot of those company owned petrol stations were operated.  There were complaints through the sixties and the early part of the seventies.  It is good to see that that will form part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>When he introduces the Bill perhaps the Minister will give us some statistics as regards the growth of the petrol retail outlets in the period since 1972 when the present restriction was imposed.  In the years before that there was a phenomenal growth in petrol outlets.  It would be interesting to find out the growth rate since then, particularly in regard to the location and the geographical breakdown of these outlets.  I hope the Minister will have some statistics or information on those matters when he introduces the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Casual Trading Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When the Occasional Trading Bill was before the Seanad it was explained that there were problems connected with the drafting of legislation to regulate roadside and street trading.  I am glad to say that these have been resolved and the Bill we are considering contains everything that is necessary to eliminate the undesirable features of outdoor trading and ensure that such trading can again be a useful service instead of the nuisance it often is.</P>
      <P>This Bill and the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, give statutory effect to the main recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission who made a study of both occasional and casual trading.</P>
      <P>Roadside trading has become a nuisance because the traditional market place in the middle of the main street fouls up traffic and local authorities seldom, if ever, have been able to remedy this situation.  Equally bad problems arise when traders set up shop on the side of main roads.  Complaints have been made not only about the traffic problems but also about the debris created by these traders; unfair competition arising from the fact that these traders have lower selling costs than shopkeepers; possible loss of jobs in the distributive trades; evasion of taxes; and failure to give fair and reasonable services to consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> The complaints are often exaggerated, but I am satisfied that there are complaints which have to be remedied.  It is not my intention to put fair and honest street traders out of business or make life unreasonably difficult for them.  It is an unfortunate fact that there are quite a few members of the population who, for one reason or another, live in mobile homes and have no other means of earning money than by selling out of doors; and there are others who have fixed abodes but who choose to be street traders.  As many of them currently operate, they create problems and they are not making reasonable contributions to public funds, but there is nothing essentially wrong with their way of doing business.</P>
    <P>The Casual Trading Bill proposes to take all the powers needed to regulate outdoor trading and to impose fair and reasonable charges which are designed to offset some of the competitive advantages enjoyed by the traders and to contribute to the cost of administering this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that, with a few exceptions, the Act will apply to retailing on public roads and streets, other places to which the public have access as of right, and any other places which local authorities designate as casual trading areas. Every casual trader will have to take out an annual licence which, apart from two classes of traders, will cost £100 and, when a local authority designates a casual trading area, an additional £20 per annum will be payable to the local authority for a permit to trade in the area. A separate permit will be required for each designated casual trading area <Col N="631" /> and, if a trader wants to trade at more than one place at the same time in the one casual trading area, he will need a separate permit for each place.  I am taking power to vary the fees either generally or in respect of specified classes of traders and I would like it to be known that I intend to make use of this provision if, in the light of experience, it seems fair and reasonable to do so.  In so far as possible I will take account of such factors as charges on the rates arising from casual trading and the capacity of some classes of traders to pay more than others.</P>
    <P>The holder of a licence will be required to display it or a copy of it wherever he is trading, but if he is trading in a designated casual trading area he will have to display his permit instead.  I do not propose to anticipate debate on Committee Stage but I would just suggest that, unless we introduce a system of identity cards for all the population, this is as far as we can go towards making it possible for consumers and other interested parties to identify a casual trader with a view to contacting him at a later date to get after-sales service or for some other reason.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are being empowered to designate any land, including a public road, to which the public have access as of right and any land occupied by a local authority as a casual trading area.  By agreement, one local authority may designate land in another authority's area. The designation of trading areas will be a reserved function within the meaning of the various Management Acts &mdash; that is to say it will be the elected local representatives rather than the officials who will take the decisions.  The authorities will be required to take into account the proper planning and development of their areas, amenity orders, traffic problems and all other matters they consider relevant when considering trading sites. The proposed procedure is laid down in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 the scope of which is being extended for this purpose. This has the merit of avoiding new legal and administrative procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> It is proposed that a person may appeal to the Circuit Court and no further against a local authority's designation of an area because it would be extravagant if the authority's development plan, amenity orders, and so on, could be subjected to lengthy and vexatious litigation when it performed what is, basically, the executive function of suiting local outdoor trading to the overall plan.  For the same reason, a person will not be free to appeal further than the Circuit Court in connection with a decision to extinguish a market right &mdash; a subject I will be referring to shortly.</P>
    <P>A local authority may make by-laws in relation to the control, regulation, supervision and administration of a casual trading area.  It is specified that an authority may limit the area a trader may occupy but, beyond that, an authority is free to cover whatever things are necessary to suit casual trading to local circumstances. It will be noted that, so far as specified in the Bill, the only income of a local authority is the £20 permit fee, but Senators will know that local authorities do not need the authority of this legislation to charge rents, tolls, stallages and, perhaps, other charges which would be directly related to the cost of providing facilities for, or servicing, street trading areas.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a local authority may acquire a market right by agreement or compulsorily and, here again, we are extending the scope of existing local government legislation to prescribe the procedure.  This was one of the things that delayed the circulation of the Bill.  Local authorities had acquired market rights from private persons in the past but I am told they were unable to extinguish the market right or change the location of the market or take any measures which would tailor the public marketing arrangements to suit modern conditions.</P>
    <P>We are providing that a local authority can continue a market or fair under their own management or may extinguish the market right and provide alternative facilities in the same vicinity and comprising or including facilities reasonably suitable for the holding of a market. <Col N="633" />  What this means is that a local authority could substitute a casual trading area for the market.</P>
    <P>Most of the other provisions in the Bill are fairly commonplace in legislation of this type and at this stage I need to refer only to two other matters.</P>
    <P>The first of these is the role of the Garda Síochána in enforcing the Act.  We are giving the Garda the same powers as authorised officers who will be appointed by me and by local authorities.  In addition, we are giving the Garda power similar to those they enjoy under the Street Trading Act, 1926 &mdash; powers to arrest without warrant in certain circumstances and powers to seize and detain vehicles and goods used by people contravening the Act.  The Street Trading Act applies only to Dublin and 26 other urban areas who have adopted it but the Bill will extend the powers of arrest and seizure to the whole State.  The Garda asked for these powers.  Local authorities who made submissions to the Restrictive Practices Commission urged that these powers are needed in certain circumstances. For example, if a casual trader, or a group of them and their customers are creating a traffic hazard, that is something which should be dealt with immediately. Another case would arise where the owners of vehicles and other goods were not immediately identifiable &mdash; arrest and/or seizure would solve this problem.</P>
    <P>The final provision of the Bill is the section to amend the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.  I wanted to ensure that charities, hospitals, schools, sporting organisations by whom &mdash; or on whose behalf &mdash; sales were organised would not be bothered by either the Occasional Trading Act or this Bill but it was brought home to us that a trader who made a contribution to a charity or other worthy nonprofit making cause could avail of the statutory exception and we would seldom, if ever, be able to prove where the rest of the profits were going.  For that reason we have provided to tighten up the provision in the Occasional Trading Act and the corresponding part of the Casual Trading Bill.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill contains all the fair and reasonable provisions needed <Col N="634" /> to confine outdoor trading to suitable places and to regulate trading at those places.  I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in agreement with this Bill which gives effect to the main recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I am aware of the great need for this Bill.  For a number of years established traders in the community had very legitimate grievances as did the trade unions.  We had a position under which people operating in normal premises in towns and villages were facing unfair competition.  They were in the business of having to pay rates through the rating system to provide maintenance for their properties, to pay taxes in the form of income tax, and to collect tax from those who worked for them through the PAYE system.  They had an obligation to their workers who in turn had reasonable conditions about which the trade unions were concerned.  With this structure of overheads they were faced with a type of competition which was not giving them equity.</P>
      <P>For that reason there was a spate of representations to public representatives all over this country, which I am sure is part of the reason why we have this Casual Trading Bill before us this afternoon. It provides the necessary balance for a more equitable trading position from now on.  On the other hand, the section of the community who have been trading on the roadsides and on the streets are also part of our Irish way of life and have been for many generations, and it would be unfair to go too far in penalising them in turn for the type of activity in which they are involved.  This Bill sets a fair balance to protect the side of the community that has been affected, without unduly penalising those who are involved in roadside trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing fees referred to by the Minister are reasonable and could not be complained about.  I agree with his remarks, too, about main thoroughfares. The inadequacy of the road system, the extent to which houses are built on main roads and the extent to which traders are there are all dangerous.  I do not believe that these traders should be allowed to <Col N="635" /> trade on main thoroughfares.  They are a hazard to themselves, to their own children, to motorists, and they are a hazard as well in the sense that if a motorist is stopping at one of these roadside traders on a main thorouthfare, the build up of traffic that can occur may result in loss of life.  It is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear reference made to the necessity to ensure that when these traders move from sites the areas they have left are kept in good condition.  The role of local authorities will be very important in the administration of this in terms of by-laws.  County councils, especially since their involvement in planning, are very capable of assuming this role, especially if in major towns the local authorities can be effective in designating special areas for this type of trading.  That will be an immense advantage, because one of the problems on fair days and market days in some of our towns is that there is a considerable amount of traffic congestion because trading is taking place in the centre of areas of very heavy traffic.  For some years there has been a very big anomaly in this area.  There has been a lack of equity.  There has been a tremendous will to see Government introduce a Bill to control the matters about which we are speaking.  This Bill gives effect to that, and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a believer in the old dictum <i>caveat emptor</i>, let the buyer beware, I do not have much sympathy for people I see purchasing at stalls from these streetside vendors.  However, they are a fact of life and we must do something about them.  This Bill should include a provision for after sale service, which is practically non-existent at present in regard to what one purchases in these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Bill contain a requirement that these vendors should display their licences or their permits. Perhaps the Minister would indicate why he only wishes them to display permits in the casual trading area rather than their licences.  They should display their licence as well as the permit.  Local authorities should discourage individuals setting <Col N="636" /> up on streets and try to channel all this activity into trading areas.  Most local authorities have at their disposal some open spaces, they may be fair grounds or established market places.  Local authorities should try to channel all these casual traders into such areas and have an established, recognised trading area, rather than have them popping up from day to day in the most unlikely places.  Local authorities have a great opportunity in this, apart from responsibility for a certain amount of better planning in regard to the areas under their jurisdiction. County managers should insist that these traders would act in a responsible way and be channelled into an area where local people could do whatever business they wanted to do there.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will have a greater opportunity to go into this matter, the matter of fines and that sort of thing, for supplying false information. We welcome the Bill.  I wonder if it gets over the problem which I believe exists in certain towns in Ireland, where there was, by old charter, perhaps dating back to the 15th or 14th century or even earlier, an established right or what was taken as an assumed right for a person to set up a market stall in any part of a town. Will section 8 of the Bill get over that point <i>in toto</i>?  It says that the local authority may acquire any market right in respect of a market or fair in its functional area.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether he is confident that section 8 will get over this problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Business people have a very big grievance with regard to roadside trading, particularly in the Border area.  It was more through an accident than anything else with our entering into the EMS and the change of currency and the breaking away from sterling, that brought that situation about.  Prior to that, in Border areas, every day a new outfit had set up.  They were selling wirelesses, blankets, you name it, they had it. These people are gone now.  We no longer see them because of the change of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traders had a genuine grievance about this in so far as they were in competition with this type of business which, to them, <Col N="637" /> was unfair competition.  Somebody set himself up on the road with a van, he had no permit and he succeeded in selling his wares and the local business community suffered a great loss.  I believe that situation will come back again.  Our currency may tighten itself up.  If it comes back, there is nothing in this Bill to prevent that happening again, other than a £20 permit, which I think is not sufficient because these people move to where they can sell their wares.  They move to cattle marts, football matches and to any place where there is a large number of people and they succeed in doing that.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Bill goes far enough to protect the ordinary trader. He is one of the people who is not exempt from rates, and his rates, even in the past three years, are increasing at the rate of 11 and 12 per cent per year.  There should be some protection in the Bill.  Maybe I say that as a trader, but I know that a number of complaints have been made.m The Minister's constituency has not that problem.  They are not as near to the border as the rest of us are.</P>
    <P>With regard to county council planning, I do not think that at any time they infringed the plan of the county council because they are only there temporarily. In most towns in rural Ireland there is a given day that a number of people visit, perhaps on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  Casual traders are there on whatever day the town is busy and they set themselves up on the main street or where most people are passing.  They are a menance to the traffic passing through these towns.  There will have to be some firm direction given to local authorities on this issue.</P>
    <P>At the other end, John Citizen wants to buy something cheap.  These people advertise their wares, washing machines, cookers, drapery or even food and vegetables.  If they sell something defective they are not there when the customer comes back and there is no guarantee. We are obliged to protect people from themselves, although it is difficult.  Something will have to be done to protect them.  Food sales may be all right.  They <Col N="638" /> come from Killybegs to my own town, which is about 120 miles away, selling fish, and a number of people buy it.  An ordinary merchant selling fish is haunted by health inspectors but roadside traders are not responsible to anybody.  The Bill does not go far enough in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of the Casual Trading Bill which will have to be handled very carefully.  It deals with circumstances which arise at marts.  Formerly, fairs were held on the streets in towns when markets were held exclusively for the sale of goods which were home produced, agricultural goods or goods which were processed in conditions which were suitable and useful to the purchaser.  These people have the opportunity of seasonally displaying goods at the fair or market.  They are anxious to provide a service for people who wish to provide themselves with vegetables, corn, seed potatoes and so on, in the spring.  People who bring them there and put them on the market do so because it is where farmers are congregated and it is an opportunity for farmers to buy their wares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know one market where people congregate to sell donkeys, whereas at a cattle market they sell ponies, vegetables and certain goods associated with the livestock services and veterinary medicines.  These people should not be classified in the same category as fly-in and fly-out people, who put down their bits and pieces of canvas without anyone knowing who they are or what kind of goods they have, whether valuable or shoddy.  These are the people to whom the Minister is anxious to apply this Casual Trading Bill.  I hope there will not be any conflict in his opinion or in the administration by his officers or by the Garda Síochána with regard to the people to whom I have referred who are associated with agricultural life.  They should not be mixed up, in the minds of the administrators, with the other kind of person whom we all feel the Bill should apply to.  I hope that circumstances will not arise where the Minister would have the Bill going through each House and becoming law without considering this <Col N="639" /> aspect of it.  What Senator Reynolds said about rural areas is true.  People have come into various market towns when markets had a greater agricultural content than they have now.  Nobody knew who they were or where they came from. They sold goods, ostensibly new, but which were sub-standard.  The Minister should take cognisance of these circumstances as they arise and apply recognition to that aspect of it, which is important.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Casual Trading Bill has not come before its time.  I recall a debate some months ago on similar legislation.  At that time we were pressing for a Bill to cover casual trading.  I am glad to see that it has eventually emerged and that we have the opportunity of making a few comments on it.  It sets out to provide a framework within which casual traders have to operate.  Equally, it attempts to protect the interests of the public and to organise casual trading in a manner which will be satisfactory from the point of view of the general public and the local authorities in the different counties.  There is a general feeling, shared to some extent with members of the public, that casual traders offer a service that may not always be available from the established outfits.  That is something which is highly questionable. There were three main areas where it was necessary to establish a code of behaviour, certain regulations to provide protection: first of all, the necessity of ensuring that the sites from which casual traders operate would be so regulated as not to cause a traffic hazard or a danger to the public.  There is the necessity to ensure &mdash; I do not know if we have done it in this Bill &mdash; that the standard and quality of the article made available for sale will be such as not to put the public at a disadvantage.  We must also recognise that there was a need to correct the situation because the casual trader had a distinct advantage in cost and so forth as against the established traders in local towns.  The established traders were faced with the casual trader who arrived overnight, pitched his tent and offered various <Col N="640" /> articles for sale, in competition with the local operators.</P>
      <P>The local shopkeepers and traders were ratepayers, they were providing employment and their industry, their business and the livelihood of many of their employees were being put at risk by the activities of the casua; traders.  As things operated up to now, the casual trader had a distinct advantage over the established trader.</P>
      <P>The casual traders on many of our public roads and highways created a traffic hazard.  I see them in my own part of the country operating at the sides of some of our principal roads, drawing the attention of passers-by, lines of cars queueing on either side and creating a danger and a hazard to other road users.  The Bill will, to a very great extent, rectify this danger.</P>
      <P>Senator Markey asked a few moments ago to what extent would this Bill get over a problem that some local authorities and local councils have had to deal with &mdash; the rights of casual trading that apparently exist under some ancient charters in many towns.  A local council in my own county had difficulties on this score, and while we will have a detailed discussion on section 8 of the Bill, perhaps the Minister would indicate if there is adequate power within the provisions of section 8 to enable local authorities and local councils to get over the difficulty which has been created by ancient charters providing rights to casual traders to operate in designated areas in certain towns.  It is necessary that there should be a fair measure of muscle in the Bill to ensure adherence to its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one talks of fines of £5,000, of confiscation of goods, and the sale of these goods, these penalties are very sweeping.  Perhaps the Minister feels they are necessary.  I would like him to indicate if sweeping powers are being vested in the Commissioner of the Garda to impose these fines.  In somewhat similar legislation, we have been reluctant to do that in the past.  But by and large, the measure is welcome, it is necessary and I hope that when it is enacted it will deal effectively with the problems that <Col N="641" /> undoubtedly exist in this field at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is attempting to tackle a very difficult job, the regulation of casual trading. There is one particular reason why I welcome it.  Perhaps it is not one that has been emphasised very much by other Senators and perhaps not very much emphasised either by the Minister's introductory speech.  There is a side effect of casual trading, which is the dirt and rubbish created on the streets.  Casual trading is only one of the causes of dirt and rubbish in the streets, but we have an extremely serious problem of a dirty image, particularly with tourists.  Unfortunately, one says particularly with tourists, because we seem to have accustomed ourselves to dirty streets, to debris and to waste paper all over the place.  A very important aspect of regulating casual trading would be that the dirt or debris results would form an important part of judging whether or not people get licences and permits, on the record of cleanliness that they have.</P>
      <P>I stress this because for years I was in a position of dealing with hundreds of young foreign visitors to Ireland every year.  Before they left, as a sort of market survey, we always asked them to write their impressions of the two or three months' stay in Ireland during which we would have arranged for them to travel around the country.  In almost 100 per cent of the essays which were generally favourable to the country they did remark, in a slightly bemused manner, on the extraordinary high level of acceptability among Irish people of the dirt in the streets everywhere.  To most continental Europeans, certainly anybody from Northern Europe, it struck them as being quite astonishing that we could tolerate such dirt all over the place.  That is one aspect that I hope attention will be paid to when we are attempting to regulate casual trading.  I realise that not for one moment was dirt the main reason why this Bill is being brought in, but I would like to upgrade that reason if you like and appeal to the Minister to give special attention to that whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> I was very struck by the compassion and the interest the Minister displayed in people who for one reason or another live in mobile homes and have no other means of earning money than by selling out of doors.  Obviously there are people who depend on this kind of job to make a few bob.  Indeed it is also true that traditionally there has been a great deal of colourful character associated with casual trading and obviously nobody wants to see that die out.  However I believe that the character and the colourful qualities of casual trading are far outweighed by the evils resulting from it, certainly in this area of debris in the streets.</P>
    <P>I have not very much more to say on the Bill except that I am very glad that it excludes horticultural and home-produced produce.  A very pleasant part of any journey through Ireland in the months of June or July is the possibility of buying strawberries or other fruit on the roadside, people's produce of which they are justly proud.  I am very glad that that has been excluded.</P>
    <P>In the difficulty which the Minister mentions of following up casual traders and tracing them for possible come-back on problems he mentioned briefly that unless we introduce a system of identity cards it would be very difficult to copperfasten any attempts to trace people.  I do not know what would be the objection to a system of identity cards in this country.  It is common practice in most European countries that everybody carries an identity card.  In the Bill we should not immediately shy away from that just because it would cause a difficulty to introduce them right across the board.  For example I know that people who are concerned with under-age drinking, consider that identity cards for the population as a whole would be a greater help to publicans in this matter.</P>
    <P>That is really all I want to say on the Bill.  I want to re-emphasise that I feel the debris in and the dirt of our streets are an appalling example to young people.  It is saddening to see how used we have all got to it, and I hope there will be a lot of emphasis placed on that aspect when this casual trading is regulated.</P>
    <Col N="643" />
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  For too many years we have had to put up here with the type of trading now to be prohibited under the provisions of this Bill.  I am delighted to see it being introduced for a few reasons, one of which would be that for many years the type of merchandise being sold by these people was of very questionable quality.  In a lot of cases their origin was questionable and in many many cases, particularly in electrical goods, the merchandise was downright dangerous.  The standard of the electrical goods meant that they would not pass any test by any good electrician. They were definitely the cause of many problems and constituted hazards in many homes.  Hopefully, with the provisions of this Bill we will be able to regulate not alone where people can trade but also that it will mean we will be able to regulate not alone where people can trade but also that it will mean we will be able to regulate the type of merchandise sold by these casual traders under licence.  There is no doubt, as Senator Hussey said, that there is a joy in seeing somebody trading casually but in an orderly fashion, particularly in the horticultural field when people can buy fruit and vegetables at a reasonable charge straight from the farm or producer.</P>
      <P>I would just like to ask one question regarding the definition of casual trading. What is the situation regarding a supermarket or a major store which leases space to people other than the owners of the store?  It is becoming increasingly widespread that in many of the larger stores the owners lease half of their premises at certain times of the year &mdash; at Christmas or Easter &mdash; to people who sell seasonal items.  Will people who take space in these stores be considered casual traders, will they have to have a licence, or are they covered by the fact that they are operating from within a store, shop or retail outlet of any description?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the traditional markets will be capable of being maintained is a very good thing.  In many country areas people who run such ventures as country markets, people like the ICA and so on, do so in an orderly fashion on some Saturday <Col N="644" /> mornings or other occasions throughout the year.  Such people provide a very useful local amenity.  From the point of view of regulation of trade anybody in business will wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  Indeed the public should welcome its introduction because it will mean that if they buy from a casual trader in future they will know that that casual trader has been licensed, that if he deals in shoddy goods, in goods which are of questionable origin he will be fined heavily, also that he can lose his licence if he in any way deviates from the appropriate regulations.  Therefore the public will be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill. in the past two years we have seen quite an expansion in the incidence of casual trading, which has not contributed anything to the country as a whole.  At present there are certainly casual traders who seem to congregate in large numbers, squatting on property, be it in public or private ownership.  They seem to place themselves above the law.  As many speakers have pointed out this constitutes unfair competition to the ordinary merchants whether they be hardware, grocers or whatever.  I want to compliment the Minister for tackling this problem.  It is not fair that people can come in, set up a business and not contribute, as do the ordinary merchants and traders.  These casual traders pay neither rates nor taxes. Indeed I doubt very much if they pay VAT which, on some of the merchandise they sell, would be as high as 40 per cent. It is easy to give a customer a good bargain if one does not have to guarantee the goods and if one does not have to pay VAT.  At present in country towns traditional traders are subjected to severe pressure not alone from this kind of questionable activity but from the appearance right across the country of the multinational retail outlets.  In many counties there are price cutting wars going on in which the small independent family grocer, or trader has very little hope of competing.  Any regulation endeavouring to bring some kind of fair play back into the market must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> In recent years we have had several measures designed to protect the customer, many of which possibly emanated from the EEC.  However with this particular breed of itinerant traders the consumer has absolutely no protection, good, bad or indifferent.  These people are allowed to park on our major highways or arterial roads.  It is quite common for drivers to stop on impulse, as it were, without giving any kind of warning or indication.  This must surely be the cause of some accidents and certainly of many close shaves.  This practice must be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Most Members will be familiar with and conscious of the difficulty the police will have in enforcing this Bill because one is dealing with people&mdash;I think it is fair to say from observing them&mdash;who have scant respect for the law.  Therefore the Garda should be given the widest powers possible when people set up camp in a prohibited area.  I would invite any Members of the House to put themselves in an ordinary merchant's shoes, somebody who maintains a shop and a shop front.  One can understand his reaction when he finds, perhaps, a black plastic canopy or some kind of van on the kerb, two feet away from his shop, even excluding daylight from his premises, not to talk of this inhibiting customers from going into his store.  This happens practically every day in county towns.  At present the police seem to be incapable of moving these people on.  Indeed, the police should be capable of confiscating their vans, indeed the lot, just to move them out of a place.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any particular section should be allowed to dispose in public of merchandise whose origins certainly in many cases are questionable. This is a well-known fact.  People in the trade will say that the only way articles can be sold at the knocked down prices sometimes obtaining is because the merchandise is hot, has been stolen, is stolen property of whatever.  I see no reason why the House should be any way lenient in this respect or condone that kind of operation.  I hope that the Minister will examine the problem carefully and realise <Col N="646" /> the difficult people with whom he has to deal.</P>
    <P>Of late, there appears to be mixed up with these itinerant traders a small number of ordinary people, in the main farmers or market gardeners offering fresh vegetables for sale.  Over the past year these people have fallen into the same category and, I think, have been treated in much the same way by the Garda.  I do not blame the Garda for doing that.  I am glad that the Bill takes account of this because this year I am sure the imports of vegetables will be in the region of £7 million, with imports of over £3 million of potatoes alone.  These are absolutely and completely unnecessary imports. Our young farmers and others who are prepared to grow first-class quality vegetables should be encouraged to make them available to the consumers in as short a time as possible.  The people who sell their own fresh produce to the consumer should be encouraged.  When this Bill comes into operation I hope county councils and licensing authorities will make adequate provision for the encouragement of the direct sale of vegetables to the housewife.  This would be one way of eliminating our outrageous vegetables import bill.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that throughout the country local authorities have experienced difficulty in dealing with this category of people, the casual trader.  I sincerely hope that it will be possible for them in the coming financial year to allocate adequate finance for the acquisition, surface dressing and servicing of areas appropriate to this kind of trading.  I would be quite happy to see street traders of any category provided I was satisfied that they contributed their normal share of tax and that they did not constitute unfair competition for the people who have to meet sizeable taxation and rates bills at present.</P>
    <P>I have been many years in public life and this is the first year in my area that it has come to my notice that ordinary merchants, whether they be grocers or hardware merchants, are finding it extremely difficult and complaining about the burden of the rates.  This never happened <Col N="647" /> before, in my experience.  These people certainly need to have a break.  It is just not good enough that in latter years, not just on market days but at any old time, casual traders can trade on their doorsteps, almost hindering their customers in free access to their premises.  I hope this Bill will have a speedy passage through the house and that its implementation will at least give some encouragement and hope to a very hard pressed sector of our community, the ordinary merchant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill, as have other speakers, and look on it as at least a start in solving a problem which has been worrying the community for some time.  I can foresee certain difficulties ahead which will probably come to light when the Bill comes into operation.  This Bill will be welcomed also by a lot of the small retailers.  Indeed Senator McDonald spoke of some of the reasons I was going to mention.  One of them is that the retail trader, in a fixed position, feels that he or she is contributing to the community because they are paying their rates and taxes.  In this case the casual trader will be paying a licence fee which one might contend will probably offset the rates.  But then there is the question of paying taxation.  Most small shopkeepers have to pay income tax, which amount is usually arrived at by assessment.  To prove the figure they usually use the invoices of the supplier of the goods sold.  Similarly with regard to value-added tax, they trace back the tax by the purchases and are allowed the value-added tax on the invoices.  The question I want to ask is: will they give similar treatment to the casual traders? Are they likely to be followed up in this case because, if so, it will be fair treatment but probably it will also elucidate the source of some of the supplies sold at present.  On the question of specification and the following-up on the quality of goods supplied, I presume they will display their licence.  Presumably it will bear its number or something readily identifiable through which people will be able to follow-up and make a claim, if necessary.  Taking the Bill all in all it is a <Col N="648" /> good step and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators I welcome the Bill.  Every Senator who has spoken has referred to the problems experienced by the ordinary retailer or shopkeeper trying to compete with this casual trading throughout the country. Something had to be done about it, and this Bill is the answer.  I wonder does the Bill go far enough?  There are people who might be described as van traders who go around the country in vans selling produce, furniture and so on.  I am not so sure that such people are covered by the provisions of this Bill.  Perhaps another Bill should be introduced to cover them and their trading.  In my opinion they are more dangerous than the people who trade in the market square or on the side of the street.  They are people who go into houses, up dark laneways, knocking at doors and offering furniture, produce or whatever it may be they have for sale. Not alone do they offer items for sale but they insist that the article they offer be purchased.  By one method or another they insist that the person makes the purchase.  Nine times out of ten the victim is the housewife.  These people usually know when the man of the house is away from home.  Indeed these people do not remain at doorways but insist on coming into the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a programme on television recently about some of these people venturing into a house, exerting so much pressure on the housewife to make the purchase that she did so at a much higher price than she would have paid for the same article in a shop.  In addition, the article sold was of a much inferior quality to that which would be sold in the shops. There is sufficient proof that this type of trading is going on on a large scale.  In our smaller towns especially one sees these vans passing daily piled high with items of furniture.  We know this type of trading is going on, but how it can be controlled is another matter.  I am sure we would have to involve the Garda in some way or another because of the intrusion on the privacy of the individual. Many reports have been made to the Garda in this regard and they have taken <Col N="649" /> some steps.  But it is not sufficient to inform the Garda because they have not the adequate manpower to control this type of trading.</P>
    <P>Some kind of legislation must be introduced to eliminate completely this type of trading.  I do not think imposing a tax on such traders would be effective because they would then put up the price of the article and sell away as heretofore. So some other means must be employed to ensure the elimination of that type of trading.  Also there should be some supervision of trading in the market square.  The condition in which such squares are left after a market day is deplorable, with articles scattered around, fruit trodden into the ground and secondhand clothing thrown into corners.  The onus should be on those people who sell articles in the square or streets of a town to clean up after their trading. The onus should not be on the county council but rather on the people who carry out the trading.  If they do not do so they should not be allowed to trade in the streets or in the squares of such towns.  I regret to say that the Bill does not cover the whole area of casual trading.  It constitutes a small step in this direction only.  It does not take into consideration the people about whom I have been talking, and they are the people who must be caught.</P>

      <P>I should like again to thank Senators for the manner in which they have received this Bill, and also to thank all those who have contributed to this debate.  I think there is a notion in some people's minds that this Bill is designed &mdash; if you like &mdash; to put certain people out of business.  One Senator made reference to the services traditionally provided by certain people who have been operating over a period at fairs, markets and so on.  It is not intended to restrict anybody in any way.  It is a measure to regulate a situation which has gone out of hand completely.  We are hoping that many aspects of the present position will be rectified, many aspects which cause, say, traffic hazards, unfair competition <Col N="650" /> to conventional traders and so on, that all of that will be dealt with by the provisions of this Bill.  If the powers contained in the Bill are properly enforced we should see an enormous improvement in the present position.  We all accept &mdash; as has everybody who has spoken on the Bill &mdash; that there is a tremendous need to have the matter properly regulated.</P>
      <P>I shall deal briefly with some matters raised by the Senators who contributed to the debate.  Senator Staunton and Senator Reynolds referred to the traffic hazards being caused at present by these traders.  We hope the Bill, when implemented, will eliminate that kind of thing. The power to provide areas for &ldquo;setting up shop&rdquo;, so to speak, will be in the hands of the local authorities, the elected representatives.  I think that we would all accept that they are sensible people, people who have a responsibility to the community, that they will exercise their powers in a sensible, reasonable way in selecting areas which they regard as being suitable for this type of trading.  We would also expect that they would try to provide under other statutory powers they have suitable facilities for this type of trading, for matters like having water laid on to sites, having provision made for sanitation, for the clearing of debris, as mentioned by Senator Hussey and other Senators.  They would be providing the areas where these people would operate and would attend to matters of that kind.  We all agree that it is terrible to walk through towns on market days and fair days when these people collect to sell their wares and see the way they leave things after them.  They leave cartons, papers and all sorts of debris around the place.  We will be glad to see an end to that when this Bill is enacted.  We see the same thing in our main thoroughfares, and I am glad Senator Hussey referred to this.  I am certain that the powers in this Bill will help to eliminate that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Markey asked what will be allowed under the permit in relation to a trading area.  First of all every person who carries on casual trading will have to have a licence.  Then he will apply to the local <Col N="651" /> authority for permission to trade within specified areas.  He has to have his licence and then it will be up to the local authority to decide whether they can regulate him by providing a specific trading area where he can operate.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey also mentioned the question of after-sales service.  This is regulated by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  As has been mentioned by many Senators, a great number of these people sell inferior goods and there is no protection for the consumer. Because of the fact that they will now have to display a licence, it will be easy for people to take a note of the number on the licence and get the name of the person, and then they will have the means of getting some redress.  They will be in a position to follow them up.  In the debate in the Dáil one Deputy related an experience he had where he had to pursue one of these people on behalf of a client.  The matter went on for some considerable time but he found he was not able to track down the individual concerned.  He had been asked by his client to try to get some redress for him because of the fact that he purchased an inferior product from one of these traders.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey also raised the position in relation to rights conferred by charter hundreds of years ago.  He wondered if the Bill would give the local authorities power to acquire market rights either by agreement or compulsorily.  We are satisfied that the Bill will solve that problem.  We are giving the authorities power to acquire market rights either by agreement or compulsorily.  When an authority acquire these rights they can allow the traditional market to continue as before, or extinguish the market right.  If it is decided to extinguish this right, section 9 (3) (a) says that they shall not do so unless they provide alternative facilities reasonably corresponding to the market or fair in the same vicinity.  This will solve many of the problems the local authorities have at present in dealing with some of these people.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds raised the question of traders who come in from other areas. <Col N="652" /> He was referring, I presume, to people who come in from the North of Ireland. I am aware of cases where traders &mdash; and this is not related to the Border &mdash; are bringing furniture and other materials from England and putting them up for sale here.  We have no authority at the moment, under EEC regulations, to restrict these people but, under the Casual Trading Bill, they will have to apply for licences and permits 30 days in advance.  They will be subject to the same discipline as home-based traders. Because of the fact that we are introducing this legislation we will be able to prevent that type of trader from operating in the easy fashion traders get away with at the moment.  It will not be as attractive in the future for that type of trader to operate here.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the question raised by Senator Hussey in regard to hygiene.  I presume that the local authorities will take cognisance of the current situation and, when they are issuing permits, will try to ensure that they attach suitable conditions to be taken out by the people who are carrying on this type of trading; that they will be regulated and that attention will be paid to hygiene and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Kilbride seemed to be under the impression that persons selling horticultural or agricultural produce were restricted in the same way as the casual traders will be under this Bill.  This is not so.  They have a partial exemption.  There is a nominal charge of £5 per year for a licence but otherwise it is intended that these people will be restricted to the same extent as other casual traders will be.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard does not seem to be too happy about the penalties which it is intended to provide for.  Considering that it is possible to have a £5,000 fine, we believe the Bill has gone a long way to try to show these casual traders that we are serious about taking the necessary action to ensure that casual trading will be carried on in a regular and regulated way.  It will be up to the courts, of course, to ensure that the fines are dealt with properly, and I am sure we can rely on them to take the necessary action when <Col N="653" /> charges are brought against these casual traders.</P>
    <P>The authority given to the Garda in relation to the seizure of goods, and so on, will be welcomed by everybody.  They have the right to seize the goods, to sell them, and so on.  I am sure the Garda will be glad to exercise this authority because they, more than anybody else, together with business people who are affected so much by these people, have the greatest headache with regard to the way these people operate.  The authority given to them in the Bill will certainly help to eliminate many of the abuses, and I am sure they will be glad to exercise in a reasonable way their full authority in dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of people who rent space in supermarkets and other premises for the sale of goods. These people are regarded as occasional traders and are required to take out occasional trading permits if they occupy a shop or hotel for a period of less than three months.  They are covered by the Occasional Trading Act which was enacted a short time ago.  If they are in the premises for less than three months, it will be necessary for them to have an occasional trading licence in order to carry on with the sale of goods.  In reply to a query by Senator Lanigan it will help to ensure that the consumer will be protected and that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act can be enforced where these people are concerned.  It will also make it easier to enforce after Acts which cover things like the standard of materials these people sell.  The Bill will help to protect consumers on that score.</P>
    <P>With regard to the questions raised by Senator McDonald I have referred to the authority given to the Garda, and I am hoping that will have the desired effect. Senator McDonald also referred to standards and to the protection of the consumer, and I have already dealt with these matters.  Some questions were raised in the Dáil regarding the Minister's right to refuse to grant or revoke a casual trading licence.  We have this authority and, if we find that somebody has offended in any way, we can refuse to give a licence.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago mentioned the unfair <Col N="654" /> competition provided by these people, and he mentioned in particular the question of taxation.  The fact that a trader will have to display his licence means that the Revenue Commissioners will be in a position to know him and, like every other person in business, he will be expected to pay his fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>I think that covers most of the points raised by the Senators.  I am grateful for the manner in which they have accepted the Bill.  I wonder could I have all stages of the Bill this evening.  We are most anxious to have the legislation enacted as quickly as possible.  It should have been introduced a long time ago.  We are under pressure from the traders' associations, from people in business, and we are most anxious to get all stages of the Bill this evening if possible.  Senators have been most generous in their welcome for the Bill.  Senator McDonald said he would like it to have a speedy passage through the House.  I would be grateful if Senators would facilitate us by giving us all stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate necessity for this Bill arises from the death of the former Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, the late Deputy Joseph Brennan.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide a method for determining the constituency for which the outgoing Ceann Comhairle may be deemed to be re-elected as a Member of the Dáil without a contest at a general election following a revision of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 16.6 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law for the uncontested re-election of the Ceann Comhairle.  The statutory provision to give effect to this requirement is contained <Col N="655" /> in section 14 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  Under the terms of that section as it stands at present, the Ceann Comhairle is deemed to be re-elected for the constituency for which he was a Member before the dissolution of the Dáil or, if a revision of constituencies takes effect on the dissolution, for the constituency declared on the revision to correspond to that constituency.</P>
    <P>For this purpose it has been the practice at each revision of constituencies, to include in the relevant Bill a statement indicating which of the new constituencies corresponded to the constituency represented by the Deputy who held the office of Ceann Comhairle at the time of the revision.  Earlier this year, the Oireachtas passed a constituency revision Bill, entitled the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1980, and section 5 of that measure identified the new constituency of Donegal South-West as the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle could be deemed to be re-elected.  The death of the former Ceann Comhairle, the late Deputy Brennan, has rendered that provision ineffective.</P>
    <P>The situation could be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by amending section 5 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1980, so as to specify the constituency for which the present Ceann Comhairle may be deemed to be re-elected.  However, I think there is general agreement on the desirability of dealing with the matter in general terms so that it will be possible, without further legislation, to identify the appropriate constituency in relation to any Deputy who may be elected from time to time to the office of Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to amend section 14 of the Electoral Act, 1963, so as to provide that, where a revision of constituencies takes effect on the dissolution of the Dáil, the Ceann Comhairle shall be deemed to be re-elected for the constituency which is identical with or contains all the constituency for which he was a Member immediately before the dissolution.  If, however, his present constituency is divided between two or more new constituencies, he will be deemed to be <Col N="656" /> re-elected for a revised constituency selected by him which contains part of the constituency for which he is at present a Member.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the selection of a constituency by the Ceann Comhairle shall be made by means of a declaration in writing addressed to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The Ceann Comhairle will also be required to notify the Members of the Dáil of the declaration.  The precise manner of notification will be such as the Ceann Comhairle considers appropriate in the particular circumstances, but it may be expected that in the normal course he would make an appropriate announcement in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that any such declaration shall cease to have effect in the event of the person who made it having ceased to be Chairman of the Dáil.  This ensures that there can be only one such declaration in force at any time.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short and simple measure designed to achieve an objective on which we are all agreed.  I may mention that I gave considerable thought to possible alternative ways of achieving this objective.  In particular I considered whether a formula could be designed under which the appropriate constituency could, in every circumstance, be identified automatically without placing any burden of choice on the Ceann Comhairle.  A satisfactory formula did not prove practicable, however, and the Bill provides for the exercise of a very limited choice by the Ceann Comhairle in particular circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill would not have been introduced were it not for the death of Deputy Joe Brennan. After it is enacted the Ceann Comhairle will have the right to write to the Clerk of the Dáil and convey to him the constituency which he will represent after the next election without contesting the election.  We all wish him well in his great position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only objection I have to the Bill is that after the revision of the constituencies the Ceann Comhairle could decide to opt for a constituency consisting of two townlands and ten or 20 people.  He has <Col N="657" /> the right to opt for a constituency which might be divided into four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten parts.  If there were only six people left in a given constituency, he has the right to opt for it.  I wonder how fair or how just it is that one Member of the Dáil can do that.  I do not say this because the present Ceann Comhairle is a member of Fianna Fáil.  It could easily happen that he was a member of the Fine Gael or Labour parties. That is the only objection I see.  I do not think it is right to give such power to any individual.  It should be provided in the Bill that if 50 per cent, or 70 per cent, or some percentage, of the population were left in the constituency he could opt for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is somewhat similar to the point Senator Reynolds made.  It can be argued that the option given in this Bill favours the party to which the Ceann Comhairle belongs.  It can happen that the balance of support for political parties in an adjoining constituency can be upset by his opting to transfer into that constituency, if only a slight fraction of his present constituency is transferred in the revision.  In other words, as Senator Reynolds said, if as little as two townlands of his existing constituency are transferred to the neighbouring constituency, he can opt to transfer to that new constituency and the balance of power in the adjoining constituency can be such that his becoming an automatic Member of the subsequent Dáil can upset it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle is supposed to be strictly impartial and above party affiliations or any party political leanings. This Bill gives the Ceann Comhairle an option which can weigh against the parties in Opposition at the time.  It can also be argued that due to a revision of constituencies, an element of uncertainty is created for the Ceann Comhairle in deciding for which constituency he will automatically be a Member after the subsequent election.  The Minister describes that element of uncertainty as the burden of choice.  It is far out-weighed by the favour which can attach to his political party from the option which is given to <Col N="658" /> him.  I would have thought that the procedure followed hitherto would be the best practice to follow.  It would have done away with this element of suspicion which any party in Opposition would have when they saw an option such as this.  To that extent I disagree with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some clarification. Over the years revisions of constituencies have taken place on a number of occasions.  The Ceann Comhairle might represent one constituency during his term as Ceann Comhairle and after the next election he might represent a different area because of a revision of the constituencies.  A small portion might go to a different constituency and, because of his political affiliations, the Ceann Comhairle might feel that they were in danger of losing a seat and decide to go into that constituency.  That is all right on one or two occasions, but it could happen on a number of occasions.  The constituencies may be revised every four or five years because of the way the population is moving into Dublin.  In some constituencies the number of voters may be reduced and in other constituencies it may be increased.  If the Ceann Comhairle has changed into a different constituency because of the revision of that constituency, he may opt again for another area and, after a while, he would be representing a different constituency altogether from the one to which he had been elected when he was appointed as Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>In that situation it would be wrong of the Ceann Comhairle to opt for a completely new constituency.  I would like to have this clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators expressed some misgivings at the fact that in certain circumstances the Ceann Comhairle would be required to make a choice of constituencies.  Obviously it would be satisfactory if we had a formula under which the appropriate constituency could be automatically identified in every circumstance, thus relieving the Ceann Comhairle of the burden of choice.  I have had this <Col N="659" /> aspect closely examined and it is clear that there are serious difficulties in the way of devising an automatic formula which would be reasonable and satisfactory in every case and which would meet the fears and suspicions of the Opposition.  For this reason the proposal in the Bill which in certain circumstances allows the Ceann Comhairle a choice within very prescribed limits is the most reasonable arrangement and ought to be accepted.  We have to look at it in the light that the Ceann Comhairle, selected by the Dáil, is a very respected figure within the Dáil.  No Senator or Deputy would impute to him any motive that would be less than honourable.  We must work on this system of trust.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion in the Dáil and a relevant amendment proposed that the Ceann Comhairle would retain a substantial proportion of his own constituency in an instance of a revision.  I can give the example of the man whose death has unfortunately given rise to bringing this Bill before the Dáil and the Seanad.  Joe Brennan's old constituency was a five-seat constituency at the last election. With the revision it is now two three-seaters.  If he had been forced to pick the larger part of his own constituency, he would have had to choose Donegal north-east, whereas every Senator knows that Joe Brennan's main base was in Donegal south-west, where he resided.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Members of the Seanad that in the drafting of the legislation we examined every possibility for the devising of some wording or formula which would meet the points being made by the Senators.  I can assure the House quite reasonably that no formula could be arrived at.  We are going to have to leave the matter to the honourable people that we pick to be Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  We must respect men whom we put into that position.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 7) Regulations, 1980, and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1980</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Seanad on the 11th day of December, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations would reduce to a nominal amount as from 1 January 1981 the fees payable in respect of pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  In a full year the total remission comes to £½ million. The purpose of this remission is to afford relief to the pigmeat industry over the next two years to help overcome the serious difficulties being experienced by the sector at present.  The industry has engaged a good deal of the Minister for Agriculture's attention over recent months and he has had a number of meetings with the various interests to consider <Col N="661" /> ways of helping the industry over its current difficulties.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the bacon curers and the pig producers have now confirmed that they are unanimously agreed on measures to improve the centralised marketing of pigmeat.  We now have therefore the very welcome situation of a unified approach by all concerned.  The remission of fees now proposed should provide the pigmeat industry with the will to establish itself on a surer footing for the longer term.</P>
      <P>If the industry is to withstand growing competition on export markets and the prospect of imports the united efforts of all will be needed to maintain output and employment.  The surest way to maintain and expand our share of the market is to strive for the highest standards of product quality on a uniform basis.</P>
      <P>In addition to the temporary remission of veterinary fees, the Government have decided to provide a grant of £200,000 per year over the next two years to the Pigs and Bacon Commission to enable the commission to intensify their work on the promotion of pigmeat.  This is also a very necessary step towards strengthening the industry.</P>
      <P>It is the Minister for Agriculture's intention to introduce legislation to extend the statutory levy to all pigs slaughtered for pork including slaughterings for the home trade.  The extension of the levy to port pigs is aimed at leading to a more comprehensive and co-ordinated approach within the industry.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss in that I was not supplied with the Minister's script.  I am not aware that it has been handed to any Member of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies to the Senator in that he was not well briefed, this is due <Col N="662" /> to the speed with which the other business has been disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to remind the House and the Minister that if this particular Bill is as important as I think it is we should have been supplied with copies of the script in accordance with normal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>In so far as this House is concerned I will take it that it is important enough in that it has to come before us.  So far as my knowledge of the pig industry is concerned, this is a very important happening and I find it difficult to continue without the script.  In fact for the three years that I have been here I have not experienced this sort of situation before.  In the circumstances, I propose that the House adjourn until the document is laid before us.</P>

      <P>As it is almost 8.30 I think in the circumstances perhaps we should adjourn.</P>
