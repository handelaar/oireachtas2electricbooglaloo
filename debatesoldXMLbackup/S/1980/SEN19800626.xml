      <P>Before the adjournment on last Tuesday night, I was dealing with section 5 of this Bill.  That section provides certain sums for the widow and children of an officer or soldier who is killed in the course of duty as a member of the forces, or who receives while serving in the forces a wound attributable to such service and dies within four years after receiving such wound in circumstances attributable solely to the wound.  While no sum, no matter how big, could make up for the loss of the one who has gone, the amounts being offered under the provisions of this Bill are generous.  The widow will receive 50 per cent of the husband's annual pay and each eligible child will receive, if the mother is alive, 13? per cent and on the <Col N="1388" /> death of the mother, 26 per cent.  A widow with three children will be in receipt of nine-tenths of the pay of the husband.  That is reasonably generous. Some speakers made the point that it should be much bigger.  There is a limit to what can be done and generally speaking Senators will agree that that is a very reasonable provision.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to expect that when discussing this Bill one would begin with section 5 on account of the tragic circumstances in which some of our soldiers lost their lives in recent times. No words could describe the feelings of the people in that connection.  While it is not the purpose of the Bill to discuss the circumstances in which these men met their deaths, the least one could say is that we are very proud that they died, not in an aggressive way, but in defence of the peace of the world.  &ldquo;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend&rdquo;.  These men laid down their lives, not alone for their friends, but to a large extent for their enemies as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.  These sections have to do with making further provision for recipients of what was known as the special allowance and other allowances also in so far as the widows of these men have now an entitlement to certain sums of money.  If we are to give those men their due, the men of the Old IRA, the men who were responsible to a very large extent for the freedom we enjoy, no amount of money would be great enough by which to mark our appreciation of their work and their patriotism.  We hold them in the highest honour.  They are people we are very proud of.  Their numbers are few and while they are there we should give them the highest honour possible.  They fought when times were much worse than they are now.  They fought and they struggled, motivated by the highest feelings of patriotism for the freedom of this country.  They fought against the British Black and Tans in 1919 and 1920 and certainly those men who still survive must feel very disillusioned by the actions of what one <Col N="1389" /> might call the Irish Black and Tans 60 years later, who seem to be hell-bent on bringing about economic ruin and cultural and moral disaster.</P>

      <P>I know it is not relevant, and I am passing on to my final remarks.  I am glad of the opportunity to commend and praise the very high standards of our Army.  We have a splendid body of men from the highest ranking officer down to the latest recruit.  We are very proud of them; they are doing a great job at home and abroad.  Their name and their work are very much appreciated by all men of goodwill throughout the world.  My wish is that long may they continue to uphold these very fine traditions and standards of efficiency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome for this Bill.  Its main provision is the substantially enhanced pension provisions for the widows and children of members of the Defence Forces who die in the circumstances outlined in section 5.  I take the point made by Senator Cranitch that no money can compensate for the loss of a spouse but it is important for the morale of the Army that there would be public recognition by the Government and parliament of concern for the predicament of the survivors of members who would lose their lives in the course of service. That is good for the morale of the Army.  It shows that the Government and parliament appreciates the service that is being rendered by these men and the role they play in the affairs of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the morale of the Army would be maintained at as high a level as we can maintain it for two reasons.  The efficiency of the Army depends on its state of morale and, arising from that, an efficient and attractive army will attract recruits.  If we are to keep up a viable rate of recruiting it is <Col N="1390" /> important that the Army would present an attractive career and obviously a factor that would influence people in considering a career is, &ldquo;What provision will be made for my dependants if anything happened to me?&rdquo;  This Bill fills an important gap here and, of course, that consideration must loom larger and larger in the minds of volunteers with the increasing amount of overseas service as part of the UN peace-keeping operation. The dangers inherent in that service which were highlighted so tragically recently, have not inhibited volunteers from coming forward.  In fact, as is traditional, there have been more volunteers than there have been places and we want to ensure that that will continue to be the case.  As we establish a stable and mature Army a greater proportion of the members of it will be married.  They will be the soldiers with experience and will obviously come for inclusion in the overseas contingents.  Should there be any repetition&mdash;and we all pray there will not be&mdash;of the tragic loss of life which occurred in the Lebanon, understandably there could come domestic pressure on married members.  To counter that pressure the provisions in this Bill are very necessary and very welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like to echo the tribute Senator Cranitch paid to the members of the Army.  They have served this country well.  We who were born after the events that brought them into being and know of those events only at second hand are perhaps inclined to underestimate the democratic spirit that has pervaded the members of the Defence Forces in their attitudes towards the institutions of this State.  We have to remember that when a Government was established here, there was a lot of exchange of personnel between the military arm of the State and the civil arm of the State.  There was a rumbling at one period but it was quickly dealt with by the Executive of the day and the supremacy of civilian and democratic rule was restored.  That supremacy was accepted at the time by the vast majority of the members of that fledgling Army, men who had, only a very short time previously, contributed <Col N="1391" /> to the victorious and successful completion of a revolution.</P>
    <P>We have seen in other countries, after revolutions are completed, the scrabble for power and loot that takes place afterwards, how so frequently military men forget their purely military role and find themselves in the forefront of that scrabble.  We were spared anything of that nature in this country because of the patriotism of those who served in the Army and their recognition of their role in a democratic State.  Likewise too, when there was a change of Government&mdash;and that was a traumatic experience for many people in 1932, having regard to the events of just ten years before that&mdash;there was anxiety as to how the Army would react to that change and the consequences and emotive implications of it.  Again one must pay tribute to the patriotic democracy of the officers and men of the Army for the way in which they accepted that democratic change.</P>
    <P>It is right that these things should be said in the context of this Bill which is providing for enhanced conditions of service for the successors of that Army.  An army is a continuous thing and the morale, standards, spirit and <i>ésprit de corps</i> have to exist all the time and in so far they exist today they are inspired from those days of the past.  In so far as we, of our time, can provide for the future we do that in legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>I have a number of points to make which might be more proper to keep for Committee Stage, but I will mention one or two because they are of general application. The first is with regard to the circumstances when the allowances provided for in section 5 can be paid, and as provided by section 5 they are when the member of the Defence Forces is killed in the course of his duty or receives a wound and dies within a certain time thereafter in circumstances attributable solely to the wound.  A number of points arise from that.  Should we extend those provisions and include a third situation where the member contracts a disease attributable to such service <Col N="1392" /> whilst serving in the forces?  What puts that into my mind is that there may be for men serving at home or, more particularly, abroad, circumstances where they may be more prone or liable to contract a disease.  One example is the danger of being bitten by a rabid dog. That may have a slight overtone to it that may suggest that it is unreal, but members of the Defence Forces serving in the Middle East have had that experience and have had to endure the treatment that such a bite necessitates. They were lucky enough to be able to receive the treatment and did not contract any disease as a result, but treatment might not be readily available and such an incident could have fatal results. I mention that as one example of how a member on foreign service could contract a disease as opposed to what is provided for in the Bill, a wound.  There is, obviously, a distinction.  The Minister should consider broadly in section 5 including a third consequence, namely disease. If a soldier contracts tuberculosis, for example, and can show that it was due to his service that he contracted it and that if he had been in civilian employment the exigencies of that employment would not have been likely to lead to it as the exigencies of military service, we should look to compensate him for that in the same way as we would compensate a person who receives a wound. I mention these for the Minister's consideration and I would be glad to have his views when he is replying to this Stage.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make with regard to section 5 is that the commencement of its provisions go back to some time in 1975.  While I appreciate that there has to be a commencing date and that we cannot allow the Bill to be open-ended, so to speak, in retrospect, I would be glad to know why 1975 was picked as the starting year.  A more appropriate starting point might be the first year that our troops went on overseas service with the United Nations.  One obviously could not go back to the Civil War and reward the veterans or dependants of veterans of the national Army, much as they might <Col N="1393" /> deserve to be rewarded.  It would be going back too far.  It could provoke a claim by dependants of irregulars who might have lost their lives in that conflict. Likewise to go back to the Emergency would involve administrative difficulties also.  There has to be a starting date and I suggest to the Minister that the proper starting date would be the commencement of overseas service with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the provision in section 5 (1) (b) where the entitlement arises if the death occurs within four years after the deceased receives his wound because immediately it brings to mind what happens in the case of the unfortunate men who died four years and one month after.  Again, it is necessary to have a time limit on the State's liability but there should be discretion given to the Minister to ignore that time limit in circumstances where he deems it would be just to do so.  Absolute time limits can lead to injustice.  The Minister in another welcome provision in the Bill recognises this when he takes discretion to ignore failure to observe time limits for making certain applications.  He has recognised that application has not been made because people were not aware of time limits and have lost benefits as a result and, obviously, he is convinced that hardship has resulted.  He is taking a discretion now in this Bill to ignore those time limits and admit late claims.  In another part of the Bill he has abolished time limits altogether for some other claims.  To follow that line of thought he should give himself discretion in section 5 (1) (b) not to be bound by the strict four-year period.  How were four years arrived at?  Was it thrown into discussion and somebody said three years, somebody else said five years and some said, &ldquo;Look, let us settle for four years&rdquo;? It is very difficult to arrive at a time limit in the circumstances of that paragraph. The difficulties of arriving at a satisfactory time limit can be resolved only by the Minister taking discretion.  I suggest that he should do that and I should be glad to have his views when he is replying on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> I am glad to note from his Second Stage speech that he intends to publicise the new provision of section 6 which waives the existing time limits.  Many people throughout the country may have given up any thought of claiming what they were entitled to because they were out in time and they should be sought out specifically where there is any record in the Department, and a lot of publicity should be given to the changes.  I suggest to the Minister that in his publicity he might give particular attention to the local newspapers circulating in areas where there are garrisons, for example, Galway, Athlone, Longford, and where there are likely to be widows and dependants of soldiers who would be entitled to claim under section 6.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to repeat my welcome for the Bill and I hope the number of occasions on which the benefits of section 5 will arise will be few and far between.  One last point occurs to me. The Bill is drawn up entirely on the basis that the married officer or married soldier who loses his life will be male.  We have now introduced women into the Army and I would imagine that under the equality legislation the provisions will have to apply equally to the spouse of a female officer who might lose her life in the circumstances set out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  This Bill is particularly welcome.  There are many improvements and corrections included in the Bill of what people would see as something in the nature of injustices.  The removal of the time limit on applications is particularly good where people, because of lack of knowledge, did not make their application in time.  Also to be welcomed are the new provisions applying to the widows and children of personnel killed on duty here or abroad. These provisions are just and fair.  The widow of an officer or ordinary rank will receive 50 per cent of his pay and where there are children the first two children bring it to a total of 90 per cent.  What should be emphasised here is that side by side with these payments to the widow for herself and her children are the social <Col N="1395" /> welfare payments applicable to any widow and children of any ordinary employed worker.  This brings the payment to the widows and children of the unfortunate men who died in the tragedy in the Middle East to virtually 100 per cent of the ordinary pay.  Every Member of the House here will welcome these provisions as being just and fair.</P>
      <P>Senators said that no rewards can be too high, and I am inclined to agree, but, to be fair and just to those who put their lives at risk, it is something worth doing.  I welcome also the special allowance referred to by the Minister, dating from 1 July 1980.  What is open to the not very great number who took part in the War of Independence but never sought pensions and who have the appropriate medals?  I recently came across a few cases of widows whose husbands had fought in the War of Independence because it was their patriotic duty and did not do it for money, and therefore, did not look for pensions.  In some of these cases the widow may be living on the means test assistance allowance and nothing else.  I refer to that particularly because I welcomed earlier the removal of the prohibition because of failure to apply in the case of the ordinary services. How does a person in this category fit in?  There are not many of them, I confess I am ignorant of what happens in those cases.  What provision can be made by the Minister?</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, I welcome the provisions in this Bill.  They clear up many problems going back over the years which one found difficult to justify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, but I want to add my voice to those Senators who have welcomed the Bill.  I want to make a few comments on points already made.  Like other speakers I had the good fortune of encountering Irish Army personnel, not simply in Ireland but in other parts of the world.  I have been struck, as others have been struck, by the very high quality of the Irish Army.  A key to that is a very interesting <Col N="1396" /> thing I heard Senator Cooney say a few minutes ago when he referred to the democratic spirit in the Irish Army.  We know its origin recently and in the struggle for independence.  The attitudes of that time I am glad permeated very much.  It is invidious perhaps to make comparisons and I will not mention other nations but I know of other nations from direct experience in which officer corps seem to be a parking place for deliquent younger sons and uneducatable young sons of well to do people both in town and country.  Nothing could be further from the situation in the Irish Army.  Because of the democratic spirit of the Army, because of the nature of its origins, because of its relationship to the whole people, it is able to recruit officers and men of very high quality indeed.</P>
      <P>I would also like to record my pleasure at the obvious excellence of the internal educational mechanisms, because one is not just struck with the personal quality, moral quality, the native intellectual quality, but also the quality of training.  If one considers things like the Army Air Corps, the input into our level of technological knowledge through the whole population by ex-Army personnel&mdash;I used the example of the Air Corps as highly technological&mdash;is extremely valuable in our whole national development.</P>
      <P>There is one point to which I want to refer.  We fear the appropriateness of this Bill because we feel nationally the trauma of seeing our soldiers die in South Lebanon.  That gives it an appropriateness. I do not want to discuss a very complex and sensitive situation in detail.  We should let our soldiers know from all sides of both Houses that we are proud of them.  We should let them know too, how much we appreciate the desperate delicacy of their situation, and how brilliantly they are discharging their responsibilities.  One can think back to the Congo and to Cyprus and now one thinks of South Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great pride for this country that we are acceptable in any circumstances of strife and such has been the&mdash;I cannot use a word less than <Col N="1397" /> brilliance&mdash;brillance of Army leadership in these situations, such has been their delicacy of understanding in complex situations, that they have acquitted themselves magnificently over and over again.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch quoted the famous phrase about laying down one's life for one's friend&mdash;greater love than this no man has than that he should lay down his life for his friend, and he added, and for his enemies too.  Our people died in South Lebanon for both.  I do not want to make this contentious, and I do not know how rigorously we ought to look at those words.  It seems that they are faced with two exceedingly difficult circumstances. One is that in an ordinary confrontational way between two lots of soldiers, both sides can have at each other with some semblance of equality, but our people cannot reply to the aggression on them, and have been showing very extraordinary and magnificant restraint.  In that sense, there is, on the one hand, aggression against people and, on the other hand, there is the refusal to hit back in any simplistic way.</P>
    <P>Secondly, surely the whole difficulty that makes the situation so admirable on the part of our soldiers is that they are not friends or enemies.  There are persons in conflict.  We have never identified with either side.  I say that because it seems to me that with the history, the democratic spirit which Senator Cooney made reference to, I hope that whoever they are, regardless of ethnic origin or religion or anything else, our tendency in seeking to intervene in disputes, or being asked by international agencies to intervene in disputes, will be to rally to the disadvantaged and the oppressed, whoever they are, and the disadvantage and oppressed vary from one circumstance to another and from one time to another.</P>
    <P>I cannot help noting&mdash;and here I will simply make the observation and not elaborate on it&mdash;that there are approximately as many Palestinians as there are Israeli Jews and that as far as the peaceful settlement in Israel/South <Col N="1398" /> Lebanon/the West Bank, is concerned the world's wishes and needs can only be attained on the basis of security and equality for both sides.  It is precisely because of that sort of neutrality, of seeing the rights and wrongs of both sides, of identifying with the oppressed whoever they are, and because of the history of our Army and the nature of its relationship to our whole people and our whole national movement, that our Army is particularly good at this.  If we express pride in them, it is pride for their bravery, pride for their calm in exceedingly difficult and delicate circumstances, but also pride for the moral and intellectual qualities that are able to distinguish a correct role in a very complicated circumstance.  They are serving us very well and anything we can do in terms of conditions of employment and in terms, specifically of what this Bill does, of pensions for widows and dependants is done wholeheartedly and with admiration, and we can say, is done with unanimity.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte mór roimh an mBille seo.  Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an Roinn Cosanta agus an t-Aire ag tabhairt an Bhille seo ar aghaidh chun socrú maith a dhéanamh i gcomhair na saighdiúirí Éireannacha atá ag déanamh obair dian, dainséarach, go mór mhór le déanaí.</P>
      <P>This Bill introduces measures which are to be highly commended.  I have one suggestion which might carry recognition for the work our soldiers do and the service they give.  Other speakers commended our Army for the way they carry out their duties so I will not elaborate on that point.  I would like to say something about the context in which members of the Army could lose their lives, or ways in which they could be affected adversely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very understandable tendency for people to think of places like the Lebanon as being at the other side of the world, very divorced from everyday life and ordinary domestic circumstances. I had the opportunity of visiting our soldiers in Southern <Col N="1399" /> Lebanon, staying with them and sharing headquarters with them.  It brings the situation home to you in a way that just reading about it could not do.  For instance the short wave transmitter-receiver system in McKee Barracks is in contact with Southern Lebanon every morning and they get a run down on what happened the previous day.  There are people in McKee Barracks who are in immediate contact and feel the pressures the soldiers are under.  Recently the Minister was standing by when the pressure was on.  In the Lebanon in the town of Brachid there is an old school occupied by the Irish soldiers.  At nighttime it is a look-out point.  I was mad enough to go on the roof of this school with the sentry and was shown how to use an infra-red scanner.  This scanner lit up the whole countryside and I could see into the various fields and marvelled at the technology, but it suddenly struck me that somebody out there probably was using one looking at me.  I do not mind telling you I got down quickly off the roof.  That brought it home to me that the Irish soldier on sentry duty was continually in that exposed position.  We are talking about recognising this type of service.  I wanted to put it in that context.</P>
    <P>I will give another example.  Standing in the camp beyond Shakra talking with a son of a Member of the Oireachtas who was serving there, suddenly there was a thunderous roar of murderous missiles launched from the Israeli side. Again it came home to me that there were our soldiers in the middle of this area and these shells whizzing overhead. I could not get out of the place fast enough.  That is what our soldiers are up against.  This Bill is recognising this in a very special way and it is recognising that if in those circumstances our citizens lose their lives their dependants have to be looked after.</P>
    <P>This is something the House has to recognise in public, as Senator Keating said.  We are talking about our citizens&mdash;Private Stephen Griffin, Private Thomas Barrett and Private <Col N="1400" /> Derek Smallhorne, all Irishmen who recently lost their lives in most tragic circumstances. What gets my goat is to see accounts in the media, Zionist-dominated, for instance, comparing the circumstances of the death of Lord Mountbatten to the death of the soldiers in the Lebannon.  I am not going to elaborate on this point in case the Chair is getting worried, but it is something that we in the Upper House must recognise, what our citizens are subjected to in terms of media coverage.  We must recognise this for what it is.  We must speak out and protect our soldiers who are caught up in the complexities of a very difficult political struggle.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating brilliantly outlined how sensitive this is without getting too deeply involved.  This is not a Bill for that, even though at some stage I would like the opportunity to elaborate on that particular situation.  Our soldiers find themselves not only carrying out a military duty but, in some way they are carrying out a social political duty.  Some people may have seen the picture and report in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> of soldiers looking after children and families in some of the villages and the young woman saying the only way she was able to make ends meet was with the help she was getting from the Irish soldiers.  We must recognise that as well.  It is not all done from behind the gun; it is also done from the heart, and from experience.  The Irish soldier, very often a married man, is able to provide care and understanding in countries blighted by these problems.</P>
    <P>I will not go any further than to paint just one or two pictures of that kind to put this in context and also to appeal to the Minister to do something for those who are alive, as well as for those who might be killed.  For instance, he might review the allowances to the soldiers serving abroad and ensure that they keep in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>I would suggest another approach that might be used.  The Minister might be able to persuade other Departments to do something about this.  I have found in my clinics in Dublin that the wives of <Col N="1401" /> the soldiers very often have housing difficulties. The Minister should try to prevail on the local authorities to put soldiers who have to serve abroad in a special category for local authority houses.  I do not see any reason why that could not be done, and it would help the families of these men.  Very often these women are very concerned and worried about the welfare of their husbands and are living in circumstances we do not like to see them in.  I know of many instances of this kind.  I would ask the Minister to use his influence, through the Minister for the Environment, with the local authorities to put the soldiers serving abroad in a special category for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Tá mé an-shásta go raibh seans agam cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar ár Arm náisiúnta, Arm atá ag tabhairt brat na hÉireann thar lear agus atá ag cur ainm na tíre go h-árd sna nuachtáin timpeall an domhain go léir.</P>
    <P>We are all extremely proud of them and, we should do everything we can to recognise what they are doing by any rewards that can be made available through the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very necessary legislation.  There is sadness that this legislation, which guarantees allowances to the widows of soldiers killed in the course of duty, should have to come before us.  but it is necessary for three reasons.</P>
      <P>First, the circumstances have completely changed in the past decade or two, and certainly since our first input into foreign activities for our soldiers in the Congo back in 1960.  At one time the Army was regarded as the Cinderella of the State armed services.  The Army was looked on as a place in which the less fortunate members of society take refuge unless they had a vocation to join.</P>
      <P>Now the Army has become a very important arm of Government services, particularly in its activities abroad where the presence, the behaviour and performance of our troops can bring a certain amount of credit and worthy reputation to the Government and to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> We must remember we never had conscription we always relied on voluntary membership of the ranks.  Now it is necessary for us to give these people proper conditions which will be on a par with conditions in civil life.  At this stage one might hesitate to say that a 50 per cent pension to a widow was appropriate. In certain civic positions there are pensions far in excess of that.  Some superannuation schemes give to widows two-third pensions plus a nice lump sum. We could argue at length about whether 50 per cent is appropriate, or whether the four year period cut-off point is appropriate. This legislation we see a considerable advance on what was there before.  Section 7 gives the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence power to change the regulations in due course and then bring the proposed regulation change before this House. This is a most worthy provision.</P>
    <P>The second reason why I say this legislation is necessary is that soldiers today can see at first hand experience what civilians are able to enjoy.  We have our soldiers standing on the streets guarding banks.  They are seen much more in our towns and cities, on our streets and in the countryside than ever before.  They can see at first hand how a person who remained in civilian life has better conditions that he enjoyed ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  It is only right that the Government should ensure that our soldiers have very good conditions.  If they are not on a par at present with civilians, they should reach that stage as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Last week on the invitation of the Minister I had the opportunity of seeing new billets in Gormanstown Camp, County Meath.  Three years earlier new billets were opened in Dundalk, County Louth.  These are very fine buildings but because of their very impressive structure they stand out in vivid contrast, indeed harsh contrast, to the billets which the soldiers will still have to enjoy in the same camp area because of the lack of available modern accommodation.  It is necessary that we bring the conditions of the soldiers in barrack life&mdash;where they live, where they have recreational <Col N="1403" /> facilities&mdash;as quickly as possible to a standard they could enjoy in civilian life.</P>
    <P>The third reason is that our soldiers have always voluntarily joined the Army.  We never had conscription.  There never has been any form of compulsion, apart maybe from an occasional instance where a district justice might give a nice hint to some young person who has infringed various laws, that perhaps he should take himself into the Army for a period to learn discipline.  People who voluntarily join the Army should be given every opportunity to enjoy the service for as long as they serve, be it five years, ten years or for whatever term.</P>
    <P>We cannot look at this legislation without remembering the deaths of our soldiers in far-off fields.  When the Government make their decision to send our Defence Force personnel abroad, I think this is a model of a democratic Government functioning.  It is a pity that people who are more fortunate, but who criticise the Government's decision to send troops to foreign countries, would not take a leaf out of the way in which our Defence Forces have always gone when the Government make a decision that they should serve in far-off fields.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the Government, in facing up to a request from the United Nations to send some of our forces abroad, should not act, as it were, willy-nilly in response to such a request without adequately assessing the situation as it pertains at that particular time. This country, due to its history, is in a rather unique position to answer a request for its Defence Forces to serve abroad but I believe that the timing is very important in regard to a Government decision as to whether our forces should serve in response to such a request. It may be appropriate for us to send our Defence Forces abroad now but it may not be appropriate in three months time.  We have to look at this thing in a wider context than perhaps just answering a request from the United Nations.  I do not believe that we would suffer as a result of our saying to the United Nations that we did not regard it as <Col N="1404" /> appropriate at the present time that our forces should spend time abroad.  The United Nations know that they can approach us in 12 months' time or two years with a request when we might be able to take it up.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I believe that it is important for Oireachtas Members, more than anybody else in the State, to look at any place abroad where soldiers may well be asked to go.  Unhesitatingly I say that I was disappointed at what I would regard as Oireachtas Members on both sides of the House in the past six months allowing themselves to be used to an extent by one side or the other in the Middle East problem.  I believe that Oireachtas Members, more than anybody else, should, as I ask the Government to do, assess the situation as it exists in any of these foreign fields of operations and weigh up the pros and cons of whether they should just stay quiet for a while until things settle down.</P>
    <P>We are sending young men abroad in a situation where they will have to operate with one arm tied behind their back.  If one converses with any of the soldiers who have returned from a period of service in the Lebanon one will find this continuing tale of frustration on their part.  I do not believe the situation is helped in any way by Oireachtas Members perhaps allowing themselves to be used for publicity purposes by one side or the other, and there are always two sides to any problem abroad.  I think we have to be careful if only from the viewpoint of our soldiers.  They take a calculated risk in going out there in the first instance&mdash;I believe it is a voluntary action on their part as to whether they go, but we know what &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; means if the person is in the Army and he is asked to volunteer for foreign service. I think very few of them would refuse such a request.</P>
    <P>In our Defence Forces we have a very good service which we should build up and on which we should bestow conditions appropriate to what those young men can experience in civilian life.  If they remained in civilian life they would not be faced with a situation where they <Col N="1405" /> could not have a reasonable standard of living.  Social welfare conditions at present are reasonably appropriate and would give them such a standard.  Instead, they opt to join our Defence Forces and I believe without any hesitation that we should help them in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I know that semi-State bodies from time to time extend invitations to Members of the Oireachtas to visit their various plants or installations or whatever it might be.  I suggest to the Government that the various military barracks throughout this country should extend invitations to the Oireachtas Members, and indeed local authority members as well, to go on a day visit and see our Defence Force members in training, doing drill and generally see the conditions under which they are operating.  I think everybody who went on such a visit would come away with a far greater understanding and appreciation of what our soldiers are doing for us.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the wording of the Bill which states, &ldquo;widows and children of military personnel who are killed in the course of duty or who die from a wound sustained in the course of duty&rdquo;.  Does the course of duty just apply to foreign operations?  What will happen in the case of a soldier who suffers a serious wound while training in his own home barracks and dies within the four year period?  I ask the Minister for clarification of that point.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I believe some provision should be written into the Bill as regards covering other situations.  For instance, in the course of the Second World War there were very many deaths, not of our soldiers, fortunately, but of soldiers of other nations, from malaria and other diseases.  If we send young men to places like the Middle East, and perhaps we will even be sending them farther afield in the years to come, they may well be subjected to certain diseases endemic to those areas that may not yet be conquered by the medical people.  It would behove us to write something into the Bill whereby soldiers who die as a <Col N="1406" /> result of such diseases, whatever they may be, would qualify as regards pension entitlements to their widows.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in welcoming the Bill.  I only want to make one point which is relevant to section 5 (1) (b).  I think the point has already been made by Senator Cooney who suggested the possible extension of the four year period.  I would suggest to the Minister that there ought not to be a limitation at all.  I have had to handle an unfortunate case for somebody who responded to the call in the 1914-1918 war and who died very many years afterwards as a result of wounds caused during the war and the operative machinery made it possible to prove that his death was attributable solely to these wounds.  I do not know why a limit is imposed now; in view of the advances in medical science in keeping people alive, time limits may become less appropriate. I would have thought it necessary that the proposed paying authority should be informed of the nature of the wound and the medical history and be in a position obviously to guard against bogus claims coming very many years after.  Four years seems such a short period, alas, nowadays.  I do not know whether the Minister has power under the regulations to extend that period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank Senators for their constructive and helpful contributions to the debate on this Bill.  I am glad that they welcome it and share my opinion that it is a very worthwhile measure.  I wish also to express appreciation for the very well-deserved tributes which have been paid to the Defence Forces and in particular to their outstanding contribution over the years to <Col N="1407" /> the cause of international peace with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The most significant provisions of this Bill relate to benefits for dependants, that is for widows and children.  For the first time, the widows or special allowance holders are being granted allowances under the Acts.  This is being done in accordance with the budget statement of last February.  This is indeed a very welcome development.  Senator Governey and, indeed, a number of other Senators, raised the possibility of abolishing the time limit of four years in the case of death attributable solely to wounds.  I have considered this particular matter.  In the first place, for the purpose of the Bill it is necessary to relate the death to the wound.  It will be agreed that the further removed in time the death is from the occasion of the wound, the more difficult it is to establish its attributability.</P>
    <P>It is, however, appropriate to look at this in a broader context.  The Defence Forces pension schemes and the Army Pensions Acts have been evolving over the years.  The new provisions represent a very worthwhile development in the evolution of the superannuation and other provisions.  There is provision in the Acts for the payment of other benefits to a widow of a pensioner who was seriously disabled.  In the case of a widow with three children benefit could amount to two-thirds of pay.  To that extent the new allowance may be said to be complementary to the existing allowance.  While it would supplant the existing allowances, being more favourable in the circumstances specified in the section it is intended essentially to cover a case where the husband is killed on duty whether at home or abroad and it does that.  The overall provision is, I would suggest, a very worthwhile one.  It is framed in a reasonable way, particularly when looked at in the wider context of the other provisions of the Act.  I would ask the House to accept it. I am quite confident that if the need arises in the future to modify the provision it will be modified.  Another matter raised by Senator Governey was whether the allowance would be increased <Col N="1408" /> in the future.  It can be taken that it will be treated in the same way as other superannuation benefits and allowances which are increased annually.</P>
    <P>The question of disease was raised by Senator Cooney and Senator Markey. The disease pensions for former members' of the Defence Forces are payable in respect of disease attributable to (i) the emergency period and (ii) service with a United Nations force.  These relate to pensions payable to the personnel themselves. I would point out further that if the degree of disablement is 50 per cent or more, then the widow automatically gets an allowance for herself and her children.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effective date of the new allowance, that is 1 March 1975, the position is that allowances are already payable under the 1927 Act.  The troops first went abroad in 1960 and they were covered by the 1927 Act. Making it effective from 1975 is to give it quite a considerable degree of retrospection and I do not think I did too badly in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha referred to those who had medals and who did not make applications for pensions.  The point is that the allowance of £185 a year provided for a widow in this Bill flows from the fact that her husband had a special allowance.  Anybody who has a duly awarded medal can apply for a special allowance.  Senator Mulcahy suggested that the local authorities be requested to help out in respect of soldiers who are looking for houses.  I would like to take this opportunity of saying that local authorities have been exceptionally helpful in this matter and I would like to express my appreciation of that.  Senator Markey raised the point as to whether expression &ldquo;in the course of his duty&rdquo; would include a soldier who was wounded in training and who died later or was killed in training.  The answer is yes.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senators for their very helpful response to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a short contribution on this, a kind rather different from that made by anyone else in so far as I want to if I can, understand the structure of this whole affair.  We have the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968, which scheduled five harbours in relation to which fishery harbour centre orders may be made.  This amending Bill really contains only two modest amendments to that Act by providing for a more appropriate fine than £100 for any offence that might be committed.  That in fact keeps in line with inflation.  The other is to replace Galway as a harbour in relation to which a fishery harbour centre order might be made and to substitute another harbour Rossaveal, which is in County Galway also.  There does not seem to be any dispute from what I have gathered in the course of the debate, as to the wisdom of that particular measure.  My only concern is regarding the structure that makes it necessary to come back to us for authority to substitute Rossaveal.  What has been happening about Rossaveal.  if anything, and what will happen when we enact this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the structure of the main Act, the Rossaveal harbour will be transferred to the Minister and be his harbour, if you like&mdash;taken away from, presumably, Galway County Council. The order has to be published indicating the area that has to be acquired as part of the harbour centre and there are provisions for objections and so on.  In the course of the year one sees mention of large sums being spent on fishery harbours. There have been questions here and in the other House as to the kind of area the Minister should take.  It would be interesting in this House for us to know just what kind of area is involved and what he intends doing with it.  I ask this question because this year there is a sum of £5 million for this kind of harbour development work.  I find that hard to understand.  It suggests to me that money must be paid or spent on harbours that are not included in the top five harbours&mdash;Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Galway, Howth and Killybegs, now with the substitution of <Col N="1412" /> Rossaveal for Galway.  It seems to me that by virtue of some other authority and on somebody else's pieces of property money has been spent on harbours.</P>
    <P>I just do not find it a happy thing to be debating a Bill of this kind without getting a fuller picture of our policy with regard to harbours generally.  Are there going to be harbour centres which are going to be the recipients of a particular policy and particular expenditures?  Are there going to be other harbours, the subject of another policy, administered possibly by other people?  The relevant Act was passed in 1968 and the power was taken in 1968 to make orders in respect of five of these places.  I am restricted by the fact that the most recent audited accounts of the Harbour Centres Fund, which was established by the Act of 1968, was signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in October 1979 for the year ended 1977.  It is quite clear that at that stage there were only two of these harbour centres in existence after 12 years, one taken in in 1969 and another taken in in 1970, after which nothing happened until we decided to substitute one place for another place.</P>
    <P>Talking about £4 million to £5 million expenditure, I looked at total expenditure in respect of these harbour centres right up to 31 December 1978 and it came to £2.754 million.  Now I am told that in this year we are proposing to spend £4 million to £5 million.  Are we going to gush money suddenly into these three harbours?  What is the overall policy with regard to this matter?  One has only to look at the map to understand the new international law, and it really is new international law, even though the Law of the Sea Conference have not signed all their papers yet.  It is an essentially new international law giving us 200 miles in the context of the EEC.  It would seem that we, with Britain, are enormously important in relation to the EEC's possession of fishing waters.  I do not want to go into who negotiated in 1972 and whether the negotiations were right or sufficiently informed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> In general, there seems to have been a curious lack of confidence in the whole idea of developing our fisheries.  I remember leading a few delegations to a few Ministers on behalf of the fishing industry and it must be said that the present Taoiseach was the only one who finally got the point.  The other two men just told us in fine language what the existing policy was.  The Taoiseach did actually hear what we said and did make a change in the law.  Right into the sixties the law was that it was illegal to have a boat beyond a particular size.  It was a social policy administered for part-time fishermen and there was no sense of the possibilities of the whole affair for the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why we have five harbour centres.  Why not introduce a Bill to enable the Minister to do all these things which protect all property rights in relation to all harbour centres? Why just list five?  No doubt there is a reason.  It may be a good reason or a bad one, but I should like to know what it is. Are things being held up?  The Minister has a map or a plan in his office, presumably.  He sits there wondering whether people will object and therefore he cannot go on with the acquisition.  He cannot spend money on what he has not acquired and the thing is being held up in a way in which it need not be held up if he had the power to amend the Schedule or to substitute or add to it, unless there are other reasons why that should not be so.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the proportion of people who work in the food industry here is to the number of the farmers who grow the food.  I do not know what the ratio is of what we call the processors of food to the farmers who grow it.  That is not an easy figure to work out because so much of what farmers grow is exported. In relation to fish it would seem that the ratio is very modest indeed.  I take it there is an overall plan to build up a fish processing industry with due energy and knowing that the costs involved in this kind of thing are all costs which must come back.  We are importing £6 million <Col N="1414" /> worth of fish, on the 1977 figures, and exporting six times that amount.  It may well be that in the international market, as a result of the 200-mile extension, there is now destabilisation in the whole business of catching fish in big boats outside the limit.  In the light of what the conservation policy has got to be one would like to have some estimates made of what is procurable for processing in Ireland.  I understand the structure better than other things about this.  Is there any question of our processing here fish caught under the proper grant of quotas in the EEC by fishermen other than Irish fishermen?  Is that fish landed at harbours here and made available for processing in factories in Ireland, replacing our imports and adding to exports?</P>
    <P>In particular I should like to think the area to be taken in will be quite sufficient to provide for all the processing facilities and will be ambitious, whatever about the private sector money which will largely go into the actual building of the factories.  Are there plans which have been operating already in conjunction with the local authorities for the development of roads?  I do not know the Rossaveal scene.  If you are building a harbour and you are hoping that there will be processing, you have to have a road structure.  The timing of all that will have to be fitted in under some plan.  I do not know whether the harbour authority the Minister will establish under this Bill will have a proper ability to get money spent on the roads servicing these harbours.</P>
    <P>One of my great notions about economic life is that an awful lot of value can be generated out of consumption as well as out of production, out of what you do with your money as well as actually getting it, whether you save it and make it available for capital goods, or whether you spend it in a wise and sensible fashion, with good taste, and so on. Considering that eating fish on Fridays was the outstanding devotion of Irish Catholics for some centuries, it is rather interesting that fish on Fridays and fish on Wednesdays were imposed as legal obligations by Queen Elizabeth in Great <Col N="1415" /> Britain long before it became the United Kingdom.  This was to ensure that the fishery industry under the old mercantilist regime of Great Britain would be built up.  I do not think the EEC could stop an obligation being imposed on us all to restart eating fish on Fridays on a strictly non-sectarian basis.</P>

      <P>I should like to contribute very briefly on this the Bill which concerns a transfer of emphasis from Galway to Rossaveal.  The Bill is not controversial.  We support it.  I just want to make one or two remarks about harbour development on the west coast.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister's speech that, under the amending legislation, the harbours to be developed as centres are Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Rossaveal.  Of course, there cannot be any quibble about the choice of any of these centres. Castletownbere is the major fishery harbour development on the south-west coast.  Dunmore East is very significant in the south-east.  Killybegs is predominant, and Howth, on the east coast, is very significant.  In talking about the Rossaveal development the Minister speaks to a large extent about the fact that it is in the Gaeltacht.  Of course it is necessary to develop the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <P>I want to speak very briefly about the Mayo coastline.  Off the north-west Mayo coastline there is another major pier, a major harbour development, at Ballyglass outside Belmullet.  It is a very significant area because it is on the main sea route round the country.  The Donegal fishing fleet catches a substantial part of its catch off the north Mayo coast.  This harbour was built about three or four years ago with an investment of something approaching £½ million.  It is in an area giving shelter.  It has ready access to probably the most significant fishing grounds off the country, but there has been no development whatever of the harbour area, apart from the harbour itself.  It is worthy of consideration by the Minister because Donegal people are fishing there a great deal.  It is an area in which an indigenous Mayo fishing fleet can develop.  The Minister places particular significance on the place of Rossaveal in the Gaeltacht. Ballyglass is also in the Gaeltacht.  For <Col N="1417" /> many reasons I feel the Minister should look at it with a view to its being included in this separate list at some future stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome too the idea that Rossaveal comes under the Minister's responsibility for direct development.  The danger is that, if these harbours do not get special privileges, with piecemeal development, lack of co-ordination and a lack of a sense of responsibility, a number of Government agencies may weaken their development.  For that reason I support this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Bill, but I want to take this opportunity to make some comments both on what is in the Minister's speech and also on some wider aspects.  It happens that, both from the sea and the shore, I know the Rossaveal situation.  I have to say, in fairness, that originally I thought the attraction of Galway as a larger city, with chandlers, with pubs, with restaurants, with other facilities, would outweigh the advantages of Rossaveal one of which is the advantage of a shorter distance from the fishing grounds.  I thought that the tug-o'-war of the real economic attraction of the two places Galway would win, but I am very happy to say I was wrong.  I am very happy with the figures the Minister has given indicating that Rossaveal is now No. 5 on the list of landings in the whole country, and indicating that it has far exceeded the port of Galway.  It is necessary that the major fishing harbours should not be subject&mdash;with the best will in the world towards local authorities&mdash;to piecemeal development, and not subject to the various tug-o'-wars for money and for facilities of the kind local authorities and county councils encounter.  It is a good thing to have a small number, in this case five, of the crucial harbours taken under central control for their planning, their development and their growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I should like to ask the Minister to think about a few more. Howth for the east coast is fine. Castletownbere for the south-coast is <Col N="1418" /> fine.  Rossaveal we are accepting.  It is winning the battle with Galway, and good luck to it.  Killybegs is already very well established and dynamic and full of people with a great deal of commercial vitality, acumen and knowledge of the sea and how to catch fish.  Its future is healthy.  I am not saying we should multiply these special harbours to any considerable extent because their very success involves a concentration of effort.</P>
    <P>From Castletownbere to Rossaveal is a long way.  I was wondering whether somewhere on the southern end of Clare, or perhaps in the Shannon Estuary, or the north Kerry shore, might have an argument to be made in its favour, because the distances are considerable, and because the price of fuel for the big trawlers has expanded much more dramatically than the price of fish.  In 1973 the price of oil was 2.50 dollars a barrel and now it is something over 32 dollars a barrel.  The distance of the fishing ground from the developed harbour is becoming very significant.</P>
    <P>I know that experts have been into this.  It is an area in which I have always had an interest.  As a veterinarian I have always been a bit interested in marine biology that I look on as a parallel science.  As someone concerned with agriculture I look forward to the day when mariculture&mdash;the farming of the sea as distinct from the hunting of the sea which is all that fishing is&mdash;will become very important in Ireland.  The argument might be made for somewhere in north Kerry.  I feel that the distance from Rossaveal to Killybegs is very substantial, and Ballyglass is a good location.  I have no connection with the district.  This is in no sense a representational observation on my part, because it is a place I know a little but I have no connection with it.  The argument might be made to have a look at Ballyglass.  Of the existing five around the coast&mdash;I did not mention Dunmore&mdash;there are two in the east, one in the south, one in the far north-west in Killybegs, and one in the middle of the west coast.  Somewhere in the north Mayo area or on the south side <Col N="1419" /> of Donegal Bay looks right.  There is a very good fishing ground there.  There may be an argument for one somewhere around the mouth of the Shannon or a bit south of that.  It is not an enormous increase.  It is going from five special harbours to seven.  That is reasonable in view of the length of our coastline and the size and richness of the Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>I have a sense of omission from the Minister's speech.  I know this is a little Bill and in opening the Second Stage debate the natural inclination is to keep the content of the Minister's Second Stage speech down, so that Senators do not go chasing after everything.  If we are talking about the development of special harbours, we can only put that in the context of the development of the fishing industry.  It is in a lack of any sense of perspective for the fishing industry that I find a genuine omission from the Minister's speech.  I am a little bit disappointed.  I am not now going to try to open a debate on the future of Irish fishing.  I believe it to be so important that I think that this chamber ought to do more than to put down a marker, as I will be doing over the next few minutes.</P>
    <P>I was in the Irish chair at the Council of Ministers when our Minister for Foreign Affairs moved, with immense distinction and credit to Ireland, into the President's chair of the Council of Ministers during the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers in the period in office of the Coalition Government.  One of the things that was continuously arising was the matter of fisheries policy.  It is a very troubled and difficult area, and I am not going to enter into it now.  From my personal experience, from experience of friends in the industry, from reading regularly the admirable periodical <i>The Irish Skipper</i>, which I would recommend to anyone interested in the Irish fishing industry, I know that the animating thought when we were talking about community policy on fish was that Ireland would formulate what was practically going to be a crash programme to make dramatic advance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> I want to deviate to say that, in our maritime and fishing tradition, if you go far enough back, we have one of great courage, skill and success.  What destroyed us was the transition to steam trawlers in the last century at a time when there was capital starvation in Ireland.  It was left as a part-time, an artisan, a small boat, a traditional and in-shore fishery.  While the great east coast ports in Britain, which were heavily industrialised, heavily capitalised, which could call on the finances of the city of London to make this dramatic leap of technology, simply took over the North Atlantic fisheries, we were left out in a piece of what I would describe as economic imperialism.  It was one of the many ways in which we suffered from being part of the United Kingdom.  We suffered by the loss of industry after industry, and we suffered because our fishing industry, based on small in-shore boats and traditional methods, was not able to accumulate the capital to make the technological leap.  Nothwithstanding the existence of a certain number of large and modern trawlers, we still have not got strong economic structures from trawler owning, through to processing, into distribution, to market, despite the admirable efforts of people like BIM.</P>
    <P>It was axiomatic when we undertook the effort to develop a common fisheries policy in the Community and we agreed to participate in it, that we would make a very strenuous effort to overcome the disadvantages of the past.  I remember with acute annoyance hearing people from Germany and from other Community countries referring to what I consider the Irish Continential Shelf as the Community's Continental Shelf.  It is still the Irish Continental Shelf but, if we do not catch the fish on it, they will, because they are much richer and much more technologically advanced.  There are two completely separate things.  One has a social aspect and is the protection of the life of the small and disadvantaged communities on the west coast where they depend on the land, which is a poor and grudging land often, and work it very hard, and they depend on the sea.</P>
    <P>These are poor people, short of <Col N="1421" /> capital, short of technology.  Some of them are part-time fishermen, some of them are full-time with small boats, in-shore fishermen, and they have to be protected.  Even the most brilliant of them have to be helped to make the transition to large-scale modern capitalist intensification, but that is not enough. That is only part of a fisheries policy. The other part is to build the structures, using the very largest vessels, the most advanced technology which does not even exist in Europe any more&mdash;it is now the prerogative of the Japanese&mdash;the most capital intensive and sophisticated and productive processing within Ireland, and the follow up to intensive and sophisticated marketing which gives maximum added value to us.</P>
    <P>We have the great good fortune that the North Atlantic Drift brings energy to our shore.  It brings feed for fish to our shore.  It brings fish to our shore.  The failure to develop in a modern way, as well as protecting the artisan fisherman, the in-shore fisherman, and to develop a distant water large-scale efficient fleet is a very glaring failure in our whole economic development.  It is very serious for employment and very serious in the throwing away of a resource that is there on our doorstep.</P>
    <P>Time is running out.  We have not changed in the period since the middle seventies when the original standards about a common fisheries policy arose in the Community.  We have not used those resources to advance our position very rapidly as was envisaged at that time. The time is approaching when the rigours of a common policy will become more and more uniform and <i>commun au taire</i>, rather than responding to the demands of individual nations.  The British, with a very highly developed industry, have fought a tremendous rearguard battle and that is what it has been.  If we do not use the distant water advantages we have to catch those fish in Irish boats and land them for Irish processing, Irish distribution, and Irish sale, then other people will do it.  We have already squandered <Col N="1422" /> nearly half a decade and, if we squander the next half decade, the door will be slammed and it will be too late.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed about the lack of effectiveness for the capital-intensive, big, highly-developed industry and the lack of a sense of desperate urgency.  If the present structure of the Irish fishing industry <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Danes or the British, or the French or the Germans, is a reflection of the draining of capital out of the country, a reflection of our past economic history and our past economic exploitation, to try to come on the scene now with a crash programme in an industry where the return on capital is not very high, is, in my view, totally impossible without major State aid and major State participation.  Either we have a large scale, heavily funded but ultimately very profitable, big scale fishing industry, modern efficient fishing industry, or else in the long term we leave the fish of our Continental Shelf to the goats of Britain, France, Germany and Denmark. It is a choice that we can still make.  It will not be a choice for much longer.  I am sorry that a sense of a wider perspection and a sense of urgency was not in the Minister's opening speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot repeat them exactly but I hope I can repeat the sense.  Firstly, the Continental Shelf is a huge resource.  Secondly, we have not been able to take advantage of it for reasons of our economic history and the capital starvation and indeed the educational starvation in technological matters of our people.  Thirdly, the European Economic Community's Common fisheries policy is developing at such a rate that, if we do not catch the fish by modern intensive large-scale methods, other people will do it.  Fourthly, when we started negotiations and indeed concessions in this area in the middle seventies, it was implicit that there would be a dramatic crash programme to expand large-scale efficient fishing&mdash;I am making a separation between that and in-shore <Col N="1423" /> artisan fishing&mdash;that there would be a crash programme to dramatically expand the large-scale high technology, high capital fisheries, to exploit the Continental Shelf for Ireland.  Finally, since we are at a time of world economic difficulty, since the fishery industry now is an area of low profitability, this will simply not happen at all, if it is not done with major State intervention.  It is potentially very profitable but it will not be done on the basis of private enterprise and that we do not have for ever.  We squandered half a decade and if we squandered another half decade it will be too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I should like to thank Senator Keating for doing the needful.  From reading and listening to the Minister's Second Reading speech last night, there was one point I noticed: he did not refer to the fact that this scheme under section 3, Rossaveal, has been significantly grant-aided from the regional development fund.  Back in 1976, I spent a week with Commissioner Thompson in the west of Ireland trying to sell the needs and the benefits of providing adequate facilities there for the fishermen of the entire west coast.  My recollection is that the port and the entire project were significantly aided.  It is one of those on which we based our greatest argument for enhanced contributions for the usage of the fund.  We based the argument on the west of Ireland, especially in the fishing industry.  Not only did it come up but it was tied in with the discussion we had then on the law of the sea and on the extension of the Irish-Community fishing limits.  Will the Minister confirm, when he is replying, whether or not my recollection is correct that the Community did come in on that?  In 1976, and indeed before that, during the time I was President of the Transport Commission, I had the opportunity of looking not only at all the major sea ports but at all the major fishing sea ports, including the ports in Greenland.  If we are sincere about equipping our fishermen&mdash;and I <Col N="1424" /> regret that they appear to be going through a lean time at present&mdash;we must provide the very best infrastructure.  It is not just a matter of improving the existing facilities.  The decision to take Rossaveal and to build it up was an excellent decision.  We need a little more of that.  We have got to put our fishermen in a position where they will be able to compete economic-wise, cost-wise, with all their competitors.  I hope the fact that the Minister's Department are now taking over this port means that we will not have a typical situation where, after years of looking for even the smallest improvement, the Minister and his Department will respond or react.  I hope that in this situation, where as it were the ball is at our own feet, the Minister's officials and his experts will be one step ahead of the industry in providing and enhancing the facilities, constantly putting our fishermen in a position where they will be able to compete adequately with the most modern trawlers and the most intensively financed competitors, from whatever other country they come.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the Minister will be able to give this particular area a vital boost.  The other facilities and infrastructures mentioned need a greater amount of expenditure.  I remember that during the discussion with the Greenlanders they were sore with the United Kingdom colleagues, that they were pirating their waters.  When I asked our own people for figures, they had only one boat which was in excess of 100 or 101 feet.  I am not an expert on fishing&mdash;I am very much a midlander&mdash;but nevertheless, I would like to ask the Minister whether or not the regional development fund has played any part and whether or not it can be utilised to make a more dynamic contribution to the provision of the infrastructures that the fishing industry needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment everybody who contributed here.  It was nice to see that the people who did contribute had a serious interest in the matter we were dealing with in regard to Rossaveal. Some of their remarks were critical and <Col N="1425" /> some complimentary, but at least they dealt with the matter in hand and did not depart from the subject, as was done in the other House.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard welcomed two matters, the increase in fines and the commitment to Rossaveal to change from Galway.  The probable cost, based on present prices, of carrying out work there will be in the region of £4 million to £5 million.  All interested parties in the area have been informed.  I can give you a list of the bodies.  Senator FitzGerald mentioned we would have to tie up with the local county council.  We had a representative from Galway County Council, Mr. Callaghan, on that and a substitute is required.  They should be in a position to deal with the infrastructure needed in the area while the port is being developed.  I emphasise for the benefit of people here that while we have designated these five particular areas as major centres that is not the end of the road for other areas and, indeed Senator Brugha has a particular interest in Daingean Uí Chúise.  Dingle is designated in a Gaeltacht area; Roinn na Gaeltachta have been involved in major dredging in that particular area.  In 1975 a quarter of a million pounds was spent on it and Kerry County Council have agreed to take responsibility for any maintenance dredging that will be needed in the meantime.  The responsibility for dredging and harbour maintenance rests with them.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara have also put in an ice plant and fish processing is going on in one particular firm in the Dingle area.  If you are not among the five, it does not mean you are left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt Senator O'Brien gur aontaigh sé leis na téarmaí a bhí anseo.  Senator Mulcahy made a suggestion that we should look upon Dublin port and the old wharf there as being a place they might develop for fishery landings.  There are a few points against that&mdash;one is the distance they would have to steam to get to the fishing grounds, also there is a possibility that pilots will be needed to bring boats in to Dublin Harbour.  It is a good suggestion.  We have already given <Col N="1426" /> facilities there and it is something that we might look at.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked about the structure of the Bill and what structures we have.  When the Bill is passed an order will be made declaring Rossaveal a fishery harbour centre.  The area defined in the order will vest in me responsibility for the further development of the harbour in its control and management, operation and maintenance.  That will all pass on to me.  The fine is increased from £100 to £500.  Senator FitzGerald looked upon that as being in keeping with inflation.  It is not intended that it should be nor do I agree that it is&mdash;it is more a deterrent for people who break the law.  It is much easier to get £500 now than it was when this law was first introduced.  I hope it will be more of a deterrent to people who are likely to break it.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht area up to now, the Gaeltacht were responsible for the work that went on, and in the five designated harbours we will be responsible.  These arose because we got a report from a Swedish expert.  He outlined the priorities, where the major work should go on, and Rossaveal has been picked instead of Galway because of the reasons that were set out in my opening remarks&mdash;it will have all the facilities and it will have the infrastructure as well, hopefully, on the mainland to allow the produce of the fishing industry to be transported or exported elsewhere.  It will also have ferry facilities for the Aran Islands, which is something that we are thinking about.</P>
    <P>That means though that other works go on elsewhere and when we get representations about a particular area it is surveyed and the Office of Public Works are informed, to get a preliminary idea of the expenditure involved.  Then we do something in the nature of a cost-benefit analysis because the eventual cost of the work is weighed against the fish landings that were there or the projected fish landings.  We do what is necessary realistically when we get Finance approval for that.  It is unlikely that there will be expenditure this year in <Col N="1427" /> Rossaveal but we hope that in the first year about £750,000 will be expended and over the period that it takes to do the work, that should amount to about £4 million to £5 million.</P>
    <P>Some Senators remarked that there was a lack of confidence in the industry. I do not see that in Killybegs or Castletownbere.  We have big work going on in Howth at the moment and in Dunmore East.  I do not see any lack of confidence.  The greatest tribute that can be paid to the confidence in the fishing industry is that this year five new boats will come into the fleet in Killybegs. They will be over 120 feet long and will cost £2.2 million each.  They will be the most sophisticated boats available.  Unfortunately, they have to be built outside the country but possibly we will remedy that eventually.  They will be in a position to harvest the sea and fish side by side out to any distance with any other boat in the Community and these are all first class with fine Irish born skippers who have learned their trade at home.</P>
    <P>To be realistic, the five fishery harbour centres designated at the moment are enough to be going on with.  Work can go on in others.  Not very long ago, during the life of the present Government, it was decided to carry out significant works in Schull and they very much appreciated it.  I visited Clare Island recently.  I was saddened to see that work that had been going ahead has now stopped, work on the extension and other facilities to the pier which they badly need, because of difficulty with the contractor.  It is sad to see steel and other articles there rusting on the pier for want of a decision.  It is something I must look at.</P>
    <P>I mention these things to indicate that you do not have to be designated as a major centre for the work to go ahead.  I agree that fishing and the fishing industry does not play a sufficient part in the economy of a maritime country like ours that has wonderful fishing grounds, natural harbours, a long coastline and placed in a position where we are nearer to fish than any other member country.  We <Col N="1428" /> regret that.  We are improving our position, thanks to The Hague Agreement; we had commitments from our fellow states that we were allowed to double our catch between 1975 and 1979.  We did not do that but we still have that commitment from the member states. That is the target we aim at and future quotas and total allowable catches that we will be given will be based on that.</P>
    <P>Our processing industry has improved. We have processors.  Senator FitzGerald remarked that we should try to encourage foreign based industry to process.  We have a tie up with a Spanish firm, Pescanova, who are processing now under the name of the subsidiary firm Eiranovo in Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald remarked that some years ago there was a law passed that fish would be eaten on Fridays and Wednesdays in Britain.  He gave Queen Elizabeth the credit for that.  I knew her father bore the proud title of defender of the faith.  I did not realise that he had passed on that attribute to his daughter as well.  It is nice to know even at this late stage that you can learn something about Queen Elizabeth and appreciate the interest she had in ensuring the faith lived on.  Maybe she has a little sin to answer for, fish being tied up with penalising somebody, that eating fish has been looked upon as a penalty for too long.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir de Brún trí Ghaeilge gur aontaigh sé leis an méid atá á dhéanamh againn anseo.  Dúirt sé go raibh fhios aige gur chuir Roinn na Gaeltachta £1 milliún isteach ins an gcuan seo agus tá fhios agam féin go bhfuil an-spéis aige in iarthar na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton mentioned Ballyglass.  I am aware it is very convenient to the fishing grounds.  It is enticing for the Killybegs and Donegal fishermen to use it.  It has not got the facilities it should have.  More recently when I visted Achill Island the fishermen there pointed out that maybe Darby's Point would be more suitable.  It would entail considerable expenditure.  If improved, it would be a more suitable harbour than Ballyglass.  I agree that increased oil <Col N="1429" /> costs and steaming costs have made fishing an expensive business.  You have to go very far.  We are examining Ballyglass.  Senator Keating agreed with the change from Galway to Rossaveal.  I agree that it is important when major harbour centres are being developed that the further they are removed from petty local pressures the better.  He mentioned the distance between Castletownbere and Rossaveal and the need to establish another fishing port or fishing harbour there.  Unfortunately, in the report that Bjuke presented to us he did not indicate that there was any possible harbour suitable in Clare or north Kerry or even on the coast line that would be suitable.  I know Dingle has limited advantages and Ballyglass of course, as already mentioned, has advantages too.  I am conscious of the fact that when you go to considerable expenditure to improve a port, fishing grounds do not always remain static and the fish will decide to move away to another area from places that were traditionally good.  It is a bit awkward to have to follow them with further development of that area too.</P>
    <P>I do not share the pessimism expressed by Senator Keating with regard to the future of Irish fishing.  I am convinced that we will have the benefit of a common fishing policy within a year. This is something that has the fear of the unknown, the uncertainty about the future has been a deterrent to investment in the industry and every indication at recent meetings we have had with the Council Fishery Ministers is that we will have that common fishery policy.  There is a greater awareness and anxiety to bring it about.  Our number one priority will be to get an exclusive zone for Irish fishermen and to get the very best possible deal for them.  We can base our arguments with regard to quotas on The Hague agreement and that is based on the continuing and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry.  We can advance some excuses.  We had to take conservation measures with regard to our herring fishing in the Celtic Sea and off the Donegal Coast, purely from a conservation point of view.  We suffered <Col N="1430" /> as a result of that and we are hoping that it will not be held against us when the quotas are being distributed. We have got very good reason to hope that we will get an increased mackerel quota to compensate in part for the amount of herring that we will be losing. In a recent visit to Killybegs perhaps I got a little bit carried away but I felt the enthusiasm, and hope for the future there seems to be contagious.</P>
    <P>We have every reason to be optimistic and I do not agree that we have been idle for the last 50 years or that we have thrown away something that we had and that we should have cherished.  There is no great lack of urgency in the Irish fishing industry.  There has been a great involvement of State aid, both advisory and monetary, and I think that the criticism is ill-founded that there is no crash programme needed in our industry at the moment.  We have an ongoing, progressive and improving programme.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the regional fund.  He is correct in saying that a grant was made from the EEC to Roinn na Gaeltachta in 1975 and it is nice to know that a land lubber like Senator McDonald&mdash;and I share that distinction with him&mdash;took such an interest some years ago in the fishing industry and particularly in Rossaveal, that he was responsible for getting a grant for them during his term in Europe.  I look upon that as a compliment, I would like to bask too in the reflected glory Senator McDonald claims.  You do not have to be born in a stable to enjoy the Derby.  Neither do you have to be born with a tang of salt on your lips to have an interest in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I am aware that through the western package there is great hope for us improving our infrastructure in the west of Ireland.  I know somebody had the bright idea that Mr. Gundelach in one of his trips here be brought on a reconnaissance flight in a helicopter over the west of Ireland, and at that particular time in the European Parliament I mentioned to him that we did not wish to <Col N="1431" /> have motor roads as in Sicily but we would settle for reasonably good roads and he agreed.  He was amazed when he saw the bad roads that we had there and said they needed to be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up a legal structure whereby exclusive proprietary rights can be afforded to plant breeders for new plant varieties.  The Bill provides that any such rights granted will be protected against infringment and affords equal treatment for Irish plant breeders and breeders from countries party to the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.</P>
      <P>The concept of plant breeders' rights has been established for many years. Seven of the other eight member states of the EEC are party to the convention&mdash;the exception being Luxembourg where no plant breeding is carried out. Altogether 12 countries have acceded to the convention and a number of other countries including the United States, Canada and New Zealand are proposing to do so in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> It is essential that the creation of new plant varieties continues in order to obtain higher yields, better quality and security of crops from the hazards of weather and disease.  A new plant variety is the result of a substantial investment of human skill and resources for periods as long as 15 years.  Plant breeders are no different from creators of other intellectual property&mdash;which can be protected by copyrights and patents&mdash;and breeders can only be expected to undertake such expensive and time-consuming work if they can be satisfied that the results of their work cannot be pirated.  Without the kind of system envisaged here the likelihood is that plant breeders could expect little return for their work because their propagating material could be freely used for the production of further propagating material for commercial use.  The concept of breeders' rights has evolved in order to protect breeders from this kind of exploitation.  Breeders would be granted a right whereby, for a period not exceeding 25 years, propagating material of their new plant varieties could only be produced or marketed as such with the breeders' prior authorisation.</P>
    <P>Some individual countries have established their own breeders' rights systems but the more common, and in my view the most satisfactory method, is to adopt the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.  Countries party to this Convention constitute the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants&mdash;known as UPOV&mdash;which administers the convention.  In order to be in a position to ratify the convention, a country must enact legislation which contains the principles laid down in the convention and the purpose of this Bill is, essentially, to enshrine in our national legislation this system of protection of plant breeders' rights.</P>
    <P>Almost all the countries from which we obtain seeds or plant material are, or are proposing to become, members of UPOV.  The EEC Commission recommend that all member states accede to the convention and take a particular interest <Col N="1433" /> in the work of UPOV.  The two bodies are at present co-operating towards achieving harmonised systems of plant variety testing with a view to minimising both the workload and financial costs for the countries involved.</P>
    <P>There has been increasing pressure from Irish interests for the establishment of a rights system in accordance with the UPOV Convention.  Our plant breeders are justified in seeking protection against infringement of their rights for any plant varieties they create.  I would hope this legislation would have the effect of encouraging more breeding work in Ireland.  A further consideration is our dependence on foreign varieties for our main agricultural crops such as cereals and grasses.  Most of the useful new varieties of these species are protected under the UPOV system, and we have been very fortunate in being able to avail of them up to now under what might be termed <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements because it was generally known that we proposed to join UPOV.  However, there are serious grounds for concern that, if we do not now press ahead and actually join, then some foreign breeders would not be prepared to continue to allow us use of their varieties.  Accordingly, there are, I feel, compelling reasons for this legislation&mdash;protection and encouragement for Irish plant breeding interests and easier access to foreign varieties of seeds and plant material.</P>
    <P>During the Bill's passage through the Dáil some mention was made of the possible effect of this type of legislation on the genetic resources of the Third World.  However, I can assure the House that the existence of plant breeders' rights legislation as such is totally unconnected with the genetic resources position.  Many high-yielding plant varieties which would almost certainly not have been developed in the absence of a plant breeders' rights system, have contributed substantially to world food supplies.  The very fact that less developed countries have been able to take advantage of these new varieties in my view effectively answers critics who <Col N="1434" /> suggest that plant breeders' rights legislation makes it impossible for Third World countries to avail of developments in plant breeding.</P>
    <P>On the question of maintaining genetic resources, a number of individual countries and also some international organisations such as FAO and the EEC are already involved in setting up gene banks which will help to preserve &ldquo;old&rdquo; varieties that may be in danger of being lost.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make a few specific remarks about this Bill.  As I have already mentioned, it is based on the principles of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.  The convention was signed on behalf of Ireland on 27 September last subject to ratification after the enactment of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The main provisions in the Bill are:</P>
    <P>Countries party to the convention will be recognised as having a special status in regard to plant breeders' rights.</P>
    <P>A breeder granted rights will for a specified period have the sole authority to produce the plant variety for the purpose of commercial marketing.  He will also have exclusive rights in so far as the export or import of any reproductive material of the variety is concerned.  The breeder may transfer these rights to others on conditions which he may specify, just as in the case of any other property.  In the exercise of their rights breeders will, in turn, have a duty to ensure that their varieties are made available on reasonable terms and are maintained true to the characteristics which originally qualified them for rights.  If a breeder is considered to have abused his rights&mdash;for example, by imposing unreasonable restrictions on authorisation or if the public interest so requires, then it is open to an aggrieved party to apply for a compulsory licence.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down precise criteria for grant of rights and a variety must be distinct from others of the same species, must be uniform and stable in its reproduction and, subject to some transitional <Col N="1435" /> arrangements, must not have been previously commercialised outside certain periods.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the establishment of a body corporate to be called the Office of the Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights to administer the rights system.  The Minister for Agriculture will appoint a Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights who will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the system.  The office of the controller will be somewhat similar to the existing Patents Office.  It is hoped that eventually the system will be self-financing but this will depend on demand.  The technical and scientific work of evaluating applications for rights would be integrated into the seed variety testing arrangements at present conducted by my Department and the administration of the system would also be undertaken by my Department.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for appeals relating to decisions by the controller and for objections and representatives as regards applications to the controller for surrender, revocation, assignment and so on of rights.</P>
    <P>All the interests concerned with plant breeding in Ireland have been consulted and their views taken into account.  The immediate aim is to introduce a rights system of suitably modest proportions to meet our needs.  While rights under the Bill may be applied to varieties of any botanical species, it is our intention initially to confine rights to varieties of wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, ryegrass and white clover.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to make up my mind as to whether I should speak in favour of the Bill or against it. Having examined the contents of the Bill, I feel that the control of seed breeding and the development of plant varieties will be in the hands of monopolies, and international monopolies at that.  Because of the size of our country and because the influence we have in the development of agriculture is so limited internationally, I <Col N="1436" /> have doubts about the potential we would have in the development of new varieties and in conveying that Ireland should be recognised as an agricultural country which should have influence in that field.  International monopolies have in the past and up to very recently been powerful in their control of anything they have been involved in.  Therefore, I have doubts about the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to support the Bill because if there is some control over those monopoly influences, the development of new plant varieties and new and extra foods may enable us to give thought to the Third World.  The developed world, as we call it, takes very little interest in the Third World.  If we can develop sufficient foods that we would be able to supply the Third World with certain foods at a price that they could pay, or even through international bodies without receiving any payment we would be doing good for every race in this world by helping the Third World.  Unless we make up our minds now to help the Third World we will be all found wanting and the future of the whole world could be at stake.  For that reason there is some cause for me to support the Bill.  I would like to know what control we would have over the monopolies created by this Bill.  Our influence would be very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When America had surplus food they did not export it subsidised in any way to the Third World.  They put a match to it and set it on fire.  If development of new plants and new varieties creates more food, that may happen again, and if it does happen then we will all be involved. Our influence here should be seen to be effective.  In the past our influence has been ignored and that applies to all other countries who favour the idea of subsidising food for the Third World. Monopolies are very dangerous and people in big business are apt to create monopolies.  They are in the business to make money out of it and they would not be in the business unless they could get money for being in it.  They would not be interested in the development of new varieties unless they knew that they were going to get finance from their investment. <Col N="1437" /> That is the reason I am worried but we should be in there at the same time even though our voice may be limited.  We may be able to convince other people who should be involved in the development of those monopolies that we must think of the Third World.</P>
    <P>Also, unless we are involved we could be left out of the whole development.  We would probably be forced to develop our own plant varieties and we may not be capable of doing that to the extent necessary to keep up with the other countries.  Companies in this country and the Agricultural Institute are very involved in the development of plant varieties, but unless the knowledge is available to them about the development of varieties in other countries we will be left far behind.</P>
    <P>Sixteen years is far too long for any monopoly to have.  I know the reason for giving exclusive rights to multi-national companies for a period of time is the investment they put into the development of the new varieties.  Some guarantees must be given to them to allow them to develop the new varieties because of the cost of developing and because some of the new varieties may fail and some would not come up to the required standard. They would have to dispense with them and start again to try to develop other varieties.  Some compensation must be paid for that and the compensation should be a period of years.  Sixteen years is too long because during that time things do not remain static.  You develop and keep developing all the time. The scientific mind does not allow things to remain static.  There would be substantial changes every six, seven or eight years and continuing the extension to 16 years is giving full control over longer than 16 years because you are adding eight years to eight years to eight years without ever losing the monopoly control of the plant varieties.  I suggest that the Minister would consider the point I am making.  I am sure he realises that the scientific mind never stops and that a variety created now would not be the same variety in 16 years' time.  That may <Col N="1438" /> have been the case ten or 20 years ago but at present and in the recent past you could not produce anything, whether it is plant variety, a piece of machinery or anything else, and say that that is the &ldquo;be all and end all&rdquo; of what is being developed.  That is not the case.  We never stop and we keep going.  The population of the world is expanding and will keep expanding and, therefore, this development must keep recurring.  It is wrong to give control for 16 years to any company or any monopoly.</P>
    <P>The control will not be in our hands and about 98 per cent of the people who will receive patents will be foreigners. In that case we will really have no great interest in the development of any product.  Our people who will be involved in it will be two per cent or less of the total and we will have little influence on the varieties that will be developed.  One could develop varieties for countries of the Middle East and America which may not suit our climate or our society.  For that reason I doubt about whether we would get any great benefit from being a member of this organisation.  We may get scientific knowledge of the development of new plant varieties in other countries and the Agricultural Institute may sow the seeds of those varieties and see what the result will be.  The first time the seed is sown in our country it may produce bumper crops but the results of sowing that seed on that land over a few years may be very disappointing.  The soil in certain parts of our country may not be suitable for the breeding of some new varieties. We should be very careful before we use any new plant developed by outside interests. Our own institutes should develop their knowledge of new varieties introduced here.  We should be very careful that we do not sow them wholesale throughout the country without first having them tested on our own soil.  The monopoly created by this will have the selling powers and will have documentation designed to convince the people that what they are selling will produce so many tons of a variety of seed&mdash;wheat, barley and so on.  A lot of that will be propaganda that may influence <Col N="1439" /> our farmers to buy the seed. What grows in other countries may not produce enough here to give the farmer a profit on his investment.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know if we should support this Bill.  I cannot make up my mind.  I have thought about it, I feel there are advantages and disadvantages, but I hope that, whatever will come of it, we will not forget the Third World.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an impassioned address by me because it is not a subject that I know any more about than I have gathered from reading the Official Report of the Dáil on it.  I do not need to have access to the Official Report of debates to know about monopolies and patent rights, and that I have a very great suspicion of any extension to any new field of existing monopoly rights.  I take the Minister's case on this.  I understand the objective. In general I would be in the same doubt as my colleague expressed because I do not know enough about it except that there are risks inherent in the affair. Because I do not know enough about it, it seems to me that I should go along with the Bill and get to work on it for Committee Stage.  I would like to compare the system which is outlined with the existing statutory provisions with regard to patents, about which I know something, just to see what snags have been developing in that area and whether we have taken advance notice of them in the provisions we are designing now.  I know we have not got to the business of fixing the next stage, but if I am to do any work worth anything I will want a week to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that there is also a movement in the EEC to throw into question even patents where there is a question of interference with free competition.  I would like to look at this aspect of this affair, of which I gather from the debate that I have read that the EEC seem to be making a different approach from what their approach generally is with regard to industrial <Col N="1440" /> technology.  It would be the duty of Senators to inform themselves better than we are informed.  This took a leisurely pace in the Dáil and I am not criticising anybody.  It is a new area. The Bill was moved in mid-February and finished a week or so ago.  We would not be doing our duty if we did not give more consideration to it than we are able to do.  That is not to say that we seek to deny the Minister a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>There was one point made in Dáil Éireann, and I do not know why it is not made more often or why it has not been made more successfuly generally.  I thought it was one of the benefits that we were going to get out of the EEC system. The EEC do not have any hesitation about sending you out the draft legislation at a certain stage, so that you can study it.  Among the bodies that get that draft legislation to consider are Memebers of Parliament.  We have a Joint Committee looking at the draft legislation.  Our original terms of reference did not entitle us to do that, but the Joint Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation now looks at draft proposals for legislation at the stage when it goes to the Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>We have been able, on behalf of the Irish Parliament, to gather together all affected Irish interests and put them through a political sieve, which is different from the testing they would get in Brussels, and then present an Irish quantity, formulated politically, to Brussels. At the end of the day we get an improved piece of legislation.  Why do we not make a change?  For years we have copied the British system; but since we joined the EEC one of the good things I thought might come out of it would be that not merely would people with special interests get copies of the proposed legislation, or an outline of the proposals, but Deputies and Senators would get them too.  We would be all in on the act and thinking about it long ago before it came to this point.  We would have had an opportunity of discovering from our different contacts if this was a good idea, or what were the dangers in relation to it, and give a more considerable <Col N="1441" /> review, it might be said a less party-political view, about it.  That would then be the best view we could form in the light of affected interests.</P>
    <P>I am not threatening anything on Committee Stage, because at the end of the day I might find myself in agreement with all that is in the Bill.  I have not had a chance of doing any more than understanding what the proposals are, and reading through the sections.  I think more than that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and was pleased to note that there was general agreement with the objectives of the Bill which would put our plant breeders on equal footing with our counterparts in other UPOV countries.  Agriculture is much too important to allow any of our services to be put at a disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> our counterparts.  For too long now our plant breeders have not been able to enjoy the advantages afforded by this kind of legislation.  This Bill, when enacted, will provide reasonable protection for their rights in respect of any new plants they may create.  At the same time we will require them to maintain certain standards as regards quality and so on.</P>
      <P>Concerning Senator Butler's remarks about the dangers of monopolies, for years the only plant breeders here were in the public sector.  There have been some notable successes in breeding here in those years, and this legislation is essential if we are to afford our breeders the protection enjoyed by our counterparts in other countries.  We also expect an interest in commercial plant breeding when this legislation is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Butler also referred to the dangers of giving rights to varieties which might not be suitable for our country.  Breeders of such varieties could apply for rights here and could be given rights if&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;the variety met the requirements of being stable, uniform and distinct.  The breeder would then have to pay annual fees to maintain his rights here.  However the grant of rights here does not mean <Col N="1442" /> that we would recommend it.  This is also very important.  Even if it meets the requirements it would not necessarily have to be recommended.</P>
    <P>Our recommendations as to what are the best varieties to be grown here are given separately and are based on the results of trials carried out in this country by the Department.  For these trials the Department issue recommended lists of the more suitable varieties.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also mentioned monopolies.  Often, the strongest argument against monopolies is that the cost of the goods or services they supply are in excess where competition exists.  It could be argued that the existence of plant breeders' rights in other countries has meant that because of royalties there have been consequential increases in the price of seed.  We had to pay these even though we had not a plant breeding rights system.  The proposed legislation will not affect the royalty situation.  Most seed imported into Ireland is covered by plant breeders' rights and a significant amount is paid by farmers each year.</P>
    <P>This legislation will mean that Irish plant breeders will enjoy the same facilities as their counterparts in other countries, including the right to charge royalties and the right to secure them.</P>
    <P>I hoped we could get through this legislation today.</P>

It is extremely unlikely that we will hold it up but we may make points on it that may be useful to the Minister and his administration, which may be covered in an amending Bill or something of that kind.  The Bill has not been studied, should be studied, and will be studied.  It need not take too long either.  We can decide whatever time suits the Minister.</P>

      <P>Ar 12 Nollaig 1968, d'eisigh an tAire Oideachais, Brian Ó Luineacháin, TD, ráiteas ag foillsiú go raibh beartaithe ag an Rialtas institiúid den triú leibhéal a bhunú i Luimneach agus go mbeadh soláthar chaipitil ar fáil chuige sin.

    <P>Ceapadh stiúrthóir don institiúid agus chuaigh sé i mbun na hoibre ar 1 Eanair 1970.  Cheannaigh mo Roinnse an suíomh ag Plassey i Mi Feabhra 1970 agus bunaíodh Bord Pleanála sa mhí céanna.  Seisear a bhí ar an mbord taobh amuigh den stiúrthóir-chathaoirleach. Cuathas i mbun deisiú Teach Plassey i 1971 agus bhí an obair sin críochnaithe i 1972.  Tógadh roint foirgnimh réamhdhéanta freisin.  Tugadh cead an chéad grúpa den fhoireann teagaisc a cheapadh i Mí Meán Fómhair 1971 agus faomhadh na cúrsaí a bhí le cur ar siúl sa bhliain acadúil 1972-73.

      <Col N="1446" /> With the acceptance of the first group of 100 students in autumn 1972, the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, came into being with programmes leading to diploma and degree awards in administrative systems, business studies, electronic engineering, European studies and materials and industrial engineering.  The accommodation provided in Plassey House and prefabricated structures was quickly supplemented by the first phase of permanent building which, with the aid of a World Bank loan, was commenced in 1972 and completed by 1975.  This provided accommodation for 1,100 students in 18,500 sq. metres.</P>
    <P>The growth of the institute since 1972 can be gauged by the fact that in the current academic year, there are over 1,300 full-time students, and over 1,100 part-time students, following degree courses in business studies, administrative systems, European studies, regional studies, public administration, electronic eingineering, industrial and management mathematical science, materials and production engineering, energy technology and chemical technology with diploma courses in business studies, banking, European studies, industrial electronics, instrumentation and control, computer engineering, materials and production engineering and industrial design.  There is also a certificate level course in data processing as well as post-graduate courses leading to the award of master's degrees and doctorates.  There are over 100 post-graduate students in the institute in the current academic year.</P>

    <P>(i)  The National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick shall be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland, with the capacity to evolve into a constituent college of the National University of Ireland or to become an autonomous degree-awarding institution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> (ii)  The majority of the members of the Governing Body of the NIHE Limerick shall be nominated by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and shall include representatives from the trade unions, agriculture, business, industry and educational interests.</P>
    <P>(iii)  A Council for Technological Education shall be established to plan and co-ordinate courses and to validate and award non-degree third-level qualifications in the NIHE Limerick (and other institutions).</P>
    <P>(iv)  The National Institute for Higher Education Limerick shall be a designated institution for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(v)  The Governing Body of the NIHE Limerick shall consist of twenty-five members.</P>
    <P>On 5 March 1975 the Government approved a list of names of persons to be invited to act on the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  The first meeting of the Governing Body was held on 19 June 1975.</P>
    <P>The National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, was granted Recognised College status by the National University of Ireland in 1976, and the university was the degree-awarding authority for students of the institute who graduated in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>On 14 December 1976 the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, was designated by the Minister for Education as an institution of higher education for the purpose of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>That then was the position when I became Minister for Education.  One of my first actions as Minister for Education was to restore to the National Council for Educational Awards its degree awarding function.  I had discussions in the matter with UCG, which was the college dealing with the NIHE. <Col N="1448" /> Limerick, on behalf of the National University of Ireland, with representatives of the governing body of the NIHE and with the National Council for Educational Awards.  On 18 November 1977 I announced that the NCEA was to be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree level courses in the NIHE, Limerick, and also in the NIHE, Dublin, the Thomond College of Education and the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>As a result of my discussions with the bodies concerned, a smooth transfer of responsibility for degree awards from the National University of Ireland to the National Council for Educational Awards was achieved.  I want to put on the record of the House how grateful I was, and am, to the National University of Ireland and in particular to University College, Galway and University College, Cork which did some work also in this field, for making that transfer as smooth as it actually was.  The NCEA was the degree-awarding authority for the NIHE, Limerick, from 1978 onwards.</P>
    <P>I now propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill as it has been presented.  Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 establishes the institute which shall be known in the Irish language as An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard Oideachas, Luimneach, and in the English language as the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick. Section 3 defines what is meant by membership of the institute.  Section 4 provides for the functions of the institute. The functions are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide degree level courses, diploma level courses and certificate level courses and, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, such other courses, including postgraduate courses, as may seem appropriate to the governing body;</P>
    <P>(b)  to engage in research in such fields as the governing body may deem appropriate;</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultation with an tÚdarás&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> (i)  to buy and acquire lands or buildings,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to institute and, if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes and other awards;</P>
    <P>(d)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to maintain, manage, administer and invest all the money and assets of the institute;</P>
    <P>(e)  to accept from donors gifts of land or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donors: provided that nothing in any trust or condition is contrary to the provision of this Act;</P>
    <P>(f)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to further the objects and development of the institute.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 (2) the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may by order assign to the institute such additional functions as he thinks fit.  Section 5 provides for the establishment of a governing authority for the institute, to be known as the governing body, and prescribes its structure and functions.  More detailed provisions for the operation of the governing body are set out in the First Schedule.  The governing body is to consist of a chairman, the director and 23 ordinary members. The chairman and the 23 ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  The manner of appointment of the 23 ordinary members is set out in section 5 (4) and is as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  nine shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (5) which draws particular attention to the need for adequate representation of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions;</P>
    <P>(b)  three shall be appointed who shall be members of the academic <Col N="1450" /> staff of the institute who shall be chosen by the academic staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(c)  one shall be appointed who is a member of the non-academic staff of the institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(d)  two shall be appointed who are full-time students of the institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(e)  three shall be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of Thomond College of Education, Limerick;</P>
    <P>(f)  two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staff of regional technical colleges;</P>
    <P>(g)  two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the management boards of regional technical colleges; and</P>
    <P>(h)  one shall be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the functions of the governing body.  The governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the institute and shall perform all the functions conferred on the institute by this Act and shall have all such powers as may be necessary under this Act for this purpose.  The governing body may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks proper to assist it in such manner as the governing body shall direct and the governing body may assign to any committee so appointed such duties as it thinks fit.  The acts of any such committee shall be subject to confirmation by the governing body unless the governing body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a post of chief officer of the institute, to be known as the director.  The Second Schedule sets <Col N="1451" /> out the conditions governing the appointment of the director.  Section 8 provides for the establishment of an academic council for the institute and prescribes the functions of the council. The academic council act as specialist advisers to the governing body on academic matters.  Its functions relate to the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the institute.  The membership and terms of office of the academic council are determined by regulations made by the governing body.  Section 8 (3) lists particular functions of the council as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  to design, develop and implement appropriate programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(b)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement such programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(c)  to make recommendations to the governing body on programmes for the development of research;</P>
    <P>(d)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students;</P>
    <P>(e)  to make, subject to the approval of the governing body, and to implement the academic regulations of the institute;</P>
    <P>(f)  to propose to the governing body the form of regulations to be made by the governing body for the conduct of examinations and for the evaluation of academic progress;</P>
    <P>(g)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the award of fellowships, scholarships, bursaries, prizes or other awards;</P>
    <P>(h)  to make general arrangements for tutorial or other academic counselling;</P>
    <P>(i)  to exercise other functions, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, which may be delegated to it by the governing body; and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> (j)  to implement any regulations which may be made by the governing body concerning any of the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the governing body, the academic council may establish such and so many committees either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the institute as it thinks proper to assist the academic council in the performance of its functions and may determine the functions of any committee so established.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the staff serving in the <i>ad hoc</i> institute may be transferred to the service of the statutory body and protects the conditions of service, pay and pension rights of the transferred staff, which will not be any less favourable than the conditions they enjoyed while serving as members of the staff of the <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places responsibility on the institute to prepare and submit to the Minister as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, a pension scheme for staff.  All provisions of any pension scheme submitted by the institute will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  Every approved scheme will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires the governing body to submit to the Minister annually a report of the work of the institute.  The section also provides that the institute will give the Minister any information about its operation that he may require from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that in each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by the Higher Education Authority to the institute, out of moneys received by the Authority under section 12 (1) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, a grant or grants of such amount or amounts as the Authority think fit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> Section 14 requires the institute to keep accounts which must be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When received by the institute the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be submitted with the accounts to the Minister.  The Minister will lay the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the institute to charge fees for admission to courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event held by the institute or for admission to any event held at the institute. Section 16 is the usual provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the short title and the commencement date.</P>
    <P>I should like to record my appreciation of the great service rendered by the planning board in getting the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick off the ground and overseeing its development in the early years of its existence. I should also like to pay tribute to the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> governing body which has been responsible for the affairs of the institute since 1975 and whose term of office has been extended by me until the institute is established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government, announced by my predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in 1968, was a difficult one, but in hindsight the right one.  It must have been tempting to announce the establishment in Limerick of a university college, modelled closely on those that were well-established and well-respected in Dublin, Cork and Galway rather than the creation of a new, and, consequently, less understood concept.  The latter was the course, quite consciously taken, in the interests of the people of Limerick and, being a national institute, of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> It is satisfying, now in 1980, to see that the wisdom of the decision is evident; the graduates of NIHE are providing the country with a new range of expertise in disciplines ranging from microprocessor engineering to European studies, and while providing existing Irish enterprises with the expertise necessary for the microchip age, their very presence serves to attract a variety of new industries into this country.</P>
    <P>In many senses the need to make a new start in Limerick arose from our success in the sixties in stimulating economic growth.  At that time we succeeded in both reawakening Irish business and industry and attracting a considerable amount of foreign investment. Initially, and quite understandably, our development frequently depended on a large labour force eager for work, but for the most part neither highly skilled nor with a background in business or industry.  The dynamic growth of the sixties made it quite evident that we had in Ireland qualities which few abroad had previously attributed to us: we could achieve high levels of productivity and rapidly assimilate new knowledge and acquire new skills.  Those industrial organisations which came to Ireland in the sixties discovered many of our latent strengths and built upon them.  Initially, of course, much of the newly generated employment was not particularly sophisticated or intellectually demanding.  However, the sixties served to lay the foundation for a new era of development, which commenced in the seventies and is now under way in the eighties.  Ireland is no longer looked upon as a source of cheap unskilled labour, but as one of the special locations where the engineering, business and scientific expertise necessary for the sophistication of the microchip era is available.  As an indication of this, employment in the electronics industry in 1979 was double the 1973 level, and during the same period the value of electronic exports has grown from £38 million to £305 million. Already there are over 70 companies in the industry in Ireland, including 12 out of the top 100 US electronic firms.  This <Col N="1455" /> would have been inconceivable ten years ago, and impossible had we not taken the initiative in the late sixties to establish the regional technical colleges and to invest heavily in the major technological centre which has been created on the Limerick campus.</P>
    <P>Increasing numbers of our young people are now well equipped for challenging careers within their own country.  No longer must large numbers of our most talented youth go abroad for employment. The drain on our life-blood has been stopped: now our able young people make things happen here and industry is now coming to Ireland in order to avail of this talent.</P>
    <P>The NIHE, Limerick, Bill, 1980, is intended to make statutory a new and important component of the Irish higher-educational structure.  It is not intended that NIHE, Limerick, should be inferior, or indeed superior, to the established universities within the State; rather it is intended that its work should be complementary and its standing comparable. Other countries have found need to introduce similar new institutions as their economies develop, and indeed the parallel drawn with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by my predecessor when in 1968 he announced the decision to establish the institute still stands.  The country is at a stage of economic development where we need a full contribution both from the established universities and the new NIHEs in Limerick and Dublin, which will be established statutorily.  I will be coming before the House again with regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>The recently enacted legislation for the National Council for Educational Awards makes it clear that academic standards are set at levels comparable to those in the established universities, while any visitor to the Limerick campus leaves without any doubt that the facilities and equipment already provided compare favourably with the best found within this country or abroad.</P>
    <P>While equivalent in standard and <Col N="1456" /> standing to the established universities as a designated body under the HEA, the institute is expected to have a special relationship with the regional technical colleges.  Through interaction with the RTCs, and I want to emphasise this, and in conjunction with the NCEA, it is intended that programmes and regulations should be developed in a compatible way so as to ensure ready mobility of students in this case vertical mobility.  We shall have as an ambition horizontal mobility between universities and the disciplines in them and also the national institutes.</P>
    <P>The capital investment and resources necessary to achieve levels of excellence in any discipline of engineering or science are great.  However, optimum use of our available resources can only be achieved through close collaboration between the various institutions.  With careful planning it should be possible to facilitate a student with ability to progress within the State from one centre to another in order to specialise in his chosen field.</P>
    <P>In deciding that degree programmes operated at NIHE, Limerick, and accredited by the NCEA, should be both practically oriented and at the same time comparable in standard to those in the established universities, special constraints are placed on those planning and operating the programmes: not only must the programmes be career-orientated but they must also be academically rigorous. The two requirements are not, of course, mutually exclusive, but nevertheless special effort must be taken to ensure that the sensitive balance is achieved and maintained.</P>
    <P>While the institute was assisted by its own development consultants, and monitored by the extern examiners of the National Council for Education Awards, it was recognised that the success and the standing of the institute would ultimately be measured by the performance of its graduates.</P>
    <P>It is now widely known that NIHE, Limerick, graduates are eagerly sought out by employers, and many individuals&mdash;particularly in areas such as <Col N="1457" /> electronic engineering&mdash;choose from four to five attractive job offers even before they complete their courses.  As a result, each year 80 per cent of NIHE graduates go directly into Irish employment, while of the remainder some 15 per cent undertake research or further study and less than 5 per cent go abroad for employment.</P>
    <P>Not as widely known perhaps is the achievement of the smaller number of NIHE, Limerick graduates who have undertaken post graduate study abroad in a number of leading university centres. Perhaps the most vivid example is the success of European studies graduates at the College of Europe in Bruges, where over the last three years they have distinguished themselves.  In fact in 1979 an NIHE Limerick graduate took first place in a class of 130 postgraduate students drawn from leading educational centres throughout the European Community.</P>
    <P>Various approaches have been adopted to ensure that NIHE, Limerick, undertakes work which is relevant to the needs of the community at large. Perhaps the most successful of those has been the co-operative education programme whereby every national diploma and every degree student spends one or two six-month periods in employment off campus.</P>
    <P>The co-operative education programme introduced in Limerick is new to the country and is perhaps the single most important element of the innovation on the NIHE campus.  Quite obviously the students benefit from their practical experience and equally important perhaps is the fact that the faculty members of the institute have an opportunity while supervising students to visit and establish relationships with a wide range of Irish business, industrial, professional and State organisations. Through this interaction changes in the curriculum are brought about, the need to mount new programmes is identified and various consultancy and research projects are initiated.</P>
    <P>During the past year the institute's heavy involvement in the special manpower <Col N="1458" /> programme, designed to meet special manpower shortages, has led to a significant increase in enrolment, to a total of 2,462 students, of whom 1,302 are full-time.  While the existing facilities have been modified to some extent to cope with the increased numbers, I was pleased to announce recently that a major expansion is at an advanced planning stage.  When complete this will more than double the available capacity.  In the interim I know that various arrangements are being made to accommodate the increased enrolment planned for the forthcoming academic year.</P>
    <P>Because of its special mission the institute has focussed on the disciplines of engineering and business and in 1979 over 350 new full-time students entered the College of Engineering and Science, while over 280 entered the College of Business.  In terms of size alone the institute has therefore become the country's main source of engineering graduates and after UCD the country's largest source of business graduates.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to achieve a fully satisfactory result in relation to consideration of this Bill as I attach great importance for the future of Ireland to the development of technological education through the National Institutes of Higher Education and the regional technical colleges which will be closely associated with them.  I have given careful consideration to all recommendations and suggestions made to me since publication of the Bill with the result that a considerable number of amendments have been made on the Committee and Report Stages of its consideration by the Dáil.  This Act for the establishment of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, will serve as the model for the legislation in connection with the National Institute in Dublin and for Thomond College of Education.  Accordingly, I propose to introduce those two Bills immediately after the Summer Recess and anticipate a speedy passage through the Oireachtas for them.</P>
    <P>Molaim mar sin an Bille don tSeanad mar thógra a bhfuil lán-mhuinín agam as ó thaobh leas na tíre agus an oideachais.</P>
    <Col N="1459" />
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá i dtús báire go gcuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus a rá leis go bhfuil buíochas tuillte ag an Aire freisin, mar thug sé dúinn go soléir cúlra an scéil seo ó thúas go deireadh.</P>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has given a backround explanation to developments in Limerick since the beginning of the campaign to have a third level educational institute established in that part of the country.  The Minister is entitled to commendation for the way he presented the background.</P>
      <P>The movement began with a demand for a university to be established in Limerick, as the Minister has pointed out.  After some time the Government decided that backing would be given to the establishment of a third level educational institution there and by degrees and after much examination, a third level institution of the kind now operating in Limerick was the one that was favoured.  I want to say clearly that I believe it was a wise decision.  It had become obvious, and it has become much more obvious since, that there was a great need for more technical and technological advance in this country. Even yet we often see in the newspapers that people in industry, at FUE level and at the trade union level, constantly draw attention to the great need for skilled operators and for people with high technological expertise.</P>
      <P>If an institute of the kind under discussion today had not been established in Limerick that need would be even greater than it is.  All the indications are, as the Minister has pointed out and he has given figures in support of his claim, that the institute in Limerick will fill a gap and will provide workers of the kind that will be needed in increasing numbers because of the advances in science.  For that reason I think that decision was a wise one and I want to get that clearly stated at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point where people differed with regard to this new third level institution in Limerick is whether it should <Col N="1460" /> be under the aegis of the university system then in existence, or whether it should become complementary to the university system and develop in its own way.  People who held differing views held these views with sincerity.  Those who held that the institute should be under the aegis of the university probably believed that was necessary in order to give status to the Limerick institute, that because of the status already achieved by the universities the new institute, if it were to make any impact, would want to be linked as closely as possible with the existing university system.  That was the view held by those who advocated that line of approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of his first acts when he took up office was to ensure that the conferring of degrees or the awarding of degrees would be given over to the NCEA.  He made this decision early on assuming office and, again, I think it was the correct decision.  It was the wise decision to take at the time, and events since then have borne out that it was a wise decision.  I believe as time goes on it will be shown to have been a wise decision.</P>
    <P>The background to the whole question can be seen from the point of view that for too long education in this country at all levels was aimed, to too great an extent, at the academic level.  The vocational schools were regarded as the Cinderella of our whole educational system.  People were of opinion that children of ability, on leaving primary school should move towards a secondary school or into the academic stream, and they should avoid the technical school or the vocational school.  The attitude was that it was more or less an institution designed to cater for people of lesser ability, the sort of education not favoured by parents.  The whole emphasis was to get the cream of the school-going population moved towards the secondary stream, away from the vocational stream, on towards academic attainment rather than towards technical or technological attainment.</P>
    <P>It might be said that such a line of thinking and such a system of education <Col N="1461" /> was more suited to generations ago than it is now.  We need people of high technical skills and high technological expertise.  We must have people of that kind if we are to develop as an industrial people, if our standards of business, of marketing and so on are to keep abreast of countries with whom we must compete every day.  The work being done in the regional technical colleges is having its effect in helping us to turn out the type of people who are needed for industrial advance in the State.</P>
    <P>We started off with the vocational system which got under way 50 years ago but which was left for too long without a chance of developing and creating an impact on the educational system and providing the skills and training that our people needed.  Then the change came.  Now the role of the vocational school is appreciated to a much higher degree.  That was in part brought about by the development of the regional technical colleges which are doing the kind of work that was necessary and are turning out the kind of people who are needed.  The next step was the provision of an institute of the kind we are talking about in Limerick.  The figures given by the Minister about the numbers who have enrolled there, the constant growth in the number to date, also the wide range of courses offered to students there, and the obvious excellence that some of them have attained already, are very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Another point on which some people genuinely hold different points of view is the question of the independence of this institute in Limerick.  There are people who say that it should not be rigidly under the control of the Department of Education, that it should be, as far as possible, a wholly independent or autonomous body.  Different views are genuinely held with regard to that question. The maximum independence should be afforded to an institute of this kind.  I own up to having a strong belief that it is necessary that the people who provide the funds must ensure that an institute of this kind is doing what it was intended to do.  I do not think that the Minister <Col N="1462" /> would wish to wield undue or certainly a restrictive influence on an educational establishment of this kind but people who hold different views on this are entitled to express them.  The Minister has given an indication of the fact that he is prepared to listen to views by saying that he was in consultation with numbers of different people over a long period, that amendments were accepted in the Dáil and the Minister has invited amendments here too.  That is the right approach.  A development of this kind in this country is new.  Nobody can speak with great assurance on the assumption that he himself knows exactly what is the right way to run this place, what is the right system, what power the governing body should have, what types of vocations and interests should be represented on the governing body, whether the block grants system would not be the best way to run it, and so on.  There are different views held on matters like that by different people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today, and in the Dáil, that there were on the Continent institutes of this kind that were under close control by the government department responsible for education and that they were working successfully.  In some parts of the world it is held that if third level education is to develop in the way that it should develop it must be absolutely free from outside control.  It can be said that in certain parts of the world some governments make use of their power to see to it that the ideology which is held in favour in that State at the time is indoctrinated into the people at all levels of education.  I do not foresee something of that nature happening in this State in our time but it is the case that is made by people who claim that there should be maximum autonomy and independence in the running and governing of these third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I hope as time goes on and more funds become available that halls of residence will be provided at Limerick and, perhaps, at Glasnevin.  The ordeal that students have to go through when they come to enrol in universities in Dublin, Cork or Galway, looking for a place of <Col N="1463" /> residence or digs, is the next thing to a nightmare.  Provision should be made that would ensure that the institute in Limerick, as it develops, would go as far as possible to provide a hall of residence for these students to ensure that they do not have to endure the torture of going through the streets of Dublin and knocking on door after door in the hope that they can find accommodation.  They are told by people who provide accommodation for guests that, if they are university students, on no account will they be taken in.  That is happening with the result that students looking for accommodation are being driven further and further to the extremities of the city and away from the university centre.  The question of travelling in and out to lectures is becoming a serious matter for parents who have to provide the cash.  I would hope it is the intention of the Minister in time to ensure that residential accommodation will be provided in the institution in Limerick and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I want to make one last suggestion. Probably it will appeal to the Minister as much as it does to me but he is in a better position to have something done about it than I am.  Recently I saw the results of a survey of the numbers of people in different areas receiving third level education.  It was based on so many per 10,000 of the population.  I was sorry to see that Monaghan, part of the Minister's constituency, is down at the very bottom.  His county, and mine, County Cavan, are not too far up either. Indeed, this percentage of people from our end of the country who are availing of third level education is not as high as we would like it to be.  I hope that sometime the Minister will do something about setting up an institute at that level in our part of the world.</P>

I want to make a few points for the record which are important as far as I am concerned.  I must say I am surprised that during the debate on a Bill of such <Col N="1464" /> importance in the field of education there is such a very bad turnout in the House.

      <P>I suppose I should not but I feel strongly about it.  I will start by talking a little bit about the origin of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  The Minister in his wide-ranging opening speech mentioned the Government decision announced by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Lenihan, in 1968.  I am sure the House will forgive me if I go back a little further and recall an occasion when a previous Minister for Education, Mr. Donogh O'Malley, sent me, as chairman of the Regional and Technical College Steering Committee at the time, and another member, another Limerickman, Eamonn MacDermott, to Limerick to have discussions with the committee which at the time was pushing for a university in Limerick.  I make this point to the House because I want to stitch Donogh O'Malley's contribution into the record.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record the incident which I am now about to describe because it is an example of how long it takes to innovate, to get things changed, and the type of obstacles one comes up against.  I hope that today in 1980 the lesson of 1967 will be recalled.  We were sent down by Donogh O'Malley at that time to see if we could persuade the committee to shift away from their strategy of wanting to have a university in Limerick, and get them to accept a new type of institution which would be based more on providing applied courses in technology in the business area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien brought out this point.  He also said something which is very fair.  People are entitled to have different views, and hold those views sincerely. I accept that.  During that visit the committee were very slow to accept the <Col N="1465" /> notion of anything but a university.  &ldquo;We want a university for Limerick&rdquo; was their motto.  Even though we presented the scenario of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology model, which the Minister referred to in his speech, we were not able to get across to them. Eventually events marched forward.  The Regional and Technical College Steering Committee produced this report which led to the setting up of the nine regional and technical colleges and recommended in that report that a very special type of college should be set up in Limerick. This was required not only because of what was clear to those of us who were thinking at the time about future industrial growth, but also because the Commission on Higher Education had just produced a recommendation for a college which was to be known as a new college.  It was clear to us that a very special type of institution needed to be set up in Limerick.  The Steering Committee recommended that.  To ensure that a college of that kind would have the right status, built into the steering committee report was the recommendation that a National Council for Educational Awards be set up with a degree awarding function.</P>
    <P>This was a well thought out strategy and it was advocated strongly by the then steering committee.  We all know that events marched by.  We debated the NCEA Bill and it is now law.  When Donogh O'Malley died there was a certain sympathy with his views and, soon afterwards the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, announced that a new type of institute would be set up in Limerick.  We can all be proud today that that decision was taken.  What the institute is now contributing to society can be measured by some of the figures given by the Minister which show what the students have achieved, and by the influence the institute has on our industrial policy.</P>
    <P>One other person we should mention when we think of the origins of the institute, that is, the man who was Assistant Secretary in the Department of Education, and later Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, Mr. Seán <Col N="1466" /> O'Connor.  He had the vision to help to steer this new bucking bronco, this new rather strange animal, through the more traditional web of the educational system.  Tributes have been paid to him before.  I believe that the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick, is already making a tremendous impact in our society and will even make more in the future.  Therefore I would like to stitch into the record the contribution Seán O'Connor made not only in guiding the first steps of the institute in administrative terms, but also in the negotiations he conducted to obtain some of the funds which came from the World Bank.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, the National Council for Educational Awards and the regional technical colleges has already been referred to by the Minister.  It is a sensitive and key relationship.  I do not know how that relationship will evolve. Some people might say the National Institutes for Higher Education should be autonomous from the start and award their own degrees.  Others say the degree awards of the National Institutes of Higher Education should be awarded by the university system.</P>
    <P>As the person who was acting chairman of the National Council for Educational Awards when the Coalition Government took the decision to remove the degree awarding powers from that body, I should like to tell the House what a rough time that was for us to live through.  We had to steer the National Council for Educational Awards through a period when the Coalition Government made a fundamental basic error of judgment.  To my knowledge, a sub-committee of the Cabinet sat to consider educational policy and Senator Keating was a member of that committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Keating can confirm that.  A fundamental error was made which set back the development of <Col N="1467" /> technological education by some three years, and maybe more.  The fact that this Bill has arrived in this House in 1980 is due to that.  I am not making a political point.  I am making an educational point, a point about educational policy.  I know Senator Keating had certain views about the relative merits of the binary system of education and the more integrated comprehensive system of education.  I know he felt fairly strongly that any degrees to be awarded in Ireland should come from the same origin, which was the university system.  I do not know what his conviction is today.  He can make his own case.</P>

      <P>It was a great error.  It held up the development of education. Not only that but, on the facts given by the Minister about the way this institute has contributed to our development in economic and industrial terms, as well as educational terms, it may have contributed to slowing up our economic development.  When the Minister took office he immediately restored the degree awarding powers to the National Council for Educational Awards and we were in a position to get under way again.  In the meantime some institutions were delayed in running courses in which students expected to get degrees.  There was a state of chaos.  I have tremendous sympathy with the Minister on the difficult time he had in trying to sort it out.  It is very satisfying to know that the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick will now get its degrees from the National Council for Educational Awards when the two Bills are enacted. There are other institutions in the pipeline which will operate under the same scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for Educational Awards, which has no axe to grind in the sense that it is not providing courses or conducting academic programmes itself, is the ideal unit to take an objective view of standards.  Far from talking about the National Council for Educational <Col N="1468" /> Awards having a standard which is equivalent to university degrees, it should have an objective standard based on the best concepts of measurement systems in education.  To illustrate what I mean, as far as I know the National Council for Educational Awards is one of the few bodies to produce a document or a report which examines what constitutes the standard in a degree.  This document arose from a discussion that took place between the academics in the university system and outside of it who participate in the National Council for Educational Awards.  I have no great hangup about having equivalence with the universities in terms of standards and degrees.  I would hope&mdash;and we see the signs already&mdash;that the degrees that will be awarded under the umbrella of the NCEA will stand objectively as degrees against the standards and criteria objectively articulated by the council.  In other countries&mdash;for instance in Germany, where they have reviewed their educational system&mdash;they are finding that the traditional autonomous education units in the form of universities might not be the best for the needs of modern times.</P>
    <P>We have taken the right step here.  If things have to be changed in the future on the basis of our developing understanding of the situation, so be it.  In the meantime we can make progress.  I always felt when this discussion came up that any parents seeing one of their children emerging with a Ph.D from the National Institute of Higher Education, or from any other such institution, would be quite as happy about the standard of that Ph.D when they heard their friends calling their son or their daughter &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;. I saw that eventually that would be the proof of the pudding.</P>
    <P>The Minister has just informed us that there are some 100 post-graduate students working in NIHE at the moment and doing programmes.  I forecast that the Ph.Ds who will emerge from that system will have qualifications and standards of which we can all be proud. They will have qualifications and standards based on research work into the <Col N="1469" /> very area that is required for our national economic development.  They will not be doing Ph.D work on esoteric explorations around the corners of some molecular investigations for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us talk about the National Institutes of Higher Education. One of the aspects I am very interested in is the fact that they came up with a very clear strategy in their intentions from the beginning.  In those early days I noticed a certain cynicism when Dr. Edward Walsh published his strategy for an institute based on programmes aimed at the European dimension; cynicism I think is the best word.  He was clear in his strategy.  He knew the type of programme he felt was required for the needs of the emerging industrial nation. Events have proved him right, and the figures the Minister gave us are an indication of that.</P>
      <P>I believe from reports produced by the Confederation of Irish Industry recently that the export figure for the electronics industry will be of the order of £2,500 million in 1985.  It is running now, as the Minister said, at something like £305 million.  When you think that our export level at the moment is of the order of £5,000 million you see what we are talking about.  Dr. Walsh's strategy was right.  The employment in that industry is projected to be at a level of 30,000 by 1985. If a strategy was ever vindicated, that one was vindicated by the events of today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other dimension of the NIHE strategy is the one which relates to flexibility. <Col N="1470" /> The system is designed to enable, and where necessary encourage, students to avail of the possibility of vertical movement as well as&mdash;and hopefully there will be a lot more of this&mdash;horizontal movement from one institution to another, to the universities as well.  Some interesting experiments of this kind are already underway in terms of movement from institutions to the universities and <i>vice versa.</i>  The system is designed for flexibility.  It can cater for students who want to finish after one year, two years or three years, depending on (1) their motivation and (2) their capacity to absorb education at that level.  They can stop there and they will have a certificate or a diploma which is terminal as far as they are concerned.  They can walk in to any employer and say: &ldquo;I have a diploma from the National Council for Educational Awards based on a three-year programme, or whatever.  I did such and such and I am now interested in employment&rdquo;. The system is designed to deal with that and that is the way it ought to be.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it deals with the situation where somebody who was not really switched on in the second level of education, or was a late developer, in the third level system suddenly realises there is a possibility of making progress.  People may be more attracted to the method of the educational process in that system than in the second level and therefore lift their sights.  Rather than stopping them, the system promotes and selects, and leaves it to the student to switch on or switch off at a particular level in the educational system.  There are some of us today who are very glad that opportunity exists.  Some members of my family are going through that system and I find a complete switch on as opposed to what was happening at second level.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we are in a new era of development.  We are going from the era where the cheap unskilled labour was on offer to the incoming industrialist.  We are in the era of having dear skilled labour on offer.  Far from putting industrialists off, it is attracting them even <Col N="1471" /> more.  New industries are coming at the rate of something like 70 a year in this sector.  That puts tremendous demands on our system.  Again in the Confederation of Irish Industry report I see that the output at diploma and certificate levels of engineering technicians, running as it is at about 250, is about 100 short of what appears to be the going requirement.</P>
    <P>That is a problem but, at the same time, it is a tremendous opportunity.  It is an opportunity for us really to get that whole system working to bring individuals to a higher level of educational achievement and put them into very satisfying work in industry and, in the process, getting it across to the parents of Ireland that work in industry is a desirable, commendable career for both men and women and should be followed up.  We have a psychological barrier to get over.  The success of students going through this system, getting proper, satisfying jobs, will help to break that psychological barrier far more than the persuasion and the orations of public figures.  The next step was to try and have remedial effort to bridge that gap. The Minister has told us that under the influence of the new programme to deal with manpower shortages NIHE Limerick is now handling 2,462 students, of whom 1,300 odd are fulltime. There again is a justification for following that particular strategy.</P>
    <P>That brings us to NIHE Dublin.  We had the staff of NIHE Dublin in the Oireachtas last week giving us a presentation, showing what their plans were for the future, what their student intake was going to be, what their facilities were.  I look forward to the next phase of the development when the NIHE Dublin Bill comes in and we will see the sume successful performance from NIHE Dublin.</P>
    <P>The new institute in Dublin is not sufficient. We all know that some four regional technical colleges spread around the developing areas of the city will be required.  I am looking forward to a healthy network of education in the applied area of technology, of business and <Col N="1472" /> communications operating throughout Dublin, with NIHE Dublin as its peak and the regional technical colleges there side by side working in a collaborative stance&mdash;all under the umbrella of the National Council for Educational Awards.  This is a system of education which will challenge everything else that exists in Dublin.  Unfortunately, there are still some problems surrounding the position of the colleges of technology under the VEC system.  I hope these problems can be resolved.  I am certain that the existence of NIHE Dublin and four new RTCs will&mdash;as a new cuckoo in the nest&mdash;make a few of the recalcitrant individuals holding up progress in those areas move aside and learn from the success of the NIHE, Limerick, and the success of the nine RTCs already operating around the country.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to move steadily in that direction&mdash;the rest of the educational system will follow because it will have something to live up to.  There is nothing like competition to get performance.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom gur chaith mé an méid sin ama ag dul isteach ins an mBille ach thaitnigh sé liom a fheiceáil ar dtús gur oscail an Aire i nGaeilge, agus ta súil agam, cé go mbeidh an Institiúid um Ard Oideachas i Luimneach ag déileáil le bun-straitéis a mbaineann leis an Eorap, nach ndéanfaidh siad dearmad ar an Ghaeilge ins an coláiste sin.

      <P>Because this is a subject that relates to what I spent most of my life at, I am very interested in it.  I would like to go on for a long time, but I think we have agreed to stop at 3.30.  I saw a little while ago that Senator Whitaker was offering so I propose to be very brief and ask him not to go away because I am certainly not going to talk it out to 3.30.  I should also say at the beginning that for the next ten minutes I will be speaking my mind from this much up to now of my lifetime's experience with universities and with other aspects of further education.  I do not know if there is a party whip in the Labour Party and I do not know what he said, for now I am speaking my mind.  I hope I am not in too much conflict with my colleagues.  If I am, so be it.</P>
      <P>I want to disagree profoundly with the Minister and the last two speakers.  This is a fairly central issue.  I only want to touch on two topics, not to consider the Minister's speech in detail.  The first is the topic of how you manage the third level institution.  In other words, I want to talk about the governing body.  The other one is whether you should have a unified or a binary system of third level education.  The second one is the more important.  It is the question in regard to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> The first one is easily disposed of.  Universities have evolved a system which gives them a lot of independence, which I believe to be a good thing.  There is not enough of it and they are not quite democratic enough.  But they are very free, I am glad to say, from interferences from Government and, I am gladder to say, from interferences from the permanent staff of Government Departments and, more specifically, the Department of Education, because I believe Government institutions are not capable of making useful inputs into education except in a very general and regulatory role.  The history of efforts in this and other countries to run third level or other education in a &ldquo;status&rdquo; way is almost universally a history of disaster.  It is not to take away from my respect for the civil service at doing the things they are good at.  But having anything to do with the atmosphere that ought to prevail in first, second or third level education is so foreign to their ethos, it is a disaster.  One needs to look no further than straight out the window, because I am looking at the slates that cover what is currently, and has been for many decades, the National College of Art and Design.  If you want the catalogue of disaster, that is the place to look for it.  Thank God the universities are free.</P>
    <P>We see here&mdash;I am talking now about the governing body that is here being legislated for&mdash;25 people <i>in toto</i>, the chairman, the director and 23 others.  Of those 25, 24 shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  Then let us look at the mechanism; nine on the recommendation of the Minister, that is 36 per cent; two on the recommendation of the Minister from the teaching staff of the regional technical colleges, that is another 8 per cent; two on the recommendation of the Minister from the members of the management board of the regional technical colleges, that is another 8 per cent, making a total of 52 per cent, just over half, direct ministerial nominees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a proper interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1475" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister tell me, because in comparison to those nine plus two plus two, the members of the academic staff have three which is 12 per cent.  The non-academic staff have one which is 4 per cent and the students have 2 which is 8 per cent.  They are the total representation on the governing body from academic, non-academic and students, 24 per cent, and Minister's nominees 52 per cent, more than twice as many and an absolute majority.</P>
      <P>Well, dear me, academic freedom.  I have seen not just bad appointments made by this Government in terms of Ministerial decisions as to who goes on boards.  I have seen a marked deterioration. I have seen times when efforts were made to choose excellence and to distribute the things fairly.  I have seen appointments that are so shocking, of party hacks, that I worry for the whole fabric of our public life, particularly in the last half year.  This is a rotten way to run any institution when we have the model of the bits of democracy that exist in other third level institutions.  It is not serious, it is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British have got a binary system in third level.  They have university, technological, other third level non-university. They have an industry that is a disaster.  They have a trade union structure and a management structure which are disasters.  They have the most incredible classification in the work place with a rifeness of snobbery and an inability to communicate ideal leadership technology up and down in industry.  If we wanted a model of what not to do in our third level education, it is the British model.  We have heard stuff about MIT and it is a wonder I did not hear about Caltec and a few German high schools as well.  There are examples and different countries have different third level histories.  This is why the Minister's speech and Senator Noel Mulcahy's speech filled me with the gravest apprehension. I quote the Minister on page 17 of the circulated text where he says: &ldquo;I am particularly anxious to achieve a fully satisfactory result ... I attach <Col N="1476" /> great importance for the future of Ireland to the development of technological education&rdquo;.  There is education and it contains different portions and different specialists, but education is a unit as culture is a unit.  What this Bill does is to perpetuate a binary system which is a class system, which is a system received from Britain which is a stratified system, which is a hierarchical system, which is a pecking order system and which, by perpetuating two cultures, damages both, because there is not technological education in the world, there is education, and the sniggers of Senator Noel Mulcahy about the esoteric explorations in these, I take it, his reference is to molecular biology, show to me how little he understands the whole educational process and the connection between educational industrial&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say molecular biology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but I thought the Senator agreed when it was referred to.  Esoteric explorations are necessary to the educational process just as much as the totally applied aspects. They are a unity.  If you separate them and hold them apart, then you damage both.  Our need in Ireland is to unify our culture and to unify our structures.  The etymology of the word university means something and, hopefully, people with different traditions, with different attitudes, different subject matter in their daily expertise will rub off on each other and mutually benefit each other and mutually fertilise each other's minds so that we will get a total burgeoning culture.  The efforts to separate them mean class, stratification, and the withering of the different aspects.  On this one I believe the Minister is&mdash;and perhaps as a classicist he is entitled to the mistake&mdash;totally wrong, with the best will in the world.  The two previous speakers were gratefully acknowledging that people of different views could be sincere.  I have no problem with recognising the sincerity and the concern of the Minister.  I will close by saying on this <Col N="1477" /> one, which I know he cares about, I think he has got it totally wrong, damaging for the totality of Irish culture, damaging for technological education and because it damages the quality of our cultural life in general, it therefore damages our industrial development and the whole fabric of our society.  I believe it is wrong and I am sorry.  I am sorry also that I have not longer to go on talking about it but it is a fundamental issue.</P>

I thought the idea of two cultures was reasonably well discussed and understood in the matter of higher education, in the matter of culture in countries. If it is not, let my say what I mean, and talk about own cultural and educational <Col N="1478" /> developments in Ireland.  The universities ante-date modern industrial society and they bear the marks of their history on their structure.  Traditionally, they have given undue emphasis, certainly undue for contemporary society, to things like classics, philosophy and some of the other aspects of abstract knowledge. Once medicine graduated from barbers, surgeons and so on, they admitted it reluctantly, they admitted science reluctantly. The two cultures is a culture based on older society and older universities on the one hand centred around the classics in history and the study of languages, philosophy and theology, where it is considered important.  The other culture is the culture that is based on the industrial revolution which relates to all of technology, science&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that, because they have different historical origins, there is a great need in our society to see that they do not get separated and the two strands are not kept apart.  There are many countries that show further that they are being kept apart; secondly, that that keeping apart becomes institutionalised and, thirdly, that the keeping apart of what for example C.P. Snow has called the two cultures is very damaging for society, and indeed for its industry and its technology.</P>

      <P>There are realities and there are the perceptions of reality.  I believe that the reality of the tendencies for the cultural and the wider humanitarian streams to be separate long ante-dates Snow by hundreds of years and goes right back to the dawn of the industrial revolution.  It is a real danger of polarisation and harm in our society.  You might as well blame a man who describes the symptoms of a disease in a text book for causing the disease as blame Snow for a polarisation which is absolutely real, which is very dangerous, and was there hundreds of years before he described it.</P>

      <P>The tendency of the two cultures to be separate is particularly serious in this island because we did not have indigenous industry.  We had a tendency to copy Britain as a sense of our own inadequacy.  In the great days of the Queen and her ethos we had&mdash;and we still have the remnants of it&mdash;a most incredible snobbery and class approach to education.  There was a desire, naturally, on the part of tenants at will who became peasant proprietors after they had gone through the public health stage and got a few quid together. They wanted a doctor, a lawyer and a priest.  They did not want to acknowledge us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>For myself I do not mind it.  To say that the second arm does not exist as if we did not have engineering schools, as if we did not have schools of architecture, as if we did not have all the physical sciences, God help us, as if we did not have a management institute, as if we did not have schools for business in our universities. Of course no society can exist without the two strands and the two strands do exist.  The second strand, the scientific and technological strand, came into existence at the same time as that knowledge came into existence, which was in the last century and in the century before, so both of them exist and are inseparable from the existence of a functioning society.  We are not asking if they exist.  We are arguing.  I am vehement and no doubt the Minister will be vehement.  There is a real issue here separate from the vehemence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are arguing about is the best way to have really high standards, and creativity, and fully developed people, and industrial growth, the best way to find a place and respect for all the aspects of knowledge which are a part of culture.  We are trying to put together all the things that are done at third level with goodwill and as best we can.  I believe that a university is exceedingly valuable in its name.  It does not always function according to its name.  Places like MIT are in my definition, universities <Col N="1481" /> because of the way they have grown and diversified with all sorts of things that are a long way from technology.  MIT has become a university over the past century or so of its existence regardless of what it is called, regardless of its charter.  The point is that from esoteric explorations, which Senator Mulcahy does not like, to very, very applied and practical things, they ought to co-exist and the humanities and the scientists ought to co-exist.  Management and business ought to co-exist with the arts.  The Slade in London is part of the campus of University College London. That is not a bad place for an art school because I believe that these things belong together.  If you separate them you will get stratification.  The National Council for Educational Awards degrees are perfectly reasonable degrees.  If they are perfectly reasonable degrees, what is the need for another mechanism for awarding degrees?  What is the need for duplication?</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy says he likes competition and that such competition is good.  So do I, but you would think the different departments and the different universities did not compete.  Of course they compete.  You do not have to set up a totally parallel set of institutions just to guarantee competition.  As someone who spent his life in universities I know there is no place where competition is more intense than within universities and between universities.  You have it already.</P>
    <P>Since I have a little more time I want to go back on the question of the attitude to Limerick.  Listening to Senator Mulcahy it would appear that the Government, in their previous incarnation, were the friends of Limerick and that the National Coalition Government were the enemies of it.  It sounded that way.  I think anyone from the Limerick staff or the student body&mdash;they are all new now&mdash;would testify, for example, in my own case, to the number of times I was there compared to other universities in Ireland, and to the concern about success and growth, and the financial provisions, and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in regard to the staffing, <Col N="1482" /> or what was taught, or the student body, or the rest of it, that there would have been a pin of difference.  There was a very great difference in the degree awarding mechanism.  Therefore, there was a certain amount of confusion which people regret.  Those things happen when you change mechanisms.  To say that it set back technological education by three years, as Senator Mulcahy did in fact say, is humbug.  He does not understand the position.  In our time it may be that when we made it part of NUI we gave it a little more than it expected.  It may be that the argument could be sustained.  It is a vain sort of argument anyway.  I am not concerned with which is better.  I hope neither is better.  I am not making those comparisons.  Would it not be a good thing to have the best possible mechanism whereby cross-fertilisation could take place?  We could have an auction as to who cares more about that particular institute.  I do not think that would be particularly fruitful either.  I am happy that it is there and effective. The people I know on its staff are fine people.  I like its courses.  It is fulfilling a need.  I would argue that University College, Galway, under the leadership of Colm Ó hEocha and, indeed, of the president before him, is fulfilling that need very well in the Galway hinterland, under the umbrella of the structures of the university.</P>
    <P>It is the function of leadership and people as to whether you have good courses.  What I am begging for is that we do not have two cultures.  The Minister may sincerely believe that my saying there is that danger already increases the danger.  I do not think that is right.  The danger of that is very real in our world.  We have an under-estimation of the value of technology, and the value of overalls, and the value of manual skills.</P>

      <P>So do I.  I believe that one can find these things in our society and it is very serious.  The need to have a total and a balanced culture with the different parts inter-fertilising is very necessary.  It is very important to avoid class stratification as much for what happens on the factory floor as because of the intrinsic distastefullness of class stratification.  Some level of management is university degree, some level of management is NIHE degree and another level of management is something else and the trolls are on the ground, as in Britain where you have three or four discernable layers and the levels of communication up and down and the solidarity within that work area are very bad indeed.</P>

Of course they are not identical, it is not the same, but I see very strong analogies.  We have the possibility in a small country and a relatively new country such as Ireland to overcome the dangers, damages, polarisation of culture that we can see in other countries if we want to take a bold step to a unified system at third level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Seanad of 6th February, 1980, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Community Aid for Infrastructural Development in Ireland, which was laid before the Seanad on 11th June 1980 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in moving this motion on the report on Community aid for infrastructural development in Ireland which came from the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC.  I would like first of all to draw the attention of the House to the fact that two sub-committees of the Joint Committee were involved in the preparation of this report, one on the finance and commercial aspects which I have the privilege to chair, and the sub-committee on social affairs chaired by Senator Robinson.  I would like to acknowledge the input from that sub-committee.  The Joint Committee felt that it would be useful to put this report before the House to help to draw attention to the developing thinking in the EEC in relation to infrastructural development and particularly in relation to aspects of development that we normally think about in terms of the regional development fund.  Over a long period of time on many occasions Government representatives, indeed Members on both sides of the House, have expressed dissatisfaction with progress on regional development because of lack of funds from the EEC side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> This report describes what is happening now and what the intentions will be for the future and also indicates the alternative means of financing what we now know are the required infrastructural developments.  Here I am thinking in terms of transport and communications and other aspects of infrastructure which affect economic and social development in the various regions of this country.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee considered a memorandum which was sent by the Commission to the Council on 20 November on the role of the Community in the development of transport infrastructure as well as formal proposals by the Commission for new Council regulations relating to specific Community regional development projects and also projects in the field of transport infrastructure.  Senators have had the chance to have a look at the report and they can see that it is fairly complex and it needs a bit of reading.  It has a table of contents which we have not very often had with reports of this kind.  I prefer, as the debate goes on, to let Senators pick up aspects which they want to develop themselves.  I will highlight a few areas which I think are important.</P>
    <P>First of all there are the amendments which are to be introduced in relation to the regional fund as to the size of the fund to be determined annually.  There will be some changes in amounts and Ireland will do a little bit better out of it as a result.  Also one of the provisions is that the maximum rate of aid will be increased from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  Those were important changes. Another change which is of even more importance is that where in the past only infrastructures directly linked with the development of industrial handicraft or service activities could be aided, now under the amending regulation the definition of eligible infrastructure has been widened to include infrastructures which contribute to the development of the region or area in which they are located. That means it will no longer be necessary to establish direct industrial links in the case of the infrastructure involved and it can be looked at more as a <Col N="1486" /> broader regional development.  At the moment we are waiting for a definition of the infrastructural measures to which the fund may grant assistance and the next review of that is to be held on 1 January 1981.  Until such time as that happens there are some restrictions on the widening of the definition of eligible infrastructures.</P>
    <P>The report also outlines the difference between the quota and non-quota sections, and the non-quota sections are a very small proportion of the total.  On 18 October 1979 the Commission submitted to the Council proposals for regulations instituting five non-quota section measures.  These relate to five-year programmes from 1980 to 1985 and they refer to operations in different areas, France, UK and Italy, and in the case of Ireland it refers to an Irish border type proposal.  Sixteen million units of account are involved for Ireland and eight million for the North of Ireland. These cross-Border measures are extremely important.  The proposal is for the implementation of a special five-year programme and it will have as a subject the economic activities in the field of tourism, communications and artisan enterprises. From the report it can be seen that in Ireland on the Twenty-six County side it will cover Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and on the Six County side Londonderry, Strabane, Omagh, Fermanagh, Dungannon, Armagh, Newry and more and be financed jointly by the two countries.  There are some very interesting dimensions to this, such as construction and conversion of tourist accommodation, establishment of development bodies, carrying out special reports and so on.  I need not go down through them all but, as a cross-Border measure and as an indication of how it is possible for the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties to co-operate, it is very important.</P>
    <P>The other area of the report deals with in particular the old area of transport infrastructure. Basically the report indicates that the funds that are available for this in the regional development fund are not sufficient to meet what are <Col N="1487" /> known as links with peripheral regions&mdash;for example, links with the north, Dublin to Belfast and to Derry, and with the west, Dublin to Cork and to Galway.  These routes must be opened up to help the development of the EEC, not just Ireland, within the terms of the Treaty.  That brought us to examine the difficulties of financing these.  We looked at the old methods of financing and some new methods.  We looked at the European Investment Bank as a source. Loans from the European Investment Bank are disbursed in several currencies and the bank operate them on a profit basis.  The new financial investment which is known as the Ortoli Facility is also now available.  This facility is designed to provide loans for energy projects and also for infrastructural projects and a lot of money is involved.  The total facility is 1,000 million units of account on 14 May 1979.  Already the first 500 have been drawn down and 250 million European units of account are to be devoted to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The other method of funding arose out of Ireland's entry into the EMS, where the 3 per cent interest rate subsidy, the value of which is payable in cash, was set up.  For Ireland it involved £225 million each year for a five-year period.  It also involved £225 million, the same sum coincidentally, in the cash payment.  There are three ways&mdash;the European Investment Bank, the Ortoli Facility, and the interest rate subsidy&mdash;as alternative ways of getting funds to help an infrastructural development, as well as the normal one, the fourth, which is anything that comes directly from the regional development fund.  Paragraph 25 of the report indicates how loans and grants borrowed by Ireland under these schemes were in 1979.  The total comes to IR£226 million.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that these are available, but have we got the capacity to borrow this amount and should we be borrowing to that extent?  I am sure other Senators will want to elaborate on that aspect of it.  We would all love to be <Col N="1488" /> building more rail links along the west, opening up E-routes all over the country and increasing our communications channels; but every time we do it through a borrowing of this kind we are adding to our fund borrowing.  I am not enthusiastic about borrowing from the EEC; it is like borrowing from our own investors.  But that is another matter which I will leave to Senator Whitaker to elaborate on.  We felt as a result of a visit to Brussels when we conferred with the officials there, that maybe we in Ireland were not making the best use of the capacity of the regional fund.  When we examined this we found it not to be so, that all the funds available had been taken up and all projects required to get release of the funds had been put forward.</P>
    <P>We also examined the proposals by the Government for the new road plan. There was some doubt as to whether the rate of the development of the plan would be sufficient to meet the requirements for economic development.  We did come down on the side that, while it was good to see that there were alternative funding methods available to pay for these propects, we could indulge in them only to the extent that the national economy could take that level of borrowing.  We recognised finally that the fundamental objective of the EEC is to promote economic convergence by removing regional imbalances.  We recognised also that the regional development fund, as it stands, would hardly be capable of making a big inroad on that and that some access, as has been provided already, would have to be had to these methods of funding, but we would have to be careful about it.  We thought that it would be useful to get all of these facts down in one report to show what the alternatives were and to provide a basis for further discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report on Community aid for infrastructural development in Ireland.  I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The report relates to a very <Col N="1489" /> considerable extent to the issue of regional development and the European Regional Fund.  While this report is acceptable to us, and while the Joint Committee have done very useful work and spent many hours in developing it, there is much room for reservation in this country in so far as the European Economic Community regional policy and regional fund are concerned.  In the broadest terms, the Joint Committee recognise the deficiencies in the policy and seek a better fund in so far as this country is concerned.  Our entry into the EEC has been of tremendous benefit to this country, but I am attempting to put the regional fund into context.  It seems, from the perspective particularly of one who lives in the western part of this country, that one of the singular failures of the European Economic Community's policy has been in this area of the regional fund.  We have benefited immensely from European Economic Community membership.  We have benefited as an agricultural nation.  We have benefited in industrial terms.  We have benefited in terms of the social policy.  However, in attempting to relate Community policy to the individual rather than to the nation, there have been singular failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems in talking about the extent to which this country has benefited from the regional fund is that when one meets people from other countries involved in the Community and when one is critical about this issue, there is a tendency when talking to the British, French, Germans, Belgians, or Dutch, to have them say, &ldquo;You might not have benefited that much from the regional fund but you have benefited tremendously from the common agricultural policy and, as a consequence of that, you have benefited as a nation because the common agricultural policy is an instrument of regional policy&rdquo;.  The weakness in that is that, on any analysis of the common agricultural policy, grants have been given on a basis proportionate to output to a very large extent where in agricultural terms the share of output is by far the largest.  The <Col N="1490" /> Community have been supporting intensive areas, for example, in the area of the dairying sector, the south and the east.  I do not begrudge farmers in those regions what they are benefiting from it, but the statistics will tell us that by far the largest proportion of funding from the Community in the agricultural sector has been going into the richest grasslands of this country.  As I say, this is not in any way begrudging people in those regions the immense benefits they have got, but on a <i>per capita</i> basis any analysis of the input of EEC funds into this country has been very unsatisfactory in that a very small proportion of the population have had immense benefits on a <i>per capita</i> basis and very large numbers of people have had a minimal benefit in <i>per capita</i> terms.  This is the singular reason why EEC agricultural policy has been unsatisfactory and why, from a west of Ireland perspective, any suggestion by Europeans that the common agricultural policy is an instrument of regional policy and for that reason they should be happy is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>We see the extent to which our country has been benefiting from this regional fund.  In the referendum on the EEC some years ago we went around this country, especially in the western region, and suggested that it was very much to our benefit to join the EEC because for the first time ever the indigenous problems national Governments had had since the foundation of the State would no longer obtain.  Irrespective of the political complexion of Irish Governments there were indigenous problems about which we all know, such as poverty of our country, the limitations under which any Government had to support our people.  Here we had a Community articulating a policy which suggested a commitment by the centre of the region to the periphery and, as a consequence of this, immense benefits would flow into the periphery which would help to offset the indigenous disadvantages. Against the background of the promises of that time the lack of commitment by the larger nations in Europe subsequent to the oil crises of 1973 and 1974 and <Col N="1491" /> since then has been fairly dismal.  For that reason in any debate on an issue such as the regional fund we cannot be complacent and we cannot in a pat sense merely accept a report in vocational terms without being critical of the political issues involved in it.</P>
    <P>It is pleasant to be able to welcome the fact that infrastructure which until recently was directly linked only with development industry and handcrafts services, which arrangement was unduly restrictive, is being widened to include infrastructure which contributes to the development of a region or an area in which it is located.  Whereas the rate normally was a maximum of 30 per cent of the cost, this may amount to 40 per cent in the case of projects of particular importance to the development of a region, and this is also very important and significant.  Even though there is the commitment to this country for 1978-80, a three-year period benefit to the tune of £1,725 million which is more satisfactory than the previous three-year term, at the same time in 1979 the receipts in this country from the regional fund amounted to only £25 million which was 2½ per cent of the public capital programme.  I am speaking as a man from the west of Ireland, the region which I represented in Dáil Éireann and in which I live, about the indigenous problems that we have and the gross dissatisfaction there is in our community with the paucity of this amount against the background of the promises which were made and the immense wealth there is in the centre of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I want to give an indication of the extent of the poverty there still is in counties such as mine, or your own in Cavan, a Chathaoirleach, in relative terms.  We know that in relative terms we are better off than we were, but that is not necessarily any compliment to the EEC or to national Governments.  There are the indigenous problems, the infrastructural problems, the structural problems in terms of the sectors of employment, the huge numbers of people still engaged in what is called primary employment <Col N="1492" /> and the problems of creating employment in other sectors.</P>
    <P>In the west today, whilst we have been relatively successful in introducing jobs in multi-national companies, tourism, sea fishing and in other sectors, it is merely relative and there are still very serious problems.  I am provoked to tell of a conference I attended in Brittany some years ago of what were termed the periphery sections of the EEC.  It was a conference of sectors in the west and other regions of Ireland, the south-west of Britain, Scotland, sectors of Denmark, in Jutland, areas of France in Brittany and parts of Germany such as Schleswig-Holstein.  In the western counties in the broad sense, Donegal through Cavan, Monaghan down into Connaught, down into Cork and Kerry, we have statistically the highest proportion of people engaged in primary employment which is agriculture.  That in many cases means unemployment and unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, dole or whatever you want to describe it as.  At that conference of the infrastructural regions of the EEC there was a delegation from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany.  They made passionate speeches about the extent of their deprivation in an EEC context and in a German context.  Statistically the proportion of people in Schleswig-Holstein working in the primary sector was about 10 per cent and they held this forth as a statistic showing the level of deprivation and underdevelopment.  That puts in perspective the problems we have in the western region of this country.</P>
    <P>Involved in this is not simply an analysis of present policy by the Joint Committee, who are doing it according to their function, but a much broader consideration of the political issues involved in this and the original political commitment under the Treaty of Rome. We have to take great exception to the reluctance of the wealthier states in Europe to commit themselves to any policy that is relevant other than to pay it lip service, if they are being serious about it, in so far as the regional policy is concerned.  This view of mine was reinforced <Col N="1493" /> recently by something I foresaw two to three years ago.  We are now talking about the extension of the European Economic Community to contain Spain, Portugal and Greece and of course this is very welcome in political terms.  We are talking about three countries on the periphery of the Community which have had a weak democratic structure to say the least, which are ripe for communism and for influences which are undesirable to this Community, and the Community in their own self-interest apart from any benevolence, need these countries in to ensure an extension of the democratic boundaries of the Community.  Of course this creates enormous economic pressures because the admittance of Spain, Portugal and Greece, with their predominant agricultural economies and the weak infrastructures that exist there will present problems.  We have problems in our country but they are only half as bad as those in the three countries which I have cited, and these place immense economic pressures on the Community.</P>
    <P>We have made the case previously that whilst we in Ireland as a member of the Community welcome the admittance of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the broadest philosophical and political terms, we do it only on the undertaking from other countries in the Community that aid to Ireland will not be restricted as a result of the entry of these countries. It is very disheartening to note that the wealthier countries of the European Economic Community have in the broadest sense welcomed the entry of Spain, Portugal and Greece, but recently, when we are getting down to the nuts and bolts of the price that has to be paid for the admittance of these countries, there seems to be a terrific reluctance on the part of the wealthier countries of Europe to part with the funds involved in admitting thsese three countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transport infrastructure section of the report.  In relation to regional policy it points to the Community objective of counteracting the centralising forces of the EEC by distributing economic activities more equally through the entire territory of the <Col N="1494" /> Community.  It says that in the Committee's opinion it is essential for the success of this policy that the less favoured regions must have an internal network of communications appropriate to their present and future needs and also that they must be opened up and linked to the main centres of the Community by rapid modern routes to reduce as far as possible the handicap of distances.  I would welcome a commitment by the Minister and his Government to the well-articulated report from the west of Ireland commissioned by Bord Fáilte and Monsignor Horan of the Knock Shrine which called for the development of and support for an airport in the north-west of this country.  This report deals with links with peripheral regions&mdash;in Ireland, for example, links with the north, Dublin Belfast and Derry; with the west, Dublin, Cork, Galway.  If you talk about transport infrastructure here you find that County Mayo has the worst rail service in the country, bar none.  The standard on the train to Westport is appallingly bad. They have very good staff serving CIE on the route, but the infrastructure, the quality of carriages, the line and so on, are extremely shoddy and much less satisfactory than the links in this city with Cork, Limerick and Killarney. Recently I travelled by train to these three places and the trains were of a significantly better standard.  These are the kind of things that are practical and important.</P>
    <P>If we are trying to attract investment, it means people come in from other regions of the world taking a first look at certain parts of the country in which they may possibly invest funds.  If the arteries are not open, or if the infrastructure is extremely shoddy and unacceptable, these people are not going to invest. There is a blockage at point one. Air transport is very important.  I am glad to see this report talking about the supposed commitment within the Community to the subsidising of air transport.  The area covered by Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Donegal is the most neglected in the <Col N="1495" /> country.  In the south, Cork Airport provides the facility for major regions. Shannon Airport provides facilities for those in the Kerry, west Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare and Galway city, which is within 50 miles of Shannon Airport. But when you come north of Galway city, to east Galway, Mayo, Sligo Donegal, north Roscommon, Leitrim and Cavan, there is a tremendous lack of this basic facility in this modern age.  There has been an immense growth in manufacturing industry.  There is the tourist potential.  There is a certain type of tourist market to which other regions have access because charter flights can come into their regions.  We miss out on these completely because we do not have an airport.</P>
    <P>In the broadest terms there is a very strong case to be made in support of a recent survey commissioned by Monsignor Horan and by Bord Fáilte to suggest that there is an necessity for an airfield.  It does not have to be of international proportions, such as Shannon or Cork Airport.  If it had a sufficiently long runway, equipped for night flying, when necessary, and could facilitate charter flights of a certain size, this would suffice for the time being.  I support this completely and suggest that the Minister convey to his Government the need for national support for this project and, through the suggestions of this Joint Committee and through the supposed commitment by the Community in the transport infrastructure area, that they seek Community support by way of grants and loans for the development of this transport facility for my part of the country which has been neglected and which badly needs an airport.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the extent to which we benefited from the Ortoli Facility, which relates to energy projects.  I noted recently that Bord na Móna benefited significantly from loans from this facility.  In the light of the recent commitment by the Minister for Energy in this area, I hope this will be extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>This country's share of the non-quota <Col N="1496" /> sector represents about 5 per cent of the commitment.  In the quota section there is a bit of horse-trading and various nations, members of the Community, look for a trade-off.  In the non-quota area we are talking about that section of the fund which the Community can in a global sense dispense as they see fit, in conformity with the regional fund commitment and independent of the horse-trading area.</P>
    <P>The west, including Donegal, represents the poorest part of the entire Community, with the single exception of the Mezzogiorno in Italy.  From the non-quota section, only 5 per cent is coming into this country.  This is unsatisfactory and is not acceptable.  While I welcome the cross-Border note in the report and the commitment of the Community in the non-quota sector to the funding and to the grant-aiding of joint Border activities by us and by the authorities in Northern Ireland, I would welcome some type of commitment in the non-quota sector also to the western counties. Statistically, we have these problems.  I would welcome if the Community would look at the west of Ireland as one of the poorest sections, in addition to looking at the cross-Border areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise mainly in response to Senator Mulcahy's invitation to me to put him right about borrowing from the EEC.  Before I try to do that, might I express gratitude to the Joint Committee and to the two sub-committees for providing us with such a useful survey of the position regarding Community aid for infrastructural projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, if I could, to dispel Senator Mulcahy's notion that borrowing from the Community is just the same as borrowing at home.  That would be so if we had arrived at the ultimate goal of a monetary union in the Community, but we are very far from that goal at present. We are all individual member states trying to manage our own economies, our own currencies and, in particular, trying hard to keep our exchange rates at some fixed relationship to one another.  The fact that those exchange rates are not <Col N="1497" /> irrevocably fixed forever, as they would be in a monetary union, exposes us to the same risk when we borrow in deutschemarks or guilders as when we borrow in yen or US dollars.</P>
    <P>There is no distinction whatever at present in the implications for the community here of borrowing in an EEC currency as distinct from an non-EEC foreign currency.  In both cases the burden of transferring the interest and repayment charges is a real burden on our current production.  It is a burden which, I think, already amounts to about 1 per cent of GNP, and which is rising fast.  It would rise very fast if we continued to incur foreign borrowings at the pace of 1979.  The distinction between the real burden of transferring our resources out to foreigners in payment of interest and repayment of capital on an external borrowing and domestic borrowing is that in a real sense the domestic borrowing involves, as far as the interest and repayment are concerned, merely a redistribution within the domestic community.  I hope I have made it clear that domestic borrowing is quite distinct from foreign borrowing of all kinds, whether the foreign borrowing be from Community sources or non-Community sources.</P>
    <P>As I am talking about borrowing perhaps I might say that Community borrowing, as we have seen from today's announcement, usually takes place of our own volition in the currency which offers the lowest interest rate terms.  When I was speaking on the Finance Bill I used the example of deutschemark borrowing to compare the effective cost, if there is a devaluation of our currency in relation to the deutschemark, with the cost of raising money at home.  Senator Mulcahy rather chided me for choosing what he thought was perhaps the best case to make my argument, asking why did I not take guilders instead.  I could have taken guilders but I took deutschemarks because that is what the Government were taking.  The Government wanted deutschemarks for very obvious <Col N="1498" /> reasons&mdash;the rate of inflation, and consequently the rate of interest, in deutschemarks is the lowest in the Community. If one went to guilders what would one find?  One finds that because the rate of inflation is higher the rate of interest is higher there; several points higher than for deutschemarks.  One would just have to change the arithmetic slightly, but the end result would be the same.  I do not think there is any escape. I hope I have not entirely destroyed Senator Mulcahy's belief in the merits of EEC monetary systems which I share.  That is my immediate contribution to the question he tossed in my direction a few moments ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim) Thomas (Jnr.) McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. McEllistrim)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Joint Committee on this excellent and comprehensive report. The committee's examination of the operation of the European Regional Development Fund is particularly timely in view of the forthcoming second review by the Community of the regional fund regulation.</P>
      <P>The report, of course, goes far beyond an examination merely of the regional fund.  As the report states in paragraph 2 &ldquo;to get an overall picture of the part played by the Community in investment in infrastructure it is necessary to have regard...to the other Community instruments which can be used to further the development of infrastructure&rdquo;.  I fully subscribe to this view, as it is only through a fully integrated use of the various financial instruments that the role of the Community in regard to infrastructural development can be maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the regional fund before dealing with these other instruments.  The report deals with the role of the fund in assisting infrastructural development in a very comprehensive way and I do not wish to repeat what is already in the report.  I would like, however, in particular to welcome the Joint Committee's view, in paragraph 29, that the fund should assist <Col N="1499" /> the development of social infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, technical colleges and so on.  As the report states in paragraph 8, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission transmitted after consulting the Regional Policy Committee, is to define the infrastructure measures to which the fund may grant assistance.  I can now inform the House that the Commission is at present consulting the Regional Policy Committee on this matter with a view to obtaining an early Council decision on the lists of eligible infrastructure.  While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on discussions taking place within the Regional Policy Committee, I can say that I am hopeful that a fairly broad definition of eligible infrastructure will emerge, at least as far as the priority regions of the Community are concerned. In these regions, which are underdeveloped by comparison with other areas of the Community, the provision of social infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, technical colleges and so on, can be as essential a prerequisite for the attraction of industry as can be roads and telephones.  It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that the regional fund should assist the provision of such infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Of course it is true to say that even should the Council agree to such an interpretation of eligible infrastructure, the major limitation as to the effectiveness of the regional fund continues to be the size of the fund.  The fund as it was established for the initial period 1975-1977 was a disappointment amounting to only about half the original figure proposed by the Commission.  While the size of the fund for the current three-year period 1978-80 has been significantly increased, probably to IR£1,825 million&mdash;following a further increase recently proposed by the European Parliament&mdash;by comparison with the original endowment of IR£531 million, it remains inadequate as evidenced by the McDougall Report.</P>
    <P>This problem is further compounded by the fact that the fund operates over such a wide area, about half of the <Col N="1500" /> territory of the Community, embracing more than one-third of its population.  I note that the Joint Committee consider it to be essential that the resources of the fund should be concentrated far more &ldquo;on the more needy areas of the Community&rdquo;, a view which I would heartily endorse and which I feel will become all the more urgent with the prospective enlargement of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is hardly surprising then that the fund has done little to reduce disparities within the Community.  Our receipts from the fund, which as the House is aware, are used to increase the allocations for capital investment through the Public Capital Programme, have been fairly modest by comparison with national expenditure on the programme. In 1979, total receipts from the fund amounted to IR£25.55 million or 2.6 per cent of total expenditure on the PCP.  A more detailed examination as to how these receipts were utilised will show that the fund financed about 4 per cent of total expenditure on industrial promotion. On the infrastructure side its contribution to those programmes assisted by it amounted to about 7 per cent. However, this excludes a whole range of programmes not assisted at all by the fund.  As I have already indicated, when the whole PCP is considered the fund's overall contribution was 2.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House, however, that recent discussions have taken place at official level with the Commission aimed at speeding up the flow of fund receipts, that is to say the conversion of fund commitments into actual payment of aid. As a result of the accelerated payment provision of the amended fund regulation, the increase in the size of the fund and finally these recent discussions to which I have referred, it is estimated that our 1980 receipts will amount to IR£47 million or 4 per cent of the PCP.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree, however, with the joint committee's conclusion, at paragraph 41, that the fund cannot &ldquo;play a significant role unless the grant aid... is considerably increased&rdquo;.  In this connection it is worthwhile recalling that the European Parliament has played <Col N="1501" /> an important role in securing significant increases in the fund both in 1979 and again this year.  This has been possible because of the provision in the amended fund regulation that the size of the fund is now determined as part of the annual budgetary procedure of the Community which, as the House is aware, involves both the Council and the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must refer to the joint committee's criticism, in paragraph 31, concerning the method of administering the fund.  I must confess to having some sympathy for the view put forward that the present system involves an unnecessary amount of bureaucratic activity. This is because the regional fund is based entirely on an individual project approach.  Prior to the last review of the fund regulation we suggested that a programme approach would be a better one.  This would be consistent with the proper role of the fund which is to support the regional policy measures taken by the member states.  In the event our suggestion was not taken up.</P>
    <P>However, the regulation is again to be reviewed by 1 January 1981 by the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission.  While the Commission has not yet submitted its proposals I can say that it has indicated that it is examining the possibility of introducing the technique of financing programme agreements in place of the current method of financing individual projects.  While our attitude cannot be determined until such time as the details of the Commission's proposals are published, I would favour the proposal, in principle, as it can only improve the administration of the fund.  I am glad that the joint committee would also support in principle such a reform.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am guardedly optimistic that a number of the recommendations in this report concerning the reform of the regional fund will be carried out. Here I have in mind the widening of the definition of eligible infrastructure to include social infrastructure and the introduction of a system of funding based on specific and precise programmes.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1502" /> I am less than optimistic regarding the major recommendation of the report which concerns the provision of adequate resources for the fund.  Obviously this is an aim which I shall be pursuing but I feel, like the committee, that this will only be achieved by concentrating the resources of the fund in the areas of greatest need in the community. It remains to be seen whether the Commission's proposals will initiate such a radical reform.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the regional fund, I should perhaps say a few words about the new non-quota section.  Discussions on the draft regulations instituting five non-quota section measures submitted to the Council by the Commission, have been in progress for some time.  One of these measures is intended to contribute to the improvement of the economic and social situation of the Border areas of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Adoption of the draft regulations was delayed because of the wider problem of the British contribution to the Community budget.  Now that a solution to this problem has been found, I am hopeful that the draft regulations will be adopted without further delay.</P>
    <P>A special programme implementing the special Community measure in the Border areas is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department and will be submitted to the Commission as soon as the regulations are adopted by the Council.  While the resources of the non-quota section are extremely modest, the allocation to this country for the border programme amount to about IR£10.7 million over five years, the total cost of the programme being about IR£30 million.  Nevertheless, it does demonstrate Community concern for these areas which are amongst the most severely deprived in the Community, particularly when viewed in the context of other Community measures, for example, the cross-Border drainage measure approved by the Council in February 1979.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to other aspects of the report concerning other Community <Col N="1503" /> aid for infrastructural development.  Of particular significance to the financing of capital investment through the Public Capital Programme are the Community's loan facilities.  The report is again very comprehensive on this matter. However, I might point out in this context that the introduction of EMS subsidies and the New Community Instrument or Ortoli Facility in 1979 resulted in a three-fold increase in our borrowing through the European Investment Bank as compared with 1978 when borrowing through the bank amounted to IR£78.5 million.</P>
    <P>The report contains a useful breakdown of our 1979 borrowing under the Community loan instruments, paragraph 25.  Senators may be interested in hearing that the sectoral breakdown of this borrowing was as follows: Infrastructure, IR£139.3 million; Energy, IR£69.3 million; Industry, IR£17.5 million; Total, IR£226.1 million.</P>
    <P>While these Community loans are more significant in financing capital investment than the regional fund, nevertheless as the report quite rightly points out recourse to loan facilities depends on our ability to service an ever-increasing public debt.  Obviously grant aid is very much more attractive than loan finance which has to be repaid.</P>
    <P>At present, however, availing of the Community's loan facilities has the added attraction of the subsidy arrangements made as part of our entry into the European Monetary System.  As these subsidies are paid in capitalised form, availing of these loan facilities results in our attracting the subsidies in the form of a grant.  As the report points out, this subsidy amounts to a grant of about IR£45 million each year for a five year period.  In 1979, we were able to secure our full EMS capitalised interest subsidy with subsidised borrowings from the EIB and Ortoli Facility of IR£172.6 million.  I might also mention here that we have already secured also 50 per cent of our 1980 subsidies.</P>
    <P>Thus in 1979 the EMS capitalised subsidies of IR£45 million were 76 per <Col N="1504" /> cent greater than our receipts of IR£25.55 million from the regional fund. Together this grant aid amounted to about 7 per cent of expenditure on the Public Capital Programme.  This year the EMS subsidies which will be about the same as our estimated receipts from the fund.  Together they are expected to account for about 8 per cent of estimated expenditure on the PCP.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Joint Committee's view, paragraph 34, regarding the necessity for further Community measures designed specifically to meet the requirements of infrastructure policy must be considered.  I can only endorse this.  It will become all the more essential if the size of the regional fund is not increased to a level commensurate with the tasks it was set up to accomplish. In this context the Commission's discussion document on the role of the Community in the development of transport infrastructure is obviously of great interest.  The Joint Committee's interest in the document and in other Commission proposals in the area of transport infrastructure is apparent from the report.  Of particular interest, of course, is the draft regulation for aid to projects of Community interest in the field of transport infrastructure submitted to the Council by the Commission in July 1976, paragraph 20.</P>
    <P>When this regulation was considered by the Council of Transport Ministers in November 1978 the Commission was requested to prepare by 1 January, 1980 a document on the main bottlenecks in transport infrastructure in the Community. This &ldquo;bottlenecks&rdquo; document has not so far been published and until it has been published and examined it is difficult to form a view as to the scope of the draft regulation, the kinds of projects to be eligible, the financial arrangements to apply and so on.  I am sure that the house will share my concern that any aid to be made available under this scheme should not be confined to major infrastructure undertakings such as the proposed Channel link but should also assist the development of transport infrastructure in less developed areas.  I <Col N="1505" /> might mention also that the Council of Transport Ministers has been meeting in Luxembourg this week and I would hope that some further progress will result from their discussion.  I note that the Joint Committee believe, paragraph 35, that it may be in this country's interest to support the adoption by the Council of the proposed regulation.  I hope that when the Commission's intentions regarding the application of the regulation are spelled out more clearly it will be of interest to us and that our Road Development Plan for the 1980s for example will be eligible for aid.  However, as I have said we are not yet in a position to arrive at a firm view.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by once again congratulating the Joint Committee on this report and for the excellent work carried out by its sub-committees under the chairmanship of Senator Mulcahy and Senator Robinson.  The report will be of interest to all of us who are concerned with economic and social development in this country and the Joint Committee's recommendations will support our case for seeking Community aid for the improvement of our infrastructure which is a prerequisite for such development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my praise to the praise of others in regard to this Committee.  Committees of the Oireachtas are working well.  During the years we argued that that was the way we should develop.  With this Committee dealing with the secondary legislation of the Community and, might I add, one Committee of which I am an interested member, the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, new directions are being explored and very useful material is coming out.  Certainly from this Committee we get a large amount of material and it is excellent.  Clearly, in addition to the general guiding hand of Senator FitzGerald and the subcommittee guidance of Senators Mulcahy and Robinson, there must be a first class back-up staff.  The documents show that the input from the back-up staff <Col N="1506" /> is really good.  Having said these words of praise I would urge that in addition to the table of contents, which is useful in this report, some sort of precis or setting out should be considered.  Whoever does the drafting should give more attention to the readability of the excellent material and I think the presentation could be slightly improved.  I only say that because the material in it is so good.</P>
      <P>About the contents, perhaps I will say the kind things first.  The modifications of the fund set out in amendments to the regional fund in page 2 paragraph (4), are all in the right direction and nobody could object to them.  They are welcome obviously.  Far beyond the commitment of resources, the development across borders is welcome.  In many ways, and I am going to go on doing so later on in my speech, I am a fairly bitter critic of the Community but the recognition that areas have to be planned regardless of where borders either historically evolved or imposed borders, may happen to be is a great recognition.  What the Community is doing in this area is very worthwhile and in Ireland's case it is a unifying thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the recognition of the need to plan transport at Community level is absolutely right and wise.  I refer, for example, to page 23 where it is stated, &ldquo;the Committee supports the Commission's view that the aims of a common transport policy calls for direct Community involvement&rdquo;.  I think that is right.  It is inescapably true and it is important to say, because the danger for us as we get into the EMS, as we get free movement of goods, capital and labour, is that the inequality in development becomes exacerbated and the places that are already rich and developed take over certain functions from us.  We can only have a fair and balanced transport system on the basis of planning at Community level because the truth about what happens inside a market economy, which is a euphemism for inside capitalism, is that in the absence of very powerful planning instruments in central policy the tendency to inequality is what dominates.  That tendency to inequality <Col N="1507" /> is seen in the Community because in the years since we joined it, income levels have diverged not converged.  The observations on transport policy are right and welcome.</P>
    <P>Similarly in regard to the Ortoli Facility, there is the inclusion of energy. I will just make this one point.  We are at the beginning of having an energy policy in Ireland&mdash;long overdue but welcome nonetheless.  We have had disadvantages in the past but if you take the west, the disadvantaged place that Senator Staunton was talking about, there may be oil in the sea&mdash;my own conviction for some time which I have put on the record elsewhere is that there is oil there&mdash;but there is also a lot of marginal land which is useful for the production of biomass. There is also the incoming ocean current from which one can obtain both tidal and wave energy and paralleling the ocean currents there are the strong incoming winds on the west coast.  So you have the possibility of wind power, tidal power, biomass power and wave power all in what is traditionally a disadvantaged area.  Bringing together the Ortoli tranche, the Ortoli Facility moneys to which we will have to contribute ourselves, that interesting situation is very well worth looking at from an energy point of view.  Those are the positive things.</P>
    <P>However, there is one sentence with which I have to disagree sharply.  On page 22, paragraph 41, entitled &ldquo;Conclusions of the Joint Committee&rdquo;, the opening sentence is as follows:</P>
    <P>One of the fundamental objectives of the EEC is to promote economic convergence by removing regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>It is not so.  It is naive, with respect to all the eminent people involved in this committee, to simply say of the EEC &ldquo;One of the fundamental objectives of the European Economic Community is to promote economic convergence&rdquo;.  It is not.  What we see is economic divergence.  It is a professed objective but it is not a practised objective.  When you profess something for a long time and do <Col N="1508" /> not practise it you simply indict yourself of hypocrisy.  This is what I believe the Community is doing in regard to regional policy.</P>
    <P>Let us quantify it a little.  I refer here to page 15, paragraph 30, and to the amounts of money mentioned.  If we are concerned with ending regional imbalances we are concerned with wealth transfers across national boundaries. The total fund over three years is £1,725 million.  Let us annualise it at a flat rate. It comes to £575 million a year.  Then you apply Ireland's tranche to that, which is something over 6 per cent, and you get something over £37 million a year for Ireland.  The receipts in 1979 were less than that: they were £25 million. It is not all transfer because each country contributes to the Community roughly in proportion to somewhere between its Community share of imports and its Community share of GNP so you must subtract something.  Let us say we take that net £25 million and let us be kind and subtract only £3 million or £4 million.  That brings it down to £22 million&mdash;net receipts of £22 million in 1979.  Compared to the public capital programme it is 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>That 2.5 per cent is small but you can still see it.  I ask why compare it to the public capital programme?  That is where the money is spent but £1 equals another £1 in the total budget-making and if you cannot spend it one place you can spend it another place or if it is spared one place you can use it in another place.  The significant thing to do is to ask how big is that wealth transfer, that real wealth transfer of about £22 million under the regional fund in 1979, in relation to gross national product?  It is of the order of a quarter of 1 per cent.  One quarter of 1 per cent is so trivial in relation to the economic activities of a nation that all you can truthfully say about the regional fund is that it is window-dressing and that it is not even in the ball park of making a significant contribution to wealth transfer.</P>
    <P>In 1972 we had a referendum.  We were all told, and I was interested to <Col N="1509" /> hear Senator Staunton on the other side of the argument say so, about the great central commitment to equalise inequalities, that there was going to be tremendous wealth transfer across the national boundaries.  Yet, here we are seven years later and the divergence in income in the Community nation to nation is greater than it was then and the lip-service to convergence is still peddled but we are too old to go on believing it. When the scale of the wealth transfer is a quarter of 1 per cent of GNP then that is humbug, that is hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Much as I am interested in the detail of what you spend it on and in the reforms of the fund, I think the clear message from this admirable study has to be to the richer countries of the Community. We should tell them &ldquo;That was humbug, you conned us and now if you are serious you have to have a regional fund on a quite different scale&rdquo;.  It is not a matter of increases of a few per cent because look what is happening.  Inflation is raging on and the incoming people, the Spaniards, Portuguese and Greeks all have desperate regional problems.  In that context this sort of fund is simply not serious.</P>
    <P>I applaud the reference to inadequacy. I was interested to hear the Minister put his formal <i>imprimatur</i> on the statement deploring the inadequacy of the regional fund but there are inadequacies and inadequacies, and this is so inadequate in my view as to be offensive.  It is so inadequate in the light of the past representations, particularly at the time of Ireland's accession negotiations, as to lay the richer, old original six member nations, who are now the richer core of the Community, open to very serious misrepresentations. When we see the sort of increases that are now discussed for the next three years, when we see the expansion on the horizon and when we see the rates of inflation, it seems to get to the stage of bad faith.  I have no pleasure in saying those things.  I would like to be wrong about the regional fund.  I would like to see it real because it is desperately <Col N="1510" /> needed but at the moment it is window dressing without substance.</P>

      <P>To argue as Senator Keating has done, that the sole measurement of the advantages to this country of membership of the European Community is to be found in the scale of the regional fund, is to apply what Senator Keating must know is a totally false test.</P>

      <P>It is quite reconcilable with my position as chairman of the Joint Committee that I should sign a document which contains as it does complaints about the inadequacies of the regional fund and inadequacies of the organisation of the existing transport provisions and generally about the need for investment in the infrastructure of this country and, at the same time, hold the view which I do, which is that Senator Keating is wrong if he tries to imply that in relation to the benefits this country gained through membership of the Community that the six countries with whom this country entered its treaty acted in bad faith, if I understood the word that Senator Keating applied to them.</P>
      <P>Senator Keating does not need an economic lecture from me and it is well that he does not because I could not give it to him in the few minutes that I have but he will well know from his knowledge of the history of these matters that the Community decided to have as its task the establishment of:</P>
      <P>a common market that is progressively approximating the economic policies of member states to promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the states belong to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quoting the 1957 treaty which I got from the Library after Senator Keating's <Col N="1511" /> last few remarks.  In the protocol to the Treaty the objective of the Irish Government was recognised.  The objective was a policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland to that of the other European nations, to eliminate unemployment while progressively to even out regional differences in levels of development.  All I am concerned to say is simply that there is a treaty structure, there are juristic provisions entitling us, we have rights in this matter.  We have, in fact, benefited.  It is most unfortunate that Senator Keating did not clip off the last three or four sentences of his contribution and let it stand as it was.  If he wishes directly to attack the EEC and all about it, splendid, at least we will know what he is doing. But to get up and to welcome what we have done and to come in with the voice of Jacob and the hand of Esau, is not the way he is going to get my blessing.</P>

      <P>I certainly will not take more than a couple of minutes.  I should like to go on the record of the House as welcoming this report and the work that the Committee have done.  I would like to make a couple of brief general comments.  I do not think any of us is naive enough, and certainly I am not having been in the European Parliament, to think that the aims of the Treaty of Rome are going to be achieved and the undertakings in it are going to be carried through in a short period.  I say that particularly in view of what I may describe as the strain that is developing now and will be developing further with the acceptance of new members who have a lower GNP than we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> We have a problem here about developing the economy and about spreading that development.  I think the problem that some of the European Community members are faced with is something similar to the problem of any administration here.  You can go so far with your taxpayers and electors but you have got to bear in mind, as I think the Germans have to bear in mind, that it is not that easy when it comes down to what you are asking your own people to make sacrifices about.  While we should be reasonably critical of the inadequacy of the regional fund we should, on the other hand, appreciate that we have got benefits since 1973 out of it that I believe we could not have got otherwise.  Certainly we have in the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is going to take a long time for the Community to develop along the lines on which we would like to see it develop.  But, leaving aside the economic arguments, our own involvement in that Community is something that we should feel is an obligation because of the advantages of the Community in other areas in the matter of stability and because of the advantage that it gives to us as a very small country being involved in an area that I do not thing anyone earlier this century thought would be the case.  In that sense I think that the progress report of the Committee is a useful one and it gives us an opportunity to make a couple of comments such as I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long on this matter.  First of all, I wish to welcome the report of the Joint Committee.  I think it is fair, purposeful and objective.  In regard to this country and grant aid from the European Economic Community, I think we would be reasonable in saying that the country did benefit considerably from our association with the EEC.  The trend of events as recently affecting our nation makes us feel the need to avail of the opportunity of grant aid to a better extent and to seek it more extensively still. Towards that end I think that the Joint <Col N="1513" /> Committee are purposeful in what they have set out.</P>
      <P>I would go along with the submissions of Senator Staunton in regard to what is necessary in Ireland and where the need lies to the greatest extent.  First of all, I would say that it has been generally accepted at home and in the EEC that the real need for development is in the west of Ireland.  The barometer by which we might be able to accept that would be in-the context of or on the basis of the extent of emigration in the various parts of Ireland in the previous ten years.  In that regard I would say that Leitrim and Longford, which is my own county, suffered most.  These are the areas where aid for infrastructure is of vital importance. We should not lose sight of the fact that the real wealth of our nation is in the young people of Ireland and that the areas which they have had to abandon are the ones that require grant aid for infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The county council in my county have schemes of very ambitious proportions and are very determined to carry them out.  We are depending on borrowing form the European Investment Bank at the present time.  We are not in a position to do what we thought we should do a couple of years ago because of the economic difficulties at present.  I would emphasise that the Committee in the final debate and submission should be able to extend the application of grant aid in a greater measure and through the provision for infranstructure in roads, water and in the amenities for industry to an extent which would make these counties that have suffered so much in a position to retain their youth and provide employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Members of the House who contributed to the debate.  I note the kind of things they said about the work of the committee and I express my appreciation on behalf of the chairman, Senator FitzGerald, and Senator Robinson.  I want to refer to one or two points that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> The question as to whether the EEC is a good or a bad thing was raised.  It was defended by Senator FitzGerald and by Senator Brugha. There is no doubt that there are imbalances.  It may be an indication that the regional fund system is not working as well as it should.  The fact is that half the land in the EEC and 40 per cent of the population qualify for regional development fund grants.  We are talking about nearly 100 million people.  There are problems. That is what this report is about, to provide some data to enable people to understand these issues and make themselves felt when they get an opportunity.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister told us, that there is a new approach to be adopted.  Incidentally I hope that this business of having four audits might go out the door as well.  Funds sometimes do go astray, but it is hardly necessary to have four audits and all the associated visits that go with it to check on the funding.  On the other hand, there was the visit of M. Jaeger from the directorate of regional development who came and discussed this report in Brussels. That kind of visit is helpful and positive.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the occasion go without giving some extra information to help to counter what Senator Keating had to say about the value of the EEC.  We do not measure the value of the EEC in terms of the regional development fund only.  There was a big problem over the past six months, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was dissatisfied with the UK contribution.  What she was getting at, in effect, was that the UK was contributing £25 per person.  My memory is that we are receiving £145 per person so that the flow to Ireland is of the order of £400 million.  That is a significant proportion of the GNP.  To bring it down to the amount of the regional fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will depend on the record then.  Senator Whitaker came back at me on the borrowing.  This argument between Senator Whitaker and myself will go on forever.  He talked about the fact that the interest rates for guilders was different from the interest rate for deutschemarks but he did not go on to point out that what we are trying to protect against is the exchange rate. Since the EMS provides us with a more solid base for the exchange rate, then you cannot compare working within the EMS and the currencies of the EMS and the yen, for instance.  My contention is that if we had borrowed in guilders we would not have lost as much, despite the fact that it would cost us a bit more <Col N="1516" /> because of the higher interest rates, because the exchange rates between the guilder and the IR£ did not change over a period of two years.  I must put that on the record for the Senator to answer when the time comes.</P>
