      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1 until the end of the Second Stage, then to move to No. 3 and at the conclusion of No. 3 to go back to the Finance Bill, to the Committee and remaining Stages of the Bill and on their conclusion to take No. 2.</P>

      <P>We will be opposing the suggestion that we will go back to the Finance Bill today.  We feel that with a Bill of this complexity there should be a reasonable interval between the conclusion of Second Stage and the commencement of Committee Stage so that the various points put forward on the Second Stage debate can be considered. Those who are taking a special interest in the Bill can consider amendments or whatever is open to them in this Bill. Consequently to ask for all Stages, in effect, today is unreasonable.  I understand that there is no administrative or legal <Col N="956" /> reason why it would not go until next week, that the temporary collections divisions run until Friday, 27th.  If the Committee Stage is put off until next Tuesday we could undertake to have it concluded on Tuesday and that would then leave ample time for signing it before Friday, when time runs out.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator Cooney has said. That is, in an economic sense, the most important Bill in the year.  The Bill had a very substantial amount of time in the other House so it is lacking in the regard which is due to this House to suggest that we might complete Second Stage and then, with a short interval for minor legislation, go straight through to the later Stages.  I do not think that is fair to us or reasonable and it is not in the traditions of this House on legislation of this significance.  We will be supporting Senator Cooney on this.</P>

      <P>Two days ago a lot of Members on this side and indeed on the other side, expressed considerable concern about the necessity to give the Sexual Offences Bill, 1980, a Second Reading and the Leader of the House said he would bear in mind the representations that were made.  It was not on the Order of Business yesterday.  In the meantime, we have had considerable rumours about possible Government legislation on this issue.  I see no Government Bill before us whereas all Senators have had a Bill in their hands for some time and we have a Bill to discuss.  We must fix an Order for Second Stage and we must fix it today in order to leave time for a full debate of the Bill.  Having printed and circulated the Bill, it is responsible and constructive for the Seanad to decide to debate it.  Therefore, I am moving that item No. 11, the Sexual Offences Bill, 1980 be added to the Order of Business today before No. 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Hussey's request.  Although we would not agree with the entire contents of Senator Hussey's Bill, we agree very strongly that the Second Stage should be <Col N="957" /> ordered.  She made reference to rumours that the Government intend to publish a Bill, presumably along the same lines, and I strongly suspect it is to get over the difficulty of ignoring Senator Hussey's Bill this side of the summer vacation.  I urge that time be given for a Second Stage debate on the Sexual Offences Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Hussey's proposal that time be given to deal with the Second State of the Bill this side of the vacation.  I know we heard that there is to be a Government Bill but I feel this is a kind of reflex action which happens every time there is a Private Members' Bill.  I should like to remind the House of what Senator Robinson said two days ago about the necessity for accepting the reasonableness and the importance of having Private Members' legislation, rather than simply sweeping it away every time and saying &ldquo;We have a Government Bill&rdquo; instead.</P>
      <P>We had a Criminal Conversation Bill brought in and there was supposed to be similar Government legislation but we have seen no sign of it.  We had a Private Members' Family Planning Bill and we were told that there was to be a Government Bill.  Look at the Alice in Wonderland legislation which followed.  We had an Adoption Bill from the Labour Party and the legislation which followed, prior to the referendum, left out many vital aspects that were dealt with in the Private Members' Bill.  I find it very difficult to accept this reflex action, or is it, perhaps obscure jealousy on the part of the Government?  Every time a Private Members' Bill is brought in which may actually do something practical and useful the immediate reaction is, &ldquo;No, we cannot deal with this, we will bring in a Bill ourselves&rdquo;.  Firstly, I distrust that they are going to bring in a Bill at all and secondly I distrust what kind of a Bill it will be because of past experience.  I urge that even if the Government feel they need to amend the Bill brought in by Senator Hussey, which I am sure many people do, they should at least give it a second Stage reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the proposal to order the Sexual Offences Bill, 1980 for Second Stage and have a debate on Second Reading before the House rises for the summer.  I strongly support that for reasons already given and for other reasons mentioned today by Senators.  I should also like to support Senator Cooney's proposal. This should be an amendment to the Order of Business as well.  The Order of Business proposed by the Leader of the House is that we take item No. 1 for Second Stage, then item No. 3 and then go back to Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  I would like to propose the deletion of that part of the Order of Business proposed by the Leader of the House, and that we do not go back to try to take Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  It is an extremely important Bill.  It contains very many matters which Senators did not have an opportunity to deal with in detail on Second Reading.  It was not even appropriate to deal with them in detail on Second Reading and I do not believe that we will be doing our job responsibly if we try to crowd all this into even an extended sitting today.  As Senator Cooney said, there is no legal urgency or requirement that we complete the Finance Bill today.  It is a very reasonable proposal that we take the Committee Stage next Tuesday.  I should like to make that a formal amendment to our Order of Business and to delete the provision that we would take Committee and remaining Stages of the Finance Bill today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the proposal.  When we talked about this on the Order of Business on Tuesday, there was a suggestion that we were rather close to the summer recess and that this is one of the reasons why we could not deal with this and other matters.  I find that argument particularly specious.  There is no reason why we cannot sit in the weeks ahead, if necessary from Tuesday to Thursday. There is no reason why we cannot sit late into July as we did last year, up to 25 July in fact, and what a waste of time that was, dealing with the Family <Col N="959" /> Planning Bill.  The time element and the time objection to Senator Hussey's proposal I find particularly pointless.  It is not, after all, as if Senators were suffering incipient nervous breakdowns from overwork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine the fact that the other side of the House admit that the Finance Bill is most important should make it all the more reasonable that we get on with it, and not give time to matters which are not as important. The Bill has been available for a long time and, if people have amendments, they should be ready to take the Bill today. Senators are not so busy that they could not study the Finance Bill and be ready to take amendments today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose the granting of a Second Reading to the Sexual Offences Bill.  Senator McGuinness said that we should for a change do something practical and useful.  Despite what Senator Murphy said, we could sit here all summer discussing the very commendable Bill put forward by Senator Hussey but it would serve no practical or useful purpose.  The other House is going into recess and, even if this Bill were to pass all Stages in this House, it still would not be possible to have any new legislation implemented before the autumn.  For that reason, we should not be sitting here like a leisurely debating society in the middle of the summer discussing something that cannot be practical and useful and put into some sort of legislation in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Sexual Offences Bill, it is more than a rumour that there is a Government Bill about to be introduced.  The Minister has had under consideration for some considerable time the introduction of a Bill dealing with the crime of rape and the preparation of that Bill has now reached a late stage.  The Minister is hopeful that he will <Col N="960" /> be able to initiate it in the Seanad before the recess.  That being so, it would not be appropriate to have two Bills dealing with the same subject under consideration by this House at the same time.  In these circumstances, I cannot agree to allow the Second Stage to be put on the Order Paper.  From a practical point of view, what Senator Harney said is correct: there is no question of the Bill going through this session before the recess. The Minister's Bill will certainly be available, if not before the recess, certainly long before we resume in October.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Finance Bill, although it may be theoretically possible to take the remaining Stages next Tuesday, from a practical view it would be much too late and, consequently, I see no reason why the Committee Stage and remaining Stages cannot be taken today.  Senator Keating said it was against the traditions of the House.  It is not against the traditions of the House.  In 1970, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1976 and 1978 the Finance Bill was taken and completed in two successive days.  If we are talking about tradition and talking about what successive Ministers for Finance have asked the House to do we are very much in the tradition of the House; we are doing nothing out of the ordinary.  We are doing what has been done in almost every year in the past.  I cannot agree to put off the remaining Stages until next week. The House will have every opportunity to take the Committee and remaining Stages today.  I am proposing that we sit beyond the normal time, that we sit as long as is necessary to take the remaining Stages.  It is true that the Bill has been available for some considerable time and if Senators had wished to put down amendments, they have had adequate opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to rise from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch.</P>

      <P>Could we hear from the Leader of the House why it would be impractical not to postpone this until next week?  He offers us a bland statement that it is impractical. There is a resolution for an earlier <Col N="961" /> signature.  Could he tell us, in response to what Senator Cooney said about the relevant dates, why it would be impractical?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress last night I had been asking the Minister if he could indicate to the House whether oil consumers, the people who are buying petrol or diesel at the pumps, or home heating fuel, or whatever, can expect to benefit as a direct result of the change in Government policy and embarking on Government-to-Government deals with the oil producers.  Previously we relied on the various multi-nationals for the provision of fuel.  I should like to know where the consumer comes in.</P>
      <P>It has always been popular to bash the multi-nationals, but I am not convinced that we will get any great improvement or any significant price decrease in our oil requirements by virtue of the Government giving a licence or a mandate to an Irish consortium as against supplies coming in through the multi-nationals. Recently we saw some opposition to the fact that some of the international oil companies were insisting on the small retailers either installing larger capacity petrol pump storage facilities, or doing without a supply.  I would be apprehensive about this deal because the oil-producing countries, whether they are just small sheikdoms or big and powerful nations, will have the whip hand and will continue dictating to our sovereign Government where and in which market we should sell our own produce or, perhaps to be more exact, to whom we may not sell or with whom we may not trade.  This is going on at present in the State of Israel and in the State of South Africa, to name but two, and there may be conflicting views on that.</P>
      <P>Equally important is the danger that we could be dictated to on what we may say.  Our foreign policy may be interfered with.  As a small nation we must remain independent.  Our independence was won at a considerable price and I do not see any great reason why we should have got to forego that independence for the sake of a few barrels of oil, one way or the other.  I hope the Minister will be able to elaborate on this drastic change of policy.  I am not saying anything against the Irish companies who are embarking on this and have a franchise from the Government. Anything this consortium undertake to do I am sure will be done extremely well, but from the ordinary consumer's point of view we should be looking for a reduction in price.  The price of fuel is creating difficulties and inflating the cost of the input into every industry and is reflected very definitely in the cost of living.  I would be grateful if the Minister could give the House some indication of where the benefits to the consumer are in this drastic change of policy which, of course, is tied up with our foreign borrowings and the huge transfer of resources from this country to the East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is that, to my mind, all the Government deals over the past six or eight months in this field have been successfully concluded with Governments who appear to be in the Eastern power axis.  I do not know whether that is a good thing.  I would not like to be dependent to any large extent for our fossil fuel or oil supplies on countries completely controlled <Col N="965" /> by the huge white bear.  The statisticians tell us there may be a lack of long-term reserves coming from that whiter than white source.</P>
    <P>The Bill deserves serious study.  We had a division on the taking of the remaining stages of the Bill this morning. There is no reason why the Bill should be rushed through the House now or at any stage.  We need to give the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Chair's ruling.  The point I was making is that we must give serious consideration and examination to this Bill.  Otherwise we abnegate our rights and obligations to examine legislation going through the House, and we leave that power to the courts.  This would be unfortunate because, while the courts do their job, through the debates in both Houses it is possible to look after the rights of individuals in a more humane way whereas the courts are constrained to keeping to actual points of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that in this Bill the Minister has not held out new incentives to people, especially to younger people, to save.  The improvements in the prize bonds scheme and the marginal increases in the interest rates for building societies have been a help.  At the same time, I was hoping the Minister would introduce some novel scheme to encourage people to save more.  It is very difficult to save with inflation at its present rate.  In some of our partner countries in the EEC they have designed schemes which appear to be working.  One of those is in France where they allow young people to save up a certain amount of money, possibly the equivalent of a deposit on a new house, and if it is left in a Government saving agency for three or four years, they can have the interest rate on it tax free.  That kind of encouragement is badly needed here.  We have a big problem at present.  When people want to buy or build a house they go to the building societies, or the local <Col N="966" /> authorities, who can give them only 95 per cent.  Why is there so much hassle over bridging loans?  The Government should encourage people to save money for a deposit on a house.  This would also provide the very necessary finance for the Government's own schemes.  This is something that we should look at.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to rely on our present procedures and infrastructures.  The Government have an obligation to introduce fresh thinking into the economy and into the running of the country. With inflation at 20 per cent&mdash;and it was stated on the radio this morning that it is 4 per cent higher than in any of the other countries in the EMS&mdash;and with the Government paying lip service to the fact that there is an international crisis, there are many ways in which improvements in the economy can be tackled.  If the Government are content to treat inflation by allowing higher and higher interest rates, they are forcing more people on to the dole queues.  Last year borrowers in Germany could procure finance for productive purposes on short-term loans at an interest rate of 7.8 per cent and on long term loans at 6.8 per cent.  In Luxembourg the interest rate was around 8.5 per cent; in France, 9.8 per cent; in Belgium, 10.3 per cent, and so on.  Last year it was 18.5 per cent here and this year, in many cases, it has gone over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>When we consider the interest rate and the way it is affecting the small shopkeeper, the private sector, and the farmers, we cannot expect the organised farmers to make too much noise about that because they have their own representatives on the boards of the major banks.  They will not rock the boat too heavily.  The point is that most of the people who incurred that indebtedness in order to improve their standard of living, to develop their economy and their output, borrowed money at 10 per cent or 12 per cent two, three, or four years ago. Times have caught up with them.  I asked the Minister yesterday would he consider giving people who have put their faith in the future development of this country some breathing space and to have a <Col N="967" /> holding operation during the international depression.  I have no doubt they will all meet their commitments if they get time to do so.</P>
    <P>All the lending agencies are hoarse from calling in their outstanding loans and trying to cut down on overdraft directly as a result of Government policy as expressed through the Central Bank. It is a poor response to say to people that during the depression we will have to have more unemployment, which will go over 100,000 this year.  It is increasing at more than 1,000 people per week. This reflects the poor performance by the Minister and his Government in their economic programme and economic policy.  I ask the Minister to reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>There is a complete lack of urgency attached to the problem of providing youth employment.  In the past six or eight months, two schemes which were in operation were dropped.  Perhaps they were not good ones but they tried to provide youth employment or to introduce something in ease of young people who have not been lucky enough to be placed in employment.  The social fund has adequate finance available, all of which requires matching finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should review his order of priorities and do so as a matter of urgency.  His think tanks came up with novel ideas two and three years ago and he should reactivate them to see how the interests of the national economy can best be served and, at the same time, utilise the tremendous youthful manpower we have.  This year the private sector is going through a very difficult period.  We should at least recognise that.  Practically all the small business people have to contend with this extraordinarily high interest rate.  They also have the very unfair competition in the retail sector through the now very widespread network of supermarkets. Their shelves are filled with what amounts to dumped confectionery or dumped produce, and probably dumped within the rules of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The concept of a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, or even encouraging one, is long <Col N="968" /> since gone.  This is causing tremendous stagnation especially in the small towns and villages across this country.  This is a reversal of the kind of development we all looked forward to over the past years. The Minister must not just look forward to turning over a new leaf himself in the new year and leaving the rest of the country in a very difficult situation.  I hope he will be able to tell the House in his concluding speech why the Government insist on these record interest rates which are causing so much trouble. Perhaps he might have a solution to this problem.  They are creating havoc and uncertainty and contributing significantly to the long dole queues.</P>

      <P>I am worried by the tone of the Minister's speech as delivered and, indeed, as indicated on a more careful perusal of the text.  I see two things in it which I find very serious in the current impasse in which the country finds itself.  One is complacency, and I will give examples of that as I go through it.  The other is what I can only call, in polite terms, a movement away from reality.  I feel sadder about this because I know the drafting of this text was not by the Minister's hand.  It was by the collective hands of a number of his senior staff.  I am sorry to see honourable civil servants being coerced politically into saying things that are silly and trivial and, in some cases, which they know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is nice to see the little flicker of life return, even if temporarily. The text shows political distortion of the facts.  Let us give the Minister responsibility for that.  It shows most seriously an unawareness of real issues and a complacency.  The budget, of course, had a purpose, which was to keep reality away until the autumn, and to open the options for a general election. The economic facts are coming home to roost sooner than the autumn, perhaps a little sooner than the Minister and his colleagues thought.</P>
      <P>The purposes of a budget are more than simply to obtain enough money to pay for the services the State requires. There is also the major purpose&mdash;or there ought to have been over the past 40 odd years&mdash;of having an influence on the economy, either to stimulate it or to do the opposite, to cool it.  I do not propose to spend too much time on detail in what I have to say, because I want to devote my time to the major charge of the mismanagement of the economy since the present Government came to power and, indeed, the damage they did before coming to power by their performance in the run-up to the 1977 election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can put the burden of my charge quite simply.  At times when the economy is doing better than the normal growth line which it is possible to determine over fairly long periods, then it ought to be the purpose of budgetary policy to bring growth back to that sustainable path.  When the economy falls below its sustainable path, it ought to be the purpose of a budget to raise it so that the cycles, larger or smaller, that we know to be inherent in market economies, and that vary in their intensity <Col N="970" /> from time to time, and vary in their intensity on us as a small open economy which is part of a rapidly integrating and already very integrated world system can be levelled out.  The task of a budget is also to level out those fluctuations and to see that an optimum rate of growth is maintained in the calmest possible conditions.</P>
    <P>The central mismanagement the Government have been guilty of for the basest party political reasons is that, instead of behaving in a counter-cyclical way with the budget, they used public moneys, and used them incompetently, to exaggerate the swings in each case. Instead of behaving counter-cyclically they got themselves, for trivial and stupid political reasons, synchronised with the swing, to that they exaggerated the swing in each case.  Now in recessionary times they are making things worse, instead of being able to mitigate and to minimise the effects of some internal and external factors on us.</P>
    <P>I have talked about complacency in this rather surprisingly political document. On page 2 of the circulated text it is stated:</P>
    <P>The remaining important budgetary parameter was the need to maintain momentum in the Government's pursuit of equity in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>The aim is an important and decent and laudable one.  We see all over the world a tax revolt which presents real difficulties for Governments.  We see that people want more public consumption but less taxation, and anyone who wants to be fair about it knows that those two desires are not reconcilable.  But if taxes are to be paid on the levels that are necessary and if some sort of calm in society in the possibility of a reasonable evolution without confrontation is being preserved then taxes should be seen to be as equitable as possible, and since we all inherit a complex system to which we add little increments in budgets, of course we all inherit a complicated system and nobody suggests that in a continuing situation one can suddenly have a drastic and enormous reform.  I accept <Col N="971" /> that the Minister has practical difficulties. But the visible trend of taxation policy ought to be towards equity, for a variety of reasons that we need not pursue. The visible trend of the taxation policy indicated in this Bill and, indeed, indicated by the Government in its period of office is the opposite to equity. It is the production of inequity, of inequality in a number of ways that I will indicate.</P>
    <P>In the past there has been an effort to introduce reasonable forms of capital taxation here and the Government have backed off that in the case of the wealth tax.  In the past when there was no taxation on farmers equity demanded that there should be.  We have had in the past a very odd system of taxation on industry, and equity would demand a movement to a more reasonable payment of tax in a very refined way that would have been a stimulant to growth. What we have here about company taxation is a backing away from that.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority of people who have small incomes equity demands a direct taxation system which is based on their incomes, on their ability to pay, involving, therefore, income tax or something like it.  We see in this budget a movement which is not very harmful, perhaps, for the Minister or for myself. But for old age pensioners and for all of the weakest and poorest sections of our society it is very harmful.  That is an increase in indirect taxation.  Those are practically all the heads that one has got. One has the taxation of industry, the taxation of wealth, of capital wealth, and the taxation of wage earners.  It seems to me that the direction of taxation policy under all those heads is towards inequality and inequity.  That does not surprise me a bit.  I would have expected it knowing the complexion of this Government. What does cause me both a little outrage and a sneaking sort of admiration at the sheer brass of it is the statement that the Government needs to maintain momentum in its pursuit of equity.  To say it in that brazen way while doing the opposite is a nice trick. <Col N="972" /> But it is a trick that needs to be pointed out.</P>
    <P>I referred to what I consider the drift away from reality and the distortion of facts that I have found in this document. I know that one can play tunes on the figures.  I know one can play tunes dishonestly and one can also play the tunes honestly.  When there are a whole series of assumptions to be made and there are a range of figures within that assumption, one can pick the most adverse or the middle or the most benevolent assumption.  The way that one's numbers come out depends on a whole series of assumptions of that kind whether one goes in the middle on each case or whether one goes to the extreme optimistic or pessimistic side, so that not all variations or figures are dishonest.  But my feeling is that on pages 2 and 3 of the Minister's statement we are getting a long way in the direction of dishonesty. Perhaps it is only benevolent incompetence; perhaps it is worse.  Time will tell and, indeed, judge this by some of the Minister's own statements as time goes on.  But I see in the circulated statement the Minister says:</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the budget statement, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1980 has been calculated at 10.4 per cent of GNP compared with borrowing last year equivalent to 13.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Then the next sentence is:</P>
    <P>Such progress, however, will have to be continued ...</P>
    <P>That looks as if &ldquo;such progress&rdquo; refers to a reduction from 13.7 per cent of GNP last year to 10.4 per cent of GNP this year as Exchequer borrowing requirement. Perhaps that is just the use of the most benevolent assumptions possible.  I know serious people who, perhaps, are using the most pessimistic assumptions possible.  But they get a very different figure for percentage of GNP as Exchequer borrowing requirement for this year and they get a figure quite close to 13.7 per cent, not as high, but quite close to it. We cannot, in the nature of things, know definitively who is right until the year is over and until some arithmetic is done. <Col N="973" /> But I am just putting it on the record because time will tell&mdash;and it may not be very important to the Minister or to myself at that stage.</P>
    <P>It is a pity in fact that we scrutinise things retrospectively so little and so carelessly in Ireland, because it makes all sorts of politicians feel that it does not matter too much what they say because nobody is going to look back carefully anyway and, provided it is 18 months down the road, nobody really cares.  So even if one is not telling lies, one can take the most optimistic assumptions and one can fudge it when the time comes if one is ever challenged but it is a hundred to one against one being challenged.</P>
    <P>All of those assumptions that the Government have made are wrong.  I get in the mail, though I am not a Deputy obviously or I would not be speaking here, letters from school managements of various kinds saying the money is running out; it is running out acutely and will I please approach the Minister for Finance asking to do something about this.</P>
    <P>I am putting these representations to me on the record now.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have some sort of relation with local authorities around the country know that there is an intense apprehension about the actual availability of funds towards the end of this year.  All through the local authorities, it may be in fact that the lack of provision in our initial budget was such that we may not get through the year without a supplementary budget.  My own view, from talking again to serious people who may or may not be on the pessimistic side, is that we are not going to get through the year on the moneys voted in a number of important areas.</P>
    <P>This suggestion, because it is very slightly hedged, that we can get through this year with 10.4 per cent of GNP as an Exchequer borrowing requirement, is seriously wrong.  Time will show it to be seriously wrong.  The Government have not tackled the question which is exceedingly serious for our credit worthiness and for our ability to maintain the parity of our currency within the <Col N="974" /> European Monetary System of the level of Exchequer borrowing.  Phrases like &ldquo;such progress&rdquo; are misleading.  It is not possible with certainty to decide whether that sort of misleading of people is honest or dishonest.  Time will tell.  It is possible, though, to form an opinion. Those numerate people in the Government, or who have recently been in the Government and who presided over the 1977 manifesto, knew that the targets were not honest.  The seriously numerate people with a little bit of economic understanding in the present Government&mdash;I think they are fairly few&mdash;know that the budget was, in fact, not honest.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the matter of incomes policy.  I want to add my voice to those who say it is crucially important and to indicate why I believe what the Government has done in this context is counterproductive.  Whatever our political outlook we all want to see the country get richer; we all want to see the benefits of that growth spread as widely as possible.  Of course we want to see the better funding of all of the social services and we want to see the raising of the weaker sections of the community and better education and so on.  Those are the ordinary aspirations of everyone in political life shared by all the parties and by people of no party.  Again, one could say that the only way that this is done is by securing growth.  One cannot consume, except for a little while&mdash;and the results are, unless brilliantly managed, adverse if one tries&mdash;more than one produces.  Also we know that in the context of the European Community and in the context of the contemporary world economically, in the context of the huge transfers of wealth which are now taking place away from the traditionally developed parts of the world, the possibility of de-industrialisation&mdash;not simply of holding the situation, but de-industrialisation&mdash;of job losses in the industrial sector, the shrinkage of the industrial sector, is not alone possible but very easy to permit to come about.  We see a country with the great wealth and the great traditions and great organisations of Britain close to us, much <Col N="975" /> stronger than us, and we see a process of de-industrialisation taking place there. The level of wage demands and the rate of inflation and the competitiveness of products, especially within a community context, are an important determinant of whether this de-industrialisation takes place or not.</P>
    <P>I am talking about de-industrialisation now because we see how fatuous the promises of three years ago were in regard to employment levels.  I suppose that some of the people who made those promises at the top believed them.  I know in relation to the rank and file through Fianna Fáil who cannot be expected to be knowledgeable in this, if their leaders tell them something, I do not question their good faith for a moment; they believed them and they said them in good faith.  But we see how fatuous those things are now.  Of course labour discipline, labour peace and an evolution of wages which is related to productivity and the level of production are crucial in a successful economy. These things are capable of being influenced profoundly, they are capable of being influenced in fact to a level that determines what happens, by what Governments do.  That is why the dishonesties, the deceptions and the lies, and the things that were not lies but were said in good faith but were untrue, of three years ago were so disastrous, why their repercussions are coming back on us now.</P>
    <P>After the oil shock of 1973, the Coalition Government did borrow and did do stimulant things and did increase the Exchequer borrowing to a level of GNP that had not existed previously.  We did those things; we did them with our eyes open; we did them in the face of the sharpest recession since the early thirties. It is possible that we were optimistic about the rate at which one could stop doing that and get back into balance. But we were making strenuous efforts in 1976 and 1977 to redress the balance at a time when we knew that the world economy had turned around, that the slump was ending and that, economically, relatively better times were coming. <Col N="976" /> But the 1977 election was an auction organised by the Opposition of that time as to how much could be borrowed and how much could be spent and what Scrooges we were and how wrong we were to try to manage the economy in the way we were doing it and to try to get back on the rails.  What, in fact, for party political advantage, was done three years ago was to release forces in our society that are still echoing through it, possibly harder to control now than they would have been then but certainly having wrought terrible damage in the intervening period.  It was done in the most cynical and opportunist way for party political advantage.  We are still paying and will go on paying.</P>
    <P>On the evidence of the complacency and incompetence in this speech there is not even a recognition of what needs to be done, much less a willingness to do it or where there is a certain genuflection towards doing it, it is done in the way of fudging the figures, for example, as I have already referred to, in our borrowing requirement.  People are told that there is endless money to be borrowed. There was a debate in 1977 as to how much more we, the Coalition, could borrow to put into the economy if only we would do it, if only we were not such Scrooges.  We were being told by the same people now responsible for the running of the economy that we could borrow much more, that we were not stimulant enough, we were not borrowing enough.  Everybody remembers that debate.  It is interesting to see how farcically and cynically and trivially people have totally reversed direction in the intervening years.  I do not think they believed what they said then; I do not think they believe what they say now; I do not think they believe anything very much except the cosmetic action of PR, to try to get votes.  There is no passion or conviction or honesty or real depth in regard to the economy, good or ill, up or down, in or out of office.  There is just cynical manipulation.  But we are paying for it most desperately because if one releases those forces inside society, switches them on, the genie gets out of the bottle and then we have the exhortations <Col N="977" /> of this disgusting kind, switch them on and switch them off again.  I quote from page 6 of the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>All sections of the community must appreciate that we have been paying ourselves too much, and that, if we continue in this direction, we are behaving irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that all sections of the community must appreciate that.  Must they?  Let me offer the Minister a quotation from a different source.  I quote from <i>The Kerryman</i> of 13 June 1980.  I quote from someone who is described in the opening sentence of the piece as &ldquo;North Kerry Fianna Fáil Activist, Con Riordan&rdquo;.  He says:</P>
    <P>The organised sections of society are listened to and succeed in having their demands met whilst the old, the poor, and the vulnerable are left at the mercy of inflationary market forces that make them poorer still.</P>
    <P>That seems to me a reasonable description of what is happening.  But the Minister complacently says all sections of the community must appreciate that we have been paying ourselves too much. I listened, fascinated, yesterday to the analysis of Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I hope, for the sake of any sort of decency and equity in this country and for the sake of the reputation of the Government, that the Minister will be able to prove his calculations wrong when he comes to reply.  I hope so.  I doubt it, though.  What Senator FitzGerald showed very brilliantly is that if one is rich with these taxation changes one does better than if one is poor, a lot better.</P>
    <P>I mention, in passing, something that is in a way trivial but it is symbolic because what Ministers do is symbolic and is noticed and is watched all over the country.  In our time in Government, partly for economic reasons and partly as an example of energy conservation, we moved from larger Mercedes cars to smaller two litre Peugeot cars in the great majority of instances&mdash;different <Col N="978" /> Ministers have different cars for reasonable reasons.  But we gave an example of that.  What our successors did immediately was to move back to the larger cars.  I saw one of them claiming credit for a subsequent return to a smaller car about a year ago.  But the movement on assuming power in 1977 was the bad example movement from smaller to larger.</P>
    <P>The movement in taxation as analysed by Senator FitzGerald, who brings great competence to these things as well as, in my view, great integrity and great passion, and is a man to be listened to, indicates a growing inequality in the taxation system.  But the Minister says complacently that all sections of the community must appreciate that we have been paying ourselves too much.  In my view that is not true.  If one talks to a small farmer now, with his costs escalating at 20 to 25 per cent a year and who may be getting the same price for stock and getting a few pence more for a gallon of milk, with the price of what he sells either not increasing at all or increasing by a few per cent, with a very dramatic and rapid squeeze on his margins, it is complacent and offensive to tell him that he is paying himself too much.</P>
    <P>With small businesses, when interest rates go to their present level and when interest rates are such a significant part of their total accounting and have such leverage on their final profits, when we know that in many of these instances small businesses are being squeezed very hard at this moment, it is complacent and offensive to say they are paying themselves too much.  In the case of the lowest paid workers it is offensive and complacent to say that they are paying themselves too much.  In the case of those incomes that are determined by the Minister and his colleagues of recipients of various sorts of social welfare where the rate of inflation has eliminated the benefits, it is offensive and complacent to tell them, not that they are paying themselves too much, because they do not pay themselves, but that the State is paying them too much.  That is the sort of <Col N="979" /> stuff that does not make for social peace, for harmony, for cohesion, for labour discipline, for reasonable wage demands. That is the sort of complacent and offensive behaviour that makes for the exact opposite.  That is what the Government have been doing in pursuit of the policies and the attitudes which arose from, I was going to say, the most dishonest and contemptible and deceitful thing that had happened in Irish public life but that would be, perhaps, putting in on a special pedestal.  It is on a par with a lot of other things in their history.  But those are the actions and the behaviours that necessarily arose from the economic policies and the promises and, indeed, other than economic policies, of the manifesto of 1977.  Perhaps I will quote the source I mentioned a minute ago, Mr. Con Riordan.  He says he feels encouraged the Institute of Taxation, who</P>
    <P>My sense of betrayal of the promises we were authorised by the Manifesto to make, and, above all, my deep personal sympathy with the people who believed us and took our advice...</P>
    <P>He says he feels entitled to express his disappointment at the Government's performance. That is why it is complacent and offensive, at an exceedingly difficult time in our economic history, to say that all sections of the community must appreciate that we are paying ourselves too much.  It is incompetent as well.</P>
    <P>I turn to the matter of inflation because anyone who has any experience of wage negotiations knows that to say to the poorer sections of the community that they must take a cut in their real living standards is a difficult thing.  It is not unthinkable because the people being addressed are generally responsible, generally patriotic.  Generally in what they ultimately do they are high-minded and decent people who want the success of our country and our economy.  One may ask them, if one tells them why, to please take a cut in their income this year.  They may even do it.  But when one is reducing the taxation on the richest <Col N="980" /> and when one is reducing the taxation on the industrial sector and then asking them to please take a cut to unscramble our eggs, to save our bacon, to rescue us from the mess we have made, then one has to have pretty good arguments because the rate of inflation is a crucial determinant of the rate of wage claims. People making the claims are not fools. They may say they accept that they cannot go on getting richer every year, they notice certain sorts of figures rising and they notice the profits of oil companies rising, they notice the profits of banks rising, they notice the volume of exports rising, they notice the volume of production rising, they notice the volume of outputs from the land rising.  They say the Government make the argument that they should not get any richer this year. They say they will think about it, in the circumstances.  But the level of inflation is crucial.  And what does our competent and dedicated truthful Government do? I quote from the Minister as to what the Government do by budgetary policy at a very difficult time when the level of wage settlements is crucial this year in our econmy:</P>
    <P>However, the increases in this year's budget added less than 4 per cent to the cost-of-living index.</P>
    <P>The Minister is actually boasting.  In fact, less than 4 per cent means 4 per cent; with a little bit of using the figures in the range of guesses, it might be a little bit more than 4 per cent.  There are people who are neutral and who are outside who make it a little more than 4 per cent. There are people who take the pessimistic range of the variable figures and who make it a good deal more than 4 per cent.  But let us say that this delicate euphemism of less than 4 per cent means 4 per cent.  We will know in due course, because that figure will come out for those who want to look back and those who want to judge who is telling the truth.  We will know that in due course.  We will know it when the year has ended, but 4 per cent is not the sort of figure that the Government should be adding to inflation.  It is the sort of figure that in an appropriately-run economy <Col N="981" /> would comprise the totality of inflation, and you could make the argument that 4 per cent is too high.</P>
    <P>There are countries in the market economy world at this moment running inflations of less than 4 per cent while we have this appalling complacency of saying that all we did to an already acutely inflationary situation was to add 4 per cent to it, then the gall to turn around and say to workers, &ldquo;You must not expect compensation in your wage packet for the inflation that is taking place. Please take a cut&rdquo;.  Workers will take a cut or will accept no increase in the context of honest Government and of a serious effort to solve problems but to ask them to please take a cut in their living standards, in the context of the sort of complacency and mismanagement that we currently see is to ask the impossible.  It is an offensive request.</P>
    <P>You can do those things if your own house is in order and if you have a record of truthful dealings, but you cannot do those things with the possibility of success with the sort of record that this Government have&mdash;complacent and offensive.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to that part of the Minister's speech where he says that Chapter 4 of the Bill provides for the resource tax.  He goes on to say what the rate of tax will be and then he says that, as he said before, it is not the Governments intention that this tax should be a permanent feature of the farm tax system, that it will be reviewed at the end of the year and so on in the light of its operation.  I am not opposed to the taxation of the countryside or of farmers.  I am proud to have been a member of the Government who grasped that nettle. Precisely the sort of inequity in the taxation system that I have complained of was that farmers in the past should not have been paying tax.  A situation of where a farm worker was taxed while his employer, who was a substantial farmer, was not taxed was socially divisive and could not be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>Again, we have an example of the classic ignorant mistiming which arises <Col N="982" /> partly just from sheer incompetence and stupidity and partly because the Government trapped themselves as a result of what they did in 1977.  I said that taxation policy and indeed Government money and financial and economic policy as a whole should be counter-cyclical&mdash;when things are in trouble raise it a bit, when things are getting over-heated, cool it a bit.  That is putting it very crudely.  Is it possible that these people with all the sophistication of their grassroots and their delicate organisations spread through the country do not know what is happening in the countryside, do not know what is happening to farming?  Is it possible that they do not know what farming needs?  Is it that they are that stupid and that ignorant? Do they not know that at a time when margins contract, as they have been contracting dramatically, the way you solve the situation both in terms of the national economy and of the farm sector is to put up production?  Do they not know that Ireland needs now to raise its production and intensify its production in every sector?  Do they not know that farmers need to be encouraged and not discouraged to invest?  Do they not know that you cannot get increased production except by increased retention of profits for productive investment?  Do they not know that you cannot readily lay your hands on that investment money if it is being drained away with higher costs for your own personal and family consumption and with this sort of tax as well?  Do they not know that a taxation system ought to be delicate in the sense that it coaxes people to increase production?  It ought to be subtly tuned so that people are allowed for what they put back into higher production and that money is not taken away on a flat-rate basis to drain them at a time when they need extra investment to get over contracting margins by putting up products, by putting up volume.  Do they not know that the cycle in farming is not a matter of a month or a year but of five or ten years?  This means that you need steadiness and continuity.</P>
    <P>Why put your foot down to take it up again?  Why say to an industry that they <Col N="983" /> are to be discouraged in this year when farm incomes are dropping dramatically but that since they have protested loudly the tax will be reviewed at the end of the year?  What sort of complacency and incompetence is that?  The industry should be given reason for confidence and continuity. They should not be thumped at the moment of their greatest disadvantage. Whether that is just is not the point I am making.  Whether it will yield much money is not the point I am making.  The point I am making is that it is stupid and incompetent because it is inappropriate in time, because it is not being followed through and because it is inappropriate in its nature in relation to what the countryside needs now.</P>
    <P>Farmers' spokesmen say that farmers are willing to pay a fair amount of tax. When you analyse it that means very little, but I am not making that argument. Nobody likes paying tax.  Everybody will argue like hell especially when there is no tradition of paying it.  As it comes in incrementally people are bitter about and try to oppose it.  I am not defending those points of view.  I am happy that farmers should pay tax but it is the silliness of this tax that I am appalled by.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the industrial taxation situation which is referred to in Chapter 6.  We have had a system for a long time in both types of government in this country&mdash;Coalition and Fianna Fáil administrations&mdash;of export tax relief.  My own information which I am not certain of but which I believe to be true is that the original input of thought came from someone who has political opinions but who is not primarily a politician, certainly not a practising politician.  It is a system that has served us well.  It is a system that in my own time, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I tried in difficult times as well as in easier ones, because I had some experience of both, to operate.  I always thought it was right to have such a policy.  I argue that it is still right to have it, but in my view it is only half a policy because we have to look in our particular circumstances at intense stimulation of indigenous things. That happened.  The IDA changed <Col N="984" /> emphasis a bit both in my time and in my successor's time, and that is good.</P>
    <P>I would argue also that we need a strong public sector in our particular circumstances as well.  In other words, we need to balance the inflow of investment from foreign companies in response to export tax relief and to virtual freedom from all taxation on profits made from exports, with a much more positive and stronger industrial policy that is indigenous. It is not that the present policy is wrong but it is incomplete.  In the discharge of a promise by my successor some considerable time ago I see the enactment of the legislating of that promise, if I can express it that way.  The new rate of corporation profits tax is about 10 per cent in respect of the income of companies from sales of goods manufactured by them in this State.  The scheme consists of a new rate of corporation profits tax with that objective in view.  The change there is that it has not been possible in the Community circumstances to sustain the differential between taxes on profits from exports and profits from sales indigenously.  The passing of that differentiation may be a good thing because one could see the unbalancing of our economy as between companies who defended their places in the domestic market and companies that were set up exclusively for exports.  The long-term existence of a differential like that can have serious distorting effects, and these effects were beginning to emerge.  Therefore, so the basic idea of taxing profits in an across-the-board way regardless of where they accrue is not an idea to which I would object.</P>
    <P>I have two things to say about this section.  Firstly, we are told it is intended to operate from 1 January 1981 until 1 December 2000, that is a 20-years run.  It interests me&mdash;and if I knew more law and more governmental and constitutional history than I do, but I do not know those things and I do not know the precedents&mdash;that this Bill purports to tell budget makers in the year 1999 what rate of tax they will levy on the industrial sector.  It is interesting to tie down a tax rate for 20 years in advance on the <Col N="985" /> largest and most dynamic sector of the economy.  I wonder if it is legal. Presumably it is or it would not be there. I wonder if it is practicable.  Future governments may decline to have their hands tied in that way.  I wonder if it is prudent, because with the rate of change in the world now who can say exactly what the situation will be in 20 years time?  Who can say truthfully that in 20 years time it will be appropriate to tax industrial profits at the rate of 10 per cent?  It does not seem to me to be either prudent or appropriate.  Since the objective is to be able to say to incoming industrial firms, &ldquo;That is a promise, and it is a promise that will hold for 20 years&rdquo;, I see the point of it but I am inclined to wonder about that point.</P>
    <P>The other point I would make is that we see what is happening to the taxation on farmers.  We see what is happening to the taxation on sales and we see what is happening to the taxation on people who are wage and salary earners.  We see a trend, and of course, we see efforts over and over to adjust the bands on income taxation to take account of inflation, and we see approximately 60,000 or 100,000 people being taken out of tax altogether by a particular adjustment at band level but in the course of inflation over the next year or so they will come back into the band again.  We do not see any dramatic tendency downwards in the level of taxation on incomes.  We see a fairly dramatic tendency upwards in the level of taxation on the countryside but we do not see any tendency downwards in the levels of the various cascade taxes, value-added taxes and so on in our economy or in other economies; the European Community may be asking us to add a little on for their budgetary purposes one of these months or years also.</P>
    <P>We see a dramatic downward tendency in the taxation on company profits.  That is socially disruptive and imprudent and bad taxation policy.  If you ask me if I believe in the heavy taxation of the profits of companies, I will not answer that with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or with a &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I will say that it depends, because my belief is that companies do very different <Col N="986" /> things with their profits depending on a whole variety of reasons that we need not now analyse, and that some portion of company profits should be very heavily taxed and some portions should not be taxed at all.  I want to see a delicate and graduated method of company taxation.  In other words, I am for all the allowances which genuinely go back into keeping our plant competitive, and that is always a problem in a little country with small units and a small domestic market, everything that contributes to the introduction of high technology which will remain competitive with our rivals in other countries. I am for everything that improves the quality of life in the work place, the beauty of the workplace and of the factory and its surroundings.  I am also for everything that diminishes pollution, and that is dear, as you cannot have clean industry at low cost.</P>
    <P>But the things that are spent in phoney ways for giving executives higher level real income than they have to tell the taxman about and the things that are spent on distribution, I am not for.  So one wants a very different system of allowances and one wants a higher rate of tax on the residual.  The yield may not be very different but the social justice and the equity and the way that a taxation policy coerces our industry to go in the level of beauty, environmental concern, high quality of working environment and the retention and, indeed, the increase of competitiveness and the increase in the intensity of capital investment are well worth while.  One can coerce industry that way with taxation policy or one can coerce it the other way.  It seems to me that this 10 per cent rate is coercing it the other way.  It seems to me gravely iniquitous.</P>
    <P>I am not a farmer's leader but I am a farmer and I very often disagree both publicly and privately with what the leadership of the farming industry in Ireland say, but how does one justify the resource tax to farmers and the levels of farming taxation going dramatically in one way when farming is shrinking in its profitability and when farming <Col N="987" /> desperately needs retained profits to intensify production?  How do you justify that when you compare it with little Irish industrial plants that never exerted themselves catering to a home market, not trying very much, not re-equiping, not capitalising, just mining the resources of the capital that the company represents?</P>
    <P>There are plenty of those little companies. They have a limited life.  We know how lack-lustre their management attitudes are, that there is no investment in them, that they distribute more than they ought and that they have a dramatic reduction in taxation while at the same time a farmer down the road has a dramatic increase in taxation.  Why is an industry employing ten people different from a farmer employing ten people? Are the ten people working on a farm not useful socially?  Is managing the resource of a farm and a herd of cows different from the managing of a factory?  Why the inequity of this and why the dramatic movement in opposites? I think it is bad and it is foolish.</P>
    <P>I have said this before and I will say it for the record of the Seanad&mdash;I see very little difference between the policies of the two major parties in this country but I see an immense difference in their morality.  However, I could contemplate in the appropriate circumstances a coalition with Fine Gael but how could one coalesce with people who put out the 1977 manifesto that nobody is ashamed about, except a poor man like Mr. Con Riordan in North Kerry?  I wonder how long he will remain in the ranks of the party for which he now purports to speak.  He says in another place, referring to the present Government that their record in the economic field is diabolical. That is right, but nobody is ashamed, nobody resigned and nobody criticises the leadership except people like Mr. Riordan who are birds of passage in terms of their position in the party&mdash;an odd flicker of a conscience.  Nobody is appalled that it was dishonest or that it is incompetent or that it is complacent.  We see the frenetic efforts being made.  One is reminded of a mother bird's reaction <Col N="988" /> when one goes near her nest.  She will go off in front of you, making efforts to draw attention to herself and to lead you away from the nest.  What we see from the present Government are dramatic efforts to stop us looking at the economy and superb public relations about everything else in sight.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the major themes in the Minister's speech.  I want, in closing, to reiterate a number of major conclusions that I have drawn.  All prudent budgetary policy tries to counteract the cycles that occur in the economy and that are particularly damaging to an economy like ours which is small and open.  The Government trapped themselves in the lies of 1977 so that all of their activities since then, far from being counter-cyclical, have been stimulant to the cycles which were emerging from the working of the economy.</P>
    <P>I am making a very serious charge: in terms of the management of the economy, it is the most serious charge that can be made&mdash;that for trivial, partisan, party political reasons the Government are going the road of making the economy very hard indeed to control.  I have made the point that in a small open economy, at a time of recession in the world and when world trade is slowing, especially for an economy that is not simply small but which exports a very high percentage of its gross national product, the rate of evolution of wages is exceedingly important.</P>
    <P>Price changes are the biggest determinant in wage changes.  Wages follow prices as a rule.  There are moments when wage demands can be inflationary, but generally they compensate.  With the great rise in the price of oil which occurred after the oil shock in 1973 and which has recurred more slowly in a number of steps during the period in office of this Government, we have seen inflation brought in from outside.  Nobody denies that.  Nobody who wants to make any shot at telling it like it is can try to minimise the seriousness of the inflation that was brought to us due to the increase in the price of energy, or indeed the seriousness of the transfer of <Col N="989" /> resources away trom us because of increases in the price of energy.  I have to say that after 1973, with the continued existence of OPEC and the great success of the original OPEC manoeuvre, anyone who thought in 1977 that it would never happen again was either stupid or dishonest, or both.  It is obvious that we are living in a world in which in the foreseeable future, probably until fusion becomes technically feasible, and that will be a long time away, we will have manipulation of energy shortages and the transfer of wealth away from our economy because of the high cost of energy.</P>
    <P>I recall, with some contempt, the efforts of people now in Government to minimise the seriousness of those things during my period in Government.  I am not minimising them now&mdash;of course they are serious&mdash;but the prudent response, firstly in recognising those dangers and secondly trying to minimise them, realises that when you get an imported inflation the whole trick is not to roll it on at home and let the further subsequent stimulus come from internal developments, because the engine of inflation is not continuously the same.</P>
    <P>It varies from time to time and it is never a single thing: there is a contribution from wages and there is a contribution from Government economic policy, Government financial policy, Government taxation policy.  There is a contribution from the rate of evolution of raw materials worldwide.  There is a contribution from a specific rate of energy prices, and so on.  It is always complicated. There is a shifting dominant force, and it is a very important thing in our economy not to follow up the thump that we get from some external price explosion by adding to it with imprudent Government policies.  If you get that you cannot hold the wage front.  If you cannot hold the wage front you get a subsequent rolling on of this wheel of inflation because of internal causes which were not alone not controlled but were fermented by imprudent Government activity.  It is precisely that that seems to me so appalling in the policy outlined in <Col N="990" /> the Minister's speech.  It is diametrically inappropriate, directly opposite to what our economy needs, and it makes the economy very difficult to control.</P>
    <P>Certain persons will respond usually in ways that prudent people can predict. It is not foolish to think that if inflation is 20 per cent workers will want a 20 per cent wage rise.  You do not have to be clairvoyant to know that that is likely to happen.  It is not imprudent to predict that if the oil supplying countries can obtain the sort of disciplined control of the market and of the prices they have got they will go on increasing prices.  They will try not to do it in a way that will wreck the market economy of the world, but their own councils are divided and there are very different voices at OPEC meetings.</P>
    <P>These are given things: they are things that we know about and that prudent governments have to try to counteract. What I find so appalling is the exacerbation of the difficulties by doing diametrically wrong things.  Nobody denies the reality of the difficulties, but it is the inadequacy, the stupidity, the fatuity of the response that I find so appalling, and also the lack of frankness.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill and this budget are not in fact budgets for the whole year at all.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not back because the record will not show that it is the Minister of State who is occupying his chair.  I want to put it on the record, because the record has ears but no eyes.  I am sad the Minister is not back because I shook him out of his torpor with a reference to the relationship between himself and his civil servants.  I want to go back on that because in my own time in office I had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I respect the Chair, of course, but I find in your ruling, the expression of it in that simple way, that civil servants may not be <Col N="991" /> referred to&mdash;that formulation of the rules of the Chair I have to doubt the accuracy of.  Though doubting the accuracy of it, I must nonetheless accept it. I accept it, but I have to record that I do not think it is permissible for the Chair in rulings off the top of his head like that to expand the ambit of his powers.  I very much doubt that this is a ruling of the Chair that has received the assent of these Chambers of the Oireachtas over the period of their existence, that a speaker may not refer to a civil servant.  I doubt it.  It seems to me to be inherently improbable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to get into an argument with the Chair, but his amplification in that context is again so imprecise that it is not of any value to me.  I may, in order, though obviously on my feet I cannot quote the precedents, discuss the relation between Ministers and members of the public service in their Departments.  It is a question of some importance to me in this context and in the general context of Government in Ireland.  I admire our civil servants, though I often criticise things they do.  I admire their probity and dedication.  It seems to me that Ministers, in certain contexts, and Governments in certain contexts, are tempted to try to coerce their staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find a tendency in Irish public life in the last half year that I find worrying. When I look at the quality of the recent appointments of Ministers of State and at certain persons who have been judged to be of sufficient competence to be members of Government, I worry for the quality of our public life.  It seems to me we are getting into a personal style of Government with the whiff of authority and of intimidation about it.  It is very much my wish that in the coming years, which economically will be difficult&mdash;I am certainly not going to minimise the <Col N="992" /> difficulties facing the Government&mdash;the members of the public service in the carrying on of their duties, in the assessing of the facts, the analysing of the data, will be protected from any sort of intimidation for political purposes to cover up the sort of practices that I have deplored, the sort of practices that were introduced in 1977 for party political purposes.  If we are to have the sort of social harmony that will enable us to have reasonable wage settlements, to control the rate of the evolution of prices in those areas that lie within our competence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for the Chair to see the relevance of your remarks to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It may arise, because the linking was to come later in the paragraph.  I am nearly finished.  The relevance will emerge.  In the management of our economy, if we are to have social peace and if we are to bring the whole fabric of society undamaged through what undeniably will be difficult times, then it is exceedingly important that the facts be told openly and honestly to the public.  That is why the sort of complacency that I referred to at the beginning of my speech and a number of times in the text, the course and the body of it, is so serious.  That is why I find very worrying the sort of statement to which I made initial reference and I quote it again.  The Minister said in page 2 of his circulated text:</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the budget statement, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1980 has been calculated at 10.4 per cent of GNP...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is just the sort of imprecision and vagueness and fudginess that I find very dangerous.  What has he said?  I referred in an earlier part of my text to that imprecision. He did not quite say it, he fudged it: &ldquo;has been calculated at 10.4 per cent.&rdquo;  He did not say, &ldquo;My officers have calculated it should be that&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The Central Bank think it will be that&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The ESRI think it will be that&rdquo;.  He <Col N="993" /> said, &ldquo;has been calculated at 10.4 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In other words, he used a figure which he does not try to authenticate or validate, which he does not even give the provenance of, for what is a deceptive purpose.  He immediately juxtaposed the &ldquo;has been calculated at 10.4 per cent&rdquo; for this year, with the rigorous figure of 13.7 per cent for last year.  That figure is not a matter of estimate, whosever estimate we do not know.  That is not a &ldquo;has been calculated&rdquo; figure.  That is a figure we know is right.  Having juxtaposed a &ldquo;has been calculated at 10.4 per cent&rdquo; with a real figure of 13.7 per cent for last year, the next words are &ldquo;Such progress, however, will have to be continued and built upon in the coming years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the bad intention of the political apologetic and not the rigour of the educated public servant.  It is just that sort of cheating with figures that I find very dangerous in this context.  I do not like phrases like &ldquo;has been calculated&rdquo;.  We have had too much great tradition of dirty talk in this parliament and in this country.  That is the formulation that if you analyse it means almost nothing.  The punters and indeed the people who draw up the articles in the newspapers, and even more once further removed, the people who read the articles in the newspapers, will say, &ldquo;I hear it will be only 10.4 per cent this year.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister said, it &ldquo;has been calculated&rdquo;.  Next year he can say, &ldquo;Somebody else calculated it would be 15 per cent; I just gave somebody's estimate.&rdquo;  If the estimate was made by so-and-so, he did not even say it comes with the weight of the expertise of his people out of his own Department.</P>
    <P>That is cheating, the sort of cheating that is very dangerous.  Having told lies for the most worthless of purposes in 1977, and having exacerbated the situation that would have been difficult and dangerous anyway, there is a great need now if you want reasonable wage settlements and social harmony at this late date, and perhaps being repentant in crisis, there is the great need now to start <Col N="994" /> telling the truth, to start taking the situation seriously, but neither truthfulness nor seriousness is expressed in what the Minister had to say.</P>
    <P>I have one last quote, from Mr. Con Riordan of North Kerry in <i>The Kerryman</i> of 13 June 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I should know him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that another Kerryman has interjected.  I should know him, is that what the Minister said?  Perhaps the record did not quite get it.  What Mr. Riordan said is this:</P>
      <P>I feel entitled to express my disappointment at the Government's performance to date;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The bit that particularly appeals to me is, because I feel exactly the same:</P>
      <P>&mdash;my helpless frustration at being unable to undo some of the things that have been done now that the election is over.</P>
      <P>I share that helpless frustration of Mr. Riordan.  I do not for a moment minimise the difficulty of the situation we are in.  Can I, having said hard things, assure the Minister that the moment he or his Government start behaving responsibly in this difficulty and start telling the truth and stop trying to distract us by PR mechanisms to look at everything else in our society except the economy, he will find a responsible reaction from the Opposition?  My conviction is, though I am in no position to speak for them, that he will find a responsible reaction from the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What seems to be so dreadful is that one has complacent exhortations on the one hand and bad example on the other hand.  It is for those reasons, the reasons of the seriousness of our present economic situation and for the triviality and the lack of frankness and the complacency and indeed the sheer irrelevance of the response of the budget and of the Second Stage speech by the Minister here in the Seanad; it is <Col N="995" /> precisely because the situation is so serious; it is preciesly because the country would like a lead; precisely because all of the responsible elements in the country would like to have the truth told to them, would like to be asked to cohere, to coalesce and solve the problem truthfully and vigorously, and indeed if need be at the cost of some disadvantage and some suffering and some reduction in living standards, it is because we would like that lead, not triviality and complacency, that I have taken so much time on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this Finance Bill in the Seanad, to discuss financial matters and in a particularly difficult time, as has been stressed by a number of speakers.  Before getting down to the nitty-gritty of the Bill, it seems to me that the manner in which we order the debating of financial and economic affairs in Oireachtas Éireann leaves a great deal to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a modern economy with vast sums of money being voted to the various Departments.  We have this system in parliament in which in a short few hours we pass hundreds of millions of pounds without, in my view, adequate control.  Looking at how businesses in the private sector manage their affairs, there is a great deal to be said for some type of budgetary committee system in the Oireachtas as occurs in many other parliaments.  In an ordered system in which, under headings of State expenditure, the Government would appoint Ministers of State as chairmen of various committees in which Members of both Houses would participate, in advance of a budget we would be able to shape spending and exert democratic control over many headings.  This is not happening at the present time.  There is a tremendous weakness in the Oireachtas and it is not so much in the Executive, not so much in Government, because Government in their capacity to rule have an excellent civil service.  The Oireachtas, or parliament, is extremely weak.  We are sitting <Col N="996" /> and speaking in one of the weakest parliaments in the free world.  I would welcome some development of a budgetary committee system which I have described as a future type of organisation of Parliamentary economic work.  While I am saying that it would be pertinent as well to refer again to the appallingly bad circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The final point I want to make, with your indulgence, is simply to refer again to what has been referred to by many Deputies and Senators in various political parties and under different Governments&mdash;the extremely poor facilities there are.  We have had a commitment by this Government and by past Governments to improve the circumstances in which we work here.  I for one do not believe that these facilities will be improved until we actually see the improvements.  There is a weakness and a mockery of democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed relevant on the Finance Bill.  We are discussing Government economic policy.  I share the view of most Opposition speakers that the country is in an appallingly bad state, and very few people are aware of the depths into which we have been plunged.  Coming from a business background&mdash;naturally I am suspect because I am speaking from this side of the House&mdash;apart from my political interests <Col N="997" /> in my experience and my contacts with the business community of this country, unless one goes back a generation to the difficulties we had in an era of mass emigration, I have never seen confidence shattered in the business community of this country as much as it has been in recent months.</P>
      <P>I take the point that there is a world recession.  I know its extent through some contacts I have outside the country.  I am aware of the lack of confidence in the United States.  I am aware of the recession there is within most EEC countries, but that in itself cannot be offered as the excuse for our parlous state.</P>
      <P>Discussing the Finance Bill at this time is interesting because we are talking about a Government about two-thirds of the way through their period of office. There has been a coup within the Government; we have a different Government now from that which took power in 1977, and it is time to take stock and review economic policy.  I have to agree with my colleagues on this side that one of the major contributory forces in the present state of our economy has been the Fianna Fáil general election manifesto of 1977 which will be required reading here for centuries and will go down to posterity with the Book of Kells and other noted documents.  Original copies of it will become valuable in time, for all kinds of different reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That manifesto set out to buy votes.  It is as simple as that.  I was involved in the Oireachtas four or five years prior to that.  I was aware of the difficult circumstances leading up to that election.  The means by which they went out and abolished, for example, car tax was simple strategy.  They went into households on a canvass and said: &ldquo;Give us your vote, you in this house will not pay £40 tax or £70 tax&rdquo;.  Even that policy alone I regard as very bad social policy in the sense that the better off elements of the community benefited the, greatest from that car tax policy because what happened was that in upper income circles <Col N="998" /> people ran large cars or two cars or even three cars per household.  Extensions of that might give one family ten, 15 or 20 cars.</P>
    <P>Car tax was abolished as a sop.  What about the lower income people who do not run motor cars?  How did they benefit? What did the Exchequer lose through the revenue lost to the State to Keep roads in reasonable repair in a poor country such as ours?  The upper income people benefited tremendously through this policy strategy.</P>
    <P>Other elements of the anti-social policy of the Government have been in the budget of this year.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald quantified precisely the extent to which tax concessions benefited the better off members of the community. I re-echo what Senator Keating said&mdash;if you want social justice, leadership from a Government, an ordered society in which various elements will pull together and make the sacrifices which people will have to make in the next two to three years irrespective of which Government are in power, if we expect the people to respond to leadership, leadership in turn must set the guidelines and standards. What we have got is misguided policy, mismanaging the social structure, giving the major benefits to those sections which need it least and leaving the poorer sections without comparable benefits.  It is the type of Government which will not evoke the response which the nation demands and which will ultimately fail, and this is why leadership is so important.</P>
    <P>At the root of all the problems we are having in inflation.  The catastrophic consequences of high levels of inflation are incalculable because they hit at all of the fabric of society in any country. They affect the whole structure of wages which underpins whether we are going to be competitive in exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the suspension of business I was speaking about Government economic policy and the extremely difficult position this country is in at present.  I was going back to the events of the general election of 1977.  Government policies were promised to the public at that time and implemented by the new Government.  I was making the case that, despite the extremely difficult international circumstances at present, the Government have contributed in no uncertain manner to the state this country is in and to our general economic problems.  Look at the budget of 1979, what was promised at that time and the extent to which there was a shortfall in Government estimates. In February 1979, the then Minister for Finance forecast an inflation rate of 5 per cent.  The reality worked out at 16 per cent and inflation now is running at about 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister at that time spoke about the Government's over-riding and firm intention to come to grips with unemployment and inflation.  The extent to which there is no control is very obvious from recent figures.  We had a balance of payments deficit running wild.  The balance of payments deficit in 1978 was running at £150 million and in 1979 it was running at more than double that figure.  We had the forecast of borrowing requirement by the Minister at that time of approximately £779 million.  The out-turn at the end of the year was about £1,000 million.  We had the servicing of the national debt, which is at the root of some of the intractable problems we had at that time.  This is the most unfortunate aspect of the intractability of the problems.  Regardless of which government are in power, there are intractable problems which are inherent in a very bad financial structure.  The present national debt, for example, and the contribution to the servicing of it by the average family of four people works out at about £14 per week.  We had the commitment in the Government's manifesto on which they were elected to office that public borrowing in proportion to the gross national product would be reduced <Col N="1000" /> substantially.  It is spelled out there, in its reduction from 13 per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1979, which was the year the Government were committed to reduce the public borrowing percentage as a proportion of GNP to a level of about 10½ per cent, it apparently worked out at approximately 13½ per cent.  In other words it was wild of targets and wild of estimates, indicating that the economy was on a runaway horse, without any evidence of Governmental control.  I am interested to note in the Minister's speech that the present estimate of public borrowing, in proportion to the GNP, may end up this year at the level of 10½ per cent.  I hope he is right.  I hope the forecast is right.  I suspect it will end up somewhat higher than that.  If it does, it certainly will, at the end of the day, have to be brought down to realistic levels if there is to be a sane policy.</P>
    <P>I take great issue with the Government in their job creation policy, particularly for one reason.  If we analyse the jobs that have been created since the Government went into office, in 1978, for example, half of the jobs for which the Government claim credit were apparently created in the civil service.  I have experience as a Member of the Oireachtas for some years of the efficiency and the sense of dedication and the integrity of the civil service in this country.  I hold it in extremely high regard.  However, I am absolutely opposed to a policy, in stringent economic times, under which a Government are going to fuel inflation by a direct policy of creating jobs in a civil service.  Any government democratically elected can, with the stroke of a pen, create jobs in the civil service.  It is a great idea because you are creating jobs but we have to question how they are going to be paid for.  The Government could create 20,000 jobs in the civil service this year if they chose to do so.  If they are going to do that the jobs can only be paid out of income taxation by the existing members of the public or by foreign borrowing. That has a cannibalising effect.  You are going to fuel inflation at a staggering level if you are going to create such jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> For example, the 1978 figure of 12,500 jobs probably carries an annual wage bill of about £80 million.  If this £80 million does not come out of production, does not come out of the land, or from our industrial resources, out of mining or possible oil resources in the future, it will have to come directly out of income taxation of the general public of this country.  It is a policy to which I take exception, and I would not like in any sense to be associated with a Government which attempted to tackle the economic problems of the country in this manner.  I could refer to the period when we were in Government, in very difficult circumstances after the first Dáil crisis, when one of the policies adopted by the Government with which I was associated was to insist that there be absolutely no new recruitment in the civil service through that period, an instruction from the then Taoiseach that went down through the ranks and was implemented. The policy we have been faced with led to the type of catastrophe to which Senator Whitaker referred.  It is due directly to the policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have misread the position in placing too much faith in the private sector.  We have a private sector in the country which is relatively successful.  I have always taken the view that the private sector could not or does not have the capacity to provide the number of jobs which the Government apparently thought could be done.  The private sector has not been helped by the present Government, for different reasons.  Inflation is the root of all the problems we have.  Inflation has to do with leadership and with the ability of the Government not simply to preach a policy of low wage demands, but to give the type of leadership that will result in the implementation and the achieving of the objectives, rather than simply stating them.</P>
    <P>The inflation figure is wild, it is way above the acceptable level.  It is creating pressures within the EMS.  We are running at about double the level of European <Col N="1002" /> countries.  We are doing this at a period when we are within the EMS, which Britain did not join, and in circumstances in which we were told that the spill-over effects of the British economy on ours would not have the same effect.</P>
    <P>The economists will tell you that rampant inflation has been directly responsibility for the exceptionally high interest rates in this country at the present time, where the average cost of borrowing money is running at about 20 per cent. That is a direct consequence of the level of inflation, and in so far as the private sector is concerned in its contribution to the development of the economy this interest rate is extremely difficult to contend with, especially in the circumstances of world economy.</P>
    <P>Additionally, a direct consequence of the same policies was the starving of capital and the inability of so many people in the private sector to borrow the money even if they chose to borrow it at such high interest rates.  I have been aware of projects of development potential which were refused money by the banks who pleaded they were working under the directives of the Central Bank, and the Central Bank in turn are responsible to the Minister.  So, whilst we had a Government stating their willingness to foster private enterprise we had a reality in which the private sector were operating under circumstances and under policies implemented by the Government which were retarding their capacity to contribute as much as they might to the economy.</P>
    <P>The budget this year had some welcome features.  There is an attempt to get to grips with the public capital programme.  The Minister referred, and I welcome this, to the problems in so far as bills for the civil service are concerned and the notion that, because there is security of employment, there must be certain moderation in demand, with which I agree.  One disastrous decision of the Government in the budget this year was to tax hydrocarbon oil for industry. It is mad and running totally counter to what a Government should <Col N="1003" /> be doing in this particular area.  The whole issue of energy is at the root of the international crisis at present.  We are very vulnerable because we have very slim resources of energy&mdash;we have a turf resource, we have very limited coal resources, we have not yet discovered oil.  A huge proportion of the energy bill has to be paid for by imports of oil or coal.  Oil has risen by catastrophic percentages over the last five or six years, putting tremendous pressures on industries which use oil, many in very considerable volume.</P>
    <P>Petrol is another issue.  The Government are vulnerable on the petrol issue because petrol is no longer a luxury.  The increase in the excise duty on petrol hits less privileged people in rural Ireland because a car is a necessity for getting to work, to Mass, and for visiting friends. In the norm of political context the Government are open to criticism on the increase in the price of petrol.  I want to put this excise duty, where industry is concerned, into another category completely and to suggest to the Minister that it was a scandalous decision.  I am aware of a number of industries using substantial amounts of oil, in some cases up to 20 per cent of the total cost of their products.  They are under extreme difficulty in competing in the present age, especially if they are in the export trade. They now have to face penal increases in the cost of a raw material which is a vital component in the production of their article. On top of what has happened to the price of oil the Government, in extracting tax, are perhaps instrumental in some cases in sending these industries to the wall&mdash;extracting tax to pay some of the civil servants for the jobs created in 1978.  Are we so starved for money that the Government had to tax oil for industry for this type of madness?  I want to put on record my complete dissatisfaction with that aspect of the budget this year, and I am supported by the Confederation of Irish Industry and the intense criticism there has been from that sector in so far as Government policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and again referring <Col N="1004" /> to the energy crisis.  I welcome the recent activity of the new Minister for Energy.  I commend him for the initiative he is displaying. He seems to be doing a good job.  When I last spoke here, I think it was in the debate before Christmas, I was very critical of the fact that there was no co-ordinated energy policy.  This was referred to in the last OECD report published in August of last year.  It commented that there was no apparent co-ordinated energy policy in this country, and of course there was none.  Whilst the Minister is active, it is not before time, because we have had an energy crisis for a number of years and there was an apparent lack of interest in Government circles in tackling it.</P>
    <P>Apparently there is still sufficient turf in this country to make us self-sufficient in energy for another 30 or 40 years, independent of other fuels.  There is vast scope for development there, especially on the marginal bogs which Bord na Móna have not tackled for obvious reasons due to their scale of operations.  On many of these marginal bogs the totality in the counties in which they exist adds up to a very substantial energy resource, in relation to which, until recently, there were absolutely no Government grants to open up roads, no Government grants for development or for the drainage of such bogs.  I welcome the energy displayed recently by the Minister and the apparent receptiveness to State aid in this sector which is vital, especially since we are spending over £500 million on oil, which is about 6½ per cent of our output.</P>
    <P>I take exception to one aspect of policy, far removed from the Finance Bill but regarding energy development and bog development.  It is not a political point, but there has to be a change of policy in so far as the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are concerned. Up to now it has been sensible to plant trees on any kind of marginal land that the Department could get their hands on but there has to be a change of priority in the sense that Forestry have planted hundreds of acres of trees on high bog.  I think there should be a change in that <Col N="1005" /> policy and there should be co-ordination between Bord na Móna and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, because it seems that a sensible national energy policy requires that, in so far as high bog is concerned, the national priority must be to cut that bog down to the acceptable level above the sub-soil and at that stage allow for the planting of trees or whatever is desirable in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey these remarks concerning the high bog issue to his colleague in Government, the Minister for Energy, to seek some directive from the Government to get this desirable co-ordination of policy between Forestry and Bord na Móna so that there is a change of policy.  I feel so strongly about this that even in the land bank that the Forestry Department have at present, on which there has been minimal expenditure so far, I would welcome a transfer of these lands to agencies concerned with turf development so that the national interest would be better served.</P>
    <P>There are a few remarks I would like to make about the west of Ireland and regional development, an issue with which I have been concerned for a number of years.  We took the view in Government that this is a country of incredible centralisation, where the vast range of decision-making is made in this city and where there is little autonomy in the provinces.  We have had one outstanding example of successful autonomy in the form of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, and the mystery seemed to be that we had this single example of decision-making in the provinces.  Many of us took the view that this model, which was successful, should simply be built on.</P>
    <P>If a certain policy and a certain structure of development were desirable in the mid-west region, based on Shannon and Limerick, there was no reason why, if the model was working well, this model, or variations on it, should not also be necessary in the western counties of Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, <Col N="1006" /> Leitrim or in Donegal or in the south-east or in the midland counties.  There was a basic structural flaw in Government organisation in not analysing whether SFADCo was a success, for example, and the areas in which the structure might be modified or added to and built on in other parts of this country.  I do not think we have learned the lessons from that.  If it has been a failure SFADCo should be scrapped.  If it has been a success we should look at it and give the same benefits of autonomy and decision-making that are in the provinces to the people of the western and southern counties, the south-east and the Midlands as we have been giving to people in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that during the tenure of the last Government we became committed to the establishment of what was described as a Western Development Board.  Unfortunately, that board was not established, for different reasons.  The Government became committed to it.  Work continued in the Department of Finance as the coordinating Department.  Consultations took place with all the Ministries of State and submissions were made from each of these Departments.  I believe that had we gone back into Government that board would have been established within a couple of years.  I regret that it was not established during that time.  The Government to a degree probably were responsible in not tackling it with the vigour that they might have had but, subsequent to the new Government coming in, an announcement was made by Deputy MacSharry, Minister of State at the time, about the Government scrapping these proposals.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, whether in scrapping this the Minister was scrapping the old concept of autonomy for regional development in the provinces.  He assured me that this was not the case, that studies were being pursued in his Department regarding suitable autonomous structures within the country and that he would at some stage report back to us. <Col N="1007" /> There was absolutely no comment for about 12 months concerning this issue of regional structures and since the reshuffle of the Cabinet there has not been any comment on this issue.  The Government may not have been under pressure to do so.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a statement by the Minister about the position in so far as regional development is concerned and about what is, in fact, happening to the work which was being carried out by Deputy O'Donoghue concerning suitable sub-national levels for development purposes, whether the Government intend introducing a policy to build on the SFADCo success, or whether there is to be a continuation of the type of centralisation which we have had.</P>
    <P>I gave an example here some months ago which is factual and which shows the total nonsense of the centralisation of this country.  It is a very minor example but it shows the extent to which we are centralised and to which we are not creating many jobs in the provinces.  I gave the example of a case in which a farmer is building a new house and must apply in the first instance, not to his local county council&mdash;which is a local management structure with a tradition built up over the years, a structure which can cater 100 per cent for the applications and the decision-making in areas such as this&mdash;but to Dublin for an application form, must return it to Dublin, must apply to the county council for a second form and must return that to the county council.</P>

      <P>The Chair is wondering whether the Senator is going from the scope of the Finance Bill which deals with taxation, general expenditure and financial policy.  Administration and matters of administration will arise on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, but simply because finance covers a multitude I thought I would have sufficient latitude.  If you will allow me to perhaps develop one or two sentences I will get back to areas that are more properly <Col N="1008" /> within the scope of the Bill.  In the example I was giving, when the house is half built the farmer again writes to the Department of the Environment to tell them that the house is half built.  The Department, in turn, write to the inspector in that county to tell him the house is half built and the inspector then visits the farmer.  The Department are then notified that the house is half built and the Department pay the first half of the grant from Dublin, subsequent to which the county council pay the second half.  When the house is completed, the farmer again writes to the Department in Dublin, notifies them that the house is completed, the Department notify the local inspector who goes to see that the house is completed and he, in turn, writes to his Department to tell them that it is completed.  They send the grant and this is followed by the county council paying their section of the grant.</P>
      <P>All of the administration which is tied up in that basically terribly simple exercise can be carried out in the council chamber in Carlow or the council chamber in Nenagh, or in Castlebar, Donegal or Meath.  It means that there are a large number of jobs in the city of Dublin which could otherwise be spread to the provinces and, unless the Government conscientiously set out to look at these issues of centralisation and de-centralisation and issues concerned with autonomy in the provinces, nothing can happen, because it is the duty of Government to sort out these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am finished with that. I presume I am allowed to refer to this question of an airport in the west which was headlined in the papers last Sunday. I will not press the issue.  If you suggest that it is outside the scope of the Bill, I will not even refer to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of an airport, presumably financial considerations are very necessary in regard to the funding of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if an airport is to be provided in the western province, there will be budgetary considerations which will concern the Minister for Finance, so it is appropriate in that sense.</P>
      <P>I spoke last year about this issue.  The north western counties have huge transport problems.  Our roads are poor.  The approach roads to Dublin from the west are disastrous and, in so far as an airport is concerned&mdash;and I am glad the Minister is here because he will be very concerned in any decision-making in relation to this&mdash;we are not served a fraction as well as other sections of the country.  From Galway city and south of it they are within the ambit of Shannon Airport.  The southern regions of Cork, Kerry and Waterford are within the ambit of Cork.  The Eastern counties are relatively near Dublin; but when you get to south Donegal, Mayo, north Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Leitrim, there is not this national amenity which people in other parts of this island have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary for development purposes, apart altogether from social reasons.  There is a substantial amount of industrial development in these counties, and many of the people in these industries need to get in and out of that region in a much better fashion than they can at present.  Additionally, if we want to develop tourism in the western counties to the extent to which it might be done, air traffic is vital, and being able to land tourists within an hour or an hour and a half of the region which they <Col N="1010" /> are visiting is becoming more and more important.  There is a large segment of the tourist market which Cork and Kerry, for example, have access to but which we simply do not have access to. We are excluded through the lack of this transport amenity.</P>
    <P>The recent study done by Bord Fáilte and Father Horan in Knock suggested that somewhere in the region of Charlestown is the place.  I will not be narrow in my considerations about a location, but a location somewhere in the north east Mayo, south Sligo, north Roscommon area would service a very large area and would be very desirable.  I crave the Minister's indulgence to give it a sympathetic hearing when it raises its head in a serious manner.</P>
    <P>I have to say a few things about the manifesto, of which I have a copy here, because presumably it is the basis of present Government policy.  I believe it to be an extremely shallow document in many ways.  It speaks of a boost for the building industry which is in a parlous state at present.  We have had a commitment in a &ldquo;Buy Irish Campaign&rdquo; to the switching of 3p in every £ from imports to home products.  There is no evidence whatever that there has been success in that area.  I remember we were berated in Government for a supposed lack of policy.  One of the keynotes of the manifesto is the &ldquo;Buy Irish Campaign&rdquo;. There is no evidence of a successful policy.  We had what was described as an action programme which would lower inflation, cut unemployment dramatically, and restore stability to Government finances.</P>
    <P>Inflation&mdash;we know the position.  Inflation is at the root of all our problems. Unless this Government or future Governments can contain inflation, disaster will follow.  A successful cutting of inflation leads to sanity, leads to slow progress, to the creation of jobs, to a successful export situation, to the competitiveness of companies, to the inherent value of savings, to a sane thrifty approach to life by the population. Inflation is rampant.  We are at the 20 per cent level now.  Who can tell us that <Col N="1011" /> we will not be at the 30 per cent or the 40 per cent level or the 50 per cent level in two or three years' time, because it fuels itself?  We have seen it in South America.  We have seen it in the State of Israel running at about 110 per cent. Who can tell us at this moment that the Irish inflation rate in three years' time will not be 40 per cent?</P>
    <P>If this happens the whole attitude of people to savings has got to change.  If inflation is contained, there is some sense in people saving, there is some sense in people investing, there is some sense in people looking at an interest rate as something that is of concern to them.  In the era we have been living through saving is for the birds, saving is a madness. Coming from a business background and looking around me at what has been happening in recent years, I think the only sane policy, if one is in any kind of development area, is to simply borrow to the hilt, use other people's money, do not save because there is no point in saving. If you have liquid resources get rid of them as quickly as you possibly can, because the interest rate they will pay you will be a half, or a third, or a quarter, of the rate of inflation when you adjust for tax.</P>
    <P>We have had a war between town and country.  This is one of the factors necessitating a policy on inflation.  There has to be some semblance of national unity between the different elements of society if we are to be successful.  There is a war for which the Government are ultimately responsible.  The farming community whom we had started to tax during the period of the last Government were scared in the election campaign in 1977 into believing that, if they returned the then Government, if they did not return a Fianna Fáil Government, they would be liable for tax.  In County Mayo, when we introduced taxation on farmers with £100 valuation or more, there was an outcry among the farming community over the Government's tax proposals.  There are 100,000 people in that county.  I went through the records of this House and found that there were only 70 farmers in the entire county with <Col N="1012" /> a valuation of £100 or more and only a handful of them were in the constituency of west Mayo.  They were scared of tax.</P>
    <P>The Government started a policy to tax farmers.  The farming community became incensed because they felt it was a double-cross.  Subsequent to that, the Government relented on the taxation policy on the farming community which, in turn, incensed the work force who were paying such a high proportion of their income through the PAYE system. Government policy in this area, instead of being frank and direct and even-handed, has been waffling and insinuating and uneven-handed and reacting to the pressures of the section that is the strongest and the section that has been exerting the pressure.  This has not given an air of confidence or of interest in the even-handed policy which is necessary.</P>
    <P>The manifesto says that clear and decisive action will be taken to overcome inflation.  I do not see where that action is.  It said that it would restore the Government's own finances.  During the period prior to the 1977 election, the present Government were extremely critical of the level of borrowing by the then Government hit by the first oil crisis. Borrowing figures are now running at much higher levels than they had ever been in the history of this State.  Apparently that is acceptable when they are in Government, but not when other people are in Government, even though it is at a lesser level.</P>
    <P>On industry and commerce, in the manifesto there is a commitment to reduce the price of electricity&mdash;which makes the most incredible reading&mdash;due to some supposed look at ESB accounting procedures.  The price of electricity has gone up by about 40 per cent since then.  There is a commitment on page eight to establish an industrial development consortium.  Apparently there was dissatisfaction with the level of development.  The main thrust was to be to develop industries based on national resources.  An estate agency was to be set up, a Seán Lemass type industrial development consortium chaired by the <Col N="1013" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I gather that a committee of sorts has been established but this consortium has been practically unheard of since then. Apparently it has no influence whatever and is not influential in any sense in deciding on the direction policy will take.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Industry and Commerce&rdquo; the manifesto says:</P>
    <P>Payments to the State (taxation, social welfare, etc) will be reviewed periodically to help maintain competitiveness under severe trading conditions.</P>
    <P>That is a very interesting sentence.  I have given an example of Government policy in the budget of this year directed against industry, directed against jobs, and raising the duty on hydrocarbon oil to industry making it very uncompetitive. Instead of reducing the level of duty on the commodity which is the source of energy used mostly in this country, we increase the tax level which industry is expected to pay in these extremely difficult times on this island which has many disadvantages in terms of a base for exporting or competing with outside industries.  This has not happened.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment to establish an export credit finance corporation.  I am not aware of it having been established. In all it is a shoddy document which has done a disservice to the Fianna Fáil Party, the public and to politics.  I hope we will not see its like again.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry commitment in the manifesto is to a 50-mile limit as an urgent necessity.  They were four years in Opposition up to 1977 and called constantly for the declaration of a 50-mile limit which, of course, we have not seen. The Government propose to tax boat owners under VAT and people who work in those boats through the PAYE system.  I am in sympathy with an even-handed taxation policy, but it is a nettle which is very difficult to grasp in so far as our very limited inshore fishing industry is concerned.  Some people in the fishing industry fish for salmon.  On the <Col N="1014" /> surface it may seem that they are getting a substantial income and when the fish are running they make a substantial income, but they work in hazardous circumstances and life is sometimes at stake.  It is an industry where there are substantial overheads by way of fishing vessels and nets which need to be replaced frequently.</P>
    <P>A lot of this fishing activity is in areas such as the north Mayo coast where there are very few alternative means of employment and where the income earned by the fishermen in a short few weeks is effectively their annual income. There are difficulties in this area and there is a need for sensitivity about the difficult positions these people find themselves in.  From talking to a number of these fishermen I feel that, if the Government impose taxation at the level which is their present objective, there will be a distinct lack of interest on the part of many people in investing in the fishing industry.  Many fishing vessels will be sold because the overheads of running these boats and having to replace nets and the hazards and risk to life all make it a very difficult industry.  I had personal experience this year in the commercial fishing vessel market of an extreme sluggishness in selling any kind of vessel that will go to sea because of the difficulties in that industry.  I should like to thank you, Sir, for your indulgence if I strayed a little from the provisions of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This country, in common with many other countries, is going through a very difficult time.  It would be idle to pretend that all of the difficulties are of our own making.  We must be honest and realise at the outset that some of the difficulties which confront us, and make life so difficult are due, in the main, to increases in the cost of energy.  People should realise that.  The difficulty in having a widespread realisation of that fact springs, to some degree, from the campaign of the party now in office before the last election which was directed towards convincing the electorate that the difficulties experienced during the time of the National <Col N="1015" /> Coalition Government were caused by misgovernment.  They were attributable in large measure to a totally unexpected increase in the price of oil, something nobody foresaw at the time.  During the election campaign the party then in Opposition tried to convince people that this was a negligible factor in generating the difficulties that confronted the people. Now these difficulties have become aggravated.  Because of the indoctrination of the people, there is a general unawareness and reluctance to accept the fact that these difficulties are there, and that we must set about tackling them and dealing with them.  It was a pity that people have been led astray in that way and conned into thinking those are not the facts.</P>
      <P>Another point we must keep in mind as a background to the difficulties that confronted the Minister in his budget was the mistake made in the 1979 budget of imposing agricultural levies which the farming organisations had no difficulty in proving were unjust.  They mounted a protest against what they could prove to be an unjust form of taxation and the Minister for Finance was forced to yield ground.  That, in itself, encouraged other sections of the community to come to think that if they wanted justice under this Government they had to get out on the streets and protest. That led to general dissatisfaction and a desire on the one hand to contribute less to the revenue and on the other hand to demand more.  Individually each would lead us into trouble.  Together they are bound to lead us into the economic morass Senator Whitaker spoke about yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation and as a people we should take a look at our position and make a list of the big problems that confront us. We have the problem of inflation.  We have the problem of living beyond our means and borrowing abroad to maintain an unreal standard of living.  We have adverse trade figures.  We have industrial unrest and a general desire to try to attain a higher standard of living without the realisation that a genuine improvement in the standard of living can <Col N="1016" /> come about only by increased production. Until we grasp these points firmly and see them clearly, we will continue to be in trouble.</P>
    <P>I rate inflation as being very high on the list of the major problems that confront us.  There were some good points in the budget and some serious mistakes.  I regard the failure to make genuine and effective efforts to curb inflation, to check it, to reduce it, as the biggest failure in the budget and in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There are various views among experts as to how much the budgetary policy contributed to the rise in inflation. Some experts put it at 4 per cent.  Some put it at 6 per cent.  It is not doubted on any side that the budgetary policy contributed to the rise in inflation.  That, in itself, is most unwise because it is such a serious matter, eating into our whole economy, that no action by the Government, if at all possible to be avoided, should contribute even one iota to an increase in inflation, because of all the serious effects that follow from it.  While we have inflation, said now to be in the region of 20 per cent, it is bound to cause the working community to look for increases in wages and salaries and that, in turn, will aggravate our trade balance position.  It will lead to more and more stoppages, more and more industrial unrest, and more and more closing down of industry.</P>
    <P>In the budget of 1980, whatever other impositions the Ministers might have had put on to check inflation, to let the community see he was in earnest about checking inflation, would be accepted if they were clearly understood.  We simply cannot go on allowing uncontrolled inflation and wage demands intended to preserve at least the same standard of living as prevailed before inflation.  If we pursue that endlessly, we are certainly approaching the day when we will be priced out of the world markets to an even greater degree than is happening at present.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us all to ask ourselves how much longer do we intend to maintain a standard of living by borrowing, <Col N="1017" /> and continuing to borrow more and more, instead of getting it across to the people that a genuine improvement in the standard of living comes from increased production.  The trade figures issued today by the Government Information Service on behalf of the Central Statistics Office make rather alarming reading.  For the five months January to May 1980, our import excess is £712.8 million.  For the 12 months ending in May 1980 our import excess is £1,398.2 million.  It does not have to be repeated here that that trend must be checked.</P>
    <P>In so far as any measures taken in the budget are likely to restrict production, and thereby worsen our trade balance figures, they would be regrettable.  If, for example, the farming community is left in a situation that allowance is not made for depreciation of machinery, such as is afforded to industry, if subsidies on lime and fertilisers are cut off, especially in the 12 western counties where there is great need for the application of fertilisers and lime, production is likely to fall, our exports are likely to fall and, therefore, the import excess will grow.  In these two spheres the budget failed.  To put it another way, perhaps the Minister did not avail himself of the opportunity afforded in the budget to check these developments and do something to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  When revenue has to be collected by the Minister for Finance, it should be seen to be demanded in fair proportions from different sections of the community. If some sections of the community can prove that they are being unjustly dealt with, discontent will spread and there is less acceptance of the obligation to pay their share.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by other speakers&mdash;and I do not want to enlarge on it or to develop it any further than others have done&mdash;that the farming community had no difficulty whatever in pointing out that they were getting what could be called a raw deal.  The resource tax&mdash;another name for the wealth tax&mdash;is based on an unsound basis in so <Col N="1018" /> far as it is calculated on Griffith's poor law valuation.  Experts have shown for a number of years that Griffith's valuation is not accurate in that it does not assess correctly, or even nearly correctly, the production potential of various areas of land in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I read in farming magazines recently that in County Wexford it can be shown that land in the very fertile Clonroche area is not as highly valued as land in another area in the same county.  The indications in the report I read were that that is applicable all over the country. Areas of land with much greater production potential are not as highly valued as other areas with a lesser production percentage. A resource tax based on figures like that is bound to generate discontent amongst the people.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough having to make a big contribution to running the affairs of the country, but if one man finds that the share he is asked to contribute from a smaller potential is greater than the share another man is asked to contribute from a greater potential, we are bound to have unrest and dissatisfaction.  In that way the resource tax is wrongly based and has built up a great deal of discontent. When we examine it further and find that no allowance whatever is made for depreciation of machinery, sickness, losses and so on, it becomes the kind of measure that will arouse widespread displeasure and opposition as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Farmers are further worried by the fact that, while there was an indication at one stage that the resource tax was to be introduced for a short period only, it now appears likely to be continued for a longer period.  If the Minister could assure the House in his reply that it is not intended that this resource tax should continue indefinitely he would do a good deal to dispel the gloom that prevails on the land at present.</P>
    <P>We have the fact that&mdash;others have dealt with it and it is worthy of examination&mdash;farm incomes are falling. That has been said here, and it is an undoubted fact.  Farmers' income in 1979 was lower than in 1978.  The indications <Col N="1019" /> are that in the eighties it will be lower still.  As a result of the great uncertainty that prevails in Europe with regard to a common agricultural policy there is a disturbing belief that incomes will drop considerably.  Far from being in a position of opulence, which some people would want others to believe with regard to the farming community, many of them are just struggling.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by an independent firm of professional consultants on the Erne catchment area was published last week.  I was astonished to read that the income of 44 per cent of farmers of Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal in 1978 was below £2.000.  If it was below £2,000 in 1978 it was probably below £1.800 in 1979 and it could come down perhaps this year to the £1,600 level. The idea that is put abroad by certain sections of the community that farmers are rolling in wealth and able to meet any demand that may come from the Minister for Finance is an entirely erroneous one.  It is only right that the facts and figures be put before the people so that they have an opportunity of understanding that farmers are not rolling in wealth.</P>
    <P>The potential for further production and greater wealth in some parts of the country is not being realised because of neglect.  Also in the survey by the same firm of consultants I read that only 1.6 per cent of revenue from tourism comes into the southern Erne catchment areas, that is most of Monaghan, the whole of Cavan and a large part of Leitrim.  That is the centre of the great coarse fishing area in this country, but its potential has not been realised because of the inaccessibility of places of interest to those who come here for that purpose.  The coarse fishing season extends for a very long period.  We could have a steady development of the tourist industry in that part of the country if sufficient funds were provided to build roadways into the fishing grounds.  In some cases laneways are so narrow that if two cars meet one has to reverse for perhaps a half mile or more until they find a gap to let the other one pass.  In some places <Col N="1020" /> one has to get permission from a farmer to walk through his field to get down to some of the lakes and rivers.  Due to utter neglect, the earning capacity of that area is not being realised.</P>
    <P>The report states that in addition to the bad road structure and the inaccessibility of places of interest to anglers and others, the worst stretch of arterial road in the whole of the country is the road between Cavan town and Enniskillen. What I have said in that regard is a sufficient indication of the need there is for wise spending in some areas in order to develop their potential and generate greater wealth so that we can live on what we produce rather than on what we borrow.</P>
    <P>Inflation and the rising cost of living, some of which was due to the action of the Government in removing food subsidies at an earlier stage and to the inflation generated by the budget this year, mean that our tourist industry is being killed off by high prices.  I spoke one evening this week to an American visitor in our area and I asked him if he enjoyed his holidays in Ireland and if when he went back he intended to advise his friends to come over here.  He told me that he did enjoy the visit.  He thought amenities were good and the people hospitable and friendly.  In many ways he enjoyed it, but he regretted that the number of his friends who could afford a holiday in this country are very few.  If the decreasing number of visitors who come here go back home to their own people and tell them that this is one of the most costly countries on earth for a holiday, we will run into a serious decline in the tourist industry that was on the way up after the fall back when the troubles in Northern Ireland broke out. Whatever way the budget contributed to that situation is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to treat sympathetically cases such as the one I have in mind of a child who was fostered over 20 years ago by a childless couple.  He was not adopted legally or registered.  None of the legal formalities we have become accustomed to now was in operation at the time.  This chap, <Col N="1021" /> a very distant relation of one of the couple, was taken when he was almost eight years old to live with them.  He was schooled by them, grew up and went to work on the land until his foster parents died.  Now he finds that because he was not legally adopted or registered and was not a natural son, he has a colossal inheritance tax to pay.  In cases where a child was taken in at an early age, brought up and treated as a natural son or daughter, inheritance tax should not apply.  It is a problem that has caused a great deal of annoyance in the community and is worthy of the Minister's attention.  If he examined it he would see the justice of the claim I have made on behalf of such people.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag éisteacht le dhá lá le caint ón bhFreasúra agus chuir an chaint sin ana-dhíomá orm.  An chuid is mó den chaint uathu baineann sé leis an manifesto, 1977, in ionad an Bhille atá os ár gcomhair.  Chuireadh camastail agus uisce faoi thalamh i gcoinne an Rialtais agus i gcoinne ball an Rialtais.  Gan aon dabht tá géarchéim san eacnamaíocht i láthair na huaire, ach má fhéachaimid ráiteas an Aire, léifimid ansan:</P>
      <P>In 1979 our oil import bill was just over £500 million.  For 1980 the latest estimate is that this bill will rise to about £800 million, in other words, a massive increase of virtually 60 per cent in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the key sentence in any thesis that could be written on our economic problems at present.  That is just one of the problems, but it is a colossal one.  It is one of the biggest problems we ever had to face since the foundation of the State: an increase of 60 per cent in one year.  Judging by what I have heard yesterday and today very few of the Opposition speakers either read the speech of the Minister or adverted to the conditions that prevail today.  If they still had any doubts, they should have listened to the measured and very well enunciated statement of the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann yesterday.  Having been in close <Col N="1022" /> contact with Europe and countries with very strong economies, he was forced to make that statement.  What makes me very sad is that people in referring back to things they read into the famous manifesto of 1977 pick out certain points and put them forward with the gratuitous addition of charges against the Government for mismanagement. There is a certain amount of incitement to various interests to make even more unreasonable demands than are being made at present.  That is a very dangerous practice and something to be entirely deplored.</P>

      <P>My only reply to the remark of Senator Keating is this: O manifesto, what nonsense is spoken in thy name!  It should be the duty of every public representative and patriotic Irishman, knowing the present economic condition and climate, and our position as a weak economy in the midst of very strong economies that are in trouble already, by word and example and the type of criticism he offers, to do everything possible to steady the economy, steady the demands for further increases in wages and prices and in that way try to bring us over the period of recession we are now entering into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> If more remarks had been directed at the Bill and its provisions, a better day's work would have been done yesterday and today.  There are many excellent things in the Finance Bill.  I recommend everybody in the House to read and study it and read the Minister's speech and study it.  One thing the public are very pleased with&mdash;I speak now for the small saver&mdash;is stated in the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The exemption limit on interest paid on deposits accounts at the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks is being increased from £70 to £150.</P>
    <P>That means a lot to the small saver. Many people who spoke to me were very pleased by that.  There are many other things I could mention.  Those who have adversely criticised the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party know that as well as we do.  There is no point in bringing charges of cheating or uisce faoi thalamh against the Government.  We are all committed to trying to save the economy in these terrible times.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot about inflation and it is one of the greatest curses that can face any economy.  When the Government took office in 1977 inflation was at its highest since the foundation of the State. Those people now criticise the increase in inflation.  Together with that there were over 160,000 people unemployed.  A near miracle has been performed since then as far as unemployment is concerned. Inflation was brought down to about half what it was when we took office. It is now on the increase.  The simple reason is this: what causes inflation?&mdash; inordinate demands for wage increases, and what is worse and more diabolic, the four letter word &ldquo;work&rdquo; that so many people are trying to avoid.  We did not hear one word about that disease from any of the Opposition speakers.  West Germany&mdash;the strongest economy in the Nine today&mdash;rose from the ashes of misery after the last world war, because they set down to work.  Unfortunately, many people nowadays want jobs but do not want the work that goes with them.  Until <Col N="1024" /> we learn to work honestly there will be no cure for inflation.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of every one of us, regardless of which party we are associated with, for the sake of our people, our country and our future to work together, to get people back to the realisation that if we want to make money and want a higher standard of living or even, in present circumstances, maintain the standard of living we have, we must do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions during the course of this interesting debate.  I can say with confidence that, with a few short intervals, I heard almost every contribution that has been made. Where I was absent I have notes on what was said.  I regret that having waited to listen over such a protracted period to many of the points made by the Opposition, many members of the Opposition are not here to hear my response to them.  They may check on the record and find whether the replies I make measure up to the expectations they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the whole debate I refrained, as I believe is proper, from intervening during the course of any speaker's contribution, with one exception.  That was during the course of the contribution from Senator Justin Keating.  I did so for a very obvious reason to those who were in the House at the time.  In his opening remarks, and on many occasions right through his contribution, he said in a rather calm and measured way&mdash;but sometimes what is said in a calm and measured way carries more venom and <Col N="1025" /> distortion than what is said apparently in a heated way&mdash;that first of all he knew of course that the speech which I addressed to the House at the opening of this debate was not the creature of the Minister in any event.  Having put that on record as an implication obviously against what he sees as my incapacity for the job, he then took the other road and said that what he found particularly objectionable was that, while I had civil servants write the speech, I persuaded or pressurised them to distort the facts in the interests of my political presentation.</P>
    <P>Those distortions from Senator Keating are utterly unfounded both in respect of the preparation of the speech I stand over fully as being my own responsibility and contribution, although, as Senator Keating should know from his own short experience in Government, obviously the final preparation in each case is of course a matter for officials, from everyone from typists to the immediate advisers to the Minister.  I assure Senator Keating and the House&mdash;I do not think the House would need much assurance&mdash;that, both the content and message of my speech are entirely my responsibility.  I can equally assure him that there was no attempt on my part nor could there be any attempt on my part, to oblige honourable civil servants&mdash;in this much at least we are in agreement, he and I&mdash;to misrepresent the facts for the sake of a distorted political presentation.  I regret that Senator Keating is not here now but I hope that he checks the record.  All of us are sensitive about our responsibilities and integrity.  Sometimes in a very snide and vicious way one can leave implications that do not accord with the facts. As far as the officials of my Department are concerned, the charges being made that they are capable of being manipulated for the sake of political presentation are totally unfounded and do not measure up to what happens in reality.</P>
    <P>What we have been considering and will consider for the rest of the day is the third stage of what one might call the predetermined programme each year in <Col N="1026" /> relation to the management of the public finances and the presentation of the Government's position in relation to that.  Obviously the first stage, as Senators will know, is the examination of Estimates for public expenditure of the various Departments.  This examination is of vital importance in determining the priorities that the Government will pursue during the course of the following year but, of course, also as a consistent path along the road to the economic development plan of the Government generally.</P>
    <P>I heard some conflicting requests during the course of this debate.  I will be commenting more on the requests that I found myself in disagreement with rather than on those which were in line with my own thinking and that of the Government.</P>
    <P>One cannot ask for increased allocations for this or that service and at the same time complain about the growing budget deficit and growing borrowing requirements. There was a trend of that in this debate.  To argue both ways is to argue in contradictory directions.  I should like to assure the House that in our examination of the Estimates for Departments at the beginning of this year we recognised in view of the imbalances that have grown up in the public finances that we had two obligations.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we use expressions like the Exchequer, Revenue Commissioners and Minister for Finance, none of which is calculated to invoke much public response or sympathy, but when one talks about a taxpayer, one is talking about an individual citizen.  Our first obligation was to ensure that the tax-payer's contribution to the Exchequer would be limited to the greatest extent and applied in the areas of national priorities for economic and social development.  For that reason we took a very strict, consistent, concerned and confident approach to our examination of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>If one looks through them, one will find that there was probably a norm of <Col N="1027" /> about 5 per cent increase in relation to the current services over the outturn for last year.  I recognise that an increase&mdash;if one calls it that&mdash;in percentage terms over an outturn having regard to the inflation pattern that was there at the time is a curb in a real sense.  In that context this was a deliberate conscious decision of the Government as the first step to restoring balance in our public finances. If we had not taken that decision at that time we could not have turned to any sector of the public and asked them to respond in a responsible and consistent way.</P>
    <P>If one looks again at the Estimates for public expenditure one will see that there are priorities within those which define clearly the Government's thinking and commitment toward the economic future and maintaining a level of economic well-being in employment and responsibility in our economy generally.  I am speaking of what I referred to in my opening address, the priorities we applied in the area of the public capital programme, many of which, in themselves, are obviously important this year but many of which perhaps are even more important as laying the base for the infrastructural development of the economy in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Hence it is that the level of increase in areas such as the telecommunications area is well above the norm I referred to of 5 per cent in the public expenditure current side and, in many cases, is up to 25 and 30 per cent.  In areas for the industrial development activities and the bodies directly concerned, one is speaking again of a percentage allocation on last year's out-turn well in excess of the norm otherwise applied.  Therefore, one can say that at the first stage the Government definitely did take the first responsibility which was theirs, to curb the growth of public expenditure while at the same time ensuring that the application of the expenditure was directed towards their main priorities.</P>
    <P>Now that Senator Keating has returned&mdash;to repeat what I said&mdash;I should like to suggest to him that in the interest of proper understanding between us of <Col N="1028" /> what my role is and the manner in which I discharge my obligations, he should give some attention to reading the Official Report of what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">

      <P>The second stage that the Government were concerned about after the examination of the Estimates was in the preparation of the budget.  I should like to digress to give the background to the economic environment in which we see ourselves.  I gave some background in the course of my opening address but I will fill in a little more, briefly, at this stage.  Whatever a Government do in examinations of the Estimates, the budget or the Finance Bill is but the Government's contribution.  I agree that is a major element and responsibility&mdash;the primary responsibility&mdash;to the economic climate in the country as a whole.  There are, of course, other major factors which will influence our capacity as a nation to realise the targets that are clear and discernible to all of us, in the areas of employment, social justice and other areas.  Obviously, those factors determine the reactions of the people to the directions set by Government, whichever that Government may be, at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable that there are adjustments that are not easy to make in the light of the experience in this country, and others, over the last ten, 15 or 20 years.  However, that they may not be easy does not excuse our obligation to make them nonetheless.  If one looks back over the sixties&mdash;and I am not just talking about Ireland but of Western Europe generally&mdash;we were in a period of almost sustained and continuing economic development based, amongst other things, on the growth capacity of the western economies and also, it has to be said, to a very considerable extent on the cheap raw material commodities available to western economies from the developing countries.  During the sixties, and, to a lesser extent, in the seventies, we had a period one might say of <Col N="1029" /> relatively easy growth.  It was easy in the sense of the influences on our growth from outside which, by comparison with the influence of today, would have been very positive influences.  Oil was cheap, raw material commodities were cheap and western economies expended understandably.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with what our country achieved during that time.  I am glad to note we have a very distinguished Senator present.  Senator Whitaker, who was very much associated with what we achieved.  While I have said that the period of the sixties was different, it could not have been a successful period were it not for the clear and consistent economic planning programmes that emerged at that time from an enlightened public service and a confident Government. Obviously, this generated a belated sense of growth, action, confidence and activity in our country which was very welcome.  Those expectations, in a sense, characterised the sixties.  They were proper and in line with the climate of the sixties, nationally and internationally. Without them our economy would not be anywhere near the stage of development it is now.  The first shock of the seventies from which we took some time to recover, was the level of oil increases. It is fair to note that the level of oil increases after the first round of increases in the early seventies was not continued at the same level as they have been even in the last 12 months since the most recent increases.  Our people had become accustomed in the sixties and into the seventies to a pattern, by comparison with our present position, of rather automatic growth, of growth without the same measure of discipline that is required now.  They certainly have not had experience of having to absorb the unwelcomed problems that are facing us from every corner from outside at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on what Senator FitzGerald mentioned about the burden. In my budget statement to which he referred, I referred to that as the unwelcomed reality, not the unwelcomed reality of the Supreme Court decision to <Col N="1030" /> which I will return to in a moment.  It is an unwelcomed reality and one that we have to cope with.  It is only within our own capacity to ensure that we cope with it satisfactorily.  We have seen a pattern since 1973 of a growth in the budget deficits.  For that reason we have seen an indication of our incapacity to adjust to the new realities right throughout that period.  But whatever were the realities in the early seventies the realities of today are much more stark, and I will outline them in more detail now than I did in the course of my opening address.  First of all, it is self-evident that our economy is an open economy in a sense that hardly any other economy in Western Europe is. 50 per cent of our total GNP is based on exports and, dependent as we are on exports which is a measure of the achievements of the last number of years in reaching these markets, it means automatically that when the international economy goes into recession, when the level of demand is dampened down as it is in the markets which we supply well, then we suffer the consequences of that immediately and directly as we have done over the last six months and 12 months in particular.  Secondly, our economy is open at the other and our level of dependency on energy is perhaps the highest of the western countries at about 80 per cent of our total imported energy needs.  The impact here of those two factors obviously has had a very damaging effect on us.  I should like to demonstrate the dimension of the problem by comparison, deliberately, with the problem of the mid-seventies. The cost of oil imports to us in 1974 was £220 million.  In 1975 that rose by £5 million to £225 million and in 1976 it rose to £290 million, an increase of £65 million.  Over a period of three years it rose by £70 million.  In 1977 it rose to £352 million.  One can see from that that the cost of our oil imports, if anything, was less than the level of inflation then. It demonstrates, as I have said, that the level of oil price increases after the first rise in 1974 was not at a pace of growth that in any way measures up to the experiences we have had recently.  In 1978 the cost of our oil imports was £336 <Col N="1031" /> million and by this year that £336 million will have become £800 million.  I do not think anything illustrates more dramatically the change that has occurred in the last two years by comparison with any other period in the seventies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves, and they demonstrate more than the Senator or I or anyone else exactly what the impact of those figures on our economy will be.  Let me demonstrate this even further by reference to the trade statistics published for May yesterday.  The fact is that the trade deficit for the month at £147.8 million was approximately £52,500,000 higher than the deficit in April, but 2.2 million lower than the deficit recorded in May of 1979.  It is significant that the cost of the oil element in our imports increased over the first five months of the year by £146 million.  The consequence of that is that our deficit widened during <Col N="1033" /> that period by £81 million.  The cost of oil imports in May this year at £69 million compares with the cost last year for the same period of £37 million. Those figures demonstrate graphically up to now that we have to effect the necessary adjustments to cope with this unwelcome reality.  There will not be any self-correcting mechanism in our balance of payments this year, though it is fair to say that, allowing for a huge increase in the cost of oil, nonetheless the pattern, particularly since the budget and because of the credit guidelines being operated by the Central Bank, that even over the first five months&mdash;particularly in the three months since the budget&mdash;the situation with regard to our balance of payments is, in fact, coming under some degree of control.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything that would suggest that the policies that brought this about will not need to be maintained with the same degree of consistency as they have in the months since the budget.  The deficit, by comparison with last year, is negative.  The first two months were up on last year; there was an increased deficit over last year, but the deficit in the three months since the budget is less than the deficit for the corresponding period last year.  It is appropriate that we should note that the increased oil bill has, to a considerable extent, been offset by the decline in the value of non-oil imports.  There has been a dampening of the growth of consumer demand.  This is something that was a deliberate element in the Government's strategy as presented in the budget and as being implemented in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of those realities we need to get our economy in balance.  I indicated the stages through which the Government propose to do that in relation to the public expenditure programme and also in relation to what is contained in my budget in the Finance Bill.  If we are going to get our economy in balance, it is fair to say that we will have to get ourselves in balance as well because we need now to face up to this new reality that there will not be an easy growth, that it is not going to come <Col N="1034" /> without effort and that it involves discipline and our capacity to overcome the impact of these unwelcome developments from the outside.  It is unwelcome, but how we shoulder this burden will really be the test of how we lay the basis for further prosperity and social justice in the country.</P>
    <P>What we do is one thing but what we cannot do is another.  We cannot compensate ourselves for a level of increase in our incomes which will cushion us against the increasing costs of these oil imports.  We cannot say that because that has a damaging effect on our standard of living&mdash;obviously has, that has to be stated as a fact&mdash;we are going to compensate ourselves to a level we would have enjoyed if this did not happen. That is the first thing we cannot do for two reasons, (a) because to do it would be to ignore reality, the reality of the figures I have referred to&mdash;figures, unfortunately, do not just remain on books at this point but translate themselves into a very real crushing economic burden&mdash;and, secondly, we cannot do it because none of our competitors are doing it.</P>
    <P>At the first meeting I attended of the Finance Ministers of the European Economic Community in December it was clear that it was the consistent and determined view of all the other members of the Community that they would not allow income patterns to develop which would compensate for the increased costs of energy in the various economies.  If they are not doing it, we cannot do it for the obvious reasons but particularly for the reason that our competitiveness would be further damaged and our capacity to reach those markets&mdash;they are our main markets&mdash;would be even more constrained that it is at present.  Those are two unwelcome realities, and we have to face them.  We saw a little more of it last weekend from the European Council in Venice.  It may be fair to say that the analysis of the problems was all too evident from the statements that emerged from that European Council.  They may have been somewhat short on a prescripvention&mdash;sa <Col N="1035" /> tion for solving those problems.  Nonetheless if one looks at the analysis of the problem at least it is clear that they all recognise that the current international economic environment is very unfavourable for the Western European countries generally.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated already if that is true of Western Europe generally it is particularly true in our case.  The message that comes out of Venice is that until such time as one gets a recognition under way in the international community generally of the need to recycle the OPEC surpluses&mdash;unfortunately, there is no early evidence of agreement in that direction of the introduction of a substitution account through the IMP and, unfortunately, again there is no early evidence of a move in that direction&mdash;we will find monetary imbalances in the world economy which will have a very serious and damaging effect on our economy. The fact that there is not as yet at IMF level, EEC level or any other international level, a clear commitment to cope with these imbalances is something that the Government very much regret. The EEC have a major role to play.  I know that there are different views within member states of the Community as to what the role of the Community should be in this area of recycling funds, particularly as between developed and developing countries, of trying to introduce a momentum of economic activities in the developing countries that, in turn, will benefit the developed countries in allowing further markets for our export outlets and other varieties of consequences that would emerge.</P>
    <P>All that is under examination.  From our point of view as a Government we see the Community's responsibility as being a fundamental one.  Other partners do not share that view.  It will be a continuing preoccupation of mine and of my colleagues to ensure that the root of the problem, which is this international imbalance I have referred to, will be tackled where it is.  Otherwise, of course, it will always be open to people at home just to <Col N="1036" /> criticise the Government for not apparently achieving a miracle in the face of those economic realities.  They would be the only ones who would be comforted in the event of us not getting that degree of international co-ordination and determination that is absolutely essential at this stage.</P>
    <P>An element of that one should touch on&mdash;the question has been referred to in the course of this debate&mdash;is the question of the interest rates that are painfully high at present.  As Senator Whitaker has said, when one finds demand chasing money in the way it has been in recent times, and inflation at the level it has been in member states and in the Western world in general, it is understandable that one would get interest rates at the level they have reached in many of the Western economies.  The significant thing is that many of the western economies, particularly in the European Community, are determined that through the application of high interest rates they can bring their economies into balance.  That is a stated determined policy on their part.  Until such time as they see a reduction in the money supply and in consumer demand and, therefore, a consequent reduction in inflation, they will not take the decision to reduce interest rates.  With interest rates dropping in the United States, for instance, one might have expected consequential reductions in West Germany or Britain, two of the main influences in our case, but we have not seen that.</P>
    <P>Hopefully&mdash;I have argued this consistently with my colleagues in the EEC informally, in private conversations and at the Council&mdash;they will recognise that policies that are pursued by way of monetary discipline in member states which may be consistent and desirable can have an impact on other member states and associates, such as ours, that can be very damaging.  I welcomed the recognition from the Commission of the EEC at the last meeting of the Council that member states, in pursuing policies of that nature, must have regard to the drag effect they can have on other economies that are, perhaps, more <Col N="1037" /> dependent than they are on the international climate.  While my hope is that we will see in the reasonably near future a reduction from these historically high interest rates, nonetheless we have to see them as being a consequence of the international economic and monetary situation at present.  I should like to mention in this context that because rates have reached a peak here which, by our own standards, is obviously painfully high&mdash;I accept that&mdash;I want at the same time to point out that the difference between current rates here and those in any of our partners in the European Community is less than it was in June of 1979, in real or proportionate terms. One can take whichever one one likes on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There has always been a gap between the interest levels in Germany, the Netherlands and France and the rates applying here.  The gap is no bigger now than it was at any time over the last two or three years.  That may not be much consolation but it is a fact.  The policies are being pursued all round by member states in a way that imposes extra constraints in our case.  In fact, the reality is that the gap is smaller now in real or in proportionate terms than it has been at any time over the last 18 months or two years, even after the recent increases here.</P>
    <P>So the effects of these unwelcome developments are obviously serious for us.  It means that we have to apply priorities in the application of the funds available to us.  The credit guidelines of the Central Bank are based on that reasoning which is demonstrated particularly in the manner in which they discriminate in favour of the productive sectors, including housing in this instance, as distinct from consumer purposes.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch on a point that was made in relation to farm credit.  For every sector, including the farming sector, the cost of credit and of servicing debts at this moment is a very heavy burden.  It is fair to say that this points <Col N="1038" /> up the need to establish new priorities in the use of credit; this need was not evident over the last few years when there was rather free and easy credit.  The level of investment in agricultural plant and machinery was higher than it might have been.  Credit taken up for purchase of farm land was very much higher than it might have been.  But the level of credit used for stock improvement was lower than it should have been.  Generally while one has a limited pool of credit, as at the moment, the use of the available credit for the most productive purposes is of the utmost importance.  I know that the farm organisations are very conscious of this at this time.  That explains why, since the budget, I made adjustments to the package on farm taxation. There are adjustments in a number of areas.  First I want to make this important point.  I did not, at any time in my budget, look for a pre-determined yield from farm taxation this year.  Senator Howard seems to have the impression that I did.  He even mentioned the figure of £100 million.  Let me state for the record that the Minister for Finance has the obligation to estimate the revenue in every area.  Obviously I have the same obligation in respect of the farm taxation proposals.  My estimate at the time of the budget was about 86 million, thereby indicating that I was not looking for a pre-determined yield of £100 million as Senator Howard very specifically said I was.  Since then I have made adjustments which are incorporated in the Finance Bill before the House which acknowledge the Government's recognition that the importance of agriculture, particularly at a time when our balance of payments is a major Government priority, is crucial.  For that reason I made significant adjustments to the restrictions on the allowances announced last year.  Senators will know the limitations on depreciation allowances for farm buildings, for farm development and even for fixed plant in farm buildings have been removed.  As a measure of my recognition of the need to promote productivity in agriculture and as a consequence of the satisfactory discussions I had with the farm leaders we have made <Col N="1039" /> provisions in relation to stock relief which are in this Bill.  It is one of the major obligations of Government to promote the well-being of the farm sector and thereby the well-being of the economy in its entirely.</P>
    <P>I come to the taxation issue and the question of equity.  I was impressed by what Senator Harte had to say as a trade unionist on this.  Senator Harte said that it was damaging to unity in the country to find the farmers and the workers at odds with each other, particularly in public.  I agree entirely with Senator Harte.  I am glad that the level of public discord is not now at the pitch it was at, say, over the last 12 months.  I do not want to claim too much credit for this, but I can say that my approach to this issue has been on the basis of quiet consultation and reasoning with the organisations concerned, be they farm organisations or trade unions.  That has been our approach, and the adjustments we have been able to make as a consequence of these consultations were welcomed by the farmers and they did not at the same time cause a negative reaction in the trade union sector which had stated specifically in their pre-budget submissions that the least they would require in terms of farm taxation was the full implementation of the farm package as announced last year.  The adjustments made it rather different from what was announced but nonetheless they are adjustments that are not only to be justified but which are absolutely essential in the climate in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to equity in taxation. The point has been made by some speakers that this Finance Bill benefits the rich at the expense of the poor.  To Senator Keating I would say, for purposes of clarification, that when I said we have been paying ourselves too much I, at no stage, had in mind those people who depend on social welfare benefits.  I was not aware that anyone could have that sector in mind when speaking of paying ourselves too much.  Senator Keating managed to put that interpretation on it.  If, in a difficult year like this, I recognise the obligation to provide the <Col N="1040" /> highest level of reliefs in the budget that we ever have done in percentage terms or real terms or any terms.  It is a measure of my recognition of the Government's obligation in that direction. It was also meant to be a signpost to our people that when one talks of equity that argument is not confined just to equity in taxation.  It includes equity in the social and economic order generally. I regret that Senator Keating particularly could imply that I was suggesting that old age pensioners, widows, disabled persons and the sick were paying themselves too much.  I never made any such suggestion.  If we can recognise our obligations to that section in difficult times, it is a measure of the intention we would have, in easier times, to provide even better for them.</P>
    <P>In relation to equity generally&mdash;and I will deal with some of the specific points in a moment&mdash;I saw it as necessary to demonstrate, to the extent that one could in a budget in a difficult year, that the allowances being introduced, apart from bringing about equity were desirable in the interest of the national economy. Senator Cranitch, at the end of his speech, was perhaps the only person who touched on the need to promote the work ethic in a way that was not in evidence during the last year particularly. Sometimes we tend to think that industrial relations problems in the form of strikes are the major problems we have, and they are serious problems. But they obviously are more noticed because they are dramatic and have a major and immediate impact wherever they occur and obviously warrant, in many cases, stark newspaper headlines. But we do not tend to notice the other aspect of it.  That is the aspect of absenteeism from work.</P>
    <P>Many people in the business sector told me before the budget that one of the main problems they have in regard to the pace at which people move from one band of taxation to another, was that towards the end of the year people in the semi-skilled and skilled sectors, in the vitally important areas of our industry, found it, as they saw it, counter productive to remain at work when by absenting <Col N="1041" /> themselves from work they could, in many cases, draw rebates of taxation that would be at least as significant as what they might get at work, allowing for the tax that would be deducted. In the months of November and December this was a major problem for Irish industry and consequently a major problem for our economy.</P>
    <P>I hope that these new provisions in relation to income tax which broaden the bands very considerably and ensure that the pace at which one moves into a higher band is certainly very much slower than it was, will at least remove that disincentive to work which has been a very heavy weight on our economy and our productivity generally.  That was another reason why we moved to the system that is being implemented now in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism here.  I want to say very deliberately that, apart from one or two observations, particularly by Senator Keating, I found the tone of the debate generally understanding.  It is understandable that Senators from various parties will make political points in it.  I do not think they were misrepresenting the position as they saw it.  I found the tone of the debate generally fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>As far as allowances are concerned Senator Keating said that we had made no progress at all in terms of equity.  I have some figures here which will demonstrate very dramatically that in a few years the allowances have increased. In 1972-73 the single person's allowance was £299 and the married person's allowance was £494.  It is important that this should be put on the record.  Over the five year period to 1977-78 the single person's allowance was raised to £665, that is, an increase of £366 over five years.  The married person's allowance was increased to £1,000, of which £100 was required to compensate for the discontinuation of the earned income relief in 1974.  In the two year period 1978-79 and 1979-80 the single person's allowance was raised from £665 to £1,115, an increase of £450.  The <Col N="1042" /> married person's allowance was raised from £1,100 to £2,230, an increase of £1,130.  So much for the criticisms of this Finance Bill.  To those who would suggest that we have been ignoring the need for equity in this area and paying particular attention to the better off, I say it is demonstrated that this is not so from the increase in the allowances that I have referred to and from the broadening of the bands that have been incorporated in this Bill.  Somebody must have been totally unaware of the need to take any action in either direction in the four years during the mid-seventies that I have referred to.  The progress during those four years, if one could call it progress, was certainly very much behind the progress made in the last two years in this direction.</P>
    <P>I want to reply now to a number of the points that have been made.  Many are appropriate on this Stage and I will deal with others on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The first major point was referred to by Senator FitzGerald in what I found to be a fascinating, if not courageous manner. But he does not need to be commended for his courage by me.  He gave an analysis of the Supreme Court judgments. Senator FitzGerald will be conscious that, apart from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the only member of the Government who is referred, to in the Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, is the member of the Government who is in charge of the Department of Finance. He does have an obligation obviously, under the Constitution, to present the Estimates for his expenditure to Dáil Éireann and also the receipts; he has the obligation, under the Constitution, to present his budget and to debate the Estimates. I recognise what Senator FitzGerald is saying and I agree fully with him.  If one arm of the Constitution, in exercise of its function, were to make it impossible for the other arm to exercise its functions then of course we would have reached a very serious position.</P>
    <P>I do not find myself in a position where I can comment as Senator FitzGerald has.  But I take notes, nonetheless, <Col N="1043" /> of the rather perceptive comments he had to make in that direction.  I would suggest to him that if he reads the arguments that were made at the second stage particularly of the Supreme Court hearing, namely as to the extent and duration of the application of the judgment in respect of the plaintiffs or any others who might be entitled to relief, he will see there clearly stated by counsel on behalf of the State the case that I have summarised rather briefly just now. It is no accident that counsel presented their case in that fashion at that time.  It is in a manner consistent with what Senator FitzGerald referred to now.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald seemed to be critical of the fact that, having recognised the significance of the decision of the Supreme Court as far as the public finances are concerned, the Government actually went further than that.  Of course they did.  But long before that the Government signposted their intention to go further than the Supreme Court decision; my predecessor last year indicated that this was his intention.  If I had applied the Supreme Court ruling as literally as Senator FitzGerald suggests I should have done, I would have been treating one income couples more harshly than two income couples.  I was not prepared to do that, in the interests of equity.  If I had done so I would not have felt that I was acting in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution having regard to the special position of the woman in the home who plays a vitally important role in our society.</P>
    <P>If I had adhered strictly to the Supreme Court ruling, the tax burden on some two income couples where there was an imbalance between the two incomes and the income of one partner was insufficient to absorb his or her personal allowances would be different from the tax burden on another two income couple with the same total income which is divided in different proportions between the spouses.  It would also have provided an incentive for people who had control over their own incomes, mainly the self-employed and those who control their own companies, to engage <Col N="1044" /> in tax planning, to use a euphemism, to ensure that their spouses would have separate incomes so as to benefit from separate treatment and that would introduce a new disparity.</P>
    <P>For that reason and for the other reasons I have already mentioned, equity, national productivity and a variety of others, I decided that it would be important to go for the scheme that I introduced.  Here let me say that if some see that as too generous let me just make two points, that if one supports the principle of income splitting&mdash;and I am not saying that I number Senator FitzGerald amongst those who do, but I would number most of the members in his party judging from the reactions that were conveyed to me in Dáil Éireann&mdash;one cannot very well argue against the consequences. One of the consequences is, of course, that if the bands are doubled, as one moves higher up the scale the effect of this can be seen perhaps to convey undue benefits to those at the higher income level, those who might not need the benefit of the double bands in any event.  For that reason it was necessary to make other adjustments.  Allowing for the impact of these at certain levels in the salary scale, there would be other exemptions and reliefs introduced which would be of considerable benefit at the other end of the scale.  The exemptions contained in sections 1 and 2 of the Bill mean that 83,000 people have been removed from the tax net altogether.  The scheme <i>in toto</i> means that 180,000 taxpayers, or nearly two-thirds of those paying tax&mdash;I am not just talking about people at the top of the scale&mdash;who are at present liable to tax at higher rates are now taxed at the lower standard rate.  It is vitally important that that be recognised as being an essential ingredient and consequence of the actions taken by me in introducing this new provision for income taxation.</P>
    <P>Senators recognise that there have been many complaints over the years that rate bands were not being adjusted and that this resulted in middle income taxpayers paying income tax at higher <Col N="1045" /> rates.  But the fact that the allowances were not increased in the mid-seventies to any considerable extent obviously had major consequences, I have referred to those already and have given the figures. Therefore it was of vital importance to increase the allowances and broaden the bands.  The single person's allowance was increased from £500 to £665 in the years 1974-75 to 1977-78 and the married person's allowance was increased from £800 to £1,100 in those four years whereas in the two years that I have referred to they increased from £1,100 to £2,230 in respect of married people and from £665 to £1,115 in respect of single people.</P>
    <P>That is all part of the scheme before this House.  It was necessary to do that to ensure that those who felt they were moving too quickly into higher bands would not feel so penalised as hitherto they have felt.  The result of it is that section 8 of the Bill will correct much of this problem.  The maximum rate of 60 per cent will not now apply in the case of a single person unless the taxable income exceeds £9,000.  In the case of married persons assessed on their combined incomes it will not apply unless the taxable income exceeds £18,000.  Some people with very large incomes will benefit but Senators on the Opposition side have, understandably, quoted extreme cases.  I have been trying to visualise a case that Senator Hussey referred to where a person benefited to the tune of £8,000 net as a consequence of the budget.  That person would have to be in a salary category beyond the wildest expectations of any of us here at this time.  No doubt some such exist.  But that is not to suggest that it is representative of the experience of very many of us at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  But at the same time to argue from the specific to the general would be to overstate it a little in these circumstances.  It is very seldom a taxpayer's tax at that level would be reduced by more than 15 per cent where taxpayers on lesser incomes <Col N="1046" /> are having their tax reduced by much higher percentages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow through on a point if I may.  When one is talking in terms of tax allowances as a means of redistributing income&mdash;and it is not the only means&mdash;obviously one's capacity to redistribute income is related to the amount of tax being paid, so that where very little tax is paid the best one can do is to ensure that no tax is paid and that may mean a relatively small change of income.  One cannot do any more than ensure that no tax is paid and in respect of that the income exemptions that I have introduced this year are very considerable.  Let me give an example which is a reasonably fair one in terms of the percentages.  Let us take an income of £5,000 a year which represents a wage of about £96 a week.  An unmarried wage earner will now pay 21 or 22 per cent of his income in tax: at £10,000 a year he would pay 26 per cent of his income in tax; at £20,000 he would pay 33½ per cent.  The percentage goes up higher and higher and obviously the real amounts go up as well.  At £30,000 he would pay over 40 per cent.  In the case of a married couple with one spouse earning the percentages are 17.1 per cent at £5,000, 23.6 per cent at £10,000.  For Senator Keating's reassurance, I am not relying on the percentages, the real figures increased even more&mdash;31.5 per cent at £20,000 and 38.6 per cent at £30,000.  While one can say immediately that this, in terms of actual tax relief, means more at that end than the other, the fact is that having regard to the principle of income splitting the scheme we have introduced ensures that the level of tax paid is in percentage terms or in real terms very much higher at the higher end of the scale and that the level of relief is very much better at the lower end of the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those who say that this is an unprecedented and ridiculously high allowance for the better off, the fact is <Col N="1047" /> that by comparison with Britain, for instance, the higher income tax payers here will pay more tax than people on similar incomes in the United Kingdom would pay.  Those on lower incomes fare far better here.  On incomes up to £4,300 a year, that is about £82 per week, single tax payers pay less tax here than is the case in Britain.  On incomes over that figure he pays more tax here, the additional tax being £1,000 on an income of £11,000 per annum.  Similarly, in the case of a married couple where one spouse is earning, the tax liability is less here on incomes up to £9,540, which is £183 per week, but greater on incomes over that figure, the additional tax being over £1,000 on an income of £25,000 a year.  It is important that one should not, because we are introducing a new system, try to argue that all the benefits of it are for the better off as if it were designed for that purpose only.  It benefits people particularly in the lower-and middle-income levels, many of whom will not be liable for tax at all, as a consequence of it.  Many others will find they will have an incentive to work that up to now was not quite as effective as it will be as a consequence of this budget.</P>
    <P>Some of the other points in relation to the application of sections 20 and 21, might best be left until Committee Stage. I agree entirely with Senator FitzGerald that if, as Senator Robinson suggested, we were to interpret the Supreme Court decision in a way in which the Supreme Court themselves did not so far as retroactivity was concerned, it would mean that those who had paid their taxes during those years would be at a disadvantage by comparison with those who did not pay.  It would mean equally that depending on the amount of retroactivity one was going to introduce, one could be dealing with figures of up to £25 million or £45 million, back to 1978, which would have to be levied on other taxpayers to ensure that people who now sought assessments on the basis of the situation as they saw it, would be relieved.  There is not any other way one can relieve them except to spread the burden even more on other taxpayers <Col N="1048" /> who would not benefit.  In particular those would be single people and widows who do not have any immediate benefit under that decision.  I will go into that in further detail when we come to section 21 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few points, some of which are not immediately relevant to the Finance Bill.  Senator McDonald asked about the question of our contracts in terms of the National Petroleum Company with other States.  This is not such as to guarantee lower prices.  No one has ever suggested that but it guarantees security of supply which was a major problem last year.  So far as the influence of the big white bear is concerned, I do not suppose one would suggest that Saudi Arabia, which has been one of our main contract areas in this direction, is immediately under the influence of the big white bear, nor would the Iraquis agree that they were under the influence of the big white bear, as was suggested by the Senator.</P>
    <P>There was some suggestion, too, by Senator McDonald, of there not being any incentive to save.  In this context, I would refer, for instance, to the increase in the tax exemptions in respect of the Post Office and trustee savings banks. That has been welcomed by both the Post Office and the trustee savings banks.  It has been welcomed particularly by the small savers who rely so much on those.  I discussed in the other House the reasons for making the exemptions in those cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony went into some detail to demonstrate what he saw vividly as cutbacks in respect of local authorities.  I do not know whether he was bringing this to my attention on the basis that I was not previously aware of it or whether some local political point was being made.  He was referring to the local authority in the region I represent and which he aspires to represent.  Only if you compare our record this year against our record last year in any of these areas&mdash;I apply this to all local authorities&mdash;could you say that there has been a curb on public expenditure?  I invite all Senators from all sides of the <Col N="1049" /> House to compare the record of the funds available to the local authorities this year or last year with what was available during those four years that sometimes people would like to forget and they will see that perhaps if you compare it with our own record one could not say there is a curb of public expenditure.  One could say that we have been all too generous in that area.  However, that is a passing point in response to a rather detailed contribution on a local issue from Senator Molony.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard suggested that the new tax arrangement was no thanks to us, that it is the result of the Supreme Court decision.  I wish all the Members had been here to hear what Senator FitzGerald had to say in this regard, especially his suggestion that we had gone much further than we needed to go.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte expressed concern about the figures that he said have been mentioned for so long but have never been refuted&mdash;that almost 85 per cent of the nation's private wealth was owned by the richest 5 per cent of the population. He probably knows that those figures were based on estate duty statistics of some years ago.  For that reason alone they are clearly not comprehensive.</P>
    <P>A large amount of the wealth of the country was not covered in these statistics, for example, wealth owned by, for instance, many people under the estate duty threshold, wealth transferred more than five years before the donor's death and wealth contained in discretionary trusts.  Therefore, the criticisms I would make of that particular analysis, so far as I know, have been voiced on many occasions since that was first presented but the significance of it is that it is important that we should not rely unduly on general statements like that to imply that the level of discrepancy in our country in terms of income is deplorable.  These figures should be quoted as saying what they said at that time but should not be extended to imply, as they cannot, a level of discrepancy of that order.  If there is <Col N="1050" /> evidence of discrepancy here, and there may be some, by comparison with other countries in western Europe we are almost, relatively speaking, of a uniform income pattern, but certainly there is greater uniformity and similarity in the income patterns here than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance remains a major commitment. I agree that there is a difference between avoidance and evasion.  I will not even quote the professor of moral theology I had to refer to in response to Deputy Flanagan in the Dáil.  Learned judges in recent times in their judgments take the view from the legal point of view that the obvious abuse as they see it of the tax provisions through certain kinds of arrangements is in fact an abuse of the law, and where they had the opportunity, they said they would impose the heaviest penalties open to them where they saw that the thin line between avoidance and evasion had been crossed.  I want to assure Senator Harte and the House that because of the need for equity and the need to ensure that there is not any opportunity for transferring the burden from those who have control over their own incomes, control which those on wages and salaries do not have, to some other sector, there is an obligation on Government and on any Minister for Finance to strengthen our actions against tax avoidance.  I can assure Senator Harte that that is the position and that it is a position which will be reflected even further when the Revenue Commissioners' report for next year becomes available.  Even if the Senator considers what I have done in relation to entertainment expenses whereby I am reducing the amount of money available for such expenses to 50 per cent, I am trying to demonstrate the need for equity in the provision of the necessary public services.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Harte that experts would be much better employed in advising businesses as to their accountancy procedures, as to their cost analysis, as to ensuring that they would know exactly the financial basis on which their companies were being structured before it became too late for them <Col N="1051" /> as some of them find out when it is too late.  They would be much better employed in this way not only in their interest but in the interest of industry and the interest of the economy generally than engaging in practices that may give some immediate profit to the customer or client, namely a new loophole in the new Finance Act.  It would certainly mean profit to the economy.  I encouraged the Institute of Taxation, who I understand represent both the legal profession and the accountancy profession, that they could do much better for their clients and certainly for the national well being if they concentrated rather on the more positive aspect of the application of their professional standards rather than what I regard as being a less than positive aspect.</P>
    <P>I want to say in relation to this whole area that the Commission on Taxation have a major role here.  I deliberately phrased the terms of reference for the commission in the broadest possible phrases.  It is fair to say that our tax base is unduly narrow, that in many ways perhaps it imposes undue burdens on one side at the expense of the other but the important thing is that we have to take note of the needs of the revenue and of the interests of the national economy.  All of that is covered in the commission's terms of reference and I look forward to getting an early reply from them on the progress they are making.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two general points which cannot arise on the Committee Stage.  One is to assure Senator Staunton and, through him, others who have an interest in this area, that I agree entirely that decentralisation of the Government administration is absolutely essential for exactly the same reasons that Senator Staunton stated and also because the problems that arise in this city in particular in providing the necessary services, infrastructures and environmental facilities, are obviously very much more acute and very much more costly than they would be in the appropriate centres down the country.</P>
    <P>The experience to date of decentralisation <Col N="1052" /> has been a good and successful experience. The Government are now pursuing this policy, and the country can expect that we will be demonstrating our commitment to it in the foreseeable future in our decentralisation programme which I hope will be announced by the Minister for the Public Service.  We share this commitment for a variety of reasons, and similarly, in relation to regional development, I want to make the general point here, that because I have been preoccupied with the stages I have referred to&mdash;examination of public expenditure, the budget preparation and the preparation of the Finance Bill&mdash;is not to suggest that the most essential function of the Department of Finance which always has been there under the Minister for Finance is not alive and well.  I am speaking particularly of the function of economic planning and development.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that I will be demonstrating clearly over the next number of months through programmes and actions announced by us that this is the path along which we will move to implement the actions that I have based on the stages through which we have passed already.  When we do that it will be fairly clear that decentralisation and regional development will form a major element in this.  It is striking in areas of strategic importance in the region&mdash;let it be any of a number of towns or county towns&mdash;to see the level of cohesion and commitment of social and economic well being that grows up around that whole hinterland.  This is something that is both challenging and encouraging, and it is of vital importance that our programme of regional development will show and reflect our interests in that area.  I can assure this House that they will do so.  I expressed this view a month ago in Kerry when I went into some detail but apparently when one makes general statements of that nature instead of saying something that might warrant a scare headline it is not going to attract immediate comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one other point mentioned in that context.  It was the question of SFADCo.  My colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism indicated what has been done by SFADCo in connection with small industries.  I reject entirely what Senator Keating suggested when he talked about the position of&mdash;I do not remember the exact phrase but it was a disparaging one&mdash;small industries by comparison with the farmers down the road.  He used a disparaging phrase to suggest that some of those industries were neither capable nor viable and that we were helping them by reducing their corporation tax at the expense of the farmer down the road on whom we were imposing these two burdens.</P>
      <P>First, I can assure Senator O'Brien that it is not intended that the resource tax will continue indefinitely.  It is the intention to review it at the end of this year and if the yield from farm taxation generally is in line with what the Government consider it should be, having regard to farm incomes this year, the Government do not intend to maintain the resource tax any longer than is necessary.</P>
      <P>In relation to the final point, that was, the SFADCo exercise, this has been successful. It is a measure of what the small man can achieve for himself and the community, and because it has been successful in a pilot scheme, which is what it is in national terms, it will be the Government's intention to look as soon as possible to the extension of that right throughout the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I may have at the outset commented on those points that might have expressed disagreement or dissatisfaction, I want to say particularly that I have been very encouraged by the measure of support from Senators generally, not least from the members of my own party here and from independent Senators.  I can only assure the House that my intention is to continue <Col N="1054" /> along the path that I have indicated both in the Finance Bill and in any other opportunity that occurs.</P>

      <P>The Senator knows quite well that a Government Minister cannot indicate in advance, particularly when it would be the responsibility of a colleague, as to when something should be available but I can say that the matter is engaging the active interest of the Government at this stage.  The conclusions have not been reached yet but I do not anticipate there being any delay in their implementation after they have been reached.  The principle has been adopted very clearly and it is simply a question of the areas to which the principle can be seen to be applied.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £6,230,000 by the Irish Government to the Sixth Replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association was founded in 1960.  It is one of the organisations that make up the World Bank Group&mdash;the others are the World Bank itself and the International Finance Corporation.  In effect, the association, which has 122 member countries, is a special fund administered by the bank.  The President and staff of the bank are in charge of the day to day running of the association.  They report to an Executive Board which is elected by the member countries.  Major policy matters are decided by the Board of Governors of the association, each member country electing one Governor.</P>
      <P>The association caters for the poorest of the developing countries.  These include countries such as India, Bangladesh, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  Nearly 90 per cent of the association's lending goes to countries with an average annual per capita income of £100 a year.  In some cases the average would be even less than this. Masses of people in these countries would, in fact, be subsisting on incomes of one-third or one-half the national average.  Within these countries the association concentrates on lending for projects which have a direct effect on the living standards of the poor.  Thus, 46 per cent of the association's lending in recent years went on agricultural and rural development.  Agricultural and rural development projects undertaken in 1978 and 1979 are expected to directly benefit about nine million rural families.  The rest of the association's lending is devoted mainly to basic infrastructural, industrial and urbanisation projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the association's projects are aimed at the poorest section of the world community they are nevertheless required to meet appropriate economic and financial criteria; they are supervised <Col N="1056" /> carefully to ensure the greatest efficiency in the use of resources and, after their completion, the projects are fully evaluated with a view to improving the association's future project work.  It is accepted internationally that the assocition operate very high financial control and auditing standards.</P>
    <P>The conditions attaching to the association's loans are highly concessional&mdash;repayment over 50 years, 10 year grace periods before repayments of principal begin and no interest.  There is an annual service charge of three-quarters of 1 per cent on the disbursed portion of each loan.  The service charge is intended to cover administrative costs. The World Bank itself, by contrast, lends on essentially commercial terms and the International Finance Corporation also provide equity and loan finance on an essentially commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The concessional nature of the lending undertaken by the association is made possible by the grant-type resources which are made available to it.  To date these resources comprise, in round figures, initial membership subscriptions amounting to $1 billion, transfers from the surplus income of the World Bank of $1½ billion and nearly $18½ billion from periodic replenishments provided by its richer member countries.  The funds for these replenishments have come traditionally from almost all the developed countries&mdash;the Part I countries as they are known in the Association. All the members of the EEC and many other European countries participate; also, for example, the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia. There are as well a number of OPEC contributors and, in recent years, an increasing number of better-off developing, or Part II, countries.  The latter include Argentina, Brazil, Korea and Yugoslavia.  In all, about 33 countries are expected to contribute to the current Sixth Replenishment.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the association on its foundation in 1960, and subscribed $3 million to its capital.  This country did not contribute to the first or second of the three-yearly replenishments of <Col N="1057" /> resources, but made a contribution of $4 million to the Third Replenishment as a Part II member.  Ireland became a Part I member in 1973, because of the economic progress which had been made over the previous decade, and because of our membership of the EEC.  It was accepted that this would involve a continuing commitment to participate in future replenishments.  As a Part I member, Ireland contributed £3.1 million to the Fourth Replenishment and £5.8 million to the Fifth Replenishment.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the Sixth Replenishment began at the end of 1978 and concluded towards the end of 1979.  The negotiations agreed on an overall amount of $12 billion for the replenishment. This represents an increase of 55 per cent in US dollar terms over the amount of the Fifth Replenishment.  The vast bulk of the funds will be provided by Part I countries.  The basic principle followed in the allocation of contributions among these countries was that each would maintain in this replenishment the same share as it had taken in the Fifth Replenishment, with a number of exceptions in the case of some major contributors.  The allocations have been made on the understanding that commitments to them are not final until approval has, where necessary, been obtained from the legislature of each donor country.  The outcome of the Sixth Replenishment negotiations, which is generally regarded as successful, has been approved by the association's board of governors.  The replenishment will enter into force when member countries contributing about 80 per cent of the total replenishment formally notify the association that they will pay their allocated amounts.</P>
    <P>Donor countries have, as heretofore, the right initially to substitute nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing demand notes for cash payments.  The notes are to be deposited over the three years 1980 to 1982.  Actual cash payments under the replenishment will arise over the years 1981 to 1990.  The precise rate at which the funds are called upon depends <Col N="1058" /> on the progress made in implementing the projects financed by the replenishment.</P>
    <P>As a Part I member of the association, Ireland is, as I have said earlier, expected to participate in the periodic replenishments. In accordance with the sharing arrangements agreed in the negotiations the Government has indicated that, subject to legislative approval, it is prepared to contribute the amount appropriate to Ireland, that is £6,230,000.  The association's management has indicated its appreciation for this undertaking and for the helpful part that Ireland has played in the negotiations.  Contributions to the association are regarded as official development assistance.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the association is covered by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  As in the case of earlier replenishments the Bill now before the House makes provision, by way of amendment to the 1960 Act, for our contribution to the latest replenishment.  The proposed amendment also brings together the earlier payments provisions in the 1960 Act and those inserted by the subsequent amending Acts.</P>
    <P>This Bill, when enacted, will, therefore, enable Ireland to maintain its role in helping to finance the work of the International Development Association and, through it, to continue to help alleviate the appalling conditions in some of the poorest developing countries around the world.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill which of course is not controversial.  It is mandatory legislation designed to allow our country to meet its international commitments as members of the World Bank.  The IDA, not to be confused with the Industrial Development Authority, are a section of the World Bank Group and are described as &ldquo;the soft loan section&rdquo; in the sense that there are extremely generous concessions through this section to poor countries, what are <Col N="1059" /> described as the Third and Fourth Worlds.  It is laudable and receives our full support.</P>
      <P>In more general terms, discussing the commitment of this country to the Third and Fourth Worlds, there is room for some dissatisfaction.  This Bill deals with part of our official development assistance, but on a broader front there is room for disquiet because the agencies in this country which deal with aid to the poorer sections of the world are concerned about the lesser level of Government commitment, especially when related to what had been promised in the commitment that they apparently had sought. The total ODA budget for this year amounts to about £16 million, which is apparently a shortfall of about £5 million in comparison with previous Government commitments.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Finance is in the House because he is on record in the House in February 1975 as committing his party when in Government to ensuring that irrespective of budgetary or balance of payments problems they would set aside each year the appropriate sum to ensure that we reach at least the target set by the Minister, which is 0.35 per cent of our GNP, within five years.</P>
      <P>In relative terms, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the world's poorest countries, we are an immensely wealthy nation.  There has to be a minimum commitment of a country such as ours.  In world affairs we have earned enormous respect as a tiny country with an independent voice in the forums of the world, with a contribution that is out of all proportion to our size.  We have to maintain this moral position, and a continuation of this moral position demands that though we seek from the EEC&mdash;for example, the richer countries of the EEC such as Germany and France&mdash;financial transfers to ease the relative poverty in this country, in more general world terms we must be generous and come through with our commitment to those poorer sections of the world.</P>

    <P>I deplore the fact that we have not come through with money to the extent that we might have.  In the broadest <Col N="1060" /> terms possible this shortfall of £5 million in a country with such a budget as ours and relative to the overall wealth of the country is a pittance and though we accept this Bill&mdash;it is mandatory, there is not an option, it is simply our contribution and we are going along with it&mdash;I would appeal to the Minister to hold to the previous commitment which was the bare minimum, and to look to a future in which, irrespective of budgetary or balance of payments problems, there will be a minimum contribution from this country to these appallingly poor parts of the globe.</P>

      <P>I fully support the Bill. The Minister has told us the appalling fact that many people in those countries are trying to exist on £30 or £40 a year I hope the Minister will tell us what the total contribution from the contributing members will be along with the £6.23 million which Ireland will be contributing, and also indicate which countries capable of contributing do not contribute to this World Bank fund.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to put some of the sums of money that we have been given by the Minister into context.  If one takes Ireland's contribution, in the relevant paragraphs where he offers some of these sums to us, the initial entry fee and the subsequent replenishments, there is a mixture of dollar amounts and £ amounts.  But if one converts the dollars to £s simply by halving them, and if one does not endeavour to make an adjustment for inflation since the initiation of this scheme in 1960 and excluding the first two replenishments in which we did not participate, our contribution has been £12.4 million.  This Bill is to enable us to make a further contribution of £6.23 million, a total of £18.63 million in a period of 20 years.  Again making the very crude assumption that one will do that in a straight line sort of way, that is of the order of magnitude of £1 million a year, and that is not true either since these increments of money come at different times.  I did that crude and distorting arithmetic to get orders of magnitude <Col N="1061" /> and to say that, of course, we do not oppose this Bill.  But if one calculates an averaged contribution over two decades of £1 million a year, one is talking in terms of 30p, 33p or 40p per citizen of the country per year, which is very little indeed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of any arithmetic is to make that point.  What we are being asked to contribute is very very little.  Of course it has to be said in fairness that the International Development Association, one of the organisations under the umbrella of the World Bank group, is not the only mechanism for Third World aid, but it is an important one, and the response of Ireland on these issues in general is very good, so I would think the number of begrudgers would be very small.  In fact what we have been asked to contribute is very little indeed and should give heart-searching to none, because though we are poor in contrast with some of our immediate neighbours, we are rich in comparison to the recipients and it is the very very least we might do.  I hope we all agree to do it willingly and recognise how small it is.</P>
      <P>It is worth broadening that thought a little on the basis of the figures given to us, because for the International Development Association the initial entry fee of all the then participants two decades ago was two-and-a-half billion&mdash;we are working in dollars all the time.  The initial subscription was one billion, there was one-and-a-half billion surplus transfers from the World Bank and 18½ billion by way of replenishment. The tot of that is 21 billion, and that is leaving aside&mdash;the Minister does not in fact tell us as the previous speakers asked him to tell us&mdash;the total amount for all of the donors of the current replenishment to which this Bill relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking of a sum over two decades of 21 billion.  It is not possible for me without going through source books&mdash;and anyway it is slightly arbitrary&mdash;to state the numbers of deserving recipients, the number of persons falling within the category of those States which are recipients, but it must <Col N="1062" /> be of the order of magnitude, again just to try and get figures roughly into the ball court, of half a billion people.  That is soul destroying if one takes it as an approximate plight of the total world population, of the people known to be living at the sort of levels of income that are indicated and to which the Minister and Senator Brugha made reference.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about over a 20-year period is 21 billion dollars for half a billion people, and that is 40 dollars per capita over 20 years, and that is two dollars a year, and very crudely that is one pound a year.  I do that very simply&mdash;forgive me for the crudeness of the arithmetic, it has to be as crude as that&mdash;to put it into context.  That is to show that not alone is the effort of Ireland through this mechanism a small one but the efforts of vastly richer countries than Ireland are also small. We do not have to be ashamed of our place in the relativity table or of our commitment as an individual country, but based on those figures I want to offer people the thought that in fact in terms of the realities of wealth transfers within the world at the moment, all of these efforts are very small indeed and are dangerously small.</P>
    <P>It is presented to us that activities of this kind are terrific and that they are no more than is our duty as decent human beings in the context of a world family.  I think that is true, and they are good arguments, but I think that the argument of self-interest is exceedingly important too, because when we talk of figures like a pound per person per annum of transfers through the World Bank mechanism let us put it in the context of the transfers that have taken place due to the change in the price of oil, because whatever earning power we have, the countries we are talking about have no earning power except for single products in most cases.  If we have difficulty, as we have, in digesting the increases in the price of energy, what does that do to them?</P>
    <P>When I in my time as Minister attended the UNEDO Conference which happened to be taking place in South <Col N="1063" /> America, I also attended another international agency which happened to be taking place in that instance in Kenya, and at all of these the confrontation between developed and developing worlds was very easy to see and very dramatic and very sharp, and a sense of outrage at the developing world was also very clear to be seen.  Although I cannot do it without elaborate preparation, I have the following thoughts to offer in the context of transfers of the pound per person per year.  The extent to which the developing world since the early seventies has been forced to borrow just to retain State structure intact has been enormous, very dramatic, indeed inescapable.  Their power to repay is very small, and we see the continuing battles at the international agencies about the rescheduling of loans, about moratoria on loans, and we see that the circumstances in which the developing world now finds itself and which this Bill, in however small a way, is intended to play our part in remedying the circumstances of the developing and the poorest sections, of people with less than 100 dollars per capita annual income, their circumstances, as the seventies evolved and as the energy situation evolved and world trade has evolved, has been deteriorating strikingly rapidly.  It is not that they are getting a place in the sun, it is not that they are holding their position, they are in fact&mdash;and I say that this is not an altruistic argument, this for us is a survival argument&mdash;deteriorating very strikingly.</P>
    <P>What has been happening simultaneously is that there is an explosion in communication.  If the people&mdash;let us take an example that is in the newspapers this week, of Soweto, that appalling and obscene defacing of the earth&mdash;see television through the window of a shop that sells television sets, they see it in however occasional a way, or it may be in a pub, they no longer are ignorant of how we live, so not alone is the gap increasing but the knowledge of the gap is becoming more generalised. That seems to me a formula for explosion of a kind that we often underestimate. The conclusion, if any of <Col N="1064" /> what I am saying is right, is that helping disadvantaged places of the world is more than altruism, it is a matter of self-interest and survival for us and for the planet as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would add the thought, wearing the particular political and ideological blinkers that I do, that in the vast majority of instances the poverty and the other problems we see of social and cultural disruption in these countries are not of their own making.  It is no use applying the wasp ethic and saying that if only they worked like us they would be rich like us, it is their fault.  It is because of the realities of the development of the world economy, going back centuries, going back to the slave trade, going back to what happened with the gold in South America, going back to the last century and the development of the British Empire. I am using the analyses and the arguments and what seems to me to be the impeccable documentation of the school of economists in Stockholm. When I look at what these people say it seems to me unanswerably true that the poverty of the Third World has been created simultaneously with the wealth of the developed world.  The two things are connected and represent a wealth transfer.  The two things represent what I with my blinkers would consider as the economic basis of imperialism and, in current euphemism, neo-colonialism.  It does not matter what you call the process.</P>
    <P>The reality is that our wealth is built on their poverty and their social disruption and their culture shock, their alienation. We have responsibilities for that reason.  We have responsibilities as humans whatever the reasons for the present situation, because we are the same species.  That seems to me the most serious reason for welcoming this, but what we are contributing is not nearly enough, and we must try and see it not alone for the contribution that we honourably make but to see it in the context of the scale of the need.  The reason for making these arguments is that if we do not halt and then reverse the process of the polarisation of the globe, that is a pun but an appropriate pun, because it is <Col N="1065" /> dividing into north and south, not that the wealth is leaking down, it is leaking up, it is moving to the top of the globe, if we do not halt that process of differentiation of people whose annual per capita income is less than $100, and if we do not then reverse it and open a path to develop those people into our sort of society, our sort of standards, whether it is more Scandinavian or more like what Margaret Thatcher or Milton Friedman would wish, it does not matter very much because those different aspirations share some common ideal.  But if we do not offer them the chance of evolving in that way then they will evolve in another way with other objectives under other leadership.  It will be evolution or revolution.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the matter is not one of equity any more: it is a matter of avoiding a third world war.  The great powers will fight over these issues if they see a large scale evolution of large parts of the Third World going on a path that is not acceptable to groupings that are now predominant in the market economy world.  We have the genesis of a world war.  We have the current reality of an obscenely unjust and brutal situation, and it is getting worse.  It is not just the very poorest of the countries, for example the Caribbean countries, which have a certain tourism, a certain source of foreign earnings, a certain development of infrastructure, who are in exceedingly critical situations.</P>
    <P>I hope I can convey the sense that it is impossible for any of us who try to see the world as a whole, to look to the survival of our species and the avoidance of a world war, to exaggerate the importance of the division between north and south, between rich and poor.  It is impossible for us to be complacent when we see that division widening.  It is not a matter any more of altruism, though that is a good reason.  It is a matter of species survival.</P>
    <P>Though the contents of the Bill are indeed admirable, they are not nearly enough, and though I applaud this Bill, I cannot help noting and deploring that in <Col N="1066" /> other ways we seem, in the face of our own difficulties, which are real but in this context are nonetheless small, to be drawing back on a commitment to a level of aid and to our own indigenous organisations which behave so admirably to the other half of the globe. That seems to me short-sighted, selfish and, most important, intensely misguided in the context of the size of the crisis that has come because of the economic change in the seventies in regard to the economic survival of the Third World.</P>
    <P>Though this is a Bill which I do not think anyone in a month of Sundays could oppose, it is very important for us to see it in context, to see the inadequacy of its scale, to see other activities of the Government not evolving in the same direction in terms of magnitude, in terms of adjustment for inflation and even in terms of enabling us to continue some of the voluntary activities that Irish organisations have both admirably and very intelligently undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is fine, but the general tendency is not.  The scale of the Bill and of our effort is not fine.  It could be asked why 3.4 million people rich enough to be in OECD, to be in the EEC, have to be responsible.  We have to be responsible because we have a role in the world which goes beyond our numbers.  We are the country with the experience of being part of a metropolitan exploiting area which got away from it.  We are the country of all of the white countries which can see black as well as white.  We can see exploitation as well as the benefit from being the exploiter.  We can see what happens to the morale and fabric of life in a country when it suffers the culture shock from defeat and from the undermining of its values, its gods and its whole social structure.  If anybody of all the people who possess the northern experience, the developed experienced, the industrial revolution experience, if any nation in the world is able by its history to see both sides, it ought to be us.  If any nation has the need to shout out and to point to the danger it ought to be us.  Our duty in this regard is a very <Col N="1067" /> great one but the scale of our response is not currently adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome and support for the Bill.  It has been supported from both sides of the House but it raises many points of both principle and detail and of general approach, many of which Senator Keating, in his very interesting contribution, was making.  I would find myself very much in agreement with a great deal of what Senator Keating was saying.  One of the sad factors in the present situation and it is certainly by no means the main factor or the only factor, but it has been a contributory factor in many of these countries, is that well-intentioned attempts to bring about policies of a type and nature with which Senator Keating is associated has, unfortunately, resulted in great misery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keating mentioned the Caribbean and there is a prime example there in Jamaica where, potentially, the country which could and should be supporting its inhabitants in some degree of prosperity, through no doubt well-intentioned but misguided policies, has instead reduced that country close to ruin.  However, I agree with a great deal of the rest of Senator Keating's contribution. We are making far too small an individual or a national contribution from this country to the developing world. Certainly, we of all countries, as Senator Keating indicated, should be conscious of and aware of the mal effects of the colonial or post-colonial legacy of the way in which wealth and, perhaps more important than direct wealth, traditions, talents, individuals, have been drained away or discouraged and the cycle has been set up in which wealthy imperialist nations first of all battened on the rest of the world, drew their riches from them and set up a situation which is perpetuated from year to year and grows greater each year, whereby they continue to become more wealthy and the countries which they have impoverished have entered into a cycle which is ever getting lower, with consequent tragedy for the individuals concerned and the <Col N="1068" /> detriment of the countries concerned and bringing about a very serious overall situation in terms of world politics.</P>
    <P>The International Development Association has had its loans referred to by one of the Senators as being soft loans and this is a necessary and important role of the IDA.  There is no way in which many of these countries can possibly take loans on the basis of those offered by the World Bank or similar kinds of institution.  They just do not have the wherewithal.  There is no effective way in which they could repay the loans if accepted.  The IDA loans, even though called soft loans, play an absolutely crucial role if these countries are to have any hope of breaking out of the cycle of impoverishment in which they find themselves at present.</P>
    <P>We should differentiate between the various countries concerned.  We tend to talk in this catchphrase of north-south relations and to talk of the developing countries as though they were all in exactly the same sort of circumstances or category.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Some countries in the developing world have almost no hope at all at present of breaking out of the situation. They have no mineral resources.  They have no agricultural resources.  They have no industrial tradition.  They have a low standard of education and, in these circumstances, there is no other effective way in which they can develop unless we in the developed countries and in particular countries such as Ireland come out and help them, both through financial aid and through technical assistance. The two of them must be linked together. It is a criminal waste of money to build, for example, a very expensive high-powered type of hospital in a primitive developing country.  It may seem very charitable and worth while and people may clap themselves on the back on the amount of money that was contributed to them and so on.  If that hospital is too expensive to run, if the developing country concerned does not have the personnel to man it you end up with the population worse off than before.  They probably have made some contribution to this expensive project as a result of <Col N="1069" /> which other more necessary health projects, such as district health stations and so on have been starved of the meagre funds which they already possess.</P>
    <P>The same applies right through to industrial projects, educational projects: they must be adapted to the circumstances of the countries concerned. Otherwise, the only real beneficiaries are the industrial nations which are selling the industrial concerns involved or which are drawing revenues in relation to the expert assistance which they give.  It is very important that we do not just sit back and talk about the actual sums of money involved.  They are, in themselves, quite inadequate but even doubling or trebling them will not in itself mean that they are effectively applied.</P>
    <P>We have a particular role to play in that we have some historical idea of what is necessary and some practical experience over the last 20 years or so of gradually pulling ourselves up from a very impoverished situation.  A word of congratulation is very much in order here to the many voluntary organisations which are actively and very effectively involved in overseas aid and assistance of one type or another.  There is a lot of Government encouragement, but we could give them a great deal more.</P>
    <P>In relation to the funds involved, this is an area in which we could perhaps maximise the benefit of our contribution. The question of oil has come up and the increase in oil prices, both in the previous debate and in this debate.  It is understandable that very few of us, as we suffer from the appalling effects in western economies of the increase in oil prices, should spare very much sympathy for developing nations in these circumstances. Earlier today we were arguing whether we could afford to go on paying ourselves and keeping up with certain standards of living by borrowing overseas in order to make up for the effects of the increased oil prices, but other countries are not in quite such a comfortable position.  For many of the developing countries, particularly in Africa, the <Col N="1070" /> increase in oil prices has almost entirely used up any income that they had available and, in most cases, is far beyond any foreign incomes or foreign earnings which are available to them. The effect on those developing countries has been absolutely catastrophic.</P>
    <P>We in the west and those countries which are members of OPEC should come together and think about this matter a little further.  Some form of subsidised hydrocarbon aid to these developing countries which have no possible way of effectively paying present world prices for oil should be considered. We have contributed.  I have worked it out in dollars.  Senator Keating worked it out in pounds.  This 12 million or so extra dollars that we are now contributing represents a 66 per cent increase in our previous contributions, but really it just is not enough.  We should be contributing more and we should be extending our support a good deal more.</P>
    <P>I was horrified in another context to discover some months ago that we are not a member of the Asian Development Bank which has played a very useful role in developments in poor countries in Asia with which we have had associations&mdash;the Philippines, Thailand and so on&mdash;where there is poverty just as severe as is to be found in many parts of Africa.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised in a way at the reference to Soweto by Senator Keating. I agree with him about it being an abomination.  One of the facts we must realise is that the wealth in Southern Africa as it so happens is in Zimbabwe and in the Union of South Africa.  Many people from countries outside South Africa have been going there to get work and, relatively speaking among the African population, have a high standard of living.  I take Senator Keating's point about communications and agree with it absolutely wholeheartedly.  The problem is to see that this wealth is evenly distributed among all the populations there, whether they be white, black, or whatever colour, or whatever religious or political affiliations they may have.  It is not doing a service to an African or indigenous <Col N="1071" /> population if we help and aid it in its attainment of independence and the effect of that independence is to impoverish still further the people concerned.</P>
    <P>This is something we must look at especially with regard to South Africa. There is no way in the present day world that apartheid can or should be maintained. We must accept and encourage the fact that it must come to an end, and do all we can to encourage its speedy end.  We here in Ireland have a role to play.  We have not got dirty hands over South Africa, and let us be frank about it, certain neighbouring countries have. We are white and yet we have suffered from the type of apartheid and discrimination, dressed up, perhaps, in a different form, as exists in South Africa. I should like to think that one of the things we can do in our international aid generally, and as regards the developing countries and those segments of the population who are so very badly deprived, is to try to see that when the changeover does take place in South Africa, as inevitably it must, it is not accompanied by excessive bloodshed and that, as far as possible, the indigenous populations there, whatever their colour, stay on and allow circumstances to develop in which the wealth of that country will continue to be increased but spread to the benefit of all its inhabitants.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be driven finally to joining a political party if only to get on the front bench and thus prevent my points being stolen by the time I am called upon to speak.  However, all my points have not been stolen.  I should like to take the opportunity on this occasion of referring to the widespread disappointment that exists among various bodies which are involved in programmes of aid to developing countries, the widespread disappointment, bafflement indeed, expressed by members of such bodies as Concern, Comhladh, and so on, at the recent reduction in our own aid programmes to certain <Col N="1072" /> developing countries.  This was a matter which I expected Senator Conroy to touch on but perhaps I am not surprised that he did not.  The disappointment one hears from these voluntary workers can only be a small reflection of the disappointment, and perhaps even fury, that must be felt by the people in these countries who have seen projected programmes sabotaged, in effect, by our scandalous decision to cut back on particular aid programmes.</P>
      <P>In places like Tanzania the contrast between a remembered and friendly State visit of our President and the present bleak realities of famine stalking East Africa must be particularly bitter. That decision has affected adversely and has diminished our status <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Third World in general and those particular countries in Africa in particular.</P>
      <P>Senator Keating dwelt at some length on the question of enlightened self-interest as being, in the last analysis, the reason for survival and why we should be involved in aid to the Third World. He went on to sketch a further dimension to that which I want to develop here.  He spoke about our human responsibilities. I want to stress our Irish responsibilities.</P>
      <P>What is very important about our aid programmes to African countries and, therefore, what is correspondingly deplorable about the cut back, is that this is something we are doing as an Irish State, not as a member of the European Community, not as a member of any particular international association but <i>qua</i> Ireland.  The benefit of what we have been doing up to now is particularly important by virtue of our history, our experience of famine, our atypical non-European experience as a former exploited colony, as a subject nation only recently liberated and, after that, as a small State developing our own expertise in particularly indigenous ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is why we should have a very special relationship with the Third World.  The recent deplorable cut backs have diminished that relationship.  It is very hard not to see this unfortunate decision as part of a general drift away <Col N="1073" /> from independent stances in international affairs.  As the House knows, I am one of the unrepentant few who still hold that our horizons have diminished, have narrowed, not broadened, since our entry into the Common Market.  I am confirmed in this view by the recent and deplorable decision to cut back in our aid to developing countries.</P>

      <P>I am still on a point of order.  I was present this morning when the Order of Business was agreed. My recollection is that there was neither discussion nor agreement in regard to whether there would or would not be a break at this time.  There was certainly no decision that there would not be a break.  The matter was not discussed and was not resolved.  If one is guided by normal precedent then, after three days of Seanad sittings, at this time on the third day, with a lot of work to come, it would be normal at least to consider the possibility.  What I am asking now, courteously, is that someone should discuss the matter with the Leader of the House and we come back with reasonable time to do that.  If we do not get a reasonable response, but there is plenty of time to get a reasonable response&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it confirms that at least one element of our overseas development aid is being maintained despite domestic financial difficulties.  We made a progressive&mdash;indeed a generous move&mdash;in 1973 when, of our own volition, we joined as a Part I member of the International Development Association.  We thus recognised our distinctly favourable position in a world in which wealth is very badly divided, a world in which, whatever may be our feelings from time to time about not being so well off ourselves, we are in fact amongst the 25 richest countries in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This contribution to the International Development Association will mean a payment over a period of years by Ireland to the association of £6.23 million.  According as it is disbursed this will count as part of our official development assistance.  But, as has already been pointed out this afternoon, our total development aid programme has suffered a disappointing setback this year.  Many Members of the Oireachtas, and concerned persons and organisations outside, have already deplored the failure of the Government to live up to their commitment in regard <Col N="1075" /> to development aid, a failure indicated by the provisions of the 1980 Estimate for International Co-operation, in particular the drastic cuts&mdash;even in money terms&mdash;in bilateral aid and disaster relief and the cut of almost 20 per cent in real terms represented by the mere repetition and the cut of almost 20 per cent in real terms represented by the mere repetition (APSO).</P>
    <P>As the original chairman of that organisation, perhaps I may be permitted to say that the kind of personal service of a training character in developing countries which APSO sponsors is, perhaps, the most highly effective form of development co-operation.  It certainly does not suffer from the risk of waste, of diversion, to which Senator Conroy drew attention a moment ago.  The regrettable consequences of this real cut in the provision for APSO were instanced by the present chairman at the last annual general meeting on 27 May.  I do not intend to repeat them, save only to say very briefly that this limitation on their finances will mean that approximately one-third fewer persons giving this sort of service overseas will be in the field at the end of this year as compared with the beginning.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, to moderate my criticism because of my sense of the reality of the financial difficulties which confront the Government and, indeed, of my own advocacy of reduction of budget deficits.  Nevertheless, I do have the feeling that when economies were being sought and tax reliefs determined insufficient attention was paid to the commitments we rightly and voluntarily entered into in relation to the Third World and to the degree to which already we have fallen behind in honouring these commitments.</P>
    <P>The extent to which our performance is falling short of our promise is indicated by the fact that Ireland's total development assistance in 1980 at £16.226 million will represent less than one-fifth of 1 per cent of our GNP.  Contrast this meagre fraction with the seven-tenths of 1 per cent of GNP to which Ireland is committed as its target for official <Col N="1076" /> aid&mdash;the rest of the original 1 per cent scheduled for aid to the third world is to be, or should be made up by private aid.</P>
    <P>Our interim target, several times reaffirmed by the present Minister for Finance, was to have reached an official aid contribution of 0.35 per cent of GNP by now, whatever the budgetary or balance of payments problems.  We are short of 0.20 per cent.  But these percentage figures, I am faraid, conceal the extent of the shortfall because even 0.15 per cent of GNP is now a sum of at least £12 million.</P>
    <P>The discomfiture we should all feel, public as well as Government, because we are not honouring our commitments, should be all the greater because of our lavish spending in more selfish directions. This year's £16 million for overseas development assistance is hardly visible when set beside our current expenditure on alcoholic drink and tobacco which is now close to £1,000 million a year.  There is a disproportion here which I hope we would all wish to have reduced, particularly if we realised how terrible is the plight of the Third World.</P>
    <P>The recently published Brandt Commission Report should stir us to action. In relation to health alone, that report reminds us of some pretty horrifying facts. Amongst them are these.  There are still countries in Africa where one child in four does not survive until its first birthday. Of the 20 million to 25 million children under five who die every year in developing countries, one-third die from diarrhoea caught from polluted water. River-blindness, vitamin A deficiency, or water borne infections cause blindness in 30 million to 40 million people in the Third World.  Between 500 million and 1,000 million people in the Third World are under-nourished and hungry.  In the poorest countries with a total population of over 250 million, the average annual income per head is about £1.50 a week. As has been mentioned, it is primarily for these countries that the International Development Association caters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> If these facts were more widely known, and also if the broader considerations touched on by Senator Keating and Senator Conroy were more widely known&mdash;and I hope it will be the business of the new advisory council on development co-operation to help make them known&mdash;I am certain the response of the Irish public would be such that the Government would be strongly pressed to go steadily forward towards the 0.7 per cent target for official aid and, what is more important, would be enabled to do so financially by public acquiescence in the necessary budgetary and taxation provisions.  Meanwhile, the Government are to be commended for honouring their IDA replenishment commitment through this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to comment, however briefly, on this Bill and to welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced it in the House today.  During the six-and-a-half years I had the honour to serve in the European Parliament I was either a member of the Assembly of the Ayounde Agreement or a member of the Executive of the Lome Convention. In addition, for a couple of years I served as Chairman of the European Parliament India Relations Committee.  For the first year I was there, I was on the Development and Aid Commission of the Community, all of which tended to give me an insight into the problems of the huge masses of people for whom this type of aid was designed and intended. During my membership of the Community I had the opportunity of officially visiting some 20 odd countries.  In the main, they were in the Continent of Africa, but also in some of the other under-developed regions of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any great commitment here to the problems of the Third World.  Despite the fact that so many people here make a tremendous contribution through the various voluntary organisations, through their work in various parts of the world, nevertheless, we ought to have in the Oireachtas a foreign relations sub-committee.  The <Col N="1078" /> Seanad could well set up such a committee so that Senators could go out on fact-finding missions and endeavour to instil into the public mind our obligations as a Christian society.  No matter how thin the veneer of Christianity is, it is difficult to appreciate the problems until people see for themselves the very stark contrast and the reality of the two-tier society in which people either have their breakfast or have not got it.  This is the tremendous problem.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, it is valid to recall that the Minister's budget statement this year evoked very adverse comment, especially in the public press and from people who are making a tremendous voluntary contribution, because of the savage cutbacks in our aid to the Third World.  I do not want to dwell on that.  I know it has slowed up the very excellent programmes which so many of the Irish agencies, especially the semi-State agencies, are carrying out in Lesotho, Maseru and Swaziland.  These programmes bear comparison with the programmes the larger and wealthier countries across the world have undertaken. We are inclined to hide our light under a bushel.  The Minister has personnel in his own Department who are very committed and who are doing a tremendous job, and who go much further than they are called to go officially.</P>
    <P>I know it is disorderly to mention names, but our personnel in Lesotho represent not only the Department of Foreign Affairs but also the Department of Finance, the ESB and many other State and semi-State organisations.  Their contribution to the establishment of necessary infrastructures in that small country will be a lasting monument to them.  In my experience of visiting many other countries for not more than two weeks at a time, in the Central African Republic which is a considerable landmass, in Niger, Chad, Peru or, indeed, Swaziland, there is tremendous hardship. As members of the human race, as a Christian people, we must have an order of priorities.  While we have problems at home, we must recognise our responsibility <Col N="1079" /> to assist people who are at a lower and a later stage of development than we are.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in this century the world has shrunk drastically and it is not sufficient or valid to say any more that these problems are at the far side of the world and, therefore, we are far removed from them.  I contend that that is not the case.  While one can be very sympathetic towards areas of the underdeveloped world, when it comes to practicalities we seem to forget any commitment. For instance, during negotiations on the sugar agreement.  I do not think there is any thread of Christianity in our attitude when it comes to fighting our corner.  We must make allowances for the tremendous problems of economies dependent on one crop.  As members of the EEC we have this in common with other countries.  Government Ministers especially take a very nationalistic view which lacks a dimension.</P>
    <P>As a developed nation, irrespective of our state of development or underdevelopment, we have traditions and we have a certain stage of development.  We owe it to these people to demonstrate that we appreciate their problems and, as far as it lies within our power and our resources, we should be prepared to contribute to their orderly development.  International aid does not always have to be in financial transfers or in monetary contributions.  The tremendous work of the Agency for Personal Service Overseas can contribute in a very dynamic way to the development of these countries. In my experience the people who have gone from this country, whether they be missionaries or, indeed, people from the public services or the private sector, have worked hard.  They seem to have something which puts them apart in the eyes of those people in the developed countries from people who had a colonial background.  That makes our people ideally suitable to give a lead, to show these people some light at the end of the tunnel.  If we do not work hard to do that, as individual members of society <Col N="1080" /> we are failing to make a contribution to mankind and to assist people who are very many times worse off than we are.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I was disappointed that the Department could not find some way to contribute a grant to one of the Bantu schools in the Republic of South Africa, even though it was an all-black school.  This is where I would ask the Government to consider a change of policy.  I do not think we should recognise or support apartheid. We had the same problem in the EEC on the question of Uganda.  There was a volume of opinion that we should not support or contribute to that country for the simple reason that they had a nut, a barbarian, at their head.  It is not fair for a country such as ours, irrespective of which Government are in power, to label an entire race of people because of the policy of one man who is a dictator.</P>
    <P>Similarly on the question of the Republic of South Africa we should look for opportunities to demonstrate as Christians, as white people, as Europeans, to the oppressed people there that we want to help them.  Their school systems are assisted greatly by many of the different orders and societies of Irish missionaries.  Our Government need not necessarily be connected in any way with the South African Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker, in his excellent contribution, gave the House many very telling figures and, indeed, very important ones.  There is one great criticism of the European Community and this year there was a protracted row over the budget of the Community.  The Common Agricultural Policy is criticised by many people from different backgrounds and with different philosophies.  The main criticism is that it encourages excess agricultural production.  It encourages the production of excess food in a world where six out of every ten people are undernourished. This should make us think, and we should find ways of making a transfer of resources, whether they be food resources or others.  The Economic Community should be thinking about agri-power, if I can call it that, especially when they are speaking to <Col N="1081" /> people who are using energy.  Some countries seem incapable of utilising the increased flow of resources to improve their standard of living and to feed their population.</P>
    <P>There are many points I should like to raise in this most important debate. Perhaps the House should consider having a standing committee on foreign relations so that we could keep ourselves informed on the problems of the Third World who are numerically in the majority. We should advocate greater support for the voluntary agencies which do such tremendous work.  They are not in that business to get thanks.  But we should endeavour to ensure that they are adequately financed.  I do not mean that they require a huge amount of finance. There is a level which will keep them operating in such a way that the Irish people will continue to appreciate them and provide an Irish presence in the Third World.  Despite the fact that there has been a cut back in the fund provided in the budget this year, I compliment our people in the Department of Foreign Affairs who over the years have made a tremendous contribution which is greatly appreciated by many people in the developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long on this Bill.  I have a few comments to make and one or two questions that the Minister might be able to answer which would add to our understanding in relation to this important Bill.  I agree with speakers who said that for a small nation like Ireland, even if we are in the top 25 richest countries, aid in kind or personnel aid is probably the way that we can contribute best.  I should like to take the opportunity of noting the work done by various agencies who have contributed personnel to do this work.  I recently had an opportunity when I was in the international trade centre in Geneva to hear about the work that some of the people in the universities have done in providing consulting aid to developing countries.  It is a question of helping them to help themselves, and we have a lot to give there. Clearly there is an advantage in it for us also because when our people go abroad they learn more and get a broader perspective.  They make contacts which are good for the country in every way.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how much of the funds are actually spent abroad as opposed to staying at home in these various agencies.  Would the Minister have any information on that?  At the same time, there is a certain amount of unreality when we think of what we can achieve from this or what we can do. Yesterday during the debate on the Finance Bill I was pointing out the amount consumed in the richer countries, for instance, Sweden is in the order of $6,000 compared to something like $2,000 here.  I feel that there might be a policy in this regard where the richer countries would have a progressive bite on them as one gets up towards the larger income per capita countries rather than any proportional contribution.  We know from the combat poverty committee, although I do not necessarily agree with the figures, that 25 per cent of the people in this country are under the poverty line.  While not taking from the fact that we have to deal with the horrific facts Senator Whitaker gave us, at the same time we must recognise that we are small and should optimise our efforts not just in money terms but in helping them to help themselves by helping to train them.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the Minister might be able to tell us what the Coalition record was in terms of what they spent.  I seem to remember that there was some point about whether money could be carried over from one year to the next.  I do not remember in detail what that was about, but maybe the Minister might be able to help us.  I welcome the fact that we are continuing to meet our commitments, and I hope that we will continue to do so in line with the fact that we are a very small country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of satisfaction to us as a nation that Ireland joined the International Development Association when it was founded in 1960 but a <Col N="1085" /> matter of regret that we did not see fit or were not able to contribute to the first, second or third yearly replenishments. Later we contributed a sum of $4 million.  When we joined the EEC we became a Part I member.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply would tell us how our percentage of GNP contribution compares with the GNP percentage contributed by other member countries to the International Development Association. It was regretted that we have not been in a position to make a greater contribution. Probably if our economic situation improves we will be in a position to make greater contributions to this very deserving cause because there is not the slightest doubt that it would have the full support of the vast majority of our people, especially those who are well informed about the frightful conditions that prevail in parts of the Third World. The figures given by Senator Whitaker certainly provide food for thought for all of us.</P>
      <P>In one part of the world there are millions of people suffering from starvation and in other areas we have wheat being burned, fish being dumped back into the sea, butter mountains being built up, and all this is happening at a time when millions of people are being deprived.  For that reason future generation will have very severe comments to make about our behaviour.  In conjunction with that if we compare the paltry amount subscribed by the various better off nations towards alleviating distress in the deprived parts of the world to the enormous sums being spent on armament, we are in for a proper bashing from generations to come.  As we are a country which is not aligned to any of the great power blocks, we, together with our representatives abroad, should at international level continue to draw attention to the poor performance of mankind regarding assistance on a very paltry scale to deprived people in the Third World.  We would fulfil a useful role by drawing the attention of mankind to that situation and not allowing people to forget that Dives and Lazarus are still with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the <Col N="1086" /> Minister's opening statement was so brief in that he merely sketched some facts concerning the International Development Association, the method of filling its exchequer and what we do in that regard.  I would have hoped that he might have taken the opportunity to tell us in some detail what his views are on the general problem of the poverty of the Third World and how the richer countries should move towards curing or at least alleviating those problems.  As contributors to this association we would I presume have a voice within us, a voice which would contribute towards the making of a policy by this association and its implementation.</P>
      <P>We have a voice in the EEC and, as other speakers have pointed out, it seems incredible that while the EEC has a surplus which is being dumped in comparatively rich countries, such as the Soviet Union, there are millions dying or suffering from hunger every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not take the opportunity along those lines.  He might perhaps have indicated to us that the Government have received and are studying the recent Brandt Commission report, the fundamental investigation into what is described as North-South relations, rich-poor relations.  This was a high powered commission representative of both North and South and produced a number of extremely interesting recommendations. Its analysis of the problem was also extremely interesting.  One might quibble with some of its findings or its approach but, because of the importance of this report, the level of seniority of the members composing it and its direct relevance to the subject that we are debating, I feel the debate somehow lacks in substance when all this field is ignored.  It tends to confirm an impression I have concerning us as a nation and as individuals.  It is possibly an impression that could be applied to the rest of the European and richer countries. It is that if we pay some money we discharge our obligation, as if by paying the money&mdash;to some extent putting the problem of the poor of the world under a carpet&mdash;we have salved our consciences. <Col N="1087" /> We do not follow up and see how we can contribute towards ensuring that what we give is adequate in the first instance and that how it is spent is most effective.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency on the part of the North&mdash;I will use the terms of the Brandt Commission&mdash;to make its contribution and then forget about the problem and hope it will go away.  The sketchiness of the Minister's introductory speech is symptomatic of that tendency of the North to announce that we are paying our money, with a certain amount of self-satisfaction we all feel when we are discharging an obligation, and leaving it at that.  But we have an obligation and a duty to go much further.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Commission makes a number of very interesting recommendations, but before it does so it indicates the magnitude of the financial help that is required to alleviate the problems of the southern world.  It says that to deal with the problem an emergency development programme would be necessary which would cost at least four billion dollars a year in addition to the aid already being given.  That is an immense sum but we are aware, peripherally in our minds, that the problem is immense. It only comes home to us in human or emotive terms when our television takes an occasional rest from showing tripe and shows us real pictures of the real Third World.  We get a momentary pang of conscience when we see the impassive faces, emaciated bodies and distended stomachs of children condemned to die at an early age from hunger and malnutrition.  The consumer world in which we live sweeps in on top of us again, that image disappears and we forget our responsibility.</P>
    <P>Governments have an extra responsibility. They have the responsibility to be at all times sensitive to the magnitude of this problem.  When a commission of the weight of the Brandt Commission identify that the solution will require an extra annual contribution of four billion dollars, paltry is an inadequate word to describe what is proposed here.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1088" /> what is not proposed is an attitude or frame of mind to show a realisation of the magnitude of the problem, a query as to how we in our way could initiate, both at home and through our voice in the various international agencies to which we belong, a start on the gathering of this immense sum to try and banish from our television screens the scandalous scenes that I have described.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a voice in the EEC as one of the Council's Finance Ministers.  I wonder has he ever initiated with his colleagues there a discussion on the Brandt Commission report or suggested to his colleague in foreign affairs that the wealthy countries of Europe might take an initiative in bringing the Brandt Commission report from being a report into actuality.  I would be glad to hear from him when he is replying as to whether he thinks he could initiate anything along these lines in any of the international agencies which he attends.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Commission warns the Northern countries against any trend towards a policy of protectionism in trade.  It points out that for reasons of self-interest alone, any such direction would be detrimental to the countries of the North.  It points out that trade on an open basis with the Third World has tended to ease the effects of recession on us. It is estimated that that trade supports 900,000 jobs in the EEC alone.  If we did not have that trade with Third World countries, the already large unemployment problem would be larger by 900,000.  For reasons of self-interest alone, it would seem that protectionism is something we should avoid acutely.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there is a trend towards protectionism in the western world in times of recession which very often brings with it balance of payments problems.  There is a great temptation to look for the simple solution of shutting down the barrier in the hope that that will cure some of the current economic ills.  An extreme example of that is the very substantial body of opinion in Britain that is building up to get out of <Col N="1089" /> the EEC and get back into cosy, self-sufficiency. It is a temptation that the western world will be faced with as the recession continues.  There is no sign that it will end for quite some time yet.  I would be anxious to know from the Minister if he has detected, in his time in foreign councils, any trend towards protectionism either in countries on an individual basis or that it might become corporate policy for the Community.  We would like to hear from the Minister that he would regard such trend as undesirable and would use his voice against it.</P>
    <P>One other interesting proposal of the Brandt Commission was that to raise some of the finance needed a levy should be imposed on the sale of armaments. According to the Commission's report, these sales amount to the staggering total of $400 billion per annum.  A country such as this which is not engaged in the arms trade, which likes to think&mdash;erroneously perhaps&mdash;that it has a certain moral standing to compensate for its lack of size, might see if we have any such standing and if we could initiate any sort of a policy to persuade the arms-manufacturing countries to pay a levy on the sale of their armaments towards the alleviation of the problems of the poorer sections of the world.  It has been estimated by the Brandt Commission that the cost of a ten-year programme for essential food and health needs in developing countries would be less than half of one year's military spending.  It seems a small price to pay to banish hunger from this planet.</P>
    <P>When one has regard to the fact that the grandfathers of many people in this Chamber would have had first hand knowledge of what famine was like&mdash;famine was a reality in this country just over 100 years ago&mdash;one would think that the memory of that and the effects it has had on us as a nation would be an inspiration to us to take vigorous action in any international forum to ensure that any spare resources would be directed towards alleviating this great urgent problem.  The figures quoted by Senator Whitaker, which have impressed <Col N="1090" /> everyone because of their magnitude and the appalling scenes they represent in terms of human grief, should inspire us to do whatever we can and give whatever lead we can towards a move to try to banish famine.</P>
    <P>Politicians, notoriously, react to public opinion.  It is not a surprise, it is the way the system goes.  Public opinion in the area of foreign development, the whole North-South relationship, is complacent, not from any innate complacency but because of lack of knowledge.  It needs to be educated as to the urgency of dealing with the problem the world faces and as to the magnitude of it.  It needs education in how it has to be tackled.  When public opinion becomes sufficiently educated in that way it might then have the effect of impinging sufficiently vigorously on the political mind and, in turn, bring more vigorous political action nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>A lot of work is being done in the education of public opinion throughout the country on the problems in this area. Much of it is being done by the members of the Agency for Personal Service Overseas who are about to go on assignments or who have returned.  They can give first hand testimony of the problems they encountered and through the various voluntary organisations, they can bring a heightened public awareness of the problems.  It is ironic that they have become more vocal recently than for some time in the past.  The inspiration of the cause of them becoming vocal has been the reneging by the Government on the specific promise of the Minister with regard to the proportion of our GNP that would be set aside to assist them. They have gone so far in their current magazine as to quote him:</P>
    <P>We commit ourselves to ensuring that irrespective of our budgetary or balance of payments problem, we shall set aside, year after year, the appropriate sum to ensure that we reach at last the target set by the Minister, 0.5 per cent of our GNP within five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> The Minister said that in February 1975. Having regard to the time at which that speech was made, and having regard to the fact that that speaker now has his hands on the reins of power, and that he and nobody else has it, he does not depend on anyone else to fulfil that commitment and having regard to the fact that he has reneged on it I can only describe that statement in 1975 as a piece of outrageous political opportunism. Ironically, perhaps helpfully in the long run, the outrage of the members of APSO at that reneging has made them vocal in their cause.  There might be a good outcome in terms of public awareness of this problem.  There might be a good outcome in terms of a rethinking by the Minister, and his colleagues in Government, on their responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which aid to the Third World can be spent.  I do not know that we have sufficiently cleared our minds as to where the priority should be in allocating any funds over which we have control.  Quite obviously, the relief of hunger and the elimination of disease must be at the top of the list, to my way of thinking.  There is a school of thought that these problems cannot be eliminated until basic underlying problems are removed, problems which have to do with the political and social structures of the countries concerned, problems that have to do with the illiteracy and backwardness of the populations of many of those countries, problems which have to do with the totalitarian nature of the governments of many of those countries, problems which have to do with the lack of human rights as we in the Western world understand them in many of those countries.</P>
    <P>That school of thought that these difficulties must be first eliminated is a school of thought that is becoming unduly strong and prevalent.  It is very strong in the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and, consequently, very strong in the Trocaire fund raising campaign.  It is a mistaken notion.  The problems of famine, hunger and disease <Col N="1092" /> are so immediate, so large and horrible in terms of human suffering, that all those others, what I regard as peripheral problem areas, should be left on one side and all the funds should be directed to ease human suffering immediately.  It is only when the ambitions of the Brandt Commission report are achieved, and money of the magnitude proposed by that commission is available, that one can then go and tackle the underlying social, political and economic reasons for deprivation.</P>
    <P>It is not much consolation to a person dying of starvation in one part of Africa to be told that the Irish bishops have directed out of their fund, Trocaire, £1,075 for the purchase of bicycles for young Christian workers.  That is a luxury that the sponsors of Trocaire cannot afford to themselves.  If they feel that they can do so the Irish public must be made aware of how the funds they are contributing to those agencies are being spent.  I firmly believe that any funds contributed here should go entirely and in the first instance to the relief of hunger and disease.  The only agency I see working directly towards that, to the relief of hunger at least, is Gorta and, to a lesser extent, Concern.  Some of the medical missionaries are working directly towards the relief of disease but too much of the funds of Trocaire, the largest collecting voluntary agency in the country, go to objects which have to be secondary having regard to the immediacy and magnitude of the problems of hunger and disease.  It is only when there can be a concerted international effort in terms of administration and finance to tackle these underlying problems that we can afford to divert money away.  All other moneys collected now must, when we consider the magnitude of the problem and the horror of it, go towards relieving human beings from pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister when replying to this desirable Bill will take up some of the points I have touched on and indicate the philosophy of the Government in regard to aid to the Third World generally.  Specifically, in relation to the <Col N="1093" /> Bill and his introductory speech, I should like to ask him if the conditions for this latest replenishment becoming an actuality has been fulfilled, have the countries contributing 80 per cent of the replenishment formally notified the association that they will pay their allocated amounts?  I should like to know when our liability will have to be fulfilled and what financial extent that will amount to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with a number of specific questions first and then try to take some more of these general issues raised in the course of the debate.  Obviously, the specific questions relate to the purpose of the Bill itself and how our commitments under it can be implemented. The general questions are of major importance in the whole context of the North-South dialogue Senator Cooney has been touching on and also the interdependent role of the developed and developing worlds at this stage.  Senator Keating and Brugha inquired about the total amount in this replenishment.  I indicated, in my opening statement, that the total will be 12 billion dollars.  The directors of the International Development Association regard this, in present circumstances, as being a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations between the members of the association on a bilateral basis, in the first instance, the executives of the association and, in a multilateral framework, between each other.  That is the answer to the first precise question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brugha asked me to name those who are not contributing to this.  It is easier to name those who are.  Most of the developed countries of the Western world are contributing.  I cannot think of any exception, there may be one, but I am not immediately aware of one.  From the Eastern European countries&mdash;this is significant&mdash;only Yugoslavia is contributing though Rumania has indicated <Col N="1094" /> its intention to contribute to the sixth replenishment.  One might say in that context that not being members of the World Bank group through which this action is taken the Eastern bloc socialist countries are excluded from contributing. That would be to give a very easy let-out to those countries.  I share the views of Members who say the response from the Western world generally is inadequate&mdash;I will deal with that at greater length later.  However inadequate the response from the Western world is, what is crying out shamefully is the lack of any response in this area from the Eastern bloc countries, particularly from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  The fact is&mdash;the developing countries have noted this themselves and it is a view that was conveyed to me when Minister for Foreign Affairs during the Lome negotiations&mdash;that while they see some reason for being actively involved at the liberation stage of the struggle for freedom and independence of these countries and hold some reasons for maintaining a level of influence in those countries, when that has been done there is no real evidence at all, even on a basis that would compare with what is admittedly an inadequate response for the Western world, of any effective continuing aid programmes to the developing countries.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of a point made by Senator Cooney that as the Brandt Commission pointed out in the very comprehensive analysis and clear call and demand on the world in this area, the amount of money being spent on armaments dwarfs by comparison the amounts being contributed in this area. As he has indicated, the amount of 400 billion dollars is certainly a stark contrast to the amounts being provided in this area of development co-operation. The amount spent on armaments by the Soviet Union is in very stark contrast with the level of its activities in development co-operation through any of the multilateral organisations or on a bilateral basis.  If we are to get a degree of inter-dependence throughout the world perhaps this might be a good area <Col N="1095" /> to start.  Perhaps it can now be seen, from the relatively wealthy countries, whether one speaks of the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland or Hungary or any one of them who will be influenced by the decisions of the Soviet Union, that they have a role to play in this whole operation.  If the existing structures of the International Development Association do not immediately meet their requirement in that they may see it, for one reason or another, as being dominated by the Western world, simply because it is the Western world by and large that is contributing to it, then it is open to them to make a case for a new structure which would enable them to make contributions which were hitherto all too obviously lacking in this or in any other area.  That is the first clear point that emerges from the perusal of the countries that are involved.  One is immediately struck not so much by those who are involved but even more by those who are not involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to our own contribution, I should like to say that while Senators have welcomed the Bill, Senator Keating said that our contribution over the years was small.  That is the level of contribution that was fixed in respect of us in this area.  I do not want to make too much of this, but let me say nonetheless for the record that the vice-president of this association called on me recently for the specific reason of thanking Ireland not just for the level of the contribution but rather for the early commitment we gave which was helpful in the course of negotiations to get matching contributions from other countries of our size or association.  I was encouraged by that recognition of the role we played in negotiations and pleased to note that.</P>
    <P>While I would never overstate what Ireland, as a small country, can achieve, nonetheless neither would I understate the effect or moral impact of our achievements of this sort.  When the vice-president indicated this to me it is a measure of the significance of a contribution which is not measured in terms of the money that we apply alone.</P>
    <P>This is only part of our official <Col N="1096" /> development assistance.  In fact, it is somewhat less than 10 per cent.  I agree that the whole relationship between the developed and developing countries is now a crucial one.  Radical solutions are required to deal with the imbalance that exists, as Senators pointed out.  Understandably this morning we were talking of the impact on us of recent developments in the world economies, particularly having regard to the increase in the price of oil.  It is nothing compared with the impact it had on developing countries where the whole export earnings in a year in many cases go to paying for the increase in the cost of oil.  That, in itself, demonstrates graphically, and tragically, the impact of this latest imbalance on these, the poorer countries.</P>
    <P>I agree with all Senators who said that the magnitude of the problems and of developments of that nature are scarcely reflected here, however severe they are in our own conditions.  After today's debate, and during the course of the debate on the remainder of the Finance Bill, we can recognise the severity of it in our own conditions, but however severe they are they are but a pale reflection of the impact on other parts of the world, particularly in the developing countries.</P>
    <P>I agree in relation to armaments that there is a major issue here.  I should like to say to Senator Cooney that not only is that proposal enshrined in the Brandt Commission but, perhaps, he might be more reassured to know that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, when he addressed the special sessions on disarmament at the United Nations made a proposal exactly in line with that contained in the Brandt Commission in that context.  There is no doubt that this is an area in which we have a major role to play.  We have had a consistent position in relation to disarmament down the years.  Anything that can be done to salvage, for the starving of the world, some of the moneys being stockpiled to inevitably create, either as a threat or a reality, further problems for the poor of the world must be a matter of urgent preoccupation for all of us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> I should like to say some general words in relation to what is being received as a cutback in our aid generally in this area.  A number of Senators referred to this.  I should like to remind the House that the total amount allocated for official development assistance this year is £16.226 million. In this area I will be trespassing, inevitably, into the area of one of my colleagues, although I am pleased at the same time to put these things on the record.  That figure represents an increase of 12 per cent.  The figure allocated last year was £13.313 million for official development assistance and this year there is an increase of almost £3 million.</P>
    <P>On an issue of this kind it is as well that we do not make political issues but in view of what Senator Cooney said I should like to state that during our days in Opposition he was a member of the Government who made a commitment in 1973 to reach a target of .35 per cent over a number of years.  In the first year it fell far short of that target.  The total amount for 1974 was £2.7 million.  The amount actually allocated in 1975 was £3.45 million, an increase of £.75 million.  In the first year we fell behind the commitment given in that year.</P>
    <P>It was in that climate that I said that that kind of commitment, given and then reneged on&mdash;that word is being used in respect of the Government now but in that year there was clear and significant evidence of reneging in that year&mdash;that I said we should fix targets which are outside of the normal budgetary preoccupations. In 1975 the figure was increased to £3.45, in 1976 that became £5.71, an increase of £2.3 million and in 1977 it was £7.3 million, an increase of £1.6 million. From 1976 to 1977 it fell in total terms and was less than the increase from 1975 to 1976.  The issues which face the Government today are no different from those which faced the Government of that day.  There are two members of that Government sitting in the Opposition benches now.  I do not know what exigencies forced them to the conclusions <Col N="1098" /> they came to, but there was a real reduction in the extra amount provided.  From 1977 onwards things improved dramatically, I am pleased to say.  The amount provided in 1978 was £9.638 million, an increase of £2.3 million over the previous year, and in 1979 the amount increased to £13.313 million, an increase of almost £3½ million.  In 1980 the increase, as I indicated, will be something short of £3 million.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is not quite an issue on which one would want to divide politically.  It is a little difficult to accept members of the previous Government and distinguished members of their party, criticising the performance of the Government in this area this year. The percentage of GNP last year was .18 and this year it is .19 or in volume terms an increase of almost £3 million and it is difficult to accept that they can be consistent, either in their criticisms or convinced of the factors of the basis of that criticism, having regard to the experience they themselves had.</P>
    <P>Two other things changed the pattern of the allocations in Government of that day and the allocations in Government since we took office.  I am not sure if the figures I have given for 1975 and 1976 actually represent what was estimated or what was spent, I know that for each year that Government were in office&mdash;I am sure Senators Cooney and Keating are acutely aware of this and, perhaps, acutely embarrassed by it&mdash;if the contributions to any of the multilateral organisations were not taken up in a year they were not reallocated to any bilateral aid programme or any other part of the official development assistance programme.  That remained the pattern until I was able to persuade my colleagues in Government that the unspent part of the multilateral commitments&mdash;even the Leader of the Fine Gael Party acknowledged, as he put it, that I was able to achieve something he had not been able to achieve; I would see it rather as a measure of the Government's position in these areas&mdash;be reallocated to ensure that it was applied to other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> Funds were not spent or taken up on the multilateral side last year.  It might be that funds for something such as this association or the European Regional Development Fund for the Lomé Convention were not spent.  However, there were funds hanging over from 1978 that had not been taken up and the Government, instead of taking them back into the Exchequer, rightly and properly, as they had done since 1977, applied them to our bilateral aid programmes as an addition.  It is fair to say that the amounts made available last year were not just the amounts I mentioned in the Estimate of £13.313 million but in fact £14.5 million.  There was a carry over of £1.2 million which had not been allocated for the purposes for which it was intended.  That happened last year.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two points in relation to the bilateral programme though it is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs but I understand he has already made a reference to this in the Dáil and, in any event, we have discussed it together.  However, what he has said has not received very much publicity so it is important that I should say it here.</P>
    <P>First of all, our commitments under the bilateral aid programme will be honoured.  There will not be any cutback in the commitments that we have made in any of the areas we are operating in. That is a matter of great significance in view of the work that has been undertaken and the immense development of our bilateral aid programme over the last number of years and particularly over the last two years.</P>
    <P>If any of the funds that we are voting now in the multilateral area, whether it be here, through the World Bank Group, through the Food and Agricultural Organisation, through the United Nations Development Programme or through the European Economic Community Development Funds, are not taken up &mdash;and from time to time they are not&mdash;they will be reallocated to the <Col N="1100" /> benefit of our bilateral aid programme.  I understand and appreciate the concern of those engaged in bilateral programmes when they see that the growth of the commitments we have in the multilateral framework mean that their allocations on the bilateral side are not growing at the same pace and would seem to be curbed to a certain extent. The contribution they make is a matter of vital importance, and I hope that they will be reassured by what the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already said and by what I am saying now.  The commitments will be honoured and any funds that are left over by virtue of not being taken up in a multilateral framework will be reallocated, as has happened over the last few years.</P>
    <P>Some points have been made on general issues.  Senator Conroy stressed that one cannot generalise about the type of development required in particular countries.  That is true.  In the very poor countries the International Development Association have found that agricultural and rural development are very important. Their priorities are in the areas of infrastructural development projects particularly. The association makes money available to help support high priority projects which foster economic development in the developing world.  The bulk of these projects, over 46½ per cent over the last three years, are in the agricultural and rural development areas.  They aim directly at improving the lot of the poorer sections of the populations of the countries involved.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while I was absent for a little while during the course of this debate, I was listening to the contributions over the communications system in the room where I was working at the time, so I heard what was said even though I was not physically present.  The balance, 24 per cent, goes to the basic infrastructural projects such as power, telecommunications, transportation; 9½ per cent is for industry and organisation projects; 16½ per cent is for population, water supply, energy and other projects; the balance of non-project loans is 3½ per cent.  Senator Conroy said that a major <Col N="1101" /> hospital development which would be too sophisticated to manage and administer and staff even in a developed country could be an example of wasteful expenditure.  As far as the priorities of this programme are concerned they are based on criteria that Senators themselves would recommend.  I would like to repeat the credit terms, the soft loan provisions.  There are 50 years to re-pay; ten years before repayment of principal begins, low interest charges and there is an annual service charge of three-quarters of the disbursed portion of each credit to cover the association's administrative costs.  So not only is it on appropriately favourable terms but also the targets of the programme are geared towards alleviating the causes of the poverty and suffering as distinct from treating the symptoms of it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Brandt Commission, Senator Cooney might say that I might have made a much more detailed speech.  That would not be my function but the function of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  My function as Minister for Finance is to simply describe to the House the purpose of this.  Obviously in the course of the debate issues of a broader nature would arise and I am prepared to deal with them on that basis. But I would not like to think that because I did not go into the whole question of imbalances and North-South relationships, the Brandt Commission and matters of that sort which warrant very serious and very detailed study, that is being taken as an indication of a lack of urgency or a lack of interest.  It is not. The simple fact is that one introduces a Bill, states what the purpose of the Bill is and then it is a matter for the House to broaden the scope of the debate and they did that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the multilateral programmes particularly, the growth of these is significant in terms of our IDA contribution.  I welcome this but it is not obvious.  We do not see immediately here the visible evidence of Irish participation because it is being contributed through the World Bank Group, the FAO, the EECDF, and the United Nations Development Programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> We do not see it and therefore we do not seem to be associated with it as directly as with a bilateral aid programme.  That is understandable and quite inevitable.  But as we involve ourselves more at a multilateral level, either voluntarily or on a mandatory basis, obviously those commitments will grow and grow.  In this year particularly they have grown to an unprecedented high level by comparison with our previous commitment.  It is that in fact that explains that while the level of our overall commitment certainly has not dropped or been cut in any way&mdash;it has increased by almost £3 million&mdash;the total figures are such that within that the bilateral growth has not been of the same extent.</P>
    <P>I want to put one point on the record in this connection.  I was involved as President in office of the EEC in concluding the negotiations of the second stage of Lome which those who were involved with both negotiations indicated were very much more difficult and more complex than the first Lomé negotiations. When one is doing something for the first time it is new and it is welcome. But when one is doing something for the second time it is a little more difficult. People naturally take for granted what they have and want to work through a second stage.  But I would like to think that I was able to persuade my partners in the EEC that the level of the commitment was greater than their original disposition was to apply.  We spent many late nights in our own environments, that is, as nine foreign Ministers of the EEC, deciding what the level of that commitment would be before we ever negotiated with our Lomé partners, and I am simply pleased that I had the opportunity of bringing it, not as far as I would have wished, but certainly much further than it would have been brought if we had not spent those late nights.  As a consequence of that our own contribution has grown significantly.  It is important that that should be noted.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy also mentioned that we are not members of the Asian Regional Bank.  We are not members of any regional bank.  Any decision on joining <Col N="1103" /> these, whether it is that or the Latin American Development Bank or whatever, would obviously have to be taken by the Government after full and due consideration of our capacity to meet immediate and continuing commitments and the need to maintain the desirable mix between financing international institutions and our bilateral programmes.  I hope that it is clear from what I have said that if we are to involve ourselves further in other banks or other arrangements on a multilateral basis it could well be one of the consequences of these that the pressures on the bilateral programme, if these are mandatory commitments in the other areas, will grow because, in difficult times, there is no point pretending that there is an unlimited amount of money available though obviously one would like to be stretched as far as possible even to the point of pain.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs rather than for me to ensure that our bilateral commitment can be maintained and strengthened rather than stretched into other areas.  Having said that about the Asian regions, particularly in relation to Thailand, the Philippines and countries that obviously have problems, I was also involved in negotiating between the Community and the Asian countries the new trade arrangements between them.  This is a preferential trade arrangement between the Asian countries and the EEC.  It is not an aid programme in the sense of the Lomé Convention.  That too has significant consequences for Ireland in terms of access for their exports to the European Community market, some of which are in direct competition with some of the most vulnerable industries in the EEC.  It is important for that reason to recognise that the Community is, in a whole range of areas, whether one looks at the Asian countries or Turkey&mdash;and we can be called to make contributions there as well&mdash;the African group, the Latin American group where negotiations are now going on, or any other areas, at least as active as any other <Col N="1104" /> developed part of the world.  When the Community make an arrangement then we too make an extra commitment in all of these areas either by way of extra funds or by way of trade concessions. The balance would be rectified if other blocs, both political and economic, showed the same degree of response as the European Economic Community countries are doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy asked whether our contribution to the International Development Association is tied to purchases of goods here.  It is not There is no restriction of that nature and there are no conditions attached to our contributions.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald asked a question about South Africa.  He asked particularly what help we could give to the Union of South Africa.  I take it he is talking particularly about the black population of South Africa.  In all of these areas the most important thing is to be able to ensure that we can work on a government to government basis, that we have the agreement of the government involved to not only allow, but to channel effectively to those who need it the level of aid, the assistance, the medical aid and so on.  I have no evidence whatsoever&mdash;though I have to say it is not something I can state categorically has been tried&mdash;that the Government of the Union of South Africa would be prepared to accept an aid programme from a country such as ours towards the people of the townships of Soweto or any of the regions.  They do not choose to acknowledge that those people have needs, and if they do not choose to acknowledge that they have needs I do not suppose that they would accept any aid that we would want to channel to them.  But maybe all things are possible.  I will convey what Senator McDonald has said to my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and see what he has to say in that connection.</P>
    <P>I will refer generally to the points Senator Cooney raised.  He raised some important points which I did not refer to on opening because it would not be appropriate for me to refer to them on <Col N="1105" /> opening as some of these areas are at least appropriate for my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I said on Second Stage of the Finance Bill that one of the most urgent problems facing the world economies at the moment is to establish a new economic world order, a new monetary stability and programmes that recognise our interdependence.  In the whole North-South context so much so obviously requires to be done that one sometimes wonders why it is not being done.  There are some areas that need to be activated immediately.  Very many more countries must become involved than are at present involved.  The OPEC countries, for instance, have very significant dollar surpluses at this stage.  They have a role to play that up to this moment they are not playing.  It is not too long ago since they themselves featured in the panel of developing countries, and indeed some of the programmes that were voted through here would have been applied to some of the OPEC countries not too long ago.</P>
    <P>That pattern has changed now and as far as I can recall one of them that has a significant contribution to make to this programme is Saudi Arabia.  I do not see evidence of others who could make contributions figuring in this programme at all.  It is of vital importance, either through this programme or through the recycling of the OPEC surpluses that at the various financial agencies, the IMF or the World Bank, we agree at this stage to have a new substitution account, a new arrangement whereby we can guarantee the economic and monetary stability of these developing countries particularly, something that will in turn also guarantee the outlets, if not in the immediate short-term at least in the medium-term, from the developed world. As we, in a sense, have exploited the outlets that exist in the developed world&mdash;and the developed world is obviously in recession at this stage&mdash;even if we thought only in selfish terms it would be in our interest to encourage and promote the economic capacity of the developing countries who in turn would become consumers of the <Col N="1106" /> products that we export.  It is obvious then that there is a great need to move towards much greater co-ordination and programming of the structures for the world economy that exist at this moment.</P>
    <P>I am impatient and unhappy about what has not been achieved.  There has been a trend towards protectionism and it is undesirable.  I hope that as we feel the pinch a little more in the western world, we will be activated to respond by taking a lead role&mdash;that is what I said on the Finance Bill&mdash;both in the European dimension and with our partners at every international forum so as to lay the basis for a more stable world economy.  If we do not, while we may suffer, these people to whom this Bill is directed will suffer even more.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate for me to comment on other points like those relating to Gorta and Concern; that is more a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I would not have shared the view that Senator Cooney expressed. There may be priorities, but the real priority is to help people to help themselves.  I know the problem is immediately pressing and urgent when a person is starving; obviously he needs food and medicine.  On the other hand the most important thing is to ensure if possible that people will have the means of ensuring that they will not starve tomorrow.  Our own bilateral programme has always been in that direction.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have replied as widely as I can but decisions here are matters for Government.  I have given the Government position as has been stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself on my own responsibility.  It is not a matter for any one man, as Senator Cooney seems to imply.  But he was in government and he knows how governments operate and if he says that he shows a very hazy memory of how government operates.  To the extent that the contributions of the Minister for Finance are expressed through this Bill this is a step which I am glad that the Senators welcome.  I hope that others involved <Col N="1107" /> in aid programmes will be reassured by what my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has said and by what I have reiterated here this afternoon.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested in view of the lateness of the hour that the Committee and remaining Stages of the Finance Bill be deferred until next Tuesday. This course could be adopted if the House so wishes but there would have to be agreement that all Stages of the Bill would be concluded by 8 o'clock next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>This is just a slight further teasing out of the matter.  I agreed in discussion with Senator Eoin Ryan that since the legal difficulty genuinely will arise after next Tuesday I would be happy to see all Stages of the Bill go through on Tuesday.  That was the agreement I gave him and that is an agreement I hold to.  But I note, with certain interest, that he has now introduced <Col N="1108" /> the time of 8 o'clock which he did not introduce in discussions with me.  If we make agreements we should stick to them.</P>

      <P>I was providing that there would be a motion on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That was thoughtful of the Leader of the House. But this is a very large Bill with a lot of interesting things in it, and I would prefer to adhere to the agreement which I gave him privately, which is that he will get all Stages on Tuesday.  But I do not like the procedure of introducing a subsequent proviso which had neither been discussed nor agreed between us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think 8 o'clock on Tuesday is really as late as we can sit. This is stretching a point.  It is raising considerable technical difficulties but I cannot agree to any later than 8 o'clock on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that a subsequent proviso was introduced after an agreement had been reached.  With that on the record I am happy to accede to the request, with the addendum that it is not really a way to do business.</P>
