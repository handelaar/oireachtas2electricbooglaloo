      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Social Welfare (Modification <Col N="346" /> of Contribution Conditions for Benefit) Regulations, 1980, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Seanad Éireann on the 12th day of November, 1980, under subsection (4) of Section 14 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Nolan) Thomas Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft Social Welfare (Modification of Contribution Conditions for Benefit) Regulations, 1980, are necessary because of the introduction, as from 6 April 1979, of the new system of pay-related social insurance contributions.  The new system involves, <i>inter alia,</i> changes in the contribution and benefit years for social insurance purposes Hitherto, the men's benefit year commenced on the first Monday in June each year and the women's benefit year on the first Monday in December.  The benefit year for both men and women will in future be the year commencing on the first Monday in the calendar year.  The first common benefit year for men and women will, therfore, commence on 5 January 1981 and the governing contribution year will be the income tax year 1979-80, that is, the year which commenced on 6 April 1979.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation, claimants for disability benefit are required to have not fewer than 48 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year preceding the benefit year in which the claim is made in order to qualify for payment at the full rates.  Reduced rates of benefit are payable if the claimant has fewer than 48 contributions but at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Claimants who have fewer than 26 such contributions in the governing contribution year are not entitled to payment in the new benefit year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this contribution condition it has been necessary for my Department to examine all claims to disability benefit before the beginning of a new benefit year to ensure that the claimants continue to have title to benefit.  Hitherto, in accordance with this requirement, all <Col N="347" /> men's claims have been examined in April and May before the beginning of the men's benefit year in June and women's claims in October and November before the beginning of the women's benefit year in December.  The change to a common benefit year for both men and women would necessitate examination of all disability benefit claims in the months immediately preceding January each year.  A large volume of work is involved in this exercise and it would be extremely difficult for my Department to cope with the examination of claims without the risk of delay in the payment of benefit in many cases.</P>
    <P>The regulations now before the House are designed to deal with this problem by modifying the contribution conditions for disability benefit.  In effect they provide that when a person claims disability benefit, the benefit year for that claim will be the year from the date of commencement of the claim.  Consequently, the rate of disability benefit applicable at the start of the claim will continue to be the rate payable for one year unless the claimant ceases to claim or the right to benefit is exhausted.  The rate of benefit will not be affected, as it may be at present, when a new benefit year supervenes in the first 12 months of incapacity. At the end of this period the claim will be examined on the basis of the person's contributions in the appropriate governing contribution year.  Thus the re-examination of claims will be spread over the calendar year and will not have to be undertaken in the pre-Christmas period each year as would otherwise have been the case but for these regulations.</P>
    <P>Regulations modifying the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit were approved in 1956.  The proposed modification for disability benefit purposes is on similar lines and is intended to avoid possible delay in the payment of benefit at the commencement of each year.  In the circumstances I now ask the House to approve of the Social Welfare (Modification of Contribution Conditions for Benefit) Regulations, 1980, in draft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this party are concerned, we obviously approve.  We have to take the Minister's word that it is an improvement.  I have to confess &mdash; I wonder how many others in the House would share the confession with me &mdash; I had not a notion what he was talkimg about.  It is an indication of the complexity that has attached itself to the whole social welfare code.  I take the Minister's point that this will be in an ease of the recipients.  One thing I heard, understood and appreciate from what he said is that it will speed up claims.  If it does that it will have the support of everybody in the House.</P>
      <P>I wonder how the people involved, the claimants, can make head or tail of the system when it takes two complicated pages of script by the Minister to explain the change that is now being effected. The whole system will have to be examined with a view to scrapping it.  It might not be possible, because of the complexity of administration, to bring in some new simplified form of assessing and issuing social welfare payments but we will have to try.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unusual that we did not have a copy of the Minister's speech available to us.  It is a case of depending on memory in relation to what the Minister was telling us.  As I understood it, there were two basic reasons why the Minister introduced this, firstly to take account of changes in pay-related social insurance contributions which have been effective for some time past and secondly to establish a common benefit year for both men and women.  We cannot have any objections to that.  It is streamlining the situation and on the face of it, we have no reservations about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood that it also is to take account of certain modifications in the contribution conditions for the payment of disability benefit.  I did not hear fully part of the Minister's speech but my recollection from reading what was said in the Dáil is that there is a certain danger in dovetailing, as it were, the contribution years and starting from 5 January 1981 in that in the adjustments some people <Col N="349" /> in receipt of disability benefit will gain slightly but others will endure some loss. I gather there are some people in receipt of disability benefit who will be on the wrong side, as it were, of the situation when this comes into being and their loss could be in the region of £2 per week.  I also understand that if they continue to qualify for disability benefit in the future this, in the normal course of events, would be made good.  Nevertheless, we must recognise that people on disability benefit are people who are obviously suffering or enduring a disability of some kind or other and, very often, their financial resources are limited to the benefits they receive.  I find it very hard to contemplate or agree that people on a tight income, as it were, would be expected to accept a reduction or that we would bring in a system that would result in a reduction in what is already a meagre income to them.</P>
    <P>I accept the necessity to have a common contribution year and that the regulations are necessary because of changes that were introduced some time ago.  I accept there is merit in it from the administrative point of view.  However, it is unreasonable in this day and age to say to a person on disability benefit, particularly in the middle of winter: &ldquo;You are going to be at a bit of a loss.  Your income will be reduced by anything up to £2 per week but if you are still drawing benefit in 1982 in the normal course of events you will recover the loss that arose in early 1981.&rdquo;  That is unreasonable and I should like the Minister to assure the House that he is in a position to take steps to ensure that nobody suffering a disability will be asked to carry a loss of £2 per week in income as and from 5 January next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the common contribution year and I realise that for administrative reasons it is very necessary.  I support Senator Cooney when he talks about the way this is worded.  To be quite honest, I do not think the top civil servants really understand that there are people who will be drawing this benefit or will have to apply for it who have not even got their primary certificates.  We <Col N="350" /> throw out this jargon to them and expect them to try to get around it.  I do not think that is good enough.  If there are any soldiers around they will know that one must always cater for the thickest guy in the squad.  This does not do that.  I am sorry to see the way in which it is worded. I thought it would have been worded differently.  That does not, of course, detract from its purpose which I support.</P>
      <P>What Senator Howard said was right. It is difficult to ask somebody who is out sick, say, for about three months and may not be out sick again for another three or four years, to suffer £18 of a loss and in the case of a married woman £9.  I do not know whether it is possible or not but instead of waiting to benefit when a person goes sick again, which might be after three or four years, if the person was really badly off could he not be given £18 out of the assistance to supplement him for this loss of nine weeks at £2 a week? It is a pity that we have to start wording things in such a manner as to ensure that people do not fully understand them. People in this Chamber, and in the other Chamber, found it difficult to understand the order.  Nevertheless, having got the gist of it we think it is a good idea and we do not want to delay it going through.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the PRSI system can we find out exactly how a person knows whether his contribution is being paid or not?  Under the old system of insurance there was a stamp to be purchased.  When the stamp was purchased there was an indication as to whether insurance was being paid for that person or not.  Under the new PRSI system &mdash; I am trying to protect myself and my employees &mdash; how does an employee know whether he is covered by insurance or not?  How do the Department know whether anybody at present is covered under the PRSI system?  The first statement says that the necessity for these regulations arises from the introduction of the PRSI system.  At present there may be employers who, because there is not a physical purchase of a stamp, might decide to wait until the end of the year to pay their PRSI contributions and in the intervening period they may go out of <Col N="351" /> business or their circumstances might change.  I cannot see what check there is to find out whether anybody is covered under the PRSI system.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions.  It is the first time I have been in the Seanad since I was a Member of it and I am glad to be back here.  I accept in a certain way what Senators Cooney, Howard and Harte said about regulations of this kind which are sometimes difficult to understand. This is the most simple regulation that I have seen in any Department because it means that women and men are being treated in the one contribution year.  For next year from 5 January the contribution year for benefit will be the income tax year 1978-79.  This system is easier to understand than the old system where the benefit year for men started in June and the benefit year for women started in December.</P>
      <P>The question Senator Howard raised was that of people who may for a short period of seven or eight weeks lose 60p or £2, as the case may be.  This was also mentioned in the Dáil.  When we amend any regulations in the Department we always try to amend them so that there will be the least hardship involved.  In amending this regulation claimants will be in benefit to the extent of some £150,000.  There will be no grave hardship.  We have at present 67,000 people in receipt of disability benefit.  Fewer than 5,000 will be affected and most of those people will actually gain by the changes in the system.  I take the point that there may be isolated cases where persons would lose out but it will be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of how does a person know whether he is insured or not, or how does the employer know.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners as they are responsible for collecting PRSI.  They in turn notify us.  An employee will not suffer in any way as a result of an employer not paying his PRSI because if it happens that a firm has not paid PRSI for two years and a receiver was moved in or if it went bankrupt <Col N="352" /> the Department would pay the employee's full benefit but we would have to try to verify was he in employment at the time or was he insured.  That can be done.  He normally gets a P60 and we could check up with the Revenue Commissioners to see what the position was.</P>

    <Title>Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 2, line 34, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have put down an amendment to this Bill which would ensure that the minimum period during which whiskey would remain in the distilling and maturing process would be five years.  If whiskey is extracted from the casks in which it is maturing after a period of three years one will get a product that, in the first place, is not a marketable one because a period of three years is insufficient to give it the aroma and flavour we have come to accept in relation to Irish whiskey.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister the arguments that were advanced to him and to his Department by the distilling industry as to why it was desirable to reduce the five-year period to three years.</P>
      <P>There are also other parts of section 1 on which I should like to have clarification.  Subsection (3) (i) describes the components that would be involved in the distilling process and in line 26 it contains the words &ldquo;with or without other natural diastases&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that by referring to that the Minister could satisfy me on matters that relate to the amendment which we are putting forward.  Basic <Col N="353" /> to my argument about maintaining the five year maturing period is that if whiskey, or the product, is extracted after three years it is, first of all, a raw product in the sense that it has failed to attain the mellowness that we usually accept as being part of the product.  Secondly, it has failed to attain the colour by way of extraction from the oaken and wooden casks, and because of its failure either to have the colour, taste or aroma that we associate with it, we are into the field of additives to correct both these deficiencies.  Because of this, I believe we are providing by virtue of including the words &ldquo;with or without natural diastases&rdquo; putting additives into the product which, traditionally, have not been used.  As I have said previously, once we use additives to correct these two deficiencies we are moving away from the natural product that we have been proud of and into the field of the semi-artificial product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Senator Howard moving his amendment and thank him for his observations.  However, I cannot accept such an amendment to the Irish Whiskey Bill, 1980.  Under existing legislation, that is the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969 administered by the Revenue Commissioners, whiskey produced in Ireland must be warehoused for at least three years before it can be delivered for home consumption.  What is being proposed in section 1 (3)(b) of this Bill is completely in line with that requirement.  In other words, this Bill does not propose anything new in regard to the minimum maturation period for Irish whiskey; it merely re-states what has been the law for the past 11 years. The requirements about maturation are now being included in this Bill solely because it is considered for completeness sake that such requirements should form an integral part of the legislation relating to Irish whiskey.  The inclusion of the requirement about maturation in this Bill does not affect the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the full history of the legislation relating to the <Col N="354" /> maturation of whiskey.  However, I should like to point out that between 1926 and 1969 the minimum maturation period was five years, but that, in the latter year, the minimum maturation period was reduced from five to three years under the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969.  The latter Act was promoted by the then Minister for Finance who, in the course of his speech on Second Stage in the Dáil stated as follows:</P>
    <P>The proposed change in the law is being introduced at the request of the Irish distillers in order to provide them with greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of export markets. Whilst the law we are discussing applies only to spirits sold on the home market it has an indirect effect on exports.  This happens because in an important export market like the USA imported spirits cannot be released for consumption unless they are eligible for sale in their country of origin.  In the United Kingdom the general minimum age limit is three years.  The result is that Scotch whisky and indeed Irish whiskey produced in Northern Ireland may be sold in the USA at three years whilst our whiskey must be five years old.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said at columns 614 and 615 of the Dáil Debates dated 11 November 1969.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the considerations which applied in 1969 still apply today and also that the request of the industry in 1969 was influenced by their realisation that public taste at home and abroad had switched to milder types of whiskey which did not necessarily require a lengthy period of maturation to maintain its quality.  The maturation requirements set out in this Bill will not alter the character or reputation of Irish whiskey.  All the Bill proposes to do is to specify the minimum maturation period which is, in fact, already laid down under other existing legislation.  Of course, it should be borne in mind that while the minimum maturation period being specified is three years, many whiskies are, at <Col N="355" /> the discretion of the industry, matured for far longer periods.</P>
    <P>In considering this matter we should also bear in mind that the reciprocal legislation which the UK has enacted provides for a minimum maturation period of three years for both Scotch and Irish whiskey.  Irish whiskey will, of course, henceforth cover whiskey produced here or in Northern Ireland.  Senators will, I am sure, readily appreciate that in these circumstances it would be illogical to have different minimum maturation periods proposed for Irish whiskey in the South and Irish whiskey produced in the North.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that in a definition of &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; proposed by the EEC Commission some time ago, a minimum maturation period of two years only was suggested.  While such a maturation period is not acceptable to the Irish distilling industry it reflects the trend of EEC thinking in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that whiskey coming on the market or coming out of the maturing process at three years requires treatment for colouring, aroma and taste that is not required if the product has been maturing for a period of five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  In discussions which we had with the Irish distillers in the past week it was accepted generally that whiskey is ready for consumption after three years' maturation, and also that there are no additives during or after maturation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Howard on this.  The Minister has given an adequate commercial argument for reducing the maturation age but has he taken into account the social problems which are increasing every day, and which I come across in my profession, resulting from the fact that younger Irish people, because they have more money at their disposal, are tending to switch their taste from the traditional drinks of beer and <Col N="356" /> stout to spirits?  It is a very marked switch and distillers are well aware of it.</P>
      <P>It seems that the Minister has given a convincing commercial argument for a three year maturation age, but it may well be that social arguments would indicate that it would be wiser if we allowed our whiskey to mature for longer.  Abuse of alcohol is on the increase rather than on the decrease.  The problem that interests me particularly is the abuse of alcohol among the teenagers and the young, and, as the Minister well knows, this is a problem that is reaching extremely serious proportions.  It is a new problem as far as we are concerned.</P>
      <P>Serious consideration should be given to the social aspect of increasing the maturation age of spirits, and Irish whiskey in particular, because three-year-old whiskey commercially produced could have deleterious effects.  Are there any Irish whiskies on the market at present which have been matured for just three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My question is are there any Irish whiskies which have been matured for only three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be.  It might be three-and-a-half years or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there could be dangerous social consequences from this.  The majority of Irish whiskies with which we are familiar are matured for a much longer period but it seems that if the minimum period is the one that is being used at the moment it may be unwise to reduce it to just three years even though it is bringing us in line with legislation elsewhere.  There are serious social problems and the social consequences of this may not have been investigated fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already reduced to three years.  That is the legislation.  Since 1969 it can be more than three years. There is for sale in the Irish market whiskey up to 15 years old, as can be seen on the bottle.  As regards the social consequences, <Col N="357" /> or the social taste of our people, you rarely hear people ordering whiskey saying, &ldquo;Please give me ten or 15 year old whiskey.&rdquo;  They are quite happy to order it by brand.  The vast majority of our people are drinking whiskey of a shorter maturation period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is all on the one shelf.  We are all worried about this problem of alcoholism, especially among young people.  But the different whiskies in a good bar are on the shelf side by side and you will find that not many people will specify that they get ten- or 15-year-old Irish whiskey.  It is not a commercial requirement because in 1969 it was found that both at home and abroad people were switching to milder types of whiskey.  All I would say about social drinking is that people should have respect for this kind of drink.</P>

      <P>Let me explain it this way.  An explanation is called for to some extent.  I believe that the Bill now before <Col N="358" /> us has been arrived at after consultation with the distilling industry and the distilling industry have had a marked influence on the composition of the Bill.  There is a marked financial advantage to the Irish distilling industry in that they will be able to put their product on the market, describing it as Irish whiskey, after a three-year maturing period when heretofore it was accepted that the period was five years.  That proposition meets the wish, the intention and the desire of the industry.  We are here as legislators and we are providing for something which is to be to the disadvantage of the industry. I am not totally happy with the advice we have got and we should not readily accept it.  I am not certain that what we are proposing to do here is going to be to the advantage of the industry or to the advantage of the product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1969 the law has provided for three years.  It has survived two Fianna Fáil Governments and one Coalition Government.  We are talking about the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969.  If Irish distillers wished to avail of that Act and put immature spirits &mdash; spirits of less than three years maturation &mdash; on the market they could do so. We are providing in this Act that if Irish whiskey is put on the market at three years they have now the authority, and we back it in legislation, to describe their product as Irish whiskey, whereas the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969, did not give authority in law for the product to be described as Irish whiskey.</P>

      <P>I want to defend the Minister's point.  I have been listening to the debate but I have not studied it in any great detail.  There seems to be some confusion about it.  I gather from the debate that as it now stands the period of <Col N="359" /> maturation cannot be less than three years, that it must be a minimum of three years. Is the Senator proposing to increase that to five years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of Senators as legislators generally that is a technical argument on which we can only take the expertise of the Department or the people who are qualified to judge whether whiskey is better at three years or five years.  I am not in any position to give an authoritative decision on that, but I am prepared to accept the experience, the back-up services and the consultations which the Department would have had with the distillers.  The Minister and his Department seem to be satisfied, after 11 years of trial of leaving it at three years, that there is no technical reason for changing it to five.  From the Department's point of view it appears to have worked for the last 11 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>While it has worked for the last 11 years, I would argue that the quality of Irish whiskey has deteriorated in that period and, unlike Senator Brennan, I would not claim to be entirely ignorant about the matter.  I have conducted some research into the subject and I think there has been a deterioration in Irish whiskey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing about which we could all be pretty naive, and this is why I support Senator Howard.  It is obviously less burdensome and difficult for distillers if they can issue their whiskey after three years than if they have kept it for five years.  We could end up legislating in a few years time because the <Col N="360" /> expertise from the trade comes in to us and says, &ldquo;Ah well, why not issue it after one year?&rdquo; It is an axiom in the distillation of good drink that time is very important and the more you reduce the time the more you are likely to produce a deterioration of the product.  A point which I missed the last day is that there is a universal movement towards a preference for the blended whiskey that tastes mild, that is not matured.  Irish whiskey is improving its sales a little because it has entered into that market. I am worried, in regard to the Bill, that under pressure from the trade we may continue to reduce the time necessary for the maturation of whiskey.  Coming down from 15 to ten to five to three to two, at the end of the day you are going to end up with Hibernian rot-gut and that is what Senator Howard is concerned about and I support him.</P>

      <P>It would appear that what we are discussing now is irrelevant because if the three-year minimum period is right legally according to the 1969 Act, to go to five years, as the amendment seeks, we must first of all amend the 1969 Act.  Technically we are discussing something that we should not be discussing at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <P>A few points have been raised by Senators Brennan and de Brún. For the first time we are setting out to define Irish whiskey in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous legislation was to define it for the benefit of the Revenue Commissioners.  We are moving into a difficult and broader field.  In worldwide markets and the home market we are setting out for the first time to define what Irish whiskey is and there is need for caution here.  I said last week here that this Bill had all the appearance of being rushed legislation.  I know that the Minister is doing his utmost to be helpful here today and I accept that, but the fact that it was found necessary to have consultation with the distilling industry in the <Col N="361" /> past week reinforces my feeling that the matter was not thoroughly checked out in the beginning.  I feel that we have been encouraged by the distilling industry to go further than we need in defining what Irish whiskey is, and we are being encouraged to include in this legislation something which will be of a substantial financial benefit to the industry.</P>
      <P>Senator Brennan spoke about the technicalities and so on.  I am not satisfied yet that I have got an answer to a question that I raised earlier.  When whiskey comes out of a traditional type cask after three years the experience is that it has not had time to extract the colouring from the cask and there is need for an additive. It will obtain the colouring during that three-year period if it is put into a cask made of either cedarwood or chestnut, but if it is put into one of these casks there is a problem where the aroma is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who like drinking spirits which are not in a cask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but we are legislating.  If it comes out of cedarwood or chestnut it has aroma that has to be corrected and again you are into the field of another additive.  According to the discussions that took place last week with the distilling industry, what kind of casks is this three-year-old whiskey to be matured in and is it necessary to include an additive to give it a colouring at the end of the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on whiskey but it appears that over a period people have been consuming whiskey that has been just three years old and if the Senator's amendment is in order I wonder how is he going to protect the departed spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I know something about fermentation but I may not be an expert on the other end, of the use of whiskey. Originally the time of maturing whiskey was related to the way whiskey was made at that time and the maturing was there to make it safe to drink.  The word &ldquo;pot-still&rdquo; has gone.  Whiskey is made by a <Col N="362" /> different process from that by which it used to be made and, therefore, it can be quite safe from a health point of view to sell whiskey which is three years old, and it is the responsibility of the Government to see that it is safe.  There appears to be confusion, going through Second Stage, about the word &ldquo;milder&rdquo; as related to &ldquo;mature&rdquo;.  It seems that whiskey can be made on present processes which is milder in itself and, therefore, can be still mild and fit to drink at the end of three years.  We must assume that the people who are manufacturing and selling Irish whiskey know what they are doing and they want to be able to sell it.  If they consider that they can be more competitive and still sell a good whiskey at three years, then we should allow them three years.  It is not our job to stop them.  Our job is to make sure that it is safe.  It was not safe to sell straight the original pot still whiskey.  Evidently in County Cork, judging by the paper, there was a question of needing three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the kind of casks, whiskey is matured in oak casks, although sometimes in cherry casks.  Oak was the old traditional way.  We have referred to the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969 but the whole idea of this Bill before us is to update and extend the definition of Irish whiskey which was set out in the Irish Whiskey Act of 1950.  The Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969 which repealed the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1947 states in section 1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section no Irish spirits or foreign spirits shall be delivered for home consumption unless they have been warehoused, in the case of rum, for at least one year and, in the other case, for at least three years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be interesting to know what the people of that time were saying about it. In 1969 there was no amendment at all to the matter going through.  The then Minister &mdash; the present Taoiseach &mdash; put the Bill through and was to bring the matter into line with international thinking.  I <Col N="363" /> would like to refer to the speech by the late Deputy Sweetman as recorded in column 615 and 616, volume 242, of the Official Report of 11 November 1969 when he said that the Bill was reducing the maturation period from five to three years.  I quote:</P>
    <P>This Bill certainly has one great merit in it; it is one of the simplest draft Bills we have ever seen.  We in this party</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Fine Gael Party&mdash;</P>
    <P>are satisfied with the proposal put forward by the Minister.  As far as I can find out the original term for which spirits had to be kept was laid down in 1915 by British Act, and that Act provided that the minimum period was to be three years.  That was changed to the present level of five years by the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>I find it rather odd to note in looking back over the Dáil Debates of that time that the period was increased from three to five years without any explanatory statement by the then Minister for Finance, without any speech from the other side of the House, without any speech from the Minister's side of the House, and that it went through all Stages without any comment.</P>
    <P>That was away back in 1926.  Deputy Sweetman went on further to say: <Col N="364" /> we are therefore completely in the dark as to why the period was changed from three to five years in 1926,...</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is self-evident that it was a good move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  The 1947 Act merely repeated the 1926 Act.  He said:</P>
      <P>It cannot be stressed too much, however, apart from the facetious angle to which I have referred, that this will not in any way affect the taste or the quality or the maturity of the whiskey here at home... no matter what the name be.</P>
      <P>The people, the Dáil and the Seanad were very anxious in 1969 that the maturation period should be brought down from five to three years.  People do not say to me that the maturation period of whiskey should be five years, three years or ten years.  Most people seem satisfied as it is.  Senator Howard mentioned immature whiskey.  I do not know what he means by that.  Immature whiskey would be under three years of age and that cannot come on the market.  The Bill today is not changing that regulation one way or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This provides for a possibility of using those diastases if the necessity arose.  At the moment that is not happening and I accept the word of Irish Distillers generally that there has been no additional course.  If something happens in the future we will have to change of course.  UK legislation provides for the possibility of additives.  Our legislation is different.  In the UK legislation the words &ldquo;with or without&rdquo; are included.  Even if they are included here, there are no additives.  I accept that as factual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity in his reply.  It will be necessary, because of what we have already agreed to do, to bring in additives of one kind or another to improve the marketability of the product and we are, in the words that are here, providing for  hat eventuality.  While I have no doubt that the Minister accepts the good faith of the distilling industry, the fact is, nonetheless, that we are opening the door. We are probably issuing the invitation by having these words in the legislation.  We are issuing the invitation that, if additives are necessary, they may go in, and that you can short-circuit the process because you can correct it by additives.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Séamus de Brún spoke the last day and I joined with him and Senator Andy O'Brien in welcoming the Bill.  Senator de Brún is hankering after times that will never come again.  He said he deplored the present habit of students to protest and revolt as soon as they were, in his words, &ldquo;privileged to have a third level education&rdquo;. No sooner did that happen than they started complaining about the circumstances <Col N="369" /> in which they were going to college. Senator de Brún may not have heard of it, but students no longer regard education as a privilege, they demand it as a right.  For too long education was the privilege of very few.  It is not yet the privilege of half enough people.  If the prices of meals are too high, or if fees are put up out of the range of grants, then students are perfectly entitled to protest.</P>
      <P>I share Senator de Brún's welcome for the Bill because we have here a new kind of institute, a new, modern, streamlined, method of training primary teachers.  The position of students in Thomond College is an enviable one.  It is an extremely well-equipped college and we could say about those students &ldquo;Aoibhinn beatha an scoláire&rdquo;.  The National University had some contact with Thomond College.  It was not a very happy experience.  As the Minister said the last day, it was no fault of the NUI but it underlines the fact that the best body to handle and validate the degrees of these institutions is the NCEA and not the NUI.</P>
      <P>Limerick is lucky in the context of Thomond, Mary Immaculate and the National Institute for Higher Education. When one considers the agitation that went on 15 years ago when there were cries for Limerick's right to a university, the Government were very well advised then to resist such clamour because it was in the best interests of the people of Limerick that they were not given a poor relation, imitation university and that they were given the realisation of the best concepts of modern third level education. I welcome the Bill.  I am sorry that the infant days of Thomond were marred by an unfortunate dispute.  It is enough to say, perhaps, that there were not proper communications established.  That was a cause of a lot of the trouble.  I hope nothing of that kind will recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret I cannot give the Bill an unqualified welcome.  After all, it may be the last occasion on which I will be able to congratulate the Minister.  If that sounds ambiguous, I mean it to be.  In the first place I may not be able to congratulate him if he is here to bring in the Universities Bill, and more and more my misgivings grow on that score.  There is <Col N="370" /> also the possibility, as rumour has it, that we may not see him wearing his educational cap and gown for long more and that he will shortly be in <i>partibus infidelium</i> which I recommend to him as a nice, free translation of Iveagh House.</P>
    <P>I express the same unease to which I gave voice during the debate on the National Institute, Limerick, Bill and the National Institute, Dublin, Bill.  I am sorry to be repetitious, but it is a very serious matter.  The more I listen to people and the more I sound out opinions, the greater my sense of unease.  Not only does the letter of these Bills threaten undue Departmental interference, but there are responsible people in the institutes concerned who believe that this interference will be translated into practice.  Perhaps if we have grounds for misgivings about the draft of Bills in general, there are probably even more grounds for misgivings about Thomond in particular, because Thomond is about teacher training.  It is not primarily about research, it is not primarily about post-graduate skills, and so Thomond does not have the larger brief that the national institutes have, and is more likely to suffer from ministerial interference, if we accept that there is such.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister's Department already playing a tougher role in Thomond than elsewhere?  Would he be concerned if he thought that this were so?  Would he do something about it?  Paradoxically, would he interfere in these early and crucial years to stop interference?  There is specifically a fear that with the recurrent phrases &ldquo;with the permission of the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;, and so on, every name put up for appointment and every name put up for membership of the governing body will be gone into with a fine comb.</P>
    <P>Oddly enough, I do not express the same specific misgivings about the governing body on this occasion.  I am delighted to see that, in respect of section 5, the composition of the governing body as I make it out in my crude calculations tots up to seven people appointed under ministerial influence out of 23, a welcome and starting contrast to the position in <Col N="371" /> the case of the two national institutes.  I welcome that.  I am not complaining about it, but naturally I am curious as to why this should be so in the case of the Thomond Bill and not in the case of the other two Bills.</P>
    <P>On the question of the composition of the governing body, it seems very curious that there is only the slightest and most nominal representation from the universities.  Why bother having one member representing the universities?  It would be more logical, perhaps, to have none at all.  Why specifically are there members from AnCO and not, say, from the National College of Art and Design or an Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, because there has been a real input into Thomond from rural science?  I know this because two of my own colleagues in UCC have been active in building up a four year BSc programme.  My quarrel is not with the method of selection of the governing body as such, but rather with its composition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister can.  That is what the Minister is there for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the information that the Higher Education Authority has recently circulated a letter to this institution and to the national institutes, demanding that appointments will have to be ratified by the HEA in all cases.  Once again I suggest to the Minister that it is undesirable that the appointments system should be influenced by outside agencies, least of all by the civil service itself.  Once you set up a body and give it the dignity of a statutory existence, once you constitute a governing body and academic council, surely trust is of the essence.  How can there be credibility attached to appointing bodies if their decisions are open to reversal for no &mdash; to them &mdash; apparent good reason?  If Thomond recruits the services of reputable external academic assessors for a particular appointment and if, subsequent to the appointment being made it is cancelled by, say, the civil service or the HEA for some such reason as, for example, that the particular <Col N="372" /> candidate does not seem to have the conventional qualifications, it could quite be in question that a man might be appointed who has no degree but who is of such remarkable stature that any imaginative appointing body would grab the chance of getting him.  This is the kind of case where one could easily have the decision upended by, let us say, the more staid and conventional agencies outside. There is unease about that particular aspect, not only in respect of Thomond but of the other institutions as well.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, and as was raised in the other House, there is some misgiving also that section 4 of the Bill does not authorise Thomond to institute post-graduate courses.  This is seen, naturally enough, as an indication of further Departmental interference, that the omission of this post-graduate provision is deliberate, that the Minister, so to speak, wants to monitor each application for a post-graduate course.</P>
    <P>My colleagues on the last day, on Committee Stage of the National Institute, (Dublin), Bill began, at a certain stage when the Minister responded very positively to the points we were making, to say to me <i>sotto voce</i>&ldquo;that is enough now, leave him off the hook, it is not fair to be harassing him like that.&rdquo;  I am sorry to be harassing him but I think that this Bill, in common with other Bills we have been debating, raises the most crucial and, if I may say so, unanswered questions. Having said all that, I say with equal sincerely go néirí go geal leis an institiúd nua.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the area of the mid-west, I feel that there are a few observations that I should make on the Bill that we are now discussing and as the Minister has told us that the purpose of the Bill is to establish on a statutory basis the Thomond College of Education in Limerick, I would like to say that I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill.  I welcome the establishment of the college.  There is one aspect of the Bill about which I do have reservations and which I will come to in due course.  I welcome the college's work in providing <Col N="373" /> courses in physical education, fulfilling, if you like, what was an unfilled want in the educational field in this country.  Previous to this there did not exist a national college for physical education.  The coming into existence of Thomond College in Limerick meets that need and closes the gap that existed there, and it is to be welcomed also on that account.  I welcome the fact that it is providing courses in special study and in-service courses, as they are described, for teachers.</P>
      <P>Thomond College opened in 1973, and in the period since then it has proved its worth and shown its value and the teachers who have emerged from it have gone on to make a very valuable contribution in the communities and schools to which they went.  I am glad that the Minister has acknowledged in his speech that it must be the aim that the standard of the people emerging from Thomond College will be on a level at least with those emerging from similar institutions and colleges in Britain and in Europe.  I also welcome the decision to have a rural science programme in due course in Thomond College.</P>
      <P>It is only right that I should compliment the board of management that has been there and the college director who guided the destinies of the college since 1973. Their efforts have indeed been worthwhile and have been reflected in the facilities, in the buildings and the developments that we have seen at Thomond College.  I am confident that when the available land is developed fully and integrated into the system in Thomond College, in fact we will have a showpiece in that particular field of education that we can all be immensely proud of.</P>
      <P>I believe that with the right guidance, with the right initiative and the right commitment and financial resources the progress that has been made can be multiplied several times over.  I have mentioned initiative, commitment, financial resources, and I think it is absolutely important that we recognise that all these are needed in <i>toto</i> and that we should reject anything that would in any way imperil or impede the full application of these qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago we had a discussion <Col N="374" /> on the NIHE Limerick Bill and there were two major areas of contemplation when we discussed that Bill.  First of all, there was the composition of the governing body and secondly, the overpowering presence of the Minister and the Department in the day-to-day administration of that institution.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say with regard to the first one &mdash; that is the composition of the governing body &mdash; that it is not necessary to make the same arguments that I and others made on that occasion.  There is certainly an improvement in the balance, and the insistence of the Minister then on appointing or being in a position to influence the appointment of the majority of the members of the governing body is not there to the same extent in this present Bill.  I want to say that I welcome that.</P>
    <P>On the other issue, what to me appears to be the overpowering influence and presence of the Minister and the Department in the operation and in fact in the day-to-day running of the college is very much in evidence again here, because right through the Bill you have phrases such as &ldquo;as may be determined by the Minister&rdquo;'; &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;such conditions as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister may by order revoke&rdquo;, &ldquo;if the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;, &ldquo;with the consent off the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;with the concurrence of the Minister&rdquo;, and &ldquo;if approved by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having read the Bill and having been confronted with these phrases in relation to every worthwhile task that the governing body would be expected to perform I think it is quite legitimate to ask what really can the governing body do on its own responsibility and on its own good faith?  I want to ask the question: what can be more calculated to imperil bold, courageous, imaginative planning than as it were to have this continuous series of restraints imposed upon the people charged with guiding the destinies of the institution?  What can choke initiative and what can stifle progress more than to have a body of people charged with a certain task operating under the shadow that there is somebody there who is in a position to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> Now, is there a theory somewhere that the people who will eventually be appointed to this governing body will be lacking in some way or, on the other hand will be reckless and irresponsible, that we believe that it is necessary to surround them with this litany of constraints and safeguards?  I would for my part be prepared to make an act of faith in the sincerity, competence and the commitment of people who are likely to come on to this body to do what in their honest opinion and in their judgment is right and proper for the success and the development of the college.  I would not tie to them, as it were, this impediment that we introduce constantly throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to attempt to visualise what is the atmosphere, what is the attitude prevailing at a meeting of this governing body when they are convinced that there are certain steps, certain developments that should be taken in the interest of the college?  If they believe in their hearts that a particular course of action is right, they have not the freedom to proceed to put that course of action into effect.  They have continually to balance with it the thought: &ldquo;Is this going to be acceptable; how much of it will he wear or will the Department wear; and in what way can we shorten it or alter it or tailor it to the point where it will gain ministerial or departmental acceptance?&rdquo; I believe that is a wrong and faulty basis on which to start out in relation to this particular institution or college or to other similar ones.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while I welcome the decision to establish on a statutory basis the Thomond College of Education in Limerick, while I commend all involved in it and all associated with it and all who had any part to play in it and the remarkable success and achievements that have been there to date, I will finish by emphasising that I certainly object to and I cannot see the necessity for introducing this continuous encirclement of safeguards and restraints on the freedom of action of the governing body of an academic institution such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make just <Col N="376" /> a few points, because the Minister has listened with great patience to our comments on not only this Bill but the NIHE Dublin Bill.  In a way the tide of rhetoric has been flowing in the same direction.  I would like to make a point in sympathy with the Minister and the Bill, and that is in relation to section 12.  I make it as a symbolic point, not as a Committee Stage point, in regard to where he says the governing body shall, as soon as may be after the end of each academic year, prepare and submit to the Minister a report of its proceedings during the year.  The governing body then shall supply the Minister with such information regarding the performance of its functions as he may from time to time require.</P>
      <P>That is an admirable provision but it does not appear an admirable provision because the involvement of the Minister in every phase of the Bill is such that a sensible provision like that takes on a sinister colouring.  The Bill is badly drafted, it seems to me, in that it gives far more prominence and menace to the ministerial presence than I think even the Minister, especially this Minister, would want.  On the other hand, it seems to me that the reason for such a provision as that is fairly clear because some of these institutes for higher education have shown once or twice in their history a tendency to kick over the traces and exercise an independence from the normal obligations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things <Col N="377" /> that I had in mind did not involve UCD at all.  It involved UCC.  When NIHE in Limerick was under the tutelage, fosterage of UCC certain crises arose and conflicts which were far from edifying.  UCC actually played quite an honourable role in that matter.  It is important that an institute of higher education anywhere must be accountable to the people and as a representative of the people in this case, to the Minister.  I find that all right.  My chief objection to the Bill would be that it seems to me an extremely neurotic Bill, a Bill in which you are trying to batten down the hatches against every possible outbreak of irresponsibility on the part of the institution involved.  One thing is missing from it.  It is this &mdash; and it is the most old-fashioned idea in the world &mdash; that any seat of learning, be it a university, a national school or a secondary school, depends for its efficacy on the people who are in it and the students who have passed through it and the links between those students and their teachers, the links between the past and the present, in other words its own <i>genius loci,</i> its own sense of its worth.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think one of the reasons why institutions which have been set up in our own time, in this enlightened age of ours, frequently come into collision with the media and the public and the Government and civil service is that they are not allowed to develop their own sense of loyalty and continuity.  How, for instance, has such an obsolete system as the English public school system survived through so many Labour governments in England?  How is it that they dare not lay hands on Eton and Harrow and such institutions?  They seem obsolete.  I will tell you why: because those schools have built up such loyalty among their past pupils whom they bring back and put on the board of governors, all their alumni; in other words it becomes a great centre of learning because people love it, because it is allowed the ability to foster its own people.  So, even in the most hostile atmosphere these institutions survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a rumour that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> Eton was moving to County Cork &mdash; ahead of the posse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Professor Martin Professor Martin">
      <NameTxt>Professor Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With the change of Taoiseach it is unlikely that that is going to happen now.  They may move to Kinsealy. The point I am making is this, that on the board of the governors there is no specific provision made for the past students of the institution, for those people who come out of the institution and would be very keen to be on its board of governors.  The sense of continuity is not there.  Therefore, the people who are going to be the loyal to the institution, jealous for its good name, anxious for the perpetuation of its values, the people who would be valuable in that respect will find that there is no formal provision made for the alumni, the past pupils, for the graduates of these institutions.  I do not say they are excluded because they can come in under other banners of these institutions and be on the governing body.  I think that is a serious human deprivation.</P>
      <P>We pretend as we go on through civilisation and develop that we keep on learning and improving.  We do not: we forget sometimes the most important things in the past.  The thing that has preserved universities and colleges, even national schools, even the most humble forms of educational ministry has always been that principle of continuity, the fact that is an <i>alma mater</i> in the sense that the people whom you put through it have a loyalty to it, that you earn their loyalty, that you cultivate their further interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the serious lack in the Bill.  It is a rather cold Bill.  It looks as if everything is going to be organised by a Minister and then by civil servants, but the dynamism, the inner inspirational quality of the institution itself seems to me to have no kind of profile in the Bill at all.  That is a defect. It may be a defect that has arisen from a failure of confidence because of a few unfortunate instances, most recently between the Department of Education and one or two of these institutions, between the universities and one or two of these institutions.  The answer to that difficulty.  I think, is not to curtail the autonomy of the institutions but actually <Col N="379" /> to foster it and to give it a better chance to develop itself.</P>
    <P>That would be my prime objection to the Bill.  I suppose the Minister is weary listening to this point being reiterated in different forms.  The fact that it is being reiterated must mean that there is some validity in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statutory setting of this college particularly in the field of teacher training because we come from a tradition of not so very long ago, not so many years ago, when there was very heavy-handed control of teacher training in this country, where teachers were, to a larger extent, trained as though they were allowed to come out and teach our children with a very limited experience of life.  The fact that this college of education is being established in the way it is is an important sign of the times in the development of teacher training so that teachers are trained as adult people and in a much more modern fashion than they were in the past.  It is to be welcomed that this college is to set up in the way that it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I must, at the risk of being repetitive, share some of Senator Murphy's disquiet about the necessity for ministerial approval in so many ways. This again is a point which was made by Senator Whitaker in the debate on the Dublin NIHE and indeed on previous Bills of the same kind, in particular with regard to section 9 which deals with the appointment of people and also of their terms and conditions of employment. Previous speakers have said enough about the kind of principles of independence involved in this but I would like to say something about the practicalities of this, because I have personal experience of working on a body analogous to a governing body were all terms and conditions of employment have to have the approval of the civil service department.  It makes for a very great practical difficulties, <Col N="380" /> particularly where changes of terms and conditions of employment arise.  I have in fact found myself in the Labour Court in the invidious position of being the employer who is technically opposed to applications by staff which I really approve but which I am not allowed to approve of by the Department who are looking over my shoulder.  I am aware that this has happened with regard to the Minister's own Department, for instance, in the Institute of Advanced Studies.  The same situation arose with the Labour Court there.</P>
    <P>It can lead to unjust delays and difficulties when there is this need for a kind of niggling approval all the time.  Also, it does not state in the Bill whether they mean a prior approval by the Minister or subsequent approval by the Minister.  If if it is subsequent approval one can get the invidious situation which Senator Murphy is referring to that somebody could be appointed and then dis-appointed afterwards.  If it is prior approval that is meant it can lead, with no ill-will at all on the part of the Department concerned, to very considerable delays.  This applies also to the terms and conditions of employment.  It is not necessarily that the Department of Education will wish to make difficulties but simply that they have a great deal of work on their hands and these things can get pushed to one side.  You look around and you find it is three years ago you applied for this particular approval and it has not happened yet.</P>
    <P>It is rather impracticable apart from being undesirable in principle to look for all this Ministerial approval particularly where you have the Minister for Public Service joined in also and perhaps the Higher Education Authority.  All this approval is just not practicable, and it would be much better just to allow your governing body to be a reasonable body of persons and let them make their own decisions.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Martin that there is a need for public accountability where public money is being spent and where these institutions have a responsibility to the people but I think it could be covered by general <Col N="381" /> accountability as by the provision of a report and as by general oversight of expenditure.  I feel that there is not really this need for piecemeal approval everytime anyone wants to make any move whatsoever.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien, who had contributed to the discussion on the National Institute for a Higher Education Dublin, Bill drew again on his experience as a member of the vocational education committee to strengthen his welcome for the Bill seeing that he has serious difficulty in getting for his own vocational education committee trained metal work teachers and physical education teachers.  He mentioned something which I fear is a fact, that physical education had been to a great extent neglected in our schools. Now, this Bill is giving statutory backing to a very fine physical education college, the National College of Physical Education incorporated in the larger concept of Thomond which covers both physical education teachers and the specialist teachers of woodwork, metalwork, building construction and engineering workshop theory and practice.</P>
      <P>He paid to the tribute to the Gaelic Athletic Association in rural Ireland which provided a great deal of physical exercise of school life, and other athletic organisations, of course, did this in other schools in other areas.</P>
      <P>He also welcomed the large physical education centres where he thought that the teachers from Thomond will also have a role to play.  His final remark was about rural science.  I will correct Senator Howard, who seems to think that the rural science courses for teachers have not started yet; they have; they started in this academic year 1979-80.</P>

    <P>D'fháiltigh an Seanadóir de Brún roimh an mBille seo agus do mhol sé é mar chéim ar aghaidh ionas go mbeadh <Col N="382" /> na múinteoirí go léir oilte ar, mar a dúirt sé, chomhchéim staidis agus is dóigh liom, go háirithe ón dtuath go bhfuil sé sin ana-thábhachtach.  Dúirt sé gur thaithin sin leis na múinteoirí, agus rud maith é dos na daltaí freisin.

    <P>Senator de Brun's statement with regard to this in the light of what has happened recently in Thomond.  If Senator Martin was referring to that dispute the Department of Education was not concerned with it all.  It was a matter between the students and the administration of the college.  I am glad to say that that whole dispute has now been settled and we hope it will not recur.  Senator Murphy referred to it and said there was a certain lack of communication.  I examined the case fairly closely and I did not see that there was any justification for refusal to take an examination because I was convinced by the statements I had heard from students whom I met privately and from correspondence with the college that it was indicated as early as 1978 that this examination would have to be taken by the students.  There was a misunderstanding, and nearly all misunderstandings are due to some inadequacy in communication.  I am glad that the dispute was settled.  I took it that Senator de Brun's remarks were made in that context rather than in a general context.</P>
    <P>I would be in agreement with Senator Murphy that student input into the education debate has been of considerable interest.  One did not have to agree with all the proposals put forward by students but, in the sense of the irritation making the pearl in the oyster or the gadfly that Socrates talked about producing some action from thought, the students have performed a useful role provided, of course, that they adhere to their own arguments and concentrate on them rather than being wheeled away by extraneous matters or sometimes flippant matters.</P>

      <P>I understood that the words used by Senator Martin were with reference to the Department of Education being in conflict.  In Opposition, and in Government, I made it clear what my own policy was with regard to the validation in the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick and I cannot be accused of being inconsistent in that.</P>

      <P>Although inconsistency has its virtues, they say.  Senator Murphy referred &mdash; I am in full agreement with him &mdash; to the excellent physical conditions obtaining in Thomond College.  He said, &ldquo;aoibhinn beatha an scoláire.&rdquo; What we want to do is to come on with the next line, that they will be &ldquo;ag déanamh léinn&rdquo;.  There is no doubt, and the house is fully aware of it, that it is a beautiful site along the banks of the Shannon, that the grounds are extensive not just merely adequate.  The buildings are good and purpose-built and there is no excuse why both a pleasant and profitable sojourn should not be spent there by the future teachers in these specific areas for our country.  It is bound to have an effect on them afterwards.  I hope that with Wordsworth we might think that beauty born of wondrous sound&mdash; I am sure the gurgling Shannon is wondrous in that area &mdash; will pass into their faces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy went on to deal with <Col N="384" /> the original build-up for a university of Limerick.  We shared membership of an organisation which heard a good deal of the case being made and that union was asked to put its weight behind the idea of a university in Limerick.  The decision was a right one, as Senator Murphy said. The whole complex, the National Institute and Thomond, is on the road to success.</P>
    <P>The substantive criticism of Senators Murphy, Martin and McGuinness was that there is a undue Departmental interference.  Senator Murphy asked me if the Department was already playing a tougher role in Thomond than elsewhere. My answer to that is; not to my knowledge, and if it were I should know.  He asked would I be worried.  I presume it was not a rhetoretical question.  My answer is: I would.  The third question was would I interfere.  That was a most ingenious paradox, as he indicated himself.  He was asking me if I would interfere to stop interference, I presume.  The answer again is: yes.  I was on a very sticky wicket when Senator Murphy was thanking me for only appointing seven me with the NIHE stick at the same time.</P>
    <P>He did instance AnCO, ACOT and NCAD as the individual institutions that would have an interest and who could claim a right to a member on the governing body.  He mentioned ACOT specifically in connection with the rural science area.  As was said by both Senators Murphy and Martin they are not excluded in the terms of the Bill, nor are we specifically tied to one from university area. I know that the National College of Art and design train teachers.  Its courses also involve art teacher training.  It is very difficult to be specific about a whole lot of organisations in a Bill.  The fact that ACOT is now and potentially in the future a great influence on a very important sector of the country would indicate that they should have an interest in the governing body of the teachers of rural science.  This fact would argue that they will not be left out of consideration, but I admit they are not specifically mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to the Higher <Col N="385" /> Education Authority letter.  I do not want to slough off any kind of responsibility with regard to that.  As the Senator knows, the 1971 Act set up the Higher Education Authority and gave it considerable independence.  It would be ironic if in this debate we should indicate that the Minister should have some power or control over the Higher Education Authority because we are specifically trying to avoid that in accordance with the tenor of this debate.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Senator, when he mentioned appointments, really meant posts.  The Departments of Finance and of the Public Service have an interest in the posts more than in the appointments.  I do not think there is any effort or attempt to cover by statute any interference in the specific appointments. Senator Murphy also made the point that post-graduate provision was left out.  I should like to mention &mdash; it is of interest in this connection though there is no cause and effect interest in it &mdash; that when introducing the Bill I said that there were schools crying out for teachers, particularly teachers of the special subjects mentioned already, engineering work shop theory and practice and the building construction areas.  Many Senators mentioned this shortage from their own experience, including Senator O'Brien.  The concentration, in fact, is on the production of teachers with their degrees from the National Council for Educational Awards and getting them into the schools.  I contend that section 4(1)(a) would not preclude post-graduate degrees.  It states: &ldquo;to provide suitable degree level courses for the purpose of the training of teachers for services in such schools and institutions...&rdquo; Section 4(1)(d) which mentions research could also be adduced as a part which would support the provision of post-graduate courses in Thomond College.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that Senator Howard is mistaken in thinking that the training of rural science teachers has not started. It has started.  The first year will be 1979-80.  He paid a compliment, one which other Senators and I paid, to the director and those who have been carrying the burdens of administration and enduring <Col N="386" /> the growing pains since it first got under way, at least since the physical education part of Thomond College got under way. As the House knows, the other part only got under way in the academic year 1979-80.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Senator's reference to resources I should like to say that a sober assessment of the resources will indicate that this is one of the best endowed educational institutions in Irelans or elsewhere.  I made the point in my introductory speech that, in fact, it was the first purpose-built training college of its kind in these islands&mdash;whatever &ldquo;these islands&rdquo; are but I include Britain in that. There is no problem about resources. The resources have been allocated and the institution will be sustained at the high level at which it was launched.  Senator Howard repeated those doubts and worries of Senators Murphy and Martin about the governing body and what it can do.  A careful perusal of section 6 (1) and (2) will indicate that it has considerable powers, as it should have.  That section states that the governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property.  The affairs are multifarious affairs. There are at least four different types of teachers to be trained in this institution and the property, as I have indicated, is large and very valuable.  This is no small task for the governing body.  The section continues: &ldquo;and shall perform all the functions conferred on the College by this Act and shall have such powers as may be necessary under this Act for that purpose.&rdquo;  The governing body is not any emasculated body.  It is a body with considerable powers and serious obligations. The quality of the people who are there already in the <i>ad hoc</i> position and the quality of those who will be finally appointed to it will be such as will enable them to perform these functions efficiently and well and be a credit to our educational system.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin on section 12 indicated that he found it eminently reasonable. Section 12 states:</P>
    <P>The Governing Body shall, as soon as may be after the end of each academic year, prepare and submit to the Minister <Col N="387" /> a report of its proceedings during that year.</P>
    <P>He said it takes on &mdash; guilt by association, I suppose &mdash; a different and dubious colour when associated with other claims of ministerial power in the Bill.  I am sorry he thinks that.  We had a long discussion on this when dealing with the Bill on the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  I would be sorry to think that there was any substance in the fears expressed on this.  I agree with Senator Martin &mdash; he made this point also in the debate on the Bill dealing with the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin &mdash; that an institution develops its own ethos and its own spirit.  The staff, the student body and the graduates of the body all play a part in developing this <i>genius loci.</i> In ancient times, of course, <i>genius loci</i> was often represented by a snake.  I hope there was no particular significance in Senator Martin's choosing those words to indicate what he was talking about but then the snake of Aesgulapius was regarded as something that would cure disease.  We have it on our health board symbols.  Senator Martin, when speaking on the Bill dealing with the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, threw the shadow a little forward to the university legislation.  I got the impression that, perhaps, he might be thinking that the post-graduates in the university might be deprived of a say in those institutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer was that they would not be deprived.  Certainly, as far as membership of the governing body is concerned, and when the years, like great black oxen, produce more graduates in the area there is no reason why they should not be on the governing body because there is nothing to preclude them.  I have already dealt with the matter of the unfortunate instances of incidents between the Department and institutions.  I am not aware of any.  I thought the Senator was referring to the most <Col N="388" /> recent dispute with regard to the examination at the end of the second year.</P>
      <P>I take Senator McGuinness' point about a very heavily restricted teacher-training course which did exist.  It was, possibly, too short.  The idea behind the whole structure originally was to give the Irish language &mdash; rightly so &mdash; its proper place in the training of teachers.  It is a strange thing that many teachers of high quality came out of this over-restricted atmosphere which obtained for a long time in teacher-training.  I do not believe students would tolerate it nowadays, but it is true to say that despite the handicaps teachers of very fine calibre were produced.  Perhaps we at times attach too much importance to the influence we can exert in educational institutions, and virtue will finally prevail and moral muscles will be strengthened despite any cocooning or cosseting that may go on.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGuinness that the Bill indicates that the college will be treating people as adults, with many advantages over people who were trained in the past.  Senator McGuinness also mentioned section 9 and I should like to quote from that section 9:</P>
      <P>The college may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers (in addition to the Director) and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, it from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>It was the phraseology that the Senator took exception to.  I would like to make a distinction between posts and appointments, because it is the number of posts rather than the specific appointments, the individuals appointed and their qualifications, that are in question there.  I do not believe that the provisions of the section will in any way militate against the good conduct of the affairs of Thomond College, nor will they interfere with the training of the teachers or the quality of the teachers who come from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude by thanking the Senators for their contributions.  We did not have as long or as wide-ranging a debate as we did on the Bill dealing with the National Institute for Higher Education <Col N="389" /> in Dublin, but there was so much of a pattern in the structure of the various Bills that we have dealt with that this was to be expected.  It did not in any way interfere with the quality of the contributions which was as high as it was on the other Bills.  Is mian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil libh mar gheall air sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to clarify a pedantic point, maybe, the Irish version of the title of the college.  It appears that there is some embarrassing discrepancy between the Irish form already in use in Thomond and for which some professional sanction is claimed, in that it appears to have the OK of the Place Names Commission, and the form used in the Bill.  No matter how the shortened spelling might be canvassed, which I understand is Thuamhan, ostensibly one would like to see some of these superfluous &ldquo;hs&rdquo; removed but if one does it one interferes violently not only with the sound but with the meaning.  I am glad that the form herein is preserved.  To incorporate the shorter form would be to perpetrate a barbarism, but I should like to know what the Minister thinks of that.</P>

      <P>This matter was raised in the Dáil also. I am in total agreement with what Senator Murphy said.  The provenance of the word is North Munster, Tuadh and Mumhan into one word.  The shortened version does violence to that.  The college is using the shorter version at the moment <Col N="390" /> but ní fál go haer é and I think that they will adopt.  It means that some of their stationery will be carrying the shorter version for some time but I do not suppose they have ordered enough to do them to the end of the century.  I hope they have not.  This is the version indicating the origin of the word as North Munster or Tuadh Mumhan, the form finally agreed upon.</P>

      <P>I was not convinced by the Minister's case that the paragraphs (a) and (d) could be said to provide in some way for post-graduate studies, because the normal interpretation of a degree level course is an undergraduate course. As for the term research used in subsection (d), the normal meaning of research is research which is carried out by members of the staff, not necessarily schools of post-graduate studies.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the college, apparently, will have to negotiate each single proposed post-graduate diploma course with the Minister.  For obvious reasons this is undesirable.  I understand that this is the process already used in the case of a post-graduate diploma course in business studies.  It seems a pity that a more general provision was not put into the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be seen as pettifogging.  The section states: &ldquo;(a) to provide suitable degree level courses for the purpose of the training of teachers ...&rdquo; I agree with Senator Murphy that that is the normal interpretation of the words.  What I said was that from the wording the college would be entitled to interpret that as giving them power to develop.  We talk about an M.Ed. degree, about an M.A. degree and a Ph.D degree.  Under the wording I would think that the college would be entitled to put <Col N="391" /> on those courses and give the widest possible interpretation of the word &ldquo;degree&rdquo; in section 4(1)(a).  That was the first point I made.  With regard to research, loosely it is quite common for people who are doing an M.Sc to say they are doing research, research being crowned by the award of a doctorate or a master's degree at the end of the year.  I am talking of the universities courses.  They use those terms in that kind of way.  They would be justified in making that interpretation both at subsection (1)(a) and (d).</P>

      <P>Not to delay the House I will just make one extra point on section 5.  I respectfully ask the Minister to keep in mind a little additional university representation when he is engaged in fleshing out the whole governing body appointment.  The Minister knows, because I said it often enough, that I am totally for the proper division of power between universities and these new institutions.  I do not believe in the universities playing nanny in any way.  At the same time, one can go too far with that in a small country like ours where it is desirable to have cross-fertilisation and a proper leavening of traditional academics in such a body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep what the Senator suggests in mind.  The National Council for Education Awards, as the Senator knows, have boards of studies and on the specific boards which cover the various areas of study of which the NCEA approve we have a very strong representation from universities, business, industry, unions and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to subsections (2) and (5) which deal with pay, terms and conditions of employment and the approval of the Minister.  What type of machinery does the Minister envisage for this approval, and does it mean that every time remuneration and terms and conditions of employment are changed this will require the approval of the Minister?  How will this be processed to avoid practical delays and difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section dealing with appointments to the academic staff of the college.  I did not intervene on the Second Reading because I saw no advantage in making, for a third time, a case I had made unavailingly on the two NIHE Bills in favour of an express provision in this particular section for an appointments system aimed at ensuring excellence and impartiality in appointments.  I have to be content to cherish the indications that the Minister gave here last week that he will not be following the NIHE or the Thomond models in the new university legislation in this respect, but will give consideration in that context to both matters of concern to me, the appointments procedure and the ensuring of adequacy of degree standards.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, however, I may repeat on this section a comment I have made on its counterpart on the two NIHE Bills, and ask the Minister an explicit question.  I have criticised as being over-restrictive the provision for approval of two Ministers before any appointment can be made.  I see this as interfering with a prerogative which should rest with the governing body of any institution or enterprise set up to perform a public service, namely the prerogative of deciding initially how many and what kinds of staff they need in order to carry out their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, in favour of some control in the public interest in relation to staffing but, as I said on at least two <Col N="393" /> previous occasions, there is already the control which is inherent in the body having to seek finance from the Higher Education Authority for new appointments.  I was also prepared to add a further control, a <i>post factum</i> review by the Department of the Public Service of the staff complements and grades in institutions of this kind.</P>
    <P>The explicit question I should like to put to the Minister is this: the prerogative I mentioned has been observed in at least three other pieces of legislation and in doing so the Government was proceeding in a very enlightened way.  In the legislation dealing with the National Board for Science and Technology, Bord na Gaeilge and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaiochta the various governing bodies are allowed make appointments and decide, without reference to Minister or Ministers, the number of staff they need and the grades of staff.  They are rightly, and I have no objection to this, subject to ministerial approval about what they pay and the conditions of employment of staff, but I wonder why the Minister has not followed the more liberal legislative precedents in relation to all these institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I crave the House's indulgence because I seem to have lost the notes that I made.  I would be very grateful if Senator McGuinness would repeat her question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>It was merely to ask the Minister what kind of machinery would be set up in the Department to deal with approval of terms and conditions and of pay.  I can well understand that there has to be some public control over the way in which money is spent but generally speaking, all these bodies have an overall budget within which they must function.  If one has a position where every change in wages and conditions of employment has to have the approval of two Ministers there must be a set way in which this is to be dealt with if it is not to involve undue delay.  I just wanted to know whether that is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Such item would be a matter <Col N="394" /> for conciliation and negotiation between the college authorities, the unions representing employees, the Higher Education Authority and the Departments.  The Ministers will not enter into that at all, as far as my interpretation of the section is concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Whitaker, he made two points &mdash; one about appointments and one about guaranteeing the adequacy of degrees.  He has been pursuing these points with commendable consistency right through the debates on all third level Bills.  He again has thrown out a bait to the pond of the future in regard to universities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not present the Senator with a red herring.  I would see the statutes of the universities dealing adequately with a number of the points Senator Whitaker made.  The whole question of the internationally recognised quality of certificate, diploma and degree is something to which I have given a lot of thought and a very strong brief upon to the National Council for Education Awards.  I had the privilege of addressing them at a very short lunch break today. Their boards of studies are of a very high quality indeed, covering all areas with top experts.  They also have an obligation, as the House knows because the Bill went through this House, to ensure and promote the acceptance of these certificates, diplomas and degrees by international bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole quality of the degree is the central issue, and if any international body in a specific field is not satisfied with the quality of the award that is a red light for the council.  They have been singularly successful so far in this.  I accept totally the need for the Senator's concern in this regard.  It was always important and our traditional universities attach great importance to it.  It is significantly more important nowadays seeing that we are part of a nine, and soon a ten, and soon after that posibly a 12, nation economic community.  We are not taking in our own washing.  We are living on that <Col N="395" /> size of stage, and time spent in the house with concern for the quality of our appointments and the quality and acceptability of our awards is time well spent.</P>
    <P>In regard to university legislation the Senator can be assured that this will be taken care of.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 17, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first schedule I should like to make a point with reference to section 6.  Since being elected to this House I have noticed that there is a stock piece in a lot of legislation that membership of the Oireachtas debars one from being a member of such and such a statutory body.  I am mystified about this because I cannot see why, for example, my membership of Seanad Éireann should debar me from being a member of the governing body of Thomond College and, <i>absit omen</i> perhaps, perish the thought, from being a member of the future Cork university.  In what possible way could I compromise the public good by being a member of a university governing body, and at the same time, being a member of this House?  It does not make any sense to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in relation to section 7 which provides safeguards against vested interests, either in respect of appointments or contracts, on the part of governors by ensuring that they do not have any part in the proceedings where perhaps a relation is involved in appointments or where they themselves have a business interest in contracts.  In passing I may remark that no such tender concern for integrity is forthcoming in a lot of bodies.  How do we know that there are not all kinds of people in this House and in the other House who have the most devious and malign vested interests <Col N="396" /> in legislation going through the House that nobody ever knows?  I approve totally of Section 7.  I should like to ask the Minister if there are any sanctions in this regard?  Suppose there is a blackguard on the governing body who brazenly participates in the appointment of his nephew or furthers his own business interest in respect of a building contract, are there legal sanctions to punish this or to take action <i>post factum</i> or even <i>pre factum</i>?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points raised by Senator Murphy was about membership of Seanad Éireann.  I have to confess, as I did in the other House, that I made the same speech about this when I was on the Opposition benches as Senator Murphy has made now.  I did not see the reason, but I have been convinced that it could cause some trouble to a governing body.  I have been convinced, but only just, with regard to it.  I gave the benefit of the doubt to including it.  I can see why Senator Murphy regards it as strange.  It is in all the Bills.  That is not a reason for saying it should be in this one.  The political complications could be destructive, but not necessarily so.  I came down, but just barely, on the side of including it.</P>
      <P>On the other point, I am not a legal expert.  There is no specific sanction mentioned in the Bill but if the provision is here and is not acted upon, and if interest is not declared, there would be a possibility of charging the person concerned with corrupt practices.  However, the fact that it is part of a statute that the interest must be declared, if it is not declared it would seem to me to leave the person liable to prosecution, but as I said I speak as one less wise in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all convinced by the Minister's reply on the first point about membership of the governing bodies.  It stands to reason that if my colleagues or my graduates to the governing body of University College, Cork, of which I am not a member at present, deemed fit to elect me surely nothing but good could ensue from my membership at once of the UCC governing body and of Seanad Éireann?  There is no loot to <Col N="397" /> be gained but a lot of disinterested good to be achieved.</P>
      <P>Might I remind the Minister that this has been the unquestioned practice of our governing bodies of constituent colleges of the NUI?  For example, if one looks at the membership list of UCD or UCC at present one would probably find that the relevant lord mayor is <i>ex officio</i> represented.  More often than not he is a TD.  He does not happen to be in Cork at present.  The members representing county councils are as often as not Deputies.  Yet we have introduced here a mystifying principle which I suggest demands keener analysis than the Minister seems to be prepared to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to membership by a lord mayor and councillors the 1908 Act included them because at that time the only source of finance for scholarships was the local authority.  It was felt that, as they were the awarding bodies of scholarships, it was important to have them represented on the respective governing bodies in university towns.  One could broaden the argument and say that as first citizens of the various cities they should represent the town in the territory of the gown.  That is not actually what we are about here.  I realise there is a grain of truth in the submission made by the Senator.  I have confessed to my own weakness in regard to it.  After having considered it I simply said &ldquo;stet&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister having just said &ldquo;stet&rdquo; I suppose I may try to transfer this plea to the universities legislation.  I should like to win the Minister back, in that context at least, to his original sympathies.  For example, quite recently he very graciously proposed to the Government, and the Government advised the President, to appoint me, a Member of this House, to be chairman of the council of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  In other words, I am put on the governing body of that institution without any obvious deficiency arising solely from my membership of this House.  Similarly I have been elected Chancellor of the National University and, therefore, preside over the senate of that university <Col N="398" /> which, in the federal institution, is in effect the governing body.  I join with my colleague Professor Murphy in hoping that the Minister will perhaps have second thoughts about this in the universities context at least.</P>

      <P>I would be hard put to find activities in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies which would cause turmoil or stasis in the market place, and the study of ionization of the stratosphere is unlikely to find an echo in the county council chamber.  I commended Senator Whitaker to the Government as a suitable chairman of the institute because of his undoubted contributions in many spheres to our national life.  I take his point.  He is a Senator, and it is the point Senator Murphy was making.</P>

    <Title>Building Societies Bill, 1980: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill the primary purpose of which is to provide a general statutory basis for the payment of subsidy in respect of the interest on building society loans.  The Building Societies Act, 1976, consolidated and modernised the statute law in relation to building societies but does not contain any provision enabling the payment of subsidy on loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the following minor changes in the existing law relating to building societies.  Section 12 of the housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, enables a limited form of interest subsidy to be paid to building societies on certain loans which were issued by the <Col N="399" /> societies and guaranteed by a housing authority.  Section 4 of the Bill proposes to repeal section 12 of the 1979 Act, and any future subsidy payments in relation to such &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; loans will then be made under the provisions of section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 23 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, enables small amounts which are held in a building society in the name of a person who has died intestate to be released by the society prior to the grant of administration of the deceased person's estate.  This provision has been helpful in avoiding hardship in certain cases, and section 3 of the Bill proposes to extend the provisions so as to enable a similar procedure to apply in the case of testate deaths.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the payment of subsidy in respect of the interest on building society loans, and section 2 of the Bill will provide the necessary statutory basis.  The section is drafted on a flexible basis and will provide a broad power to pay subsidy, leaving the details as to the type of subsidy to be prescribed in regulations.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which gave rise to the recent subsidy and hence the present Bill were as follows.  In April of this year the Irish Building Societies Association informed the Minister for the Environment that due to increases in interest rates generally and the adverse effects of their relatively unattractive interest rates on the nett inflows of funds to societies, it was necessary to recommend an increase in building society investment rates from 9 per cent to 10.75 per cent, standard rate tax paid.  This would have necessitated an increase from 14.15 per cent to 16.5 per cent in the interest rate charged on home loans.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the report of a working group established to examine the matter, the Government decided to make available, on a temporary basis, a direct subsidy to societies for the purpose of enabling them to increase their investment rates from 1 May 1980 to 10.75 per cent without increasing the interest rate charged on house loans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Reductions in interest rates generally since then have enabled societies from 1 October 1980 to bring their investment rates back to the level prevailing in April of this year, and the need for the subsidy no longer exists.  Liability for subsidy amounting to approximately £7 million will result though, of this amount, less than £2 million will be payable in the current year.</P>
    <P>The reductions in interest rates recently announced by the Associated Banks together with the highly satisfactory inflows of funds to societies in recent months would, one would have expected, have left the way open to building societies to effect reductions in their investment and mortgage interest rates.  Senators will be aware that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Raphael P. Burke, recently had a number of meetings with representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association to discuss this matter and that he stressed the Government's hope that there would be an immediate and positive response from the societies.  I regret that their reaction to date has been negative.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill. Section 1 enables the Government to pay a subsidy to the building societies for the sole reason of keeping interest rates down.  From what the Minister has said and from what is conveyed in the Bill, it will also regularise the payment that is going to be made to the societies from the Government.  A lot has to be done to keep interest rates down, and the interest rate is, at the moment, 14.5 per cent on moneys borrowed from the building societies.  Building societies' rates vary as against local authority rates, and sometimes the difference can be very substantial.</P>
      <P>Section 3 extends to building societies the practice that has been enjoyed by depositors with the Post Office.  The next of kin of people who had a deposit in the Post Office, could withdraw that deposit without probate or letters of administration.  The same practice is implied in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing about which I am <Col N="401" /> not too clear.  The registrar fixes the amount of money.  How does he decide on what is a small amount?  What yardstick is being used?  Is one thinking of £1,000, £2,000, £10,000 or £20,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with section 3.  Section 4 repeals section 12 of the 1979 Act.  I am not too clear as to what is going to be repealed.  The Minister might enlighten me on that in his reply.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for the Government to provide money at a nominal rate or at a cheap rate of interest, particularly for young married couples who are finding great difficulty in purchasing houses.  I am sure that the Minister and everybody else realise that in the past few years the price of the average house has more than doubled.  It has risen from £13,000 to £27,000.  That is a very substantial increase in a very short space of time and the price is still going up.  On 1 December wages were increased by £1, plus 8 per cent; that again is going to have a very bad effect on the price of houses.</P>
      <P>It is pointless talking about the price of building materials, but for the record it is useful to know that inside the past week alone the price of timber has increased by 16 per cent &mdash; on one item of building material &mdash; and increases do not stop there.  One often wonders about the unfortunate young people who have borrowed these substantial amounts of money.  Do they think about the great demands that are coming on them?  I am not a great mathematician but I am satisfied that the repayments per week in these cases would vary from about £55 to £70.  That is a very substantial amount of money, even nowadays with inflation running at 20 per cent.  It is no surprise that there is a big falling off in the building industry.  For instance, the sales of cement, as compared with last year, have dropped by about 34 per cent.  That is a very substantial drop in the sales of the raw material for building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that, in the case of many young married couples the wives have to hold on to their jobs.  There is no alternative <Col N="402" /> because repayments could not possibly be met if they did not.  Then the children come along and while the wife is working they are deposited with some relative, neighbour or friend.  We all know that this will not make a good society.  We must look at this from every angle.  In bigger centres there is some type of place or house where people look after a substantial number of children who are left in in the morning and collected by parents on their way home in the evening.  This is not going to help our society to be as we would want it and it breaks up the home at a very early stage. We are obliged in every way possibly to go further with subsidies to keep these prices down.</P>
    <P>Building societies have a job to do and the Minister with us here tonight who has charge of housing has a big job on his hands.  There is a great demand for houses and we all know that the building societies are not able to meet the number of applications that they have.  The same problem exists with local authorities. More people will be coming to the building societies from local authorities for many reasons.  One reason is that heretofore the county manager had a discretion, if somebody applied for a local authority loan or an SDA loan and had, say, £50, £60 or £100 over the income limit, to give the person that money.  A county manager informed me recently that that discretion has been taken from them and it means that the prospective borrower has to go to a building society. How is he going to make his repayments on the figure that qualifies for a local authority loan, which at the moment is £5,500?  How is he going to make his repayments at a rate of interest of 14.55 per cent.  I do not know.  The Minister is obliged to do something about it.  Interest rates will have to be subsidised much further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with only one way in which the Government with moneys provided by the Oireachtas can influence the operations of building societies.  Its main purpose is to provide statutory authority for subsidising the interest rates on building society loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> Clearly, as recent events have shown and as the Minister of State admitted in his introductory speech, the Minister for the Environment wants to go much further than this in practice.  He wants to be able to influence what the societies pay for their deposits, as this is the pivot on which their mortgage loan rates turn.</P>
    <P>I can fully understand the Minister's concern about the societies' borrowing and lending rates, but it is quite undesirable that he should be in confrontation with them directly on such matters.  It is high time that building societies were brought under the control of the Central Bank so that all interest rates and charges would be under specialised professional supervision by reference not only to the protection of depositors and borrowers but also to the broader needs of monetary and economic policy.</P>
    <P>When the last Central Bank Act was enacted in 1971 certain financial institutions, including building societies, were specifically exempted from its scope. Building societies in 1971 were still relatively small financial institutions with aggregate resources of just about £100,000,000.  They have grown so fast in the intervening decade that their resources now exceed £1,000 million.  If they were excluded from Central Bank control in 1971 on a <i>de minimis</i> principle, no such argument is applicable now. Indeed, they have become powerful competitors of the banks for deposits and the relativity of the interest rates offered to depositors by the building societies and by the banks has a significant influence in directing how the savings of the Irish public will be used.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are, however, not just like other charges &mdash; a matter of cost plus a profit margin.  Deliberate variation upwards and downwards of interest rates has an important role to play in the contraction or easement of monetary policy and, therefore, in the management of the economy.  For this reason the whole spectrum of interest rates should be supervised and influenced by the Central Bank as the monetary authority.  The Central Bank has no power to fix interest rates even for banks but it has effective means <Col N="404" /> of influencing the level of bank interest rates.  That influence should, in my view extend to the whole inter-connected network of interest rates, including those of the building societies.  With resources now in excess of £1,000 million, it seems evident that it is the Central Bank and not any registrar or departmental officials who should be monitoring such critical questions as the prudent liquidity ratios to maintain in building societies or the balance that should be held between their short-term liabilities and their longer-term loans for various purposes.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I did not consult my former colleagues in the Central Bank before putting forward this suggestion.  They may feel they have enough on their plate already.  I do believe that putting building societies under the wing of the Central Bank would be much preferable to letting things continue as they are now, and I commend this suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard the expert, professional opinion of Senator Whitaker on this complex matter of finance and how it can be handled.  I propose to look at it briefly from another point of view.  As the layman sees it at present, the rate of interest that the building societies can give the investors will determine whether they will get an inflow of investment.  If they fall below what is being offered by other societies they will go out of existence.  In a case like that, until the suggestion offered by Senator Whitaker is implemented the Government must step in with a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to approach this from the other point of view which was developed to some degree by Senator Reynolds, that is the tremendous burden that young married couples are taking on with house mortgages.  There was an old dictum that if the housing of a family cost more than one-eighth of the income it was extravagant.  The present trend is that housing is costing as high as one-fifth and in some cases a quarter of the income and that is a tremendous burden on young married couples.  If we couple with that the hire of furniture, kitchen utensils and other amenities, we see that people who are <Col N="405" /> not more that usually wise accumulate a crushing burden of debts or overheads. that is contributing largely to marriage breakdowns.  Furthermore, it contributes to unreasonable demands from unions because many members of these unions have built up a huge pile of debts and they are forced, in order to survive, to compel the union negotiators to look for increases that they in their hearts know their own company and the country as a whole cannot afford.  This is snowballing and it has a very serious effect on social and economic life.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker has suggested how it could be controlled from the top.  I would not be capable of going into that but I think that something could be done about encouraging more saving.  Young people nowadays as soon as they start earning set out on a real spending spree. They live up to a very high standard. They spend a lot of money on luxuries. They buy cars on the HP system.  They have costly weekends.  The thought of providing for their future enters into very few minds.  Then when they marry and settle down they find themselves embarked on a completely new kind of life.  They have not learned the habit of saving.  They have not learned to make provision for this new life, and suddenly they find out that they have very heavy commitments that they are not prepared for.  That leads to domestic unhappiness. As Senator Reynolds points out, this forces more and more married women, mothers of young families, to hold on to their jobs in order that their earnings together with their husbands' might enable them to meet the overheads they have incurred.</P>
    <P>There may be different views on this, but I am inclined to the view that it would be better for the rising generation if more mothers could devote time to bringing up the children in their homes.  Also more and more young people are unable to find work when married women hold on to the jobs.  Inducement to people to save and further benefits for people who came to apply for a loan would have a very desirable effect and would make people more conscious of the need to save to prepare for the next stage in life.  This <Col N="406" /> extravagant expenditure would be curbed and people would be free of these crushing burdens of mortgages and hire purchase payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the building societies are performing a very useful function in providing the funds for the building of houses by individuals.  Because of that it is obvious that this measure should be supported.  However.  I would like the Minister when he is replying to give some idea of the value of the taxpayers' £7 million&mdash;I presume next year rather than this year&mdash; that will contribute to the subsidisation and the lowering of the level of interest so as to provide the houses that are necessary. Naturally, if the taxpayer is providing this money it would be useful for people to have some idea of what the contribution in numbers of houses has been or will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also no doubt that the highest social and financial priority should be devoted to this question of encouraging and helping young people to provide their own homes rather than have them relying on the local authorities to do so. We all know that there is a large queue, a waiting list, in most areas for local authority houses.  We also know that the cost factor is now in or around the £30,000 mark or thereabouts in many cases for local authorities and therefore, every additional house that can be provided by young persons through the medium of mortgages from building societies reduces the cost to the local authority and, therefore, to the Exchequer.  As well as that, it reduces the number potentially on the waiting list.  The highest priority should be given not alone to this entire question of subsidisation of interest rates on mortgages but also to the matter&mdash;which I have not heard put forward before and which was just mentioned by Senator Whitaker&mdash;of interest rates and the useful function which can be performed by building societies in addition to the banking system in the social structure of providing houses.  Our lives in this country, in the neighbouring island and, more recently, in the United States are bedevilled by the high levels of interest.  This is a major problem, but <Col N="407" /> there is merit in what Senator Whitaker has suggested.  I believe that that aspect ought also to be examined to see if a greater measure of expansion in the building of houses by individuals can be effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Reynolds referred to the current high interest rates payable on mortages and I share his concern at the burden this places on house purchasers.  I have every hope, however, that in the coming week the building societies association will decide to follow the lead of the associated banks, the Industrial Credit Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation and reduce their present interest rates.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds also referred to section 12 of the Housing Act, 1979.  It enables the payment of a particular type of subsidy on certain loans which were guaranteed by the housing authorities. The new Bill, in section 2, has financial powers to pay a subsidy.  Section 12, therefore, will be no longer necessary and is being repealed.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds also referred to the inability of societies to meet the demand on them for loans.  Societies have had an unprecedented inflow of investment funds.  My Department estimated that the societies would advance a total of £250 million in loans this year, as compared with £200 million last year.  The present indications are that the societies will have a total of £325 million available for loans in 1980.  Senator Reynolds was correct in stating that the registrar of building societies decides from time to time what maximum amount of the investment standing to the credit of a deceased investor can be paid out to the next of kin in advance of probate or administration.  The ceiling at present is £3,000 but it is open to the registrar at his discretion, to increase the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken note of Senator Whitaker's views as to the control of interest rates.  Whether or not to provide power to control building societies' interest was considered in connection with the Building <Col N="408" /> Societies Bill, 1976, and it was specifically decided by both Houses of the Oireachtas at that stage that such control was not advisable.  Experience since has largely justified that decision.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien referred to the difficulties experienced by young couples who run up debts on the HP system and cannot meet repayments on top of their mortgage bill.  The societies are anxious to inculcate a habit of saving on the part of intending borrowers and, for this purpose, most of the societies have a requirement that loans will be given only to persons who have been regular investors with them over a period of at least a year and, in some cases, it may be more.</P>
      <P>Senator Brugha asked about the cost of housing, which is a great problem and a worry to me because the unit cost here in the inner city is £40,000 a house approximately.  I want to be clear on this. Here in the inner city of Dublin it is costing approximately £40,000 a house.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill is a simple one: it is to permit An Foras Talúntais to sell or lease certain portions of the Johnstown Castle estate in Wexford and generally to lease to the State parts of the estate from time to time if required.  This is not possible at present because of the existing legal position.</P>
      <P>The estate, comprising about £1,000 acres, was donated to the nation as a free gift in 1944 and acceptance was ratified by the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estate, with the consent of the donors, was transferred to An Foras Talúntais under the Johnstown Castle Agricultural <Col N="411" /> College (Amendment) Act, 1959.  The Act precludes An Foras from selling or leasing the estate or any portion of it, but in practice this has proved to be unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>Over the years there have been requests from various interests for portions of the estate, and to accommodate this, an amendment of the existing Acts was contemplated as long ago as 1974. However, because of various complications, such as the amounts of land to be ceded and doubts about the necessity to obtain the donor's consent, amending legislation could not be introduced until now.</P>
    <P>The specific areas which An Foras are to be allowed to dispose of have been finally determined and are marked on the map referred to in section 1 of the Bill. The amounts of the areas of land involved are: 13.75 acres to Wexford County Council for housing and road-widening; 4.75 acres to the Meteorological Office; 8 acres to St. Martin's Hurling Club and 11.5 acres for possible future disposal; these being mainly cottages and gardens on the estate, which tenants may wish to buy, and some small sites which will be cut off from the estate by the new roadway.</P>
    <P>On the question of the donor's consent, the Attorney General's advice was that this was necessary only in the case of the sale of lands to the county council as the housing development might involve some restriction of the reserved sporting rights.  An Foras has obtained that consent.</P>
    <P>In all other cases, including the general power to lease to the State mentioned in section 2 of the Bill, the consent of the donor was not required subject to the preservation of the sporting rights and the rights of way.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps explain that the inclusion in section 2 of the general power to lease land from time to time to the State &mdash; for example in the case of a request for a site like that from the Meteorological Office mentioned earlier &mdash; is to avoid the need for future similar legislation.  At the same time, the power is sufficiently narrow to ensure that there is <Col N="412" /> no danger of the wholesale erosion of the estate as a single entity.  That would, of course, be at variance with the spirit of the donation and acceptance of the lands as a free gift to the nation.</P>
    <P>This measure is a non-controversial one and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a non-controversial issue.  However, there are a number of points I would like clarified.  The estate was donated by a very kindly donor to the State some years ago and we appreciate the great service that Johnstown Castle has given to Irish farming over the years.  One hopes that all the fragmentation &mdash; however well intentioned it is: I am looking at the map &mdash; will be put to good use.  What guarantee have we that there will not be more splintering?  Under the proposed law it might not be very long until another group comes in looking for something else.  What control has the Oireachtas over such a programme developing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 1,000 acres in the entire estate and as an overall acreage, the amount being taken away is not very large.  There are community projects and housing, which are all very commendable, but can the Oireachtas be sure that in the best interests of the nation there will not be too much splintering in the years to come?  Would the Minister say if it was necessary to bring in legislation to give those lands to the various agencies, why would it not be necessary to do the same thing again, assuming that we place such great emphasis on an estate of this type?  We hope that the day will never arrive when the castle and its surrounding estates will be defaced in such a manner that it would be beyond recognition. Anybody who represents County Wexford would be far more <i>au fait</i> with small nitty-gritty problems but, from a national point of view, that is the only question I wonder about &mdash; if we have to go through both Houses of the Oireachtas to legislate for the divisions that are here on the map why do we not have to do the same thing for a similar amount of land?  Where do the wishes of the donor come into this? Can the Government of the day overrule those wishes without going through the <Col N="413" /> Oireachtas?  Otherwise.  I see nothing controversial about it.</P>
    <P>The land being taken away will obviously be put to great use.  Will the football club be purchasing the land or will it be leased?  What is the arrangement as far as they are concerned?  I assume that once the football club decide to take it over they will want it to be their property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an important Bill in the sense that an estate which was taken over by the State is now going back to the people of Wexford.  I know Johnstown Castle quite well because, as a young child in school, I walked out to it.  The walk around the castle was the highlight of a particular month in school.  It has been developed by the State for the purpose of research up to now.  It is one of the nicest walks in County Wexford or in any part of Ireland and, as Senator Connaughton said, he would not like to see that particular estate broken up for development if it meant that it was going to be lost to the nation.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Bill are to provide essential services to an area in County Wexford.  I hope that in future estates such as this estate which was donated to the nation will be used in the manner in which this estate is now developing, whereby local communities will get the use of particular portions of it, whether for road widening or for provision of football pitches, hurling pitches or whatever.  These are the essentials of life in a rural community.  Too often we have seen in the past thousands of acres, privately owned and built in penal times with big high walls around them, and if the landlord wanted to let you in you got in and if the landlord did not want to let you in you could not.  A lot of these big estates have now been taken over by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope that developments such as this will continue to be made, because it opens up the bigger estates to the people of Ireland.  I would hate to see the day when the Irish Government would take over from the landlords of the 19th, 18th or 16th centuries and prevent people from using the facilities and amenities <Col N="414" /> of these big estates, which are handed over to the State, generally for one reason only &mdash; that the owners cannot pay the rates.  They make a gift to the State and get plenty of publicity for doing that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have estates which are being taken over by the Board of Works and by the Department of Agriculture of up to 30,000 acres in certain areas.  I hope that these estates also could be used by the Irish people for purposes for which the Irish people want to use them and that the State does not become landlord in the old term landlord.  I hope that what is contained in the Bill will recommend itself to people in other areas and that other estates will be broken up in the manner in which this particular estate is being broken up, for the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Senator Lanigan said but not with his suggestion that people who donated this estate to the State in the forties did so to relieve themselves of rates liability.  I do not know whether that was the case but that certainly was the implication of his remark.  In fairness to people who donate gifts to the State, and particularly very valuable gifts such as Johnstown Castle Estate, we should be very careful about our reaction, however many decades later.  We should place firmly on the record of the House our gracious thanks to them for providing this facility.  Perhaps they were burdened by rates but they would certainly have realised more if they had sold the property if their sole <Col N="415" /> motive was a selfish one.  They should be thanked for that.  The nation has been the recipient of many gifts including land and other artefacts of historical and particularly important interest to this country.  I would not like if the Second Stage of the debate were to end with Senator Lanigan's remarks left hanging, as it were, in mid air.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the donor's consent and said that the Attorney General's advice was that this was necessary only in the case of the sale of land to the county council on the basis that apparently a housing development might involve some restriction on the reserved sporting rights.  Would the Minister detail precisely what the original was, whether it was a deed of transfer or whether it was contained in the Act?  I presume it was contained in the original Act, that it arose out of some instrument that transferred the property to the State.  Could the Minister detail what the restriction is?  Is it that there are reserved sporting rights and that the question of consent arises only for that reason or is it that there is some other form of restriction in the original instrument of transfer?  Is it the Attorney General's opinion that it would only be exercised or be sought in the case of sporting rights being interfered with?</P>
      <P>Senator Connaughton made the very important point that the Minister is apparently being given the right in the future to obtain leases of parts of the property himself.  I think I am correct in saying that.  If that is the case what restrictions will be on the Minister's disposing of parts of or loss from land he takes on lease subsequently?  The Minister's speech does not cover these points.  I would be grateful if he could deal with them in his reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to have clarified.  The Minister stated that requests had been made by various interests for portion of the estate and to accommodate these an amendment of the existing Act was contemplated as long ago as 1974.  That was six years ago.  Surely it did not take six years to finalise the transfer of the various <Col N="416" /> interests that existed.  I would like to know how it took six years to do that.  I have a reason for asking: there are houses on this land and five of them are occupied.  I would like to know the condition of those houses.  I am asking that also because of the length of time during which the tenants did not know whether they were owners or occupiers or whether they would be in the house within a year after 1974 or three years after 1974.  They must not be living in a happy state of mind because of the delay.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask that question because I have an interest in the people and in the proper housing of the people. I would like to know what will be done for the five occupiers of the houses if their houses are in a bad state and if that is so because of the long delay in taking them over.  Something should be done and they should get some type of grant or subsidy to develop those houses.  The families, if there are families, have grown older in those five or six years.  Naturally, in that type of situation, the husband would like to develop the house during the time the family were being educated and should be living in proper housing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I shall deal with the question of splintering of the estate and say that at this moment nothing else can be disposed of on the estate except for what is marked on the original map that we have, several acres around there.  As regards leasing any portion of the estate, we put that in because the Meteorological Office are looking for a site which they will need in a couple of years.  They have already indicated that.  That is why we included it in the map.  One of the conditions is that the Dáil must be notified at all times concerning leasings or sales of any portion of the estate.  It is written into the original Act that the donor or his heirs will always have to be notified, and he has made it very plain that he does not wish any more sales or leases of any portions of the estate to be made in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sale or lease of land to the football club, that question is totally a matter for the club and An Foras Talúntais to determine, whether they <Col N="417" /> want to lease it or buy it.  They said they might buy it.  It will no doubt be offered to them to purchase so that they can develop it according to their own ideas.</P>
    <P>The road widening is a matter for the county council.  The lands are essential for road widening for the by-pass of Wexford town.  With the development of Rosslare harbour the town of Wexford has been choked with traffic and it is essential to provide for road widening. One of the reasons for the delay was getting the county council to make up their minds how much ground they wanted.  Senator Butler spoke about delays since 1974.  It was because of all these things, and the road widening matter probably caused the longest delay. First, there was the question of getting the Attorney General to advise on proper procedure and it also took some time to get the donor's consent.  All this took time.  Since I went into the Department I speeded matters up, being a Wexford man myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I helped to have it speeded up somewhat.  Senator Lanigan mentioned the matter of developing this estate, but there is no question of such development or of it being thrown open holus-bolus, because it is protected under the previous Act.  With regard to Senator Molony's remark about Senator Lanigan accusing people of giving over these estates to the country so that they will not have to pay rates, I do not think he really meant it in that way.  The sporting rights are reserved by the donor and his heirs and that is why consent had to be got from the donor in this connection. That is written in the original Act.</P>
      <P>Concerning the houses, there are five of those occupied and they will be offered to the tenants who are in them.  I think there are about 13 houses altogether on the estate and they will be offered for sale either by public auction or by tender.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the answers the Minister gave to some of the questions I raised on Second Stage, but I am having some difficulty understanding exactly what the position is.  If I understood the Minister correctly, sporting rights were reserved by the donor originally.  The Minister also seemed to me to indicate that the donor's consent was otherwise required as well in some way or another.  For example, the Minister indicated that the donor said that sufficient parts of the estate have now been disposed of from the original.  I gathered <Col N="419" /> from that that there is some general restriction in the original instrument of transfer with regard to the State or An Foras Talúntais disposing of it.  I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate to us what precisely the restriction is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's advice was that because the sporting rights would be affected as a result of house building on the estate, he felt that it was necessary to get the consent of the donor.  Because of restrictions on the transfer, the sporting rights were held by the donor.  That consent was forthcoming.  For that reason only it was necessary to get the donor's consent &mdash; because the sporting rights were being affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there obviously was on the original transfer a reservation of sporting rights to the donor and his heirs, but is that the only restriction?  Was that the only restriction in the original deed of transfer?  If that is the case I can understand the Attorney General's opinion in those circumstances but I cannot understand, for example, how the original donor could now say that there should not be any further splintering or breaking up of the estate.  There seems to be something else behind this that I do not quite understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

If that is the only reason, why is it not <Col N="420" /> limited in terms of acreage or something? As I read that at the moment, the State could lease 900 of the 1,000 acres after the passing of this Bill and could then dispose of the land as it suited itself provided it reserved properly the sporting rights of the original owners and their successors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank the House for allowing this matter to be discussed and to thank the Minister for being here.  I must say at the outset I was not too sure which Minister would be here, whether he would be from Agriculture or the Environment.  By virtue of the fact that my neighbour is here it must, in fact, be the responsibility of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I put down this matter for the Adjournment because I and a number of my constituents are having tremendous difficulty in getting what I believe to be rightfully theirs by way of a grant for the boring of wells and the provision of water on farms. To clarify the situation to the House I will explain exactly what I am talking about.  It is basically a case where a farmer decides to supply water to his farm and to his house.  This is usually in an area where there is no group water scheme and he would have no alternative but to do this if he wanted to have running water both on his farm and in his house. Usually this is done by boring a well and it is an extremely expensive procedure most of the time.  The cost of divining, boring, lining the bore hole, the provision of an electric motor, the installation of ESB current and the building of the pump house could average well over £1,500 or £1,600 and, indeed, some of them would cost a lot more.  I do not have to point out to the House that this is a small fortune for any small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that this development is usually carried out in conjunction with a reconstruction job on the farmer's house which would include the provision of water and sewerage to the house.  This is a very costly business and we would be <Col N="422" /> talking in terms of £3,000 or £4,000 for this aspect of it.  For some unknown reason in the past &mdash; I am talking about the past year-and-a-half &mdash; the reconstruction grant on the house would be paid &mdash; needless to say, that was before the present Government decided to stop payment of reconstruction grants &mdash; but for some reason we could never get the grant for the provision of the well itself.  I might add that I have a list of people that I will be presenting to the Minister when this debate is over.  They are people who have been trying for a long, long time to get an answer from the Department.  Let us be fair to the Department of Agriculture. Those people have written generally to the Department of the Environment because we were told that it was common practice for the Department of the Environment to write what is known as a &ldquo;certificate of common cost&rdquo;.  This was a certificate which would show the exact costing of the various things that went on, for example, the boring of the hole and so on.  This costing would then be divided between the two Departments involved: the Department of the Environment was involved in the house grant and the reconstruction grant and the Department of Agriculture in the laying-on of water on to the farm and the farmyard.</P>
    <P>The people I have listed here, and I am sure there are several other people all over the country, never got a reply as such.  I took up the case for the people who asked me about it between one year and 18 months ago.  I have called personally, written and telephoned the Department of the Environment on numerous occasions only to be told (a) it would be done immediately; (b) on another occasion, that they had completed common cost certificates which had been sent over to the Department of Agriculture and that the delay was with that Department; (c) on another occasion, that it was a matter for the Department of Agriculture alone.  Later on, I was told by the Department of the Environment that the cases could not be dealt with there as there was an overflow of reconstruction grants and that they could not all be processed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I was told that it was decided <Col N="423" /> that everything would be handled in future by the Department of Agriculture. If that was not sufficient frustration for me in one day, I then contacted the Department of Agriculture and was informed that this was not so; they said they had some arrangement with the Department of the Environment but that Department had not sent anything to them for a long time.  As far as the Department of Agriculture were concerned they were not writing the certificates of common cost.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I was informed by the Department of Agriculture that some decision was about to be taken but they did not know what it was or when it would be taken.  It is as a result of that frustrating experience that I decided to bring the matter to the attention of the House this evening.  I have no idea how many people in the country are involved, but I have a substantial number.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am waiting, I am writing, I am calling and I am telephoning and there must be an answer somewhere. I am asking the Minister to answer three or four specific points for me: who is responsible in this case?  At whom do we direct the artillery?  When will the certificates of common cost be issued?  When will the people who are on my list here be paid their due grants?  If it is a thing that both Departments are involved, I want to know what type of liaison is there between them.  Can I take it that we will have no such delay in the future?  In fact there is one man over two years waiting for a grant without an answer.  To ensure that the fault did not lie with either my constituents or myself, I checked recently with the local farm development officers who would be carrying out an inspection; they informed me that as far as they were concerned they did not hear anything for one year to a year-and-a-half either. Obviously, there is a hold-up somewhere.  If the grants are not going to be paid, the Department responsible should come out and say so.  People contracted to do a certain job and there was a grant available for doing it and I believe in law they are entitled to receive it.  It is very <Col N="424" /> bad form on behalf of any Department or group &mdash; civil service or otherwise &mdash; to allow this to happen to any citizen in the State, be it either in agriculture or in anything else.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to clarify the position for me in this regard.  It would be true to say that it is not a big national issue but it is an issue on which when the Minister has finished speaking, we should have an answer to all the questions.  The most important question naturally is: when will my constituents be getting their grants?</P>

      <P>I am very sorry to hear that Senator Connaughton has so many problems with his applicants for agricultural grants.  I regret the frustration that he has been caused.  All I can say is that if he had approached me in the matter I could have given him all the answers and saved him the task of bringing it to the notice of the House.  The answers are quite simple and they could have all been sorted out over a cup of coffee.</P>
      <P>The position is that my Department is concerned with the provision of water supplies for agriculture and a grant is available under the Farm Modernisation Scheme for this purpose.  The grant includes the cost of piping from the takeoff point, plus the cost of any troughs that may be necessary on the land.  It also includes the cost of installing the supply where it is for the farm only.  Where the water supply is for both domestic and agricultural purposes, the grant is payable on that part of the cost of installation which is applicable to the farm supply. For some years, my Department had an arrangement with the Department of the Environment whereby the latter apportioned the cost of installation as between the domestic supply and the farm supply. This Department then paid a grant on that part of the common cost which was applicable to the farm supply.</P>

    <P>The arrangement, however, has not worked satisfactorily in certain areas and as a result some grants have been held up.  It has now been agreed with the Department of the Environment that <Col N="425" /> where a common supply is installed, the Department of Agriculture will in future estimate that part of the cost applicable to the farm supply and pay the grant accordingly.  This procedure is now in operation, and it is hoped that all outstanding grants in respect of farm water supplies will be paid shortly.</P>
    <P>If Senator Connaughton gives me particulars <Col N="426" /> of the cases which he has mentioned I will have them examined as a matter of urgency and will ensure that the grants will be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 10 December 1980.</P>
