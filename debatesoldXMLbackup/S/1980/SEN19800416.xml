      <P>This is the general section showing how it is proposed to deal with the exclusion of implied terms and conditions.  My initial remarks do not relate to exclusion clauses but relate to a problem that has been brought to my attention in relation to a very special class of hire purchase or leasing agreements. It has been drawn to my attention that aircraft leasing by Guinness Peat Aviation, which is a major Irish aircraft leasing company, and by Aer Lingus is always by way of an agreement which, on construction of the agreement, would fall within the definition of a hire purchase agreement and consequently <Col N="6" /> comes within the terms of this particular legislation.  There is a major difficulty involved in this because several of the obligations designed for ordinary hire purchase agreements would thereby have to be applied to this specialised type of lease.  For example, one of the conditions or one of the clauses that always exists in aircraft leases, presumably for some very good reason, is a clause that at the end of the period of the lease the hirer or the lessee can purchase the aircraft for a sum that is not stated; it is a negotiated sum at the end of the term.  Under this legislation there would be no obligation on the lessor, the leasing company, to specify the price one would pay for the aircraft at the end of the term of the leasing if one were to buy it out.  This has just been drawn to my attention.  They cannot unfortunately exclude them, because of the very effective way in which exclusion clauses are prohibited.  For that reason I would ask that the Minister consider this matter.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to put before the Minister the full details of the points that have been made to me.  They are technical and, of course, one can imagine that very many of the other conditions that apply in the ordinary hire purchase agreement, if they had to apply to a specialised aircraft leasing agreement like this one, could cause all sorts of difficulties.  For that reason I would ask that the matter be looked at. Perhaps on the basis of what I have said the Minister might be able to have some investigation carried out.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 32</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 32 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering whether there is any justification at all for limiting the operation of section 32 to circumstances where a hirer is dealing as a consumer.  We had a lot of discussion on earlier sections where we tried to make a hire purchase company or a finance company liable because they financed a deal.  In section 32, if I read it correctly, we want to ensure that the supplier of goods is liable even where the actual purchase arrangement was between the hire purchase company and the hirer or purchaser.  I know of many cases where hardship is being caused because of a supplier's ability to avoid liability under the Sale of Goods Act because he never sold the goods to the user of the goods and, secondly, he is not liable under the Hire Purchase Acts because he is not a party to the hire purchase agreement.</P>
      <P>Whether he acts as a consumer or whether he acts in the course of business, a person who is an actual supplier of goods, regardless of whether the goods are sold by way of direct sale or hire-purchase, should remain to be liable and should be liable as a full party to the agreement.  I ask the Minister whether he would consider removing the limitation in this section confining it to circumstances where a hirer deals as consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In drafting the Bill it was our intention to go only as far as we have gone in this section.  It is the first time that we have breached privity in this whole part.  However, if the Senator or the House feels strongly about it, I <Col N="8" /> will look at it and come back again on it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that over the earlier sections where the situation was reversed difficulties could arise. We talked about the rights of indemnity that a hire purchase or finance house should have, but in these circumstances we have a three-way situation.  Let us take, for example, the hire purchase of a piece of agricultural equipment such as a silage harvester.  I had a case recently where a silage harvester was sold by a very reputable supplier of such goods. The cost was £20,000 and a hire purchase company financed the deal. The machine went seriously amiss, a lot of troubles were caused and my client was stuck in the position where he could not sue the supplier on the basis of the Sale of Goods Act or on the basis of the Hire Purchase Act.  He could only sue the hire purchase company who actually arranged the transaction.  The supplier is the person who induces the deal, who pushes it, and who is responsible for the equipment and he should be made liable. It is those circumstances that are affected by section 32.  I would urge the Minister to consider amending that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us back to the whole basis that we had in mind in designing this Bill to protect the consumer. We did not think it was necessary to go as far as the Senator is now suggesting.  However, I have no objections to looking at it and I can assure him that I will look at it in a favourable light and will come back to him and to the House on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is there to protect the consumer but remember the Sale of Goods Act was available to everybody.  We are repealing most of it and if we are only going to re-introduce the rights that existed in it to protect the consumer we are certainly taking steps backwards.  In these circumstances there is a very strong case to be made for broadening it to all business deals.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 33 and 34 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 35.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 35 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is an attempt to try to define &ldquo;antecedent negotiations&rdquo; so as to bring section 32 into operation.  Section 32 will not apply for the consumer's benefit against the shopkeeper unless there are antecedent negotiations.  Then &ldquo;antecedent negotiations&rdquo; are defined by section 35 as meaning any negotiations or arrangements with the hirer whereby he was induced to make the agreement.  In subsection (2) it provides that these negotiations can also be conducted by the servant or agent of that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further paragraph in subsection (2) speaks of &ldquo;representations&rdquo; and attempts to define &ldquo;representations&rdquo;. Politicians know well what representations are but not in this context.  Is there going to be a very vague legal position created by this attempt to define &ldquo;antecedent negotiations&rdquo;?  Would the words not be better standing by themselves in section 32 where they have a plain meaning according to the English language and where they could only be interpreted without getting into the area of attempting to define them?  One of the conditions is that it was as a result of antecedent negotiations that the hirer was induced to make the agreement.  I do not know whether it stretches things to envisage a situation where a shopkeeper would argue that the antecedent negotiations or the representations made by a servant were not made to induce the customer to buy but were rather made by way of explanation and were not necessarily designed to induce the sale. Is the subjective evidence of the consumer that because of the representations of the shop assistant he was induced to buy sufficient then to constitute <Col N="10" />&ldquo;antecedent negotiations&rdquo; to the purpose of invoking section 32?  It is a difficult area and I can see the Minister's difficulty in trying to define it and reduce it to specific conditions.  I suggest it might be safer to omit section 35 and rely on the plain meaning of the words &ldquo;antecedent negotiations&rdquo; in section 32.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have is a situation where it would be the consumer who would be induced and not the dealer.  What we have set out here in section 35 is what we feel strongly is the best way to handle the particular end we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the Minister's motive and I do not quibble with it.  His motive is to make sure that the shopkeeper, as well as the hire purchase company, becomes liable to the consumer and he does that by saying that the shopkeeper if he conducts antecedent negotiations becomes liable; then the Minister attempts to define what antecedent negotiations can be. They mean negotiations whereby the customer was induced to make the agreement.</P>
      <P>The question then arises as to what happened in a particular transaction if the transaction in question was as a result of something said by an assistant making representations in accordance with the later part of the subsection, not intending to induce an agreement but merely to give information.  Whom does the court look to for discharging the proof of the words &ldquo;whereby he was induced&rdquo;? Does the court rely completely on the subjective statement of the customer that the shop assistant said this was a lovely washing machine when possibly he did not know or made a statement without permission, possibly in the course of employment?  Would that relieve the shopkeeper or would the shopkeeper be held if the consumer just said he was induced thereby?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The last suggestion is the correct definition of what is intended in the Bill.  Once the consumer feels he was induced, that is sufficient.</P>

      <P>Section 37 introduces a number of new implied terms in relation to the supply of services.  For the first time in legislation we are going to have implied terms in contracts for the sale of services.  The provision that the supplier will supply the service with due skill, care and diligence is probably already in existence in statute law as a result of the Moorecock case and it may be of a codifying nature, but a number of other cases have arisen down through the years since the Sale of Goods Act which have been ignored or overlooked in the implied terms proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Mr. Golding refers in his series of articles to the time honoured test of giving business efficacy to a contract.  The courts have always implied a term in all contracts that business efficacy was intended by the parties.  It would have been appropriate in this Part of the Bill, where we bring this area of law into our Statute Book for the first time and where we are codifying some existing case law, that this should have been introduced.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he would consider extending the provisions of section 37 that effectively imply these new terms to include terms that the court implies with regard to business efficacy in contracts for the supply of services?</P>

      <P>Regarding the effect of it, in a situation where the supplier of the service is somebody in a consultant capacity, possibly a consultant in the engineering field supplying services to a practitioner in that field, I take it that section 37 would apply to that consultant but that under section 38 it would be open to the parties to exclude section 37.</P>

      <P>On a point of consistency or inconsistency, we have gone to great ends in section 13 to control roadworthiness of cars where they are supplied by motor dealers or whatever. Was it considered that where somebody provides a service in relation to a car there should be a term implied that the car would be roadworthy thereafter?  If somebody overhauls an engine or does a major service job on the brakes of a car, or something like that, there should be a <Col N="15" /> term implied that the car would for some reasonable period thereafter be roadworthy.  We had no objection in section 13 to the implication of a condition. Our objection, the Minister will recall, was to the certificate and to the possible criminal liability.  To be consistent in relation to the supply of services there should be implied a term as to roadworthiness.  Was the matter considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication in section 37 is that the service would be provided with skill and care and that is as far as we thought we should go at this time.  We are not suggesting that this is the end of the road as far as the services sector is concerned.  What we are doing is taking a first tentative step along that road and there will be many changes in the future but we thought that at this particular stage we had gone far enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  We are not that dramatic in what we are doing. Much of the content of these terms has already been implied by the courts in case law.  This is partly codifying existing laws; it is partly innovative as well but when we extracted cars and motor dealers for particular attention in relation to the sale or the hire purchase of vehicles, why did we not do it in relation to the supply and service of vehicles? Frequently problems of this nature arise. I accept that there is an implied term that the supplier has the necessary skill to render this service.  That applies to every contract just as the implied terms for sale of goods or hire purchase apply to everything.  But in relation to the sale of goods and the hire purchase of goods motor dealers were taken out for very special consideration.  To be consistent motor dealers also supply a service in relation to vehicles and why not imply a condition of roadworthiness there?</P>

      <P>This is not agreed.  I have indicated my opposition to these sections in Part V.  I have read a little about the area of law we are concerned with.  I have already, on Second Stage, made the point which I think is the major and primary point to be made about this Part of the Bill and that is that here we are indulging in something from which our entire State structure and our entire Statute Book suffer and that is patchwork.  Unfortunately, it is the case that our law of misrepresentation badly needs updating.  To go about it in the piecemeal way of changing the law in relation to the sale of goods, supply of services and hire purchase transactions is to put off the work that we should be involved in right now and that is changing <Col N="18" /> the law of misrepresentation right across the board.  Even given that in some years time or decades time or whenever we get around to doing it we do change the law of misrepresentation, apart from the parts we propose to change now, we are going to end up in a situation where the law of misrepresentation as it relates to particular contracts such as the supply of goods, sales and services and hire purchase agreements would be contained in this Bill which does not refer to misrepresentation in its main Title.  It does in the title of this section but the law as it relates to contracts for the sale of land and other contracts will exist somewhere else.  I think that is bad practice.  It is something to be avoided and it is something that could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>It is difficult sometimes to sit back and research law so as to introduce amending legislation that will cover an entire field but we have borrowed verbatim from English statute what they have done and we have applied it solely in these areas.  Instead, if we wanted to do it we should have taken the entire English Act and re-introduced it here and at least we would have changed the law of misrepresentation as it applies to all contracts and not just the limited type of contracts we are dealing with here.  I know the Minister has views on this.  He mentioned them on Second Stage.  I know his view is simply this is what we are doing, how we are going about it.  I accept his position but I think it is indefensible, unnecessary and something we will regret.  It is something that keeps on happening over almost everything that we go about doing.  We have it in relation to family law; we have it in relation to children and the law; we have it in relation to the sale of goods and in relation to company law.  Everywhere we go there are bits of law here and bits of law there.  We are losing an opportunity to put the law of misrepresentation and contract in one single basket.  We should have done it without effort.  All we had to do was copy more sections from the English Act than we have done for this Bill.  That is the first point I want to make in my opposition to these sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> The second point I want to make is that in borrowing, or taking, or copying as we did from the English statute, we managed to look at what they did in 1967 in their own Act but we did not look at one iota of experience they had had of that statute since then.  Since that statute was passed in England in 1967, several flaws have appeared in it.  They are not flaws that I am mentioning as a lawyer, ones that occur to me, case examples that I know of; they are flaws that have been considered by academics. They are flaws that have been considered by practitioners.  They have been written about and spoken of.  We have completely overlooked that in relation to almost every single section.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 41, misrepresentation arises.  We do not define what misrepresentation is.  That has been seen to be a flaw in the English Act.  In relation to the next section, the same problem arises in relation to the definition of misrepresentation. Problems arise as to how damages are to be assessed.  Problems arise as to what is to be a misrepresentation, whether silence constitutes misrepresentation. We have not just taken the original English decent version but the original English bad version as well and we have failed to benefit at all from their experience.</P>
    <P>What I want to do, if I may, is read into the records of this House an extract from <i>Cheshire and Fifoot</i> which is a very excellent book on the law of contract. It is a standard work and perhaps the points raised could be considered. I ask that in relation to amendments of these sections, but I ask the Minister to bear in mind that I would prefer that this be taken from this Bill altogether and put in another one which we could pass here on the very same day as this Bill is being passed, because we would have no further questions arising on it, and let it affect our entire law of misrepresentation across the board.</P>
    <P>In any event, I am quoting from <i>Cheshire and Fifoot, The Law of Contracts</i>, the 9th edition which was published in 1976; that is just six years <Col N="20" /> after the passage of the 1967 English Act.  The quotation is from page 276.  It is headed &ldquo;Review of Effects of Misrepresentation Act 1967.&rdquo; I want to say that for the convenience of the Members of the House his reference in the articles in the book from which I quote, sections 1, 2 and 3, may be read as sections 41, 42 and 43 as they apply to our Bill, and I will refer to them&mdash;if I remember&mdash;as sections 41, 42 and 43 as I go along.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It begins:</P>
      <P>Our discussion has involved very frequent references to the Misrepresentation Act 1967 but perhaps it is worthwhile now to attempt to look at the Act as a whole. Although there can be little doubt that the general effect of the Act will be to improve the lot of representees as a class, this has been achieved at the cost of making an already complex branch of the law still more complicated. At least three factors have contributed to this.  The first was the general policy decision to proceed by a limited number of statutory amendments to the common law.  This means that the Act can only be understood if the previous law has been mastered and since the previous law has been mastered and since the previous law was often far from clear the Act has been erected on an uncertain base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> Secondly, the Act was based on the view of the common law taken by the Law Reform Committee in 1962 which was overtaken by the decision in <i>Hedley, Byrne and Co. Ltd. versus Heller &amp; Partners.</i>  This has meant the creation of two different kinds of negligent misrepresentation with different rules and an uncertain relationship.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, these defects in approach were compounded by drafting which is frequently obscure and sometimes defective.</P>
    <P>An important example of the type of problem created by the Act is the meaning of the phrases &ldquo;after a misrepresentation has been made to him&rdquo; (which occurs three times in sections 41, 42 and 43) and &ldquo;any misrepresentation made by him&rdquo; (which occurs in section 43).  The Act does not define &ldquo;misrepresentation&rdquo; and the question has been raised whether these words are apt to extend to situations where the law imposes a duty of disclosure. It would seem reasonably clear that the Act extends to those cases where silence is treated as assertive conduct, as where it distorts a positive assertion made by the representor or where the representor fails to reveal that an earlier statement made by him is no longer true.  It is much more debatable whether the word &ldquo;misrepresentation&rdquo; is wide enough to cover cases of nondisclosure <i>stricto sensu</i>, such as contracts <i>uberrimae fidei</i>, but even here, it might be argued that failure to disclose the existence of a material fact is equivalent to affirmation of its nonexistence. Similar difficulties may arise from the failure to define the meaning of &ldquo;rescission&rdquo; in the Act.</P>
    <P>We have already dealt at length with the effects of section 41 and 42 of the Act.  Both are concerned to improve the representee's remedies for misrepresentation, section 41 by removing possible limits to the right of rescission and section 42 by widening the possibility of obtaining damages.</P>
    <P>I may stop there for a moment and sum up the basic points that are involved. <Col N="22" /> The failure to define misrepresentation leaves a great doubt as to what will or will not constitute a misrepresentation. That has already caused difficulty.  The whole law of misrepresentation is riddled with difficulties and uncertainties at the moment, and the failure in the English Act to define misrepresentation has now been found to have been a major flaw.  The same problem arises in relation to failure to define what is meant by rescission.  I would again like to refer to the view of the authors of that book that the piecemeal amendment of the common law was something that was most undesirable.  We are going a lot further than that.  They were amending all their misrepresentation law and even at that it was found to be inadequate because they did not codify existing law because they did not clarify a lot of points that were unclear at common law and as a result of case law. Here, now, we are going further than that.  We are not just being piecemeal in the sense that we are confining ourselves to the ambit of the English Act; we are confining it just to two or three types of contracts, namely contracts for the sale of goods, the supply of goods and hire purchase.</P>
    <P>The second major point that I want to make and to quote again from <i>Cheshire and Fifoot</i> in relation to this part of the Bill relates to the exemption clauses and perhaps it would be more appropriate if I left it until we have reached section 44.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Senator Molony has made a very good case for not attempting to codify the law of misrepresentation across the board as he suggested.  He has told us the difficulties which arose when an attempt in that direction was made in another jurisdiction and the trouble they ran into. It seems, if anything, that a great deal of his argument seems to be to the point that it might be better to do this in each area as it arises because of the difficulty of introducing an Act that would cover all forms of misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could agree at all with what Senator Ryan <Col N="23" /> said.  If you take the basic point of misrepresentation what constitutes a misrepresentation? I do not think the fact that this is limited just to three types of contracts solves that problem in any way and perhaps if misrepresentation were defined and we knew exactly what we were talking about it would be easier. It may be easier, in other words, to define misrepresentaton in relation to these particular types of contracts but we do not do that.

It may be easier in other words, to define misrepresentation in relation to these particular types of contracts but we do not do that.  Now, if we did that, we might overcome that difficulty.  But I, would ask Senator Ryan to consider my general point.  Misrepresentation is a matter of contract law and it is a major section of contract law and it seems to me to be better, if we are going to tinker with that in our statutes at all that we should do it in one statue.  Perhaps within that statute we could divide it into various areas.  I do not know whether that would be the best approach.  I am sorry to see that it is in the Act at all.  I would take Senator Ryan's point if we were to define what we meant by misrepresentation.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to Senator Molony and to any other Senators who have not expressed views but might have some doubts on this particular <i>rationale</i> for dealing with misrepresentation in this way, that sections 40 to 43 tidy up the law of misrepresentation in relation to the matters that are germane to the Bill and represent important improvements in the position in these areas whether one is a consumer or acting in the course of a business. Further, while it might be desirable to revise all the legal aspects of misrepresentation, it would be far outside the ambit of this Bill and, in particular, <Col N="24" /> of my Department.  I believe that we would be failing to serve the public interest if the important area of misrepresentation was set aside in our deliberations on the revision of the statutory position of the law of contract.</P>
      <P>With regard to allegations that a problem will be created by the lack of a definition of misrepresentation and&mdash;if I could anticipate&mdash;of &ldquo;rescission&rdquo;, following some legal advice on this question which I requested I do not envisage significant difficulties arising from the failure to define misrepresentation or rescission in Part IV and both these terms will retain their common law meaning.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked whether the words &ldquo;after misrepresentation has been made to him &ldquo;and&rdquo; misrepresentation made by him&rdquo; which occur in Part V are apt to extend to situations where the law imposes duty of disclosure.  I am satisfied that they are apt to extend to such situations and the absence of a definition of misrepresentation should not create any problem in this regard.</P>
      <P>The general common law rule is that mere silence is not misrepresentation. Silence will constitute misrepresentation in these cases.  One of these cases is where the contract requires <i>uberrima fides</i>, one party must make full disclosure of all material facts known to him.  An example would be contracts of insurance.  The fact that a party remained silent and did not make full disclosure in such a contract would mean that a misrepresentation had been made for the purpose of Part V of the Bill.  He would therefore be caught thereunder.</P>
      <P>My advisers are familiar with <i>Cheshire and Fifoot.</i>  The other main source, <i>Anson's Law of Contract</i>, while commenting critically on some parts of the 1967 Act nevertheless does not overall take the same view as <i>Cheshire and Fifoot.</i>  Indeed it answers the points made by <i>Cheshire and Fifoot.</i></P>

      <P>These text books that we are talking about are of necessity English.  Most standard works on common <Col N="25" /> law are English; certainly it is the case in relation to this contract law. Some of our own very learned university professors and academics seem to subscribe to <i>Cheshire and Fifoot's</i> arguments. <i>Mr. Golding</i> whose series of articles we referred to on several occasions in the course of the debate on this Bill certainly takes that view.  In those circumstances I would ask, with every respect to the Minister's own legal advisers, that the matter be reviewed again. The comment on the English Misrepresentation Act has been so&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;unfavourable and because of problems it had created, we should consider very carefully before we jump into the same boat.</P>

It is imperfect but it is not fair of the Minister to suggest that that Act of that size could not be managed in so far as all our contract law is concerned. It should have been considered. However I will take the Minister's point and will not say any more about it but when we are going about changing the law, we have made the mistakes that have been made across the water and we made no effort to deal with them at all, good, bad or indifferent.  It is a bad mistake and we should be able to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to read my legal advice on this matter.  It is to the effect that under section 42 (1) the measure of damages for negligent misrepresentation including remoteness of damages is the same as that in the tort of negligence and in consequence will be governed by the out-of-pocket rule.  This means that the injured party will be entitled to an amount which serves to put him into the position in which he would have been had the representation never been made.  He would not be entitled, as he would be on breach of the contract, to recover the loss of bargain, that is to say, an amount that served to put him into the position in which he would have been had the representation been true. On the other hand, he can recover in respect of consequential damages such as injury to his personal property.  The measure of damages to be awarded under <Col N="27" /> section 42 (2) would be the loss suffered by the representee as a result of refusal to allow rescission of the contract. This, in a contract of sale of goods, for example, would be the purchase price of the goods less their value at the date of trial of the action.  It is pertinent to stress that damages under the subsection are given in lieu of rescission. In the case of innocent misrepresentation therefore, Part V does not disturb the rule that financial relief of consequential loss should be limited to an indemnity.</P>
      <P>In assessing damages under section 42 (2) therefore, the guiding rule would be the procedure as nearly as may be to secure the same effect as could be obtained by rescission plus indemnity and not to recoup consequential loss which would fall outside the limited relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed but I want to make some general points.  This is the section that deals with exclusion clauses. Rather than pretend that any of these points is originally my own I will, if I may, resume my quotation from <i>Cheshire and Fifoot</i> on the subject.  I have not looked at Anson in the meantime but I think in relation to this section that even <i>Anson</i> would have some words of caution to offer.</P>
      <P>First of all, it should be said that section 43 of this Bill is the very same as section 3 of the English Misrepresentation Act.  There is no need for me to go through the section itself.  <i>Cheshire and Fifoot</i>, page 278 of the same edition I quoted from earlier, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section again goes beyond the Law Reform Committee's recommendations which would simply have barred the exclusion of liability for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. The section does not go well with the rules relating to clauses excluding liability for breach of contractual terms since, as we have seen, there is no general power in the court to strike down such clauses.  It seems probable that in the fullness of time there may be legislation to deal with such clauses but meanwhile the position is inelegant and indeed irrational. Even worse, this approach has aroused doubts as to what in fact the law is.  Thus it may be argued that section 3 invalidates <i>in toto</i> a clause which purports to exclude liability for both misrepresentation and breach of a contractual term.  Furthermore it is often arguable whether a statement is properly classified as a term or a representation and, as we have seen, there is no clear decision as to whether it is open to a plaintiff to treat a contractual term as a representation. If this is permissible, a plaintiff <Col N="29" /> may by formulating his claim in misrepresentation, deprive of effect a clause which would have excluded liability for breach of contract.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take particular note of the next paragraph:</P>
    <P>If there should be legislation dealing with the general problem of exemption clauses, section 43 offers a model to be avoided. although it is clearly aimed both at clauses which exclude liability and at those which restrict remedies, it contains no definition of its ambit in either area.  Yet it is well known that the line between clauses excluding and defining liability is very fine and such common commercial occurrences as non-cancellation or arbitration clauses would seem to fall within the literal scope of (b).  These difficulties are well illustrated by <i>Overbrooke Estates, Ltd. v. Glencombe Property, Ltd.</i></P>
    <P>In that case the plaintiffs instructed auctioneers to sell a property, the particulars of sales stated that &ldquo;neither the auctioneers nor any person in the employment of the auctioneers has any authority to make or give any representation or warranty.&rdquo;  The defendants, who were the highest bidders at the auction, alleged that three days before the auction, they had asked the auctioneers questions about the development plans of the local authorities, to which they had received inaccurate answers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Brightman, J.</i>, held that even if the defendants could prove these allegations, they would constitute no defence.  It was clear that the defendants had the particulars of sale and therefore knew or ought to have known that nothing told them by the auctioneers could bind the plaintiffs. Section 43 of the Misrepresentation Act was irrelevant since the provision in the particlars of sale did not constitute an exemption clause, but was a limitation on the apparent authority of the auctioneers.  This decision appears impeccable but one may suspect that if the draftsman had foreseen it, he would have proceeded differently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Perhaps the most serious criticism should be directed however at the very wide discretion which is conferred on the judge since no guidance is given on its exercise.  It may often be difficult for the court to decide whether a particular clause is reasonable since this may depend on evidence relating to the public interest which will not have been given.</P>
    <P>That is what <i>Cheshire and Fifoot</i> has to say about the exemption clause, or section 43.  If a model were to be chosen to deal with it, this certainly was not the one to pick.  The case I quoted from is ample evidence of the difficulties that can be caused by the section.  There is the point of whether something said is a term or is a representation.  The other point is the distinction of whether the purpose of an exemption clause is to exclude liability or to define the remedy that is available.  For example, a very common type of clause that we see in business contracts nowadays is a clause that provides for arbitration in the event of a dispute arising out of the contract. That clause which provides for arbitration restricts a party to the contract in their remedies.  But it can be made as an exclusion clause because it does restrict the rights of the person who wants to move afterwards whether through arbitration or in court.  This section does nothing to assist one in deciding whether an arbitration clause is an exemption clause.  It can be read as an exemption clause.  That problem has arisen in England and they have not been able to deal with it and we are losing the opportunity to deal with it here.  It seems to me that, in relation to arbitration clauses, arbitration clauses should be allowed to stand but because of the uncertainty I believe that if a lawyer were advising a client on a commercial contract that might raise problems in this area, he should advise a person to leave out any reference to arbitration.  Arbitration is a very good idea in terms of efficiency of dispute resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole section was looked at by the UK authorities in the <Col N="31" /> light of their experience of the Act and I agree with the point made by Senator FitzGerald on Second Stage that with their vast experience and their vast case law and very detailed and complicated law that we should, as far as possible, follow their example.  I see nothing improper about that and in fact, I am totally in favour of that principle.  The only change that was made in this section in the UK legislation following the 1967 Misrpresentation Act was that portion included in the Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977 in which section 8 amended section 3 of the 1967 Act by the substitution of &ldquo;contract&rdquo; for &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;term&rdquo; for &ldquo;provision&rdquo;.  Also, it improved the criteria for determining reasonableness.  We have already done that.  However, the Senator feels strongly about this matter.  I am not sure how the remainder of the Members of the House feel about it.  I would remind the Senator with regard to his source of <i>Cheshire and Fifoot</i>, that my counter arguments have been put up by counsel.</P>

If I have an opportunity between now and Report Stage I will look at this matter, which was the whole object of the type of examination laid down by my predecessor.  I would again bring the Senator and the House back to the point that this is a non-controversial piece of legislation and that we are very anxious as a Government to see that when it leaves this House it will be as near perfect as we can get it.  I am prepared to look again at this point made by the Senator and refer to it on Report Stage.

      <P>I make the general point I made on the section with regard to the supply of spare parts.  The Minister may feel at the moment that there is no necessity for him to stipulate regulations as to the use of the standard form of contract but what he is doing here is merely taking power to introduce later, by order, regulations in relation to standard forms of contract.  It may not be as widespread a problem in relation to sale of goods as it is to supply of services.  I do not see why the Minister should not take the parcel.  If a problem does arise in future, he is not going to introduce an Act of Parliament to give himself the power. We are great at providing for delegated legislation, but not so much in areas where we should provide for Ministerial power.  I welcome this type of provision. It should apply to all types of contracts that we are concerned with here.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 50 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings me back to section 13.  Section 50 provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order prohibit ....any seller of such goods or supplier of such services in the course of a business from making use of any printed contract, guarantee or other specified class of document unless it is printed in type of at least such size as the order prescribes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had great talk on section 13 whereby the contents of this new certificate will be governed by a creature called &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; that does not have to <Col N="36" /> come before the House.  The reason given when I queried the matter was that this was a technical matter which need not be of concern to Senators.  Here we have in section 50 an order that must come before the House in relation to the size of print of standard forms of contracts. There may be a specific reason why it was being provided in section 50 that it was to be established by way of order rather than by way of regulation. It seems to be a matter eminently suited to be dealt with by way of regulation. Under section 13 in relation to an extremely controversial type of certificate, regulations are in order.  It would certainly be controversial that the matter should be introduced by way of order rather than by regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely asking the Minister to be consistent in his argument. This is a flip of the coin, whether the print be the size of a penny, the size of a half crown or the size of a farthing. In the areas in relation to the sale or the supply of services, barristers' opinions will have to be sought as to the type to be used.  That is something that could be dealt with by way of regulation.  If there is no good reason why section 13 should provide for regulations, I would ask the Minister to reconsider section 13 and get rid of the regulations there and provide for an order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us an idea of which contract is likely to be required to be in writing?  The law with regard to the necessity for being in writing at the moment is very confused and has been confused for hundreds of years.  One would have hoped that in this sophisticated age of literacy, we would have been able to move away from these written requirements in so many of our contracts but the Minister is proposing to make confusion more confused by taking power to add further categories of contracts to those that have to be in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The section enables the Minister by order to provide, in relation to goods or services of a class specified in the order, that a contract for the sale of any such goods or supply of any such services shall be in writing.  Any contract in any such classes not in writing shall be insupportable.  The effect of this section will be to extend section 4 to the sale of goods in so far as a written note or memorandum, signed by the buyer, will become a prerequisite for the enforcement of a contract of the type covered by an order under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that question, the area is confused, but it has also been in existence a long time and is a very important area because very many contracts are made by word of mouth only.  Indeed, apart from writing, there are other forms of permanency that could be induced into contracts&mdash;for example, the spoken word on a dictaphone belt.  This provides for a written contract. Is there any provision that we could include in this to provide that people be given ample notice of it?  After all, the <Col N="38" /> Minister could, by order, introduce stipulations in relation to the sale of cars&mdash;the sale of cars again being a bad example because of the certificate&mdash;but the sale of anything, for instance, a type of machinery or television set, that all contracts should be in writing?  Consumers will be denied all sorts of rights if, in fact, they do not ensure that their contract is in writing.  It is a major step and particular effort would have to be made to advertise the change very widely. Maybe it is not appropriate to do it in this section but a word of caution should be offered in relation to a section which gives the Minister such power as this one.</P>

      <P>What we have here is a section designed to cater for the area of mass produced goods of a homogeneous nature, for example television sets, motor cycles, where the possibility of the consumer being misled as to his rights at the time of the sale is what counts.  It is envisaged that the provisions of this section will be used to suppress the use of prejudicial clauses, exclusion clauses which, while they no longer have legal effect, may be used by unscrupulous sellers. The fact that exclusion clauses are now being prohibited where a buyer deals as a consumer under section 22 of the Bill will not, of its nature, prevent such sellers from verbally misleading the consumer as regards his rights at the time of sale by reference to exclusion clauses and some provision is, therefore, necessary to tackle sellers who persist in forms of misinformation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>But if it is not in writing?  Take the example that the Minister has mentioned, televisions.  If the Minister introduces an order, all he has power to do under this section is to provide that such contracts should be in writing; he is not given any particular power under this section to stipulate what should be in the contract.</P>

      <P>Right.  The Minister then introduces an order, say a week after this Bill has been passed and becomes law, that all contracts henceforth for the sale of television sets shall be in writing. Now, Seán Consumer from Bally-jamesduff goes into his local television dealer and buys a television set.  There is no contract in writing.  He comes home, switches on the television and it is not working, or six months later it is not working.  According to the law, the contract is unenforceable.  There cannot be implied terms in an unenforceable contract, so he is left in a position that he has no rights, good, bad or indifferent. He does not even have a contract to sue under.</P>

      <P>Taking the example that the Minister mentioned, television sets, I do not really know what is at the back of the Minister's mind but I imagine that the Minister can do only one thing under this section and that is to provide that a contract for the purchase or sale of television sets shall be in writing.  If it is <Col N="40" /> not in writing, the contract is unenforceable and the consumer has no right whatsoever, not even implied rights, under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Money is not the only difficulty involved in this.  The only circumstances in which one almost always has written contracts are where a contract is contingent, or where payments are by instalment, or something like that. Most people go into a shop, purchase the goods and get the goods and pay their money.  That is it.  There is no reason for a written contract between the parties.  The parties are not thinking in terms of a written contract.  They may be thinking in terms of guarantees, but not in terms of written contracts.  If the Minister introduces an order providing for a written contract in relation to the sale of television sets and a written contract is not produced, the trouble is that the last thing on a consumer's mind will be a written contract.  He gets no contract. If anything goes wrong from his point of view afterwards, he would seem to have no rights at all.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes to report on Treatment and Care Persons suffering from Mental Disorder who appear before the Courts on Criminal Charge published in January 1980, and came for the immediate introduction of the Criminal Justice (Mental Illness) Bill annexed thereto.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity here in the Seanad to consider the recommendations of this report, and the urge the immediate introduction of the Criminal Justice (Mental Illness) Bill which is appended to it.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State in the House and look forward to his comments on the report and on the draft Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a specific but complex are concerning the treatment of people which have some mental illness or handicape and who come before the criminal court because they are charged with criminal offences.  It is one of the dark areas of the law which has been neglected for far <Col N="43" /> too long.  It is an area in which there are few votes.  The people concerned are not articulate, are not able to speak out for their own rights and needs, and there is no strong lobby or no great pressure for reform.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was Reid Professor of Criminal Law in Trinity College I lectured as part of the course on the rights and remedies of persons suffering from mental illness or handicap coming before the criminal courts.  I was ashamed at the lack of reform down the years in the Irish court jurisdiction and procedure in this area and the absence of a humane and decent approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>The reality was then, and still is, that a number of unfortunate people who come before the criminal courts and are not responsible for their actions are, nevertheless, treated as criminals and processed as criminals.  In some cases a defence of insanity may be raised in relation to an indictable offence, and a verdict of not guilty because of insanity, sometimes miscalled guilty but insane, is given so that the person is detained indefinitely at the pleasure of the courts. Even when the defence of insanity has been raised, the whole approach and treatment are not satisfactory and require substantial amendment.</P>
    <P>The first major reform needed&mdash;and it is basic to this report and to the draft Bill&mdash; is to transfer a substantial part of the jurisdiction in this area from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health, and to give the Minister for Health a major role in relation to regulations, treatment and care of persons suffering from mental illness who come before the criminal courts.</P>
    <P>This is a report of a committee entitled the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons and they have issued two previous interim reports in related areas.  The Committee is chaired by Mr. Justice Séamus Henchy of the Supreme Court and includes in its membership some very distinguished psychiatrists, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish member of <Col N="44" /> the Commission on Human Rights and senior officials from various Departments such as the Departments of Health, Justice, Labour and Education. The text of the report under discussion is concise and well reasoned and, as one Senator said to me downstairs, happily brief enough to be read and absorbed for the purposes of a discussion and debate of this sort.  Not only is the report concise and to the point, but the committee have done a very considerable amount of homework.  They have drafted not just the heads of the Bill, which is sometimes done by a committee who want to see particular legislation introduced, but they have annexed a full draft text of a proposed Criminal Justice (Mental Illness) Bill so that it could be introduced very rapidly if there were the political will to do it.  There might be one or two minor amendments or adjustments but the Bill is relatively ready to be tabled.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be broad agreement on both sides of the House today as to the importance and urgency of reform in this area.  Although the report was published and circulated to Deputies and Senators only in January, I understand it was submitted to the Government about two years ago so I look forward to the response of the Minister in his contribution. I would hope that there has been adequate time for the Minister to consider both the problem identified in the report and the approach recommended by this very prestigious committee and that he will be in a position to give us a very specific indication of whether the Government accept the proposals and if so when they would intend to introduce the necessary Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the problems identified by the committee which are well summarised in the paragraphs of the report.  The committee point to the lack of proper and adequate jurisdiction in the existing criminal courts and lack of any jurisdiction at all in the District Court to assess the fitness or unfitness of a person to go on trial as an accused.  I would like to turn to the way in which it is summarised in paragraph 4 of the report because this <Col N="45" /> shows the present state of the law and I do not think any of us can be happy about that.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 states:</P>
    <P>As the law stands, for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence on a charge of having committed a crime, judges and juries are debarred from taking into account mental illness or personality disorder unless it is sufficiently serious to amount to insanity as that term is understood in the criminal law.  For the test of insanity, see the judgment of the Supreme Court in Doyle v. Wicklow Co. Co. (1974) I.R. 55.  Mental illness or personality disorder, as a general rule, is taken into account only for sentencing purposes, and even then it rarely becomes a factor in the judicial process unless it is raised by the defence.  In the result, many persons are dealt with by the courts as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; offenders who are either not responsible (or not fully responsible) for the conduct charged against them or who, even if fully responsible for such conduct, are in need of psychiatric or other special treatment. The inability, or the restricted ability, of the courts to order that convicted persons receive appropriate psychiatric treatment is a grave defect in the present state of the criminal law. For example, the courts have no jurisdiction to order that a convicted person be sent direct to a psychiatric institution for treatment; they can but annex to a sentence of detention a recommendation for psychiatric treatment. The Committee is satisfied that a not inconsiderable number of persons, either before or after conviction, pass unnecessarily and undesirably into prisons or kindred places of detention.  Because such places are of their nature not usually conducive to successful psychiatric therapy, the position is not remedied by court orders providing that prisoners be given suitable psychiatric treatment.  The Committee is of the opinion that an appreciable number of accused persons who are in need of <Col N="46" /> either in-patient or out-patient psychiatric treatment are dealt with by the courts without due regard to the need for such treatment.</P>
    <P>The language is concise, perhaps rather dry, but the criticism comes forward very clearly.  There are people being treated as criminals before our courts who ought to be patients.  There are people being sent to prison who ought to be given psychiatric care, treatment and attention and that is the basic nature of the problem which this report highlights and it makes clear and specific recommendations as to what should be done.</P>
    <P>A major purpose of the draft Bill attached is to ensure that where any court &mdash;including for the first time the District Court&mdash;has reason to believe that an accused person may be suffering from mental disorder the court will be empowered at the earliest possible opportunity to have the situation medically investigated and then, on the basis of a medical report, to make the appropriate order on that basis.  That is a key provision of the Bill.  It is part of the whole framework of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the committee propose a test of insanity which they incorporate in the draft Bill and this is set out in paragraph 7 of the report.  They refer to the legal criterion for assessing insanity and they recommend a tripartite test:</P>
    <P>(i) did the accused commit the act or commission charged?  (ii) if so, was he suffering at the time from mental disorder (as defined)?  and (iii) if so, was it such that he should not be found guilty of the offence?  This test, which has not the detail or particularity of some of the other formulations, has the merit of concentrating the decision on whether, having regard to the nature and effect of the particular mental disorder, the accused should in the circumstances be held to be outside the range of legal responsibility.</P>
    <P>The test as defined is structured in order to identify that vital question.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill gives wide powers to the courts enabling them to refer, at a <Col N="47" /> very preliminary stage, or commit a person in need of treatment to a designated centre.  These centres are part of the framework envisaged in the Bill for the treatment of persons who need special care and in-patient treatment.  I will refer later to the very strong points they make about out-patient non-institutional care and treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health under the Bill would have jurisdiction to designate psychiatric centres and these are defined in the Bill as a hospital or other institution in which treatment is provided for patients suffering from mental disorder. It is provided that these centres can be either public designated centres or private designated centres, public if they are in the ownership or care of the health boards and private if they are private institutions. There is a provision in the Bill that the Minister would not designate a private institution without the prior consent of that institution.</P>
    <P>Another very important recommendation of this report and provision of the Bill is that the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is governed by a statute placing it in the context of a criminal institution should be brought under the Health Act of 1970.  There have been many improvements effected there but basically it is still a criminal lunatic asylum which has improved a bit in practice.  What the Bill recommends is that the Central Mental Hospital be brought under the Health Act of 1970, be brought within the range of institutions which come under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Health and become a designated centre among other designated centres for the care and treatment of people who, on the basis of the medical assessment and orders, are sent to these centres.  This is extremely valuable.  One of the problems with the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is that it has an aura of an institution where people are sent if they are criminally insane.  If there are various designated centres, then there are lots of advantages.  People can be sent to a designated centre near where they live, <Col N="48" /> in Letterkenny, or in Clonmel, or wherever it may be.  They are the better able to come out into the community, out to their families, to have out-patient care wherever possible and also it breaks down this stigma, aura or barrier of having just one central institution for the care of people in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another important technical recommendation of the Bill is for the introduction of the defence of diminished responsibility in cases of charges of treason, though I suppose that is almost out of date now&mdash;we very rarely have charges of treason&mdash;but also on charges of either capital murder, which still carries the death penalty here, and murder.  This defence of diminished responsibility has been recognised in other jurisdictions.  It has, for example, existed in the UK since 1957 and it would mean that a person would effectively be treated on a charge of manslaughter rather than for capital murder or murder.  There would be a greater possibility of a discretionary sentencing afterwards and not the mandatory life sentence or, worse still, the potential capital sentence for capital murder.</P>
    <P>The report deals with probably the most difficult area of all and that is the need for a recognition of a special category of persons.  These are the aggressive psychopaths, the really difficult cases, and the report recommends the need for a special unit.  In paragraph 12 of the report they say it would be necessary to identify persons suffering from a persistent disorder or disability of personality which manifests itself in abnormally violent or aggressive conduct and they make it clear that a designated centre under the Bill would not be a suitable place for the few extremely difficult cases where a special unit would be required.  They suggest that this should be under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Another very important and basic recommendation of this report which is also contained in the draft Bill is the provision for a mental care review body. This is governed by paragraph 14 of the report of the committee.  It proposes the <Col N="49" /> establishment of a permanent body to be known as the Mental Care Review Body.  Paragraph 14 sets out who they consider should be the members of it, a chairman and deputy chairman appointed by the Minister for Health, a member or substitute member appointed by the Minister for Health, a member or substitute member appointed by the Minister for Justice and two members appointed by the Minister for Health from a panel of five psychiatrists nominated by the executive council of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (Irish Division).</P>
    <P>The powers and responsibility of that mental care review body are most important. A person detained in a designated centre or in a special unit would have a right to apply to the review body for review of his detention and this right could be exercised at specified intervals. It would not be just a review perhaps at the beginning of people being sent there but at regular intervals.  The review body would know of every case of a person sent to a designated centre and would have a role of scrutinising and of monitoring the position of such. people and would be able to get regular appeals for assessment of their position from the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>This seems to me an extremely important recommendation.  It is the kind of review body we ought to have in our general prison system.  We ought to have a parole board so that when a prisoner is sent to prison for a seven or nine year sentence the board can assess the individual and can see whether in the interests of rehabilitation, and because it would benefit the person, it would be possible to make a recommendation for a review of the original sentence and for consideration of the individual factors in each case.  I have never yet met a judge who was happy with the sentencing system and they carry out a responsibility in that area.  We ought to have a general parole board but in particular this Mental Care Review Body is a very important institution, a very important aspect of the Bill which I would strongly support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> The committee make it clear in their report, and this is spelt out in paragraph 15, that they are very much in favour of out-patient, non-institutional care, wherever possible.  Having specified various centres and designated them the committee are concerned to emphasise that this does not mean they are recommending that institutional care in a designated centre is necessarily the right approach.  In paragraph 15 of the report the committee say:</P>
    <P>The Bill makes clear that the courts are to have jurisdiction to ensure that in an appropriate case a person shall, in lieu of being sent to an institution for treatment, be required to undergo out-patient treatment.  It is envisaged that those undergoing such out-patient treatment and those released from a designated centre or special unit will have the full benefit of appropriate community services.</P>
    <P>The committee leave the details of that for regulations to be made by the Minister for Health under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another important safeguard contained in the Bill is the provision for legal representation by a solicitor or a barrister where appropriate, when somebody is before the courts and important decisions as to what is to happen to him or her are taken.  There might be an important decision about their fitness to be processed by the court or, if there is a finding that they were suffering from the kind of mental illness which relieves them of responsibility for their acts, a decision about what will happen to them afterwards, whether they will be sent to a designated centre or required to have out-patient treatment.  It is important to ensure that persons in that situation have a right to legal representation because it would be a mistake to move from the criminal courts processing these individuals as criminals but with the possible safeguard, such as it is, of legal representation to an approach that was entirely treatment, treatment perhaps intended to be in the best interests of the individual but without the concern for such basic things as the liberty and civil rights of the individual. <Col N="51" /> Although it is appropriate and right that the emphasis be moved to the jurisdiction of the Minister for Health and that instead of convicting criminals and sending them to prisons we are treating patients and sending them to designated centres, nevertheless it is important when these vital decisions are being taken that people, particularly with this kind of handicap who are not able to argue their own case and speak for themselves, be legally represented.</P>
    <P>They are the main recommendations of this report and the key provisions of the Bill which is tabled and annexed to it. I would like to make a few general comments on the report and the draft Bill. First of all, if the step is taken, as I sincerely hope it will in the very near future, to accept the recommendations of the report and to implement this Bill, then if it is to work it will be important that judges are educated to avail of the emphasis in the Bill and to discharge their responsibilities in the matter.  A great deal will depend on the ability of a district justice or Circuit Court judge to identify, looking at the person before him, that the person has a problem and that a medical report ought to be sought in order to ascertain whether he or she is a fit person to come before the court as an accused or should receive immediate care or be dealt with in such a way that he or she would be sent to a designated centre or recommended to have out-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill depends on sensitivity, understanding and training in our district justices and Circuit Court judges and, indeed, in High Court judges in so far as they would be in the Central Criminal Court dealing with more serious criminal charges.  One thing that would have to be envisaged would be specialist seminars for district justices or Circuit Court judges to ensure that they knew the symptoms and the attitudinal behaviour of persons coming before them who had mental problems; to ensure that they were sensitive in their own questioning and alert to what they should be looking for; to ensure that <Col N="52" /> they knew the kind of report they should seek in relation to individuals and, perhaps just as important, that they understood the report submitted to them by medical experts, either reporting in a written form or appearing in court as witnesses giving expert evidence about the mental health or stability of an individual.</P>
    <P>That is a very important point.  It is a point that could be made in relation to other areas of our law.  Our judges could benefit from going back to school in a number of areas but specifically in this one.  Specialist seminars ought to be, organised and it is my understanding that in the United Kingdom they have regular specialist seminars.  There are people with expertise in this area and I am sure they would be willing to assist in organising similar seminars with the Irish medical profession.</P>
    <P>One vital lack in this area, as in so many other areas of law whether it is criminal law or civil law, is the lack of adequate statistical information, lack of information on the numbers involved, on the kind of problems that arise, on what happens to people when they are found unfit at the moment if they are charged with an indictable offence or when they are simply ordered to be detained.  If we are to introduce a Bill in this area shifting the emphasis to care and treatment, to the concept of a patient in need of particular attention, then, from the very beginning, it would be desirable that the Minister would establish a system of very close statistical monitoring and accounting so that there is a centralised place where we know what is happening.  Perhaps one of the functions of the mental care review body would be to take upon themselves a particular responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Another point I would make is that although this afternoon we are considering this report which is narrow, specialist, complex and I believe very urgent, and the Bill that is annexed to it, we are considering a general area that needs radical reform, the whole area of treatment of mental illness.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to give some <Col N="53" /> indication of what is happening in a more general way in this area.  As I understood it there was to be a Bill.  I thought that there would be by now a text of a Bill on the reform of the general area of mental illness and the treatment of persons who are mentally ill and the approach under our statute to that.  I know it is straying slightly outside the strict terms of this motion, but I do not think we can examine in detail this facet of the problem of mental illness, that is, the mental illness of persons who come before our courts charged with offences, without having concern for the need which has been reported on, which has been argued and stated many times over, for a general reform in the whole area of mental health.  I understood that legislation was to be drafted and I would welcome an indication from the Minister as to what the position is.</P>
    <P>I would be very grateful to the Minister if he would in his contribution to this debate give us an indication of the thinking of the Government and of the Departments concerned on the recommendations of this report.  An interdepartmental committee with some very reputable outsiders to the Departments must have more influence than a totally independent body.  I do not think anybody could describe the members of this committee as radical outside independent persons who might take a completely different line from departmental thinking within the two relevant Departments, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice. The report has been with the Government for something like two years and, since we now have it published and have an opportunity here to debate it, it would be helpful to have on the record a very specific indication of Government thinking and a specific time scale if the Government intend to introduce the legislation and the kind of institutional reform and amendment of treatment in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would also be grateful if the Minister would indicate in a more general sense the proposals which the Government intend to make in the area <Col N="54" /> of mental health.  I hope that there will be general support in the Seanad for this motion and I would remind Senators that it is not just a motion noting; it is a motion seeking the tabling of the Bill appended to this important report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like publicly to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I know he is not unenlightened in the application of justice and I am sure he will bring his experience to bear through the office.</P>
      <P>No matter how long this report took to come to light, it can be described as a report that brings great relief to the families, the guardians, the parents of the mentally ill and persons generally in that category, particularly those who have been unfortunate enough to become victims of the present legal system.  The Bill is very welcome in a special way to those of us who are committed to the Labour Party because in Labour Party policy over a long period of time, even though this constitutes only one aspect of it, we have been advocating many changes in the area of health.  In this particular area we have been advocating not exactly the recommendations made in the report but something along those lines.  Consequently the report satisfies our appetite for the changes we feel are necessary to deal with the mentally ill and the maladjusted when they appear before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report seems to carry its weight in four main areas.  First, the duty is now clearly placed on the court to investigate or inquire into the alleged offender and whether he is responsible or not responsible for the conduct charged against him.  This is a wonderful step forward because at present there is no way for this question to be raised by the court. As Senator Robinson said, the onus is on the defence to make the case that the person before the court is deranged or is irrational to a large degree.  The position is that the courts, as the law stands, must in the first instance on behalf of the State exact a pound of flesh in the way <Col N="55" /> they would take it from a normal person. This recommended change consequently appeals to justice and humanity and to a great extent relieves the judge of the embarrassment he may suffer, because many judges know under the present system that in fact people who are before them are really mentally ill or maladjusted.  The position is that all they can do is recommend that they see a psychiatrist but that the sentence be carried out, and exact the pound of flesh on behalf of the State.  While doing this they know that in fact the person should be sent to another place where he would get proper care and attention and would be under constant supervision in a proper type of institution.</P>
    <P>The second point about the report is that it is a further step forward towards enabling the court to send people suffering from mental disorders to properly designated institutions instead of jail. This is a very, very significant development. It is important because while the judge at present passes the sentence, as I have said earlier, he can only recommend that the person go to a psychiatrist, but he can in fact be ignored.  If the judge's recommendation can be ignored the whole thing can be counterproductive and in the long run no treatment is effective enough to cure the person or make his problem less acute. This is not just because of being ignored but because there is constant supervision in the properly designated institutions with a greater chance that the problem of the patient, as he should be so described now under this recommendation, would be remedied.  He would receive the necessary treatment and supervision rather than being left in the position where the judge sentences him to jail, recommends psychiatric treatment and that recommendation is either ignored or attended to.  One way or another he languishes in prison for a long time and in the final analysis he gets so bad that the warders just want to get rid of him.  He is a burden to them; he is a burden to everyone in the jail and consequently he may finish up by being put <Col N="56" /> into some sort of geriatric unit if he is old enough or just off to a mental institution because he has not had any effective treatment before that which might have allowed him to go back to the community. There is that danger in the present system where the person is allowed to languish and I think there is plenty of evidence of it.</P>
    <P>The third point, the setting up of the review body for all patients under psychiatric care, is a very, very welcome one indeed and it is long overdue.  It would impede my progress towards the other points I want to make if I dwelt too much on that but I would like to note how welcome and desirable it is.</P>
    <P>The fourth point is, I think, the main point in the report as I see it.  It does clear up the legal wrangling.  The district justice at the moment cannot take the decision that the person is insane and because of that, the person can end up before a judge and jury.  The Minister may correct me here but if I am not mistaken it would not be beyond the range of possibility that this person could end up before a jury for loitering with intent or something like that, not even a greater crime than that.  It is rather disturbing that the present system can operate in that way and therefore the point made by the review in this particular area is a very, very desirable advance.</P>
    <P>I do not know the law too well but my colleague is a lawyer.  I am trying to argue from the layman's point of view. As I see it, from the little bit of reading I have done and the few appearances I have had in court&mdash;not on trial I might say, but as an observer&mdash;I felt that the argument even when made by the defence is so restricted that it does not achieve anything at all for the person. As a layman that means to me in effect that to argue mental disturbance is not in fact a defence as the law stands at the moment.  Consequently, because both the report and the Bill will actually remedy this it is more welcome than ever.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any Senators have had experience of the pink form but at present the system is that one or two <Col N="57" /> doctors with a pink form can sign you into a mental institution.  There are some arguments as to whether the assessment unit can hold you only for 48 hours or not, but because it is possible for a couple of medical practitioners to sign the pink form it means that geriatrics finish up in mental hospitals.  That may not be relevant to the report but it is relevant to the fact that there is a review body for all psychiatric patients and it is the context in which I make the point.  Therefore, the Bill itself and the report give scope for tackling this malpractice.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very sensible arrangement that where somebody is coming before the court there can in fact be a diagnosis in advance to say that the person can be put in proper custody in a Garda barracks or elsewhere.  The fact that you may have to amend other criminal laws, as the report says, should not stop us from going ahead with this Bill because if you create a cause you create an effect, and I do not always approve of dealing with the effects, but inevitably under our type of system and the way we do our business, if we create a cause we obviously create an effect and consequently we have to deal with the effect.  The effect of bringing in this Bill is that we will have to alter some other Acts, but that is what we are here for, we are here to do that on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>Because of this report the duty is falling on us now to let the community at large know that people who come before the courts do suffer from mental illnesses and it is not just a matter of the judge saying so.  There is now evidence of the fact that the person is mentally disordered and it is not proved after he is sentenced but it is proved beforehand and this is a very, very encouraging development also.  Again, I might say in a very general way that we have campaigns to cure heart problems, campaigns to cure cancer by prevention and treatment and the Bill in its tone, I would say rather than its written word, suggests that similar efforts might be made in this particular area of mental health. Therefore, I see the introduction of the Bill as being of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> In this whole area of people who are maladjusted or mentally ill or irrational or deranged&mdash;whatever way you want to describe it&mdash;appearing before the court the reason we have not changed the law and why the commission was necessary is that we have been preoccupied with caring for the defence of the State, or the national defence.  Because of that, we tied the hands of the courts and we did not produce any enabling legislation to help the judges.  I am sure the judges, who are very experienced people, have solved the problem about this themselves.  We were unable to raise any particular issues about it in any effective way.  It is a good sign now that the judge could be in a position, if this Bill is introduced quickly, where he will not have to look on the person before him just as an ordinary criminal but as somebody who was not in fact responsible for his actions at the time the crime was committed.  We may argue or hear arguments from outside minority groups and others that it is incumbent on society to protect the lives and the property of innocent law abiding citizens, but the onus is also on us to protect all our citizens, particularly those who cannot protect themselves.  That is why this report is very important.  I do not mind the argument about inadequate deterrents to prevent crime; I do not think the Bill will affect that particular concept. That is probably right.  At least it will check up on detention in suitable places and that is very important.</P>
    <P>I wonder how much money is allocated to this whole question of mental illness.  It must have some relevance to this question of people appearing before the courts.  We should consider that area as quickly as possible.  Here we have a report whereby there could be better assessment, better screening and treatment of maladjusted people, more mental institutions capable of offering appropriate treatment.  Finally, may I say that the Minister should consider incorporating the whole prison medical service into the national health service rather than leave the services as they are at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join <Col N="59" /> in welcoming the Minister and in congratulating him and I would also like to congratulate the members of this interdepartmental committee on the excellent work they have done.  They are a very distinguished, able and knowledgeable group of people and they have presented an excellent report and made some very worthwhile suggestions in what is an extremely difficult area in relation to legislation, in relation to medicine and in relation to society as a whole.  I must say I greatly sympathise with the sentiments expressed by Senator Harte and the general tenor of Senator Robinson's remarks.</P>
      <P>It is indeed a sad situation where people who are mentally ill are before the courts.  It is quite evident to everyone concerned&mdash;the legal people, the court itself, the guards, the medical people involved, probation officers&mdash;that it is really a mental problem, one requiring treatment, rather than a criminal or other offence.  This is a very sad situation and it does indeed require reform and many of the Acts that were quoted here in relation to this report&mdash;in fact the majority of them, I think&mdash;date back to the early years of the last century.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome certain specific aspects of the report, the reference, for example, to infanticide, a very difficult, a very heart-rending situation, the references to diminished responsibility and the extremely difficult position in which the courts might find themselves in relation to mandatory sentences.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have to express certain reservations.  This is an extremely difficult area indeed.  Although agreeing wholeheartedly that reform is needed I am not just entirely convinced as yet I should fully agree with the detailed recommendations in this report and unfortunately when one does begin to look into it one does begin to realise that the problems are very grave and very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must be very careful here that we are effectively reforming the legislation, that we are effectively reforming the criminal code, that we are effectively <Col N="60" /> providing for a situation where those who are mentally ill will get treatment. We must be very careful that we do not in any way set up a situation in which mental illness could become either a cover for an acquittal where it is inappropriate or where the situation could become so abused that the public at large instead of welcoming legislation, which I think they should, and I think the legislation is needed, might end up feeling that some of the legislation which had been introduced had had quite the contrary effect to what was intended and thus bring what are really much needed reforms into disrepute.  There is a very considerable danger of this.  It is one, I am sure, of which the committee are aware and they have made a very excellent effort to deal with some of the problems involved.</P>
    <P>But there are difficulties and I suppose the difficulties, although they arise particularly in a minority of cases, can nonetheless be very grave.  I refer to the report where they talk about psycopaths, in other words persons with mental disorders who are violent, who are dangerous to themselves and to others.  Indeed, there is a sort of omnibus section here in relation to such persons. If we take definitions, page 14 of the report, there is an explanatory note on mental disorders and violent personality disorders, trying to put forward definitions, distinguishing between mental disorder which is an illness or a defect of the mind and violent personality disorder which, as its name implies, is a disorder or a disability of personality persistent in its character and manifesting itself in abnormally violent or aggressive conduct.  There could be some slight argument there about such a definition. There will be those who will consider that both such categories are forms very definitely of mental disorder.  I can see great difficulties here and arguments arising, certainly from the medical point of view, and no doubt in turn from the legal point of view.</P>
    <P>Psychiatrists are in a very difficult position here.  It is exceptionally difficult to classify or distinguish various types of <Col N="61" /> mental illness.  In turn, to make that a matter of legal definition will, I think, bring about very grave problems, problems which I hope will be solved and legislation brought in to deal with them.  I am not just happy that the proposed legislation here or some parts of it, is really sufficient or adequate in this respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson, in her very interesting introductory remarks to her motion, referred to the brevity of the introduction to the report itself.  Here again, although in many ways welcoming this brevity, it may perhaps give a slight impression that the matter is, or can be, fully covered in slightly less than six pages.  The terms of reference of the committee were to examine and report on the provisions, legislative, administrative and otherwise, which the committee consider to be necessary or desirable in relation to persons, including drug abusers, psychopaths and emotionally disturbed, maladjusted children and adolescents who have come, or appear likely to come, in conflict with the law and who may be in need of psychiatric treatment.  I would think that certain persons referred to there&mdash;drug abusers or the psychopaths&mdash;could merit and take a full report for themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope the committee will forgive me but I think there is a slight danger in the brevity with which they have introduced their report.  I am sure all the members themselves are aware of the extremely difficult problems that they are referring to.  I am not so sure the people reading this report will quite realise the depths which will have to be plumbed in order to bring forth really suitable legislation.  I think it is very important that when we do bring in reform legislation, reform legislation which is very badly needed, that that reform legislation should stand the test of time, be found to be appropriate both by the legal people involved and the medical people&mdash;and, as Senator Robinson has indicated, a very considerable trend in this report is to shifting the onus on to the medical people&mdash;and at the same time carry public confidence with it because <Col N="62" /> without that I fear we may end up with an even worse situation than we have already.  That has been indicated by the proposer and seconder of the report. There is a very definite need here which I would hope we would support on both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to join with the other Senators in extending congratulations to the Minister on his first visit to the Seanad and to wish him well in his appointment.  I welcome the opportunity of making a few general observations on the report on the treatment and care of persons suffering from mental disorders who appear before the courts on criminal charges.  I feel that as a society there is a responsibility and duty on us in any area where people such as those referred to, to whom the report applies, are involved and who may in some way be at a disadvantage, to ensure that if there is a disadvantage that disadvantage is removed.</P>
      <P>I believe that people with mental deficiencies coming before the courts on criminal charges are certainly at a disadvantage as the law stands.  Reform is needed in this area and the report that we are discussing is worthwhile in the sense that it makes recommendations as to how these disadvantages could be removed, how reform could be introduced in a positive way.  Therefore, I believe that the report is worthwhile, that it is practical and that it has merit.</P>
      <P>As matters now stand, I am satisfied that persons with a mental disorder or handicap who appear before our courts are in many cases at a great disadvantage. There are, of course, the very obvious ones, that in the majority of cases or in very many cases the people concerned lack the capacity or ability to explain adequately their involvement or non-involvement in the case to which the charge relates.  They often lack the capacity to defend themselves as effectively as a normal person would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the duty of the courts to establish the sanity or the insanity of a person on a criminal charge.  That duty has been non-existent <Col N="63" /> up to now in so far as the determining of the guilt or the innocence of the person involved is concerned.  I understand that the question of the sanity of the person, and through that the person's responsibility in relation to the crime, is taken into account only when the offence has been proved or otherwise and relates only to the measure of sentence that may be imposed in relation to the offence that has taken place.</P>
    <P>I support fully the recommendation in the report that courts should have the power to send persons with a mental handicap to designated centres of training. I believe that it is very clear that justice requires that the courts would have the responsibility and the obligation of ensuring and establishing the mental condition of a person where there is any doubt that a disorder or a handicap may exist in that person.</P>
    <P>I have read the recommendations as to how the test of insanity should be carried out and again I feel that there is merit there and it is something that I would strongly support.  I also accept&mdash;because there is merit in it&mdash;that the responsibility for persons with a mental disorder coming before the courts on criminal charges should, where it is established that a disorder does exist, become the responsibility of the Minister for Health rather than of the Minister for Justice.  I strongly support the concept that is in the report that the focus should be on the care, treatment and attention given to people who are so affected.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of a point made by Senator Conroy.  I believe there is need to exercise care that while on the one hand we want to ensure that no person will be at a disadvantage or will suffer a handicap before our courts or in society because that person may have a mental handicap or a mental disorder, at the same time we also want to ensure on the other hand that the door is not opened where the plea of insanity is availed of by many people before our courts whose mental condition would not be such that they could be described as suffering <Col N="64" /> from mental disorder or handicap.  That is a point that has to be taken into consideration. It is something that requires to be fully appreciated, that when the reforms are brought in&mdash;I hope in the not too distant future&mdash;we shall ensure that there are safeguards there that the plea of insanity is not opened to people to whom in justice and honesty it should not apply.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Government will give very serious consideration to the early introduction of the Bill with which the report is concerned.  Perhaps, they may feel, in their wisdom, that there is need to improve, to amend it in some way, but basically it is well equipped to meet this situation with which we are confronted and are attempting to deal.  I hope that no undue delay will take place in presenting legislation to deal with the matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that, while we have an obligation to persons with mental handicap, we must also recognise, as another Senator said, the suffering and the embarrassment which their situation often causes to their parents, their relatives and others.  I believe that these relatives would welcome the improvements and the measures that are proposed in that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me, also, great pleasure to welcome the Minister to the House on his first visit, to listen to and take part in this debate on a most important report.  I should like to make a few very general comments on certain issues that were raised in the report.</P>
      <P>First of all, the verdict &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; is both an unreal and an unjust one.  It is unreal because it fails to take into account the legal criterion for the definition of &ldquo;insanity&rdquo;, which is still basically that contained in the M'Naghten Rules.  The rules very clearly set out this criterion and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every man is to be presumed sane until the contrary is proved.  To establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring <Col N="65" /> under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature or the quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that he was doing wrong.</P>
    <P>That is very clear.  How can anyone be held to be guilty of a criminal act if he was incapable of knowing he was doing wrong at the time he committed it?  It is not only an unreal verdict, it is a very unjust verdict, because it confers on the person convicted and on his family a terrible stigma.  This contradiction was created by the Trial of Lunatics Act of 1883 and it is high time we got rid of it.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the proposed Draft Bill proposes to do just this.  It would give to a justice of the District Court jurisdiction to find, instead, a verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty by reason of mental disorder&rdquo;. This is a very much more just and humane verdict.  We might ask ourselves are the criteria set out in the M'Naghten Rules adequate today.  These rules are, after all, the replies of a panel of judges to questions raised by Members of the House of Lords after a debate in the House of Lords following the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.  So, perhaps, it is time we changed the criteria.</P>
    <P>As a logical development of this new verdict, the Bill also proposes, for the first time, to empower the District Court to consider the mental condition of persons charged before it and to make orders for their treatment and care.  It is a very good thing that such persons should be dealt with properly as people in need of care rather than as prisoners at District Court level.  The District Court is already overburdened with work.  It deals, for example, with consumer cases that should more properly be dealt with by another system of small claims courts.  It is also bogged down in family law matters.  There might be a long delay before the person would be examined.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) of the proposed Bill at paragraph (b) provides that if the justice remands the accused in custody, he may direct that he be examined while in custody by a registered medical practitioner <Col N="66" /> nominated by the court.  The question arises, while in custody to where is he to be remanded?  The possibilities of delay are numerous and many who are in need of treatment and who are arraigned before the District Court are young people.  Are they to be held in custody in an institution like St. Patrick's, for example?  I do not think that is a suitable environment for persons in need of medical treatment. Delay may also arise while the court is waiting for a medical consensus on the condition of the accused.  Delay in this area is certainly undesirable and the first thing that we would have to ensure is that the procedures in the District Court are streamlined so that there is no undue delay.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the setting up of a mental care review body, one of whose functions will be to consider the welfare of prisoners in custody. This is needed, because 120 prisoners were sent to mental institutions in 1975 and, while the number had fallen to 92 in 1978, the fact that they have to be sent at all from prison shows the very great need in this area.  The report is the work of an interdepartmental committee of experts specially set up.  We also had, some time ago, a specially set up committee on the Pringle Report, to report on the need for a free civil legal aid system. Also in the pipeline is the report of a committee of the Department of Health, which will put forward certain proposals to reform the law in so far as it relates to children.  All these are separately set up committees.  Should this not be the work of the Law Reform Commission?</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission was set up by Law Reform Commission Act of 1975.  Its function is to keep the law under review and, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, it &ldquo;shall undertake examinations and conduct research with a view to reforming the law and formulate proposals for law reform.&rdquo;  In its first programme, the commission said that while it was not the intention of the commission to undertake study in the whole field of family law, it would be concerned with the adequacy of the existing <Col N="67" /> law for the protection of the family. It also said in its first programme that it proposed to examine various aspects of the criminal law, including the mental element in crime and the legal force required to constitute a crime.</P>
    <P>So far, we have had from the Law Reform Commission proposals in relation to civil liability for animals, liability for builders, criminal conversation and breach of promise.  Do we have to wait for the reports of specially set up committees and hope that we get the report on the Order Paper of this House, before any meaningful law reform takes place, at the same time as the Law Reform Commission is merely nibbling around the edges of the whole area?  The thrust of this report and of the annexed Bill is to ensure that people who are mentally and physically in need of treatment may be treated as patients rather than as potential prisoners.  It deals with an area of the law that has been neglected&mdash;neglected, I feel, because of our ambivalent attitude to mental disorder. We give very fully and willingly of our time and our money to help the mentally handicapped but mental illness and its associated problems are swept under the carpet.  We fear what we do not understand. While most of us can cope, eventually, with the problems of physical illness we are unable to cope with the destructive effect, mainly on family life, of mental illness.  We have not faced up to it.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty that while the legal criteria for defining insanity can be very clear-cut and very easy to understand, the medical definition of insanity may, indeed, vary from doctor to doctor.  If I might take a rather extreme example, if somebody steals a motor car, goes for a joyride and ends up wrapping the car around a lamppost, at the same time ramming a few patrol cars on the way, I do not think it would be difficult to find many medical experts who would say that he was insane at the time he did it.  So, it is very difficult to put across to the man in the street what we are to do with a person like that.  Are we <Col N="68" /> to consider him a suitable case for treatment or should he be behind bars?  I know where the majority of public opinion would put him.  Senator Conroy has referred also to the difficulties in this area.  It is, as the proposer of the motion said, a very dark area and I hope that the debate on the report will help to throw very much needed light on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome to the Minister of State.  I gathered from something I read at the time of his appointment that he would have responsibility in the law reform area and perhaps the lack of action by his Ministers to introduce reforming measures throughout the last two and three-quarter years will now be rectified. I do not know that I would altogether recommend him to use the draft Bill attached to this report for his maiden journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I see it, sets out to do very commendable things, to improve the lot of mentally disturbed people who come in conflict with the criminal law, to improve their position before the courts and, more importantly, to make provision for adequate treatment for them afterwards.  But in doing that, it impinges on a constitutional principle that is basic to the whole legal standard of this Bill. We have the division of powers enshrined in our Constitution, divided between the judicial, legislative and executive areas.  One area in which the borderline between the judicial and executive has been very clearly marked up to now has been in the area of sentencing and subsequent dealing with a prisoner.  It has been well settled that up to now the courts have discharged their judicial function in applying the law in relation to the person before them and if a sentence is imposed then it is a matter for the executive to regulate the carrying out of that sentence and any matters arising from it, or ancillary to it.  I read the proposals in this report and the import of the draft Bill attached to it as going henceforth to involve the courts, the judicial arm of the State, in the executive area of the State, in so far as it would give the courts power to follow into the <Col N="69" /> area which up to now has exclusively belonged to the executive the person who has come before them after his business with the courts has ended.  I do not know if I altogether approve of that principle.</P>
    <P>The strength of our Constitution is that the division of powers has been rigid.  The strength of the Constitution is that if that rigidity is maintained, each arm of the State is a check on the other. If we now find that one arm of the State, the judicial, is being given power to interfere with what was hitherto the executive area, what check is there on the judicial area when it becomes involved in what has hitherto not been its scene? This basic constitutional principle is infringed by the recommendations of this report and I would be unhappy about it. I readily conceive the motives behind the report in proposing what is proposed&mdash;it is to improve the lot of the prisoner who is suffering from mental disorder&mdash;but some other administrative system could be devised to achieve that end without infringing what I consider to be a very basic and valuable principle.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report are humane and are common sense.  I welcome the new powers to the District Court.  Quite recently I had occasion to defend a person who was unfit to plead charged with a summary offence and, technically speaking, there should have been a finding, the rather contradictory finding that Senator Cassidy has pointed out, of guilty but insane, but that was not open to the court.  Rather rough justice had to be done in fairness to the person and through the humanity of the court but the procedure might not have been strictly in accordance with the law. So I welcome that change to remove any such anomalous positions.</P>
    <P>I would be worried by the definition sections in the draft Bill.  I do not know that they are altogether adequate.  A definition which defines mental disorder as meaning mental illness or mental handicap seems to me to be a classic example of a circular definition and does not lead anywhere.  The M'Naghten Rules, old and all as they are, have stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> There should have been an attempt, in the drafting of this Bill, to be more precise as to what is meant by mental disorder.  It excludes violent personality disorder.  This is getting into an extremely difficult area of psychiatric medicine. I presume that the type of person intended to be covered by the term as suffering from violent personality disorder is that person we commonly called the psychopath.  Undoubtedly, dealing with that particular person has posed immense problems for the State up to now, because psychiatric medicine has not recognised that the psychopath is a person who comes within their province. Up to now, we have had the situation where people suffering from that condition&mdash;if it can be described as a condition in a medical or clinical sense&mdash;have been imprisoned and have been extremely difficult prisoners to contend with because of their personalities.  It was my experience that society dumps them, so to speak, into the prison service and the prison service did not have the resources, being essentially custodial in the first instance, though not exclusively so, to deal with these difficult personalities. Again, it was my experience that, when we asked the psychiatric services to deal with them, the answer, very frequently, was &ldquo;These people are not psychiatric cases and consequently have no place in our hospitals or institutions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the way in which the Bill proposes to deal with that major difficulty. The Bill proposes to set up a special institute, under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, to which these people will be committed.  That is the perfect theoretical answer but I am afraid that, in terms of the financial and other resources necessary to provide it, having regard to the unfortunate way in which the country's finances have been run down, it will be a long time before the answer can be provided as suggested by the Bill.  Certainly, an institution of that type is necessary to deal with these persons who are categorised as persons suffering from violent personality disorder.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the quality of the <Col N="71" /> definition when it comes to being applied in court.  That a person suffering from violent personality disorder can stand trial and can be convicted is implicit in the section setting up the designated centres.  What will be the position of persons of that type who come before a justice and the justice is not sure, nor is the medical practitioner sure, whether the particular ailment or disability constitutes mental disorder or constitutes violent personality disorder?  If he proceeds to trial and conviction, various unfavourable legal consequences could result.  The Bill suffers from a certain looseness in this regard.  I make this point not to criticise the idea behind the report or the thinking behind the report but to criticise the way the report seeks to bring its ideas into reality.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty at the moment is dealing with the type of person known as the psychopath.  The prisons are not suitable institutions for dealing with them.  They are very often disturbing and violent people within the prison system. There have been notorious instances where these people have been not just violent to others but have done immense damage to themselves.  Yet, it is not possible to have them transferred to psychiatric institutions because the view is that they do not properly belong there.  If some solution can be found, I will certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm to put on record that people who are suffering from psychiatrically recognised disability at the moment who are in custody are subject to the care of the medical services of the health board in whose area the prison is situated.  When I was in office&mdash;and I have no doubt it is still the position&mdash;the range of medical services available for such persons were whatever services the health board's psychiatrists recommended and implemented.  Neither the Department of Justice nor the prison service determined the range, quality or extent, of psychiatric services.  There is widespread belief that they were fewer than those available to the members of the general public but that is not so.  The <Col N="72" /> services that were available for psychiatric cases were those deemed adequate and suitable by the professional psychiatrists of the health board in question. There were adequate clinics, both within the prison and to which outpatients who need treatment are taken regularly.  There was then the closed institution in Dundrum for prisoners who needed institutional care for psychiatric reasons.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a little vague and unduly hopeful when it speaks of remanding persons suffering from mental disorder which does not include violent personality disorder to what will essentially be open institutions.  I have not read the Bill as closely as I should have liked, and may be wrong in my criticism but it seems that the Bill gives power, or proposes to take power, to confine persons after the end of their sentence, if they are certified to be suffering from mental disorder, without making any provision for them being kept in secure places.  I have read the Bill rather quickly and I am subject to correction on this. The secure places are confined to persons who are suffering from violent personality disorder and that is a totally different category of person according to the definition section in the Bill.  I am sure that is not intended but if it is a consequence it gets back to the rather imprecise drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motivation behind the report.  I welcome many of its recommendations but I must confess that I am less than happy with the Bill as drafted.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my thanks to all the Senators for the words of welcome expressed to me on my first occasion here.  I hope that I shall be here for a considerable time to listen to equally constructive remarks as have been made by the various speakers to this debate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I are as anxious as anybody else, including the Senators who have spoken, to have firm decisions made on the implementation, or otherwise, of the proposed Criminal <Col N="73" /> Justice (Mental Illness) Bill.  However, the changes recommended by the committee and contained in the draft Bill are fundamental changes in the law relating to mentally ill or maladjusted persons who appear before the courts on criminal charges.  The recommendations require careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The draft Bill proposes to establish a review body and would also involve the setting up of a new psychiatric centre and units, or at least the adaptation of existing ones, to cater for the proposed new procedures.  The financial implications are serious.  There would also be the problem of finding suitable staff for the new institutions.  Apart from these practical considerations, there are, as many Senators will have noticed, some changes proposed in what might be described as basic principles of our existing law.  These changes, too, must be carefully studied.  Even though the committee incorporated a draft Bill in the report which they felt would give effect to the recommendations, they made it clear at paragraph 3 of the report that their intention was not to give definite form to their recommendations but rather to enable the scope and effect of those recommendations to be viewed and appraised as components of a legislative pattern.</P>
    <P>The report was published on 25 January 1980 and copies of it may be obtained from the Government Publications Sales Office, GPO Arcade, at £1.20.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to make that information available at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I are concerned that any person or organisation that may be <Col N="74" /> interested should have ample opportunity to submit observations or recommendations in relation to the report before putting definite proposals to the Government.  I think that the answer to the Senator is in that.</P>
    <P>It is also clear from where the report is obtainable that we would like all the vested interests and all the interested parties outside this House and outside Departments to indicate to the Government their observations.  In fact, no observations have yet been received by my Department, other than from other Departments and from some members of the Judiciary who were expressly consulted.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I welcome this opportunity for Senators to give their views on the proposals.  I assure the House that any views put forward here will be taken into account by the Minister and myself in relation to submissions made to the Government.  This is a very important matter which affects one of the less fortunate sections of our community, and it deserves our full and sympathetic consideration.  It is important that any proposed legislation must, in so far as is humanly possible, provide for the greatest possible protections in this area. Senator Robinson asked what was the position in relation to mental treatment generally.  The fact is that the Minister for Health and his predecessor.  The Taoiseach, announced that it is hoped to circulate a Bill dealing with this matter in this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of other Senators who have already welcomed the Minister of State.  I was extremely interested, just now, when the Minister said the report was published on 25 January 1980.  He was reading from a prepared text.  Senator Robinson asked him when did the Government receive the report and he said he was not in a position to provide that information.  He has two advisers sitting very close to him and apparently they have still not provided him with the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I want to repeat the question.  I also want to make some observations about this date obscurity because, putting it bluntly, it has rather a bad smell.  The publication date is 25 January 1980.  The copy I have of this report bears no letter which would be normal when presenting it to the Minister or Ministers&mdash;it is inter-departmental&mdash;and bears no date. It is a parliamentary paper with a number giving it the official status of a parliamentary paper, but no date.  I wonder if it is legal to produce a paper like that without a date.  Senator Robinson's copy has a little piece of paper stuck on to the same page where the members of the committee are listed, and what was originally typed and then xeroxed saying November 1978 has been stuck on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to add, I did not stick it on.  It came that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them have a date; some do not have a date. The Minister now has a little warning, and he may have an opportunity to clarify the position or his advisers may be able to tell him.  My suspicion is that, because of the very oddness of the lack of a covering letter being published, and the lack of a date, the Government have been in possession of this for a considerable time.  Perhaps the failure to provide us with a date, not of publication, but of receipt by the relevant Minister, or by the Government, or whatever date the Minister chose to furnish us with when the document was transmitted from the committee shows it would be a useful date to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a third interim report.  Some comment was made on the fact that it is brief, but it is a third interim report from a very distinguished committee, very widely representative indeed.  At least one member of the Minister's own Department is a participant in it.  I heard the Minister say the matter needs careful consideration, that the financial implications are serious, that changes in the basic principles of our existing law must <Col N="76" /> be carefully studied.  All true, all laudable sentiments, but how long does careful study take?  There is a very interesting&mdash;and to me as a layman and someone who does not admire the law or the legal professions very much&mdash;a very shocking second schedule on page 63 of the report which lists the enactments which would be repealed if this draft Bill were to become law.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Short Title or Subject&rdquo; we see &ldquo;Criminal Lunatics (1880)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1821&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1837&rdquo;, &ldquo;Central Criminal Lunatic Asylums (Ireland) Act, 1845&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lunatic Asylums (Ireland) Act, 1875&rdquo;, &ldquo;Criminal Lunatics Act, 18-84&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1901&rdquo;.  The reason I read out those dates is to indicate that we have a serious situation which is really long overdue for fundamental reform.  This is not a trivial corner of the law, and, indeed, it is expensive in relation to what is happening currently.</P>
    <P>Of course, the financial implications of what is suggested in this draft Bill are serious.  It seems to me that, at this moment, the cost of institutionalisation on the level that it exists without treatment is absolutely enormous.  I do not now propose to go into the matter of prison reform, but it seems to me that putting into prisons persons who are not insane, but who are mentally disturbed, is, firstly, a very awful thing but, secondly, a very expensive thing because, if they are not seriously disturbed when they go in, they will be when they come out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If they come out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is already expensive. The way our economists and politicians and others function is to look at things on the basis of departmental Estimates.  The total cost of the existing situation in our society is enormous.  The cost for an institution to make some bit of progress is quantifiable and therefore terrifying, but what about the total cost of what is currently happening? Someone mentioned the ramming of patrol cars&mdash;£30,000 in one street in <Col N="77" /> one night; that is enormous too.  It is not a situation we can brush away.</P>
      <P>Basically the situation we are facing is that the law is the law going back to 1800, and to phrases like &ldquo;criminal lunatics&rdquo;.  I am not a lawyer but to me that is a contradiction in terms.  If you are a criminal you cannot be a lunatic.  If you are a lunatic you cannot be a criminal.  It is as dotty as that, and that sort of terminology goes on for a long time afterwards.  The law has not progressed, while knowledge and science have progressed immensely.  Now they are out of step, very seriously out of step and it is very expensive.  I am not suggesting that there is a science of mind yet.  I think there will be soon because there are computers.</P>
      <P>We must not brush away as nothing the vast advances both in knowledge and in humane attitudes of the past, say, 140 years.  Our law does not reflect them, and yet what is happening now is wasteful of money.  Who puts in the charges if you are making a balance sheet?  What is it costing the courts to do things that they should not be seized of in the first place?  They are taking up a lot of the time of the courts.  In one way or another we are all involved in society around us.  Some of us are involved as ex-Deputies with our constituencies, and so on.</P>
      <P>We all have a great deal of contact with society at large.  Do we not know the number of persons committing crimes, either to get themselves their next fix because they are hooked on drugs or because they are alcoholics? Any real quantification of this suggests that this is not a matter that can be put off.  It is very urgent, and it is quite a large issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I must say I was shattered by what Senator Conroy said.  A lawyer, a psychiatrist, a philosopher or, indeed, the one I would pick out as best equipped, a neuro-physiologist, who sets out to provide you with a good definition of &ldquo;mind&rdquo; is in desperate difficulties.  Insanity is the reverse of sanity.  If we try to define sanity we are into a very difficult area.  I hope I misunderstood what <Col N="78" /> Senator Conroy was saying but it sounded to me as if he were saying it is desperately difficult and imprecise and therefore you do not legislate.</P>
    <P>The M'Naghten Rules, now nearly 140 years old, were rough justice at the time.  To suggest that they have stood the test and that we cannot do better is a piece of dottiness in my layman's view.  I understand that, whatever the law says, enlightened and humane and compassionate judges have, in fact, moved those definitions forward enormously.  I do not pretend this is an easy area.  The people who drafted this do not themselves say that this is a final definitive text, though we ought to be extremely glad that that sort of spectrum of people are available to offer a draft.  Who is a more astute person to draw up a draft than Vincent Grogan?  Who is more experienced and compassionate to judge than the judge of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Henchy?  These are distinguished persons in psychiatry in the Government service, even though the draft Bill may not be the final, definitive, perfect draft. The job of the Oireachtas ultimately is to tease these things out.</P>
    <P>We are not now debating the Bill and I do not propose to get into the small print of it.  It is for the Oireachtas to put a final <i>imprimatur</i> on it, or to amend it if weaknesses are revealed.  Sometimes in our wisdom here&mdash;our wisdom being our lack of wisdom, our wisdom being our commonsense, our wisdom being our wide experience of ordinary life&mdash;we can see something these great experts do not see, but that is a very distinguished committee.</P>
    <P>One of the nice things about the Seanad is that I heard two people from Fianna Fáil in almost diametric disagreement with each other and, of the two, it was Senator Cassidy I agreed with and not Senator Conroy.  Then I heard very substantial agreement between Senator Cooney and Senator Conroy on opposite sides.  It is a plus for the Seanad that we are not breaking up on party lines but, please let us not plead difficulty as a basis for inactivity.</P>
    <P>No one denies the difficulty.  First, the <Col N="79" /> situation is awful.  Secondly, it is unjust. Thirdly, it is wildly expensive and, fourthly, it is important not because the total numbers involved are so great but because of our whole attitude to ancient, archaic and cruel laws full of the ideas of retribution and punishment which are irrelevant in the present day.  All we want and, indeed, all any law can be is a best approximation in the light of current knowledge.  That is difficult to achieve on the frontier between mental disturbance and mental normality.  No one denies for a moment&mdash;we would have consensus on all sides on this&mdash;that that difficulty has never been a valid reason for failure to act.  The need to act is overwhelming and the penalty we pay for non-activity is very large.  It would be cheaper to act resolutely, though not in terms of the Estimates for the Department of Justice or the Department of Health but in terms of total social cost.</P>
    <P>There is one point which appeals to my particular hang-ups to which I want to make reference.  I refer to page 7 of the report, paragraph 15.  We are concerned with persons like addicts to alcohol or other drugs who need a fix and who do various things in pursuit of their fix.  Some of them are not criminals but may easily become criminals.  It seems to me that many Senators made assumptions about institutionalisation, whether it was in a place for psychopaths, or in a special institution to contain the extremely violent personality, or whether it was for treatment of the mildly disturbed and rehabilitated person.  Paragraph 15 on page 7 reads:</P>
    <P>The elaboration in the Bill of the functions of the specified institutions for those suffering from mental disorder or violent personality disorder is not intended to imply that noninstitutional treatment may not in many cases be the better or the proper way of dealing with an offender's condition.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea in terms of good results, cost and, indeed, compassion and, in so far as I understand them, the <Col N="80" /> thoughts of persons deeply involved professionally in treatment, its effectiveness and its cost-effectiveness.  Non-institutionalisation may be the best way possible.  I thought the debate was making assumptions about different sorts of institutions.</P>
    <P>We ought to have some clarification about dates.  We are entitled to that.  I want to repeat a plea for prompt action. If this draft report from these very expert people is not perfect, surely it does 90 per cent of the work on a Bill which would commend itself to all sides of the House?  Difficulties are not sufficient reasons for inactivity.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on this report, interim though it may be. It is about the best laid out report on any subject that I have come across.

    <P>Those who framed the report deserve very great credit.  They took a very compassionate view of the whole problem. That is what we would expect in a Christian country.  As I was reading the report my mind went straight to our own language where we have such very sympathetic Christian, loving phrases to describe persons who are suffering from any form of mental illness.  We refer to such a person always as &ldquo;duine le Dia&rdquo;&mdash;one of God's own people.  We try to make an excuse for persons who, as a result of their mental failings, speak what ordinarily would be called nonsense. We simply say &ldquo;Ciall agus míchiall dís nach ngabhann le chéile.  Is dóigh leis an bhfear gan chiall gurb é féin <Col N="81" /> fear na céille&rdquo;.  There is a wealth of wisdom there.</P>

    <P>The definitions distinguish between mental disorder, which is an illness or defect of the mind, and violent personality disorder, which, as its name implies, is disorder or disability of personality, persistent in its character and manifesting itself in abnormally violent or aggressive conduct.</P>
    <P>Psychiatrists distinguish between mental disorder and personality disorder. The latter, of itself, will not exonerate a person from criminal responsibility, if he is shown to have the guilty intent <i>mens rea</i> of which he is capable.  If his condition is persistently violent, his own safety and the safety of society require that special measures be taken for his custody and care.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that a person not versed in these things, or not having experience of them, would be inclined to think that most mental disorders or illnesses can be put into two categories, one of mental disorder and the other of violent personality disorder.</P>
    <P>All through my life I have been teaching, educating boys and girls, young men and young women.  I have put thousands of them through my hands.  It was inevitable, indeed, that I would come up against many cases where there was a problem of mental illness in some shape or form.  One of the things I learned from experience was that there are so many varying degrees of illnesses that, in our present state of knowledge of both disease and language, it would be impossible to define these degrees.  Another thing I learned was that you just cannot measure mental disorder or mental illness.</P>
    <P>Physical illness?  Yes, you can do that. A person is taken to hospital.  All the doctors must agree, if they take his temperature, that his temperature is at such a point.  The same thing applies to his blood pressure and his heart beat. You can measure all these things.  What <Col N="82" /> about mental illnesses?  It is very hard for psychiatrists to say that a person is at a certain point.  Few of them will agree on these matters.</P>
    <P>My own method of dealing with such disorders was to bring experience, patience, the love of the parents and the family, and the love we had for the children ourselves, to bear on the problem, to try to isolate and identify the cause of the problem.  By that means we solved most of the problems.  We did not solve them all because, coming back to the question of measuring mental illness, very often it was very difficult, in fact impossible, for us in our present state of knowledge to be able to say when the mental illness ended and the <i>mens rea</i> began.  That is fundamental to the problem we have here.</P>
    <P>I have commended those who framed this report.  It is a splendid report.  It is an excellent jumping-off ground.  Their explanatory notes, and so on, are excellent. We must acquire a great deal of knowledge before we decide on what the best way of treating these problems is. It is an extremely difficult area.  I should like to see an expanded report and I should like every person who is interested in the question of mental illness to read it.  There is more mental illness now than we ever had before as a result of the opulent society we are lining in.</P>
    <P>It is a huge problem and there is the great danger that, in our present distressed state, socially and otherwise, if we ease off too much on these things, we will have highly intelligent criminals, criminals with a very high intelligence quotient, with no sense of responsibility, no conscience, who will use every trick they can think of to defy the law and who have <i>mens rea</i> while acting as if they had some sort of mental disorder. That could be the great problem before us.  I commend our Roman friends of long ago who gave us the best advice of all, <i>mens sana in corpore sano.</i></P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State for putting the information on the record that the report was received by the Government in November 1978.  I certainly&mdash;and I am sure all other Senators do&mdash;welcome the fact that it was published, even if there was a certain delay in publication.  The Minister made the point that it is important to receive reactions, not only when a motion is tabled and debated in this House, but also from people in the community, from lawyers, from doctors and also from lay people who are concerned. That sense of concern was present in each of the contributions here this afternoon. The debate has been a useful one because the motion refers to the report and urges the tabling of the draft Bill which was annexed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spent time discussing the recommendations of the report and, in some instances, referring to specific provisions of the Bill.  At one point Senator Keating made the point that we were not discussing the Bill, that the report was not intended to be a final blueprint but rather a helpful aid to lessen the time which would elapse before the Government would introduce legislation. I had a regret that we were not discussing the text of a Bill because I believe&mdash;and I sensed this was felt by Senators on both sides of the House&mdash;that the matter is an extremely urgent one, that as a society we cannot tolerate the idea of persons being abused by our own procedures and coming wrongly before the criminal courts because we have not devised the proper method and approach to help them, and being treated as prisoners rather than as <Col N="84" /> patients because we tolerate that in our institutional system and laws.</P>
    <P>I was asked whether it is proposed to put this motion to a vote since it calls for the tabling of the Criminal Justice (Mental Illness) Bill.  It is not proposed to put it to a vote.  We hope the motion may be agreed by the Seanad as a method of increasing the urgency at Government level.  It would be regrettable after the kind of debate we have had, where there has been a good deal of open-mindedness and commitment by the Seantors who participated, to put it to a vote and therefore risk a hardening of attitudes and a polarisation of political approaches to the subject.  That certainly is not the intent of the Labour Senators who tabled the motion.  It was rather to highlight this urgent and important area, to highlight the need for a change of approach, the long overdue need for a change of approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Keating referred to the list of statutes which are still part of Irish law which would be repealed, or very substantially modified, by the proposals in the draft Bill attached to the report.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senators who emphasised the complexity of some of the issues involved.  We are concerned about a most difficult area where persons come before the criminal courts charged with offences, and the responsibility then is: how are they to be dealt with?  What is to happen?  Personally I would like to re-emphasise the importance of not focusing totally or even primarily on institutional treatment but on having the resources in the community and putting the emphasis on non-institutional treatment and care.  I do not diminish the complexity or the difficulty of definition and of the actual process of follow-up when a person has been assessed from a medical point of view and found to be unfit to stand trial or somebody who should not be treated as a prisoner but should be categorised as a patient and given medical treatment.</P>
    <P>This is a very complex area but in my view we cannot postpone introducing legislation to bring about basic reforms because of the difficulty and it was put <Col N="85" /> very eloquently by Senator Keating when he said: &ldquo;Please let us not plead difficulty as a basis for inactivity&rdquo;.  That was, regretfully, a substantial part of the contributions of both Senator Conroy, who has a very considerable medical expertise in this area, and Senator Cooney, who has a considerable legal expertise. Perhaps we want less expertise and more commitment to the need to offer a help and a support from our society to the human beings concerned.  Sometimes it is the non-expert who gets to the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte and one or two other Senators described being in court when somebody comes before the criminal court who should not be there and they know that this is not only degrading and oppressive of the person who comes before the court, it is degrading of all of us.  It is degrading of the judge who is in a position where under the present situation he cannot call for a medical report and have the person assessed professionally and given the follow-up of care and the appropriate order in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Once this problem has been identified as it has been identified in this report, once recommendations have been made as to a way to deal with it, then if there is any sense of priorities in a society which claims to be civilised and humane, this should be top of the order of priorities. We are depriving persons of the most basic needs and rights as individuals.  We are doing it because of the system we have created and because that system does not conform to modern science, modern knowledge and modern approach which is more enlightened than the old days when you could have Criminal Lunatic Acts and a criminal lunatic asylum as part of the defensive reaction of a society which did not understand the motivation and was not in the position that we are in to provide for care, treatment and identification.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy in the course of her very interesting contribution referred to the fact that a number of young people who come before the courts may have problems of mental illness or handicap. <Col N="86" /> That is a very important part of the problem.  It is a very grave situation at the moment that because of the lack of the appropriate framework for treatment there is a very real danger, which is of great concern to lawyers who are involved or who have seen what has happened, that, for example, children sent to Loughan House in Cavan may have very serious mental disorder problems. It is quite wrong that those individual children be sent to Loughan House as a place to cope with that and it is very wrong for the other children who are there and, indeed, for the prison officers into whose care they are placed.  It should be a top priority to ensure that we do not have blunt and crude methods of dealing with persons who are involved in anti-social behaviour so that we can identify very precisely and very specifically the needs of those persons.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about a need for particular care in dealing with young people.  When we are talking about persons who come before the criminal courts, whether or not they are persons with mental illness or disorder problems, we can be sure that the vast majority of them will be in a low socio-economic group.  They will be from poor and deprived backgrounds.  It is that deprivation combined with the handicap of mental illness or disorder which demands from us as a society that we treat with the utmost priority the way in which the courts assert their jurisdiction and that our society provides centres and expert medical care in cases where persons should be treated as patients rather than as prisoners.</P>
    <P>I failed to follow the line of argument put forward by Senator Cooney when he tried to suggest that there was somehow a basic departure from fundamental constitutional principles.  I find it difficult to believe that Mr. Justice Séamus Henchy, who has a considerable reputation as a constitutional lawyer and judge of the Supreme Court, would embark on proposals which were somehow fundamentally undermining the checks and balances in our Constitution.  Senator Cooney seemed to be missing the basic <Col N="87" /> point behind most of the proposals in this report that there would be a distinction drawn between those who were appropriately prisoners, to be dealt with in the normal way by the courts, and those who would be patients, to be dealt with no longer in the same way within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts but, rather, to be placed in appropriate care in designated psychiatric centres, under the monitoring and review of the mental care review body.  This thrust is well summed up at paragraph 11 of the report where it states:</P>
    <P>The implementation of the terms of the Bill will mean that many persons who would otherwise be detained in, or passed through, a prison or other place of detention under the control of the Department of Justice will in future be detained in a designated centre approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It is that thrust which we are very anxious to see implemented.  Although I join with the other Senators who welcomed the Minister of State on his first visit as a Minister to this House, I felt a certain regret when I saw him sitting in that seat that it was not either the Minister for Health or the Minister of State at the Department of Health because I believe this would indicate a genuine psychological commitment on the part of the Government to move the main emphasis away from justice, the criminal law and the criminal process and in the direction of the focus of this Bill so that it be mainly in the jurisdiction of the Minister for Health.  A special category person with psychopathic aggressive disorders and the need for special units would rightly remain within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister would certainly have a role to play and a voice in appointing to the mental care review body.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the jurisdiction and responsibility for the care of persons who because of their mental disorder need treatment, either of an institutional sort in the designated centres or outpatient <Col N="88" /> treatment, is properly&mdash;and in other countries is already&mdash;within the jurisdiction and competence of the Minister for Health.  That is not to try to avoid or in any way disregard the points made by a number of Senators about ensuring that the terms and intent of the Bill would not be so construed as to give a loophole or some escape to persons who ought not come within the terms of that Bill.</P>
    <P>If there is a system established which requires medical advice at a very early stage on the fitness of persons to be before the courts or their responsibility for the acts with which they are charged, it is much less likely that there will be abuse within the system, whether it is the abuse of treating somebody as a prisoner when he ought to be afforded the help needed by a patient or whether it is somebody trying to avoid the responsibility for his actions by claiming that he is not a fit person to stand trial.  It is much more likely that any abuse would be avoided if we established the kind of system which is recommended in the Bill attached to this report.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senators who contributed and showed the concern they feel for the urgent need for reform in this area.  I still have hope that the Seanad can agree to this motion so that we can indicate collectively and in a non-party sense to the Minister and to the Government that this is something which all of us feel is urgent, that we do not regard the Bill attached as the final blueprint but we do regard it as the work of a very responsible and very prestigious committee with, as Senator Keating said, at least 90 per cent of the recommendations being the kind of things we would like to see and the rest being a matter for further detailed consideration but certainly no further loss of time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contributions of Senators and the presence of the Minister here today.  I would have liked some further indication of a more precise follow-up by the Minister.  If there are still outstanding problems, is there a departmental committee sitting <Col N="89" /> on them at the moment?  When will recommendations come before the Cabinet?  Perhaps we can hope that the debate here has accelerated this process.</P>

      <P>As I have stated, observations have only just been received by my Department from other Departments, members of the Judiciary and, of course, Members of the Seanad, here today. As referred to by Senator Robinson, there are also other medical and legal opinions that might be worth hearing.  Agreement would be forthcoming if Seanad Éireann were to note the report on Treatment and Care of Persons Suffering from Mental Disorder who appear before the Courts on Criminal Charges published in January 1980, but in the interests of good legislation I would consider it premature to call for an immediate introduction of the Bill in the absence of the other observations.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the emergence of the Zimbabwean Republic, congratulates all the people of Zimbabwe in their successful democratic resolution of their internal differences and pledges full support and co-operation with the new State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday of this week, two days hence, we will see the formal establishment of the liberty of a new nation.  Its emergence, of course, started a long time ago and I am very proud that this House of the Oireachtas should be debating a motion to welcome that emergence, and should be expressing its welcome.  It is appropriate for us because, though now consolidated we are ourselves a relatively new nation with an experience of oppression in our history and&mdash;though the term is unfashionable <Col N="91" /> I use it quite deliberately&mdash;we have an experience of imperialism.  We know what it feels like for the people of Zimbabwe because we have many experiences similar to theirs, short of the obscene experience of the differentiating among people on the basis of colour.  That we did not have but very many of their other experiences we share and that gives us a great sense of empathy with them.  It certainly gives me an enormous sense of admiration for what they have done.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to the experience of Africa that Ireland has. Many people have gone and are going open-heartedly with love and to be of help.  Some Irish have gone to participate in a process of exploitation and in a process of racism.  I want on this occasion to reiterate my abhorrence, that of my party and, I trust, of the whole Seanad at the practice of racism.  I want to express also my abhorrence of the actions of the illegal regime of Premier Ian Smith, and the actions of those countries and great companies which sustained him through that illegal regime.</P>
    <P>We have to say in our joy on this occasion that the struggle against racism and oppression in Southern Africa is not over; with this amazing victory it has entered a new phase.</P>
    <P>While history is not made by individuals, the people of Zimbabwe in their political leadership in the Patriotic Front are lucky to possess such a strikingly able and admirable individual as Robert Mugabe.  I want to express a sense of admiration at the things they have achieved.  It required an extraordinary strategic skill to have seen with such clarity the road to their present degree of liberation.  It needed an amazing tactical skill at the Lancaster House Conference in London to see that the time had come for what looked to me then, I confess, as compromise, but which turned out to be brilliant tactical skill and the seizing of an opportune moment. We must admire, too, their wonderful organisational skill, not just the skill which sustained a long guerrilla <Col N="92" /> campaign and the organisation of their movement in conditions of brutalisation and murder, but the organisational skill necessary to keep their leadership physically alive in the face of that murder.</P>
    <P>My greatest sense of admiration is reserved for the amazing magnanimity, nobility of character and the absence of bitterness that has been shown in the moment of victory.  What a good thing for Zimbabwe and all of the persons there, regardless of colour, what a good thing for Africa, for the whole world, that the people of Zimbabwe did not learn the attitude and the manners of their oppressors.  They have shown us what magnanimity and nobility can be. Over recent months up to and since the elections we must express our admiration for the extraordinary political maturity of the people.</P>
    <P>The dangers remain immense for this new country.  There is the obvious danger of people trying to return to a white supremacist Ian Smith type of <i>status quo.</i>  They are not out of the wood, far from it.  They have made an extraordinarily brilliant start to building a society where there is not oppression, either by colour or by the power of wealth or privilege.</P>
    <P>For me it is a matter of great pride to be able to salute them across thousands of miles, to wish them well, to say what a great sense of admiration they have already engendered in us, and how intensely we wish through the decades to see them building a society in Zimbabwe that embodies the equality of all human beings and the abolition of the shameful divisions introduced from outside Africa. by people who in terms of kith and kin are close to us.  We are ashamed of that past oppression.  We applaud their brilliant start and wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be true to say that only the Labour Party welcome the result of the general election in Zimbabwe; everyone of us welcomes the result of it, particularly because it paves the way for a peaceful transition to the country's full independence. <Col N="93" /> We see it as the beginning of Zimbabwe taking its place in the world of free nations.  There is a little bias, however, in the fact that I and most of my Labour Party colleagues would particularly salute the victory of the Patriotic Front and the appointment of Robert Mugabe as Prime Minister.  We do so not because he was leading a revolution but because during the 15 years of the white minority rule the people of Africa led by people like Mugabe were asking for help to set them free from bondage.  They were not able to wait long enough for the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo; from the brigand authority in power and consequently they inevitably had to turn to the same type of methods that most countries, like Ireland, had to use.</P>
      <P>It is greatly appreciated by us that Mugabe has had an overwhelming electoral victory.  It means that Zimbabwe can move in the direction of creating a just and equal society which we hope will be based on socialist principles.  That is the Labour Party bias.  The formal achievement of independence gives rise to a lot of problems; it is just the beginning of the road for them.  I believe there is appalling poverty outside Salisbury and they face many other social and economic problems.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party would urge the Government, as soon as possible, to give diplomatic recognition to and establish full diplomatic relations with that country.  Zimbabwe will play a very important role in the future and evolution of Africa as a whole.  Ireland has given them very practical aid in the past through priests and missionaries and so on.  Now we need to give them technical assistance.  I know that we can give this technical knowledge because I was in an American-based factory yesterday and I was astonished to learn that the Irish people have introduced things that the Americans have not been able to introduce in their own country.  We should do the best we can in this area.  There should be a review of cutbacks in Government aid to see what we can do to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not every country in the world would be as anxious to help them as we who <Col N="94" /> have a similar sort of history of trying to gain independence.  Other countries may be willing enough to help but they may put impossible conditions on that help or try to infiltrate by influence, which would not be the case in the case of Ireland.  We feel this is a welcome development and the whole question of racist Africa must now be opposed more than ever by most of us who cherish the principles of democracy. I am delighted that we were given the opportunity to speak on this motion today and I would like to thank the Leader of the House, Senator Eoin Ryan, for the way he has facilitated us, not only now but on many occasions in the past. We also thank him for extending this particular courtesy to us here today.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cuidiú leis an rún seo agus comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh le muintir na tíre seo Zimbabwe agus a rá go pearsanta go bhfuil an-áthas orm, agus is dócha orainn go léir, gur éirigh leis na pleananna agus na seifteanna a cuireadh i bhfeidhm le cúpla bliana anuas agus go bhfuil rialtas neamhspleách, daonlathach bunaithe sa tír, agus go bhfuil seans ag an náisiún beag seo dul ar aghaidh i saoirse as seo amach.  I find myself agreeing with many of the remarks that have been made.  There is a great feeling in this country of happiness, a strong feeling of compassion for the people of Zimbabwe who have suffered the sort of discrimination, ill-treatment, lack of freedom and deprivation that has been the lost of so many people around the globe.  I myself feel a sense of shame for those of the white race who have been involved in this kind of thing over the past couple of centuries but, as a small nation which is trying in its own way, as Ireland is on the European scene, to bring peace and a sense of stability into the affairs of nations, as a nation which suffered in the past, suffered discrimination and lack of freedom, we must be very satisfied that the trend of events in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, has gone along the lines that it has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> There is a great deal of credit due to the discipline and courage and the faith in themselves of the black leaders, in particular, people like the new Prime Minister, Mr. Mugabe, and Mr. Nkomo, which can only be described as a faith in something greater than themselves.  I believe it is a very good thing, not alone for the people of Africa but for the people of many other areas where discrimination is still practised in one form or another, that the former white rulers in Rhodesia have had the wisdom to accept what was largely inevitable.  But nevertheless they have had the wisdom to accept what is good and to abandon the form of discrimination, the form of ascendancy, imposition of power and lack of freedom on the black people of their country.  I sincerely hope that other people in similar situations around the world would have the wisdom and the foresight to realise that situations of injustice which do exist and have been the cause of different kinds of wars, are the things which promote strife, aggression and war and that they ought to be ended.  Unfortunately, it is very often not in the power of those who want to see settlements unless some gleam of reason can penetrate the minds of those who have been in positions of great authority which has been used wrongly against other people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the people of Zimbabwe and wish them a future of peace, stability and development in economic terms so that they will be able to provide for their people what they are entitled to, the right to work, to marry, to have families and to live their lives peacefully in their own country.</P>

      <P>I had the privilege of spending two weeks in Zimbabwe in the fortnight preceding the recent election as one of a team of observers from this country with two colleagues from the Oireachtas, Deputies Quinn and Molloy. There were observers from all the western democracies present at the invitation of the UK Government to observe the election campaign and the <Col N="96" /> election procedures with a view to forming an opinion as to whether the campaign was free from intimidation and the procedures were fair and democratic.  It was the unanimous feeling of that large corps of observers that the election was conducted in a way that gave a fair reflection of the views of the people of Zimbabwe.  There was no doubt in anybody's mind that the procedures for the election itself, the rules concerning polling and the counting of votes to ensure secrecy, were excellent.</P>
      <P>It is only proper that one should pay tribute to the Government of the United Kingdom because, so far as we could observe, no expense was spared and no administrative effort was avoided to ensure that the elections would be as free and fair as possible.  That expense and effort were rewarded.  I think it is only right that the government who arranged it should have that publicly acknowledged.  All the observers who visited the country formed a great affection for Zimbabwe.  The environment and above all the friendly and efficient Zimbabwean people, both black and white, contributed to a memorable visit. There was considerable apprehension on the part of many of the white population that Robert Mugabe would win the election. I think that apprehension resulted from the propaganda of their own establishment which, understandably, during the length of the war had presented its opponent in the bush as a Marxist ogre and the white population, to some extent, were victims of their own propaganda.  It is equally true that that delusion is being quickly removed and sensible people must come to see that the people of the country have elected an outstanding leader, a man of patent ability and patent magnanimity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steps towards reconciliation were already taking place during our visit there, notably in the integration of the guerrilla armies with their former white opponents.  A Belgian colleague told me that he witnessed what he considered to be an extraordinary scene where in one of the assembly camps a guard of honour composed of white Rhodesian <Col N="97" /> soldiers and black guerrillas was formed to be inspected by General Walls and Mr. Nkomo and each of them made speeches to the assembled troops telling them that the fighting was finished, it was in the past and that reconciliation was the order of the day.  It was quite an extraordinary scene and, indeed, one that we in this country where we still tend to fight the divisions of over 50 years ago could take a lesson from.</P>
    <P>I think that spirit is going to inure in Zimbabwe and that any bitterness on the part of any elements of the white and, indeed, the black population who would have reason to be bitter for personal suffering they may have had to endure during the war, will disappear and there will come to be a recognition of the potential of the very beautiful country, very rich country in terms of its resources, a country that even at this stage of its development is efficient and well run, is spotlessly clean and represented to somebody coming from this island in the winter, a very pleasant contrast.  I have no doubt that those people are realistic enough to realise that they are living in a country with a great potential where all the people can develop and where they can have very full lives.</P>
    <P>I hope that democracy which has been in the past a very fragile plant in some emerging African countries will flourish in Zimbabwe.  I think there is a will on the part of the majority party ZANU-PF to ensure that it does, in the way that a coalition between all the erstwhile conflicting parties has been so readily formed.  We should not be surprised in the western world if we find that their democracy differs from ours in the sense that it may not be a multiparty democracy and that the democratic parties may work within a single party.  The landslide victory of Robert Mugabe was so great that the other parties may inevitably&mdash;and not through any positive action of his&mdash;wither for lack of popular support and it may become a one party State but I would be confident having spoken not to Robert Mugabe himself but to senior members in his party that even <Col N="98" /> if that were to happen the principles of democracy would still be available and practised within a one party State.  There will, of course, be a minority white opposition party but, hopefully, the ideal would be integration between all people in a political way.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence and every optimism that Zimbabwe will go from strength to strength and that the people in it will have a way of life that will be the envy&mdash;not merely of the Continent of Africa&mdash;but of the Continent of Europe as well and I have great pleasure in supporting this motion and offering our congratulations to the new nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join the other speakers in congratulating the people of Zimbabwe on achieving their freedom, their freedom from colonial domination, their freedom from the domination of one section of the community by the other.  What has been achieved really is more than one could have hoped for a few years ago and the fact that it has been achieved with little or no bloodshed or upheaval over the last few months is something for which we must all be extremely grateful.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the restraint which has been shown by the new Government, as Senator Keating said, the magnanimous views which they have expressed, there is every hope that not only will it be a free country but it will be a country in which the divisions of up to now will fairly quickly be put to one side and there will be a united country as well as a free one, which certainly could be a great example to the other countries in South Africa and Africa generally.  As a member of the anti-apartheid movement for many years past, it is particularly gratifying to me to feel that this part of Africa is no longer a problem area, that it will no longer be an area in which-apartheid will operate.  It is very satisfying to know that it will no longer be a problem area, an area of concern and I hope the developments in that country will hasten the day when apartheid will no longer be a problem in any part of Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> I would like to think that the anti-apartheid movement in this country and in other contries has played even a small part in achieving what has been achieved in Zimbabwe in the last few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with all the other Members of the House in supporting this very timely motion and congratulate those Senators who proposed and seconded it.  The fact that this country has emerged after bloodshed and discrimination leading to, eventually, a peace conference in London and because of the very divergent views, a difficult peace conference, is important. It has got off to an excellent start and sets a headline showing that, after the bloodshed, differences can be settled in conference.  The outstanding statesmanship of Mr. Mugabe and the leaders on his side, after his election victory, not only gives a chance for development in Rhodesia along the lines which we all would like to see but also gives another definite chance for a reasonable transition in Southern Africa as a whole.  It sets a headline and an example which we hope will not be lost on the other leaders whose countries should be moving in this direction.</P>
      <P>As Senator Cooney has said, the people in the States who helped in the birth of this new nation also deserve our congratulations, not least among them being Lord Carrington who conducted the negotiations in London.  Because of the many Irish contacts with Rhodesia, both in the past and hopefully in the future, we will feel that we ourselves as a nation are committed to helping the development of this new nation in many ways through aid, through our development organisations and through the many personal contacts which in the end can prove to be the most important and most fruitful and I look forward myself to long and deep relations developing between our nation and the new Zimbabwe.</P>

      <P>I too would like to <Col N="100" /> join in supporting the motion and in welcoming the development in Zimbabwe. It is one of the most hopeful international political matters that has occurred for many years.  It is very pleasant indeed that it should happen at a time when so much ill in the international situation, as we ourselves tragically know, is occurring throughout the world.  It is very, very pleasant to see a peaceful solution of a conflict which even a few short months ago seemed almost totally insoluble.  I think it gives great hope for Southern Africa as a whole.  Here we have a situation in which a Government of the people of Zimbabwe has been democratically elected, the democratically elected leader has behaved with great statesman-like attitudes and has succeeded both in satisfying the rightful aspirations of the majority population of Zimbabwe and yet at the same time seems also to have succeeded in the almost irreconcilable task of ensuring that the technically advanced white population of Zimbabwe is apparently willing and glad to stay on, as far as we can judge at this stage, and here we have a hope that there will be a country in Africa when, no matter what the colour of your skin, you will be accepted and you will work for the nation as a whole.  Could this possibly happen in the Union of South Africa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House have rightly condemned apartheid which is an affront to the dignity of man.  We, in this House. have condemned the situation in our own country of intolerance between one group and another.  Let us not forget that in Southern Africa we, in this country. have also supported at one time, and quite rightly supported, the Boer settlers who now, unfortunately, are practising this appalling doctrine of apartheid but we did support them when they were looking for what was then regarded as a rightful form of independence.  I would hope that the majority of them will now see the light, take this lesson from Zimbabwe and that, in the not too distant future, instead of the appalling bloodbath which seemed inevitable in Southern Africa we will have a situation where all people, the Boers, many of <Col N="101" /> whom, let us not forget, had been there since 1600&mdash;before many of the settlers in the north east of this country&mdash;and the majority population who have been so discriminated against, will work peacefully together for the prosperity of what has rightly been described as one of the most beautiful parts of the world. I wish them very well and I am very happy to join in this motion and congratulate the mover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to join in the warm welcome expressed on all sides of the House for the achievement of independence and democratic government in Zimbabwe.  I join in particular with my colleagues in welcoming the victory of Robert Mugabe and his party and the manner in which he has assumed the responsibilities of office.  My remarks can be brief because I agree so basically with the views expressed and the endorsement of the real achievement in Zimbabwe which was an achievement for humanity everywhere.  We have so many incidents of tyranny and suppression of people and oppression of individual human beings and whole races of human beings that I welcome this opportunity for a spontaneous and warm endorsement of the political achievement in Zimbabwe. Like Senator Harte I do not underestimate the economic and social problems and the challenges, challenges, for example, in relation to land ownership and structure in Zimbabwe. We must follow up our warm expressions of support and encouragement by practical measures, at Government and formal level by early diplomatic links and bilateral and European Community aid through the Lomé Convention or other means and also by informal nongovernmental aid and assistance of a technical nature.  Indeed, we should also watch very closely what happens there because we may have some lessons to learn for ourselves in what takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Leader of the House that this is something that the anti-apartheid movement in this country and in other countries can look upon as the real victory against racism because <Col N="102" /> racism itself is still prevalent in that part of Africa and the greatest answer to it is response of black majority rule coming out of a long and bitter conflict and the magnanimity and humanity shown by the present leaders in Zimbabwe.  This must encourage further pressure, political pressure and economic pressure on South Africa until there is a change in the structure of Government and the attitude there.</P>
    <P>There have been references to white supremacy and to the evils of racism.  I would like just to pay a tribute to an Irishman who has stood out with such moral courage and integrity for many years for his people of Zimbabwe and that is Bishop Donal Lamont.  It gives me particular pleasure to pay such unqualified tribute to a Catholic Bishop from Ireland.  It is not often that I feel quite so enthusiastically inclined in that regard but I think that Bishop Donal Lamont had great moral courage, fortunately a very good sense of humour and a very good personal balance and integrity to carry him through very difficult times.  He paid a very high price for his principles.  He paid the price at times of being ostracised by some other members of the white community in Rhodesia at the time and he always identified with the people of Zimbabwe.  I am glad that he now sees them emerge as an independent nation and I share his joy in their independence and I join with other Senators in wishing that country every success in the future.</P>
    <P>There is just one thought that occurred to me and that is that it would be, I think, a nice gesture, if it were possible, that the report of this debate, which has shown such agreement and warmth on all sides of the House, should be conveyed to the authorities in Zimbabwe. They know of our Irish history, our past and our aspirations and this is partly why we respond with such enthusiasm and warmth to their achievement and in particular in so far as we offer further help and support in what they are seeking to do that it will be desirable that they know as soon as possible of this expression of opinion from representatives <Col N="103" /> of the people in this House of the Oireachtas two days before they actually achieve formal independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join the proposer and seconder of this motion in extending a very warm welcome to the new State of Zimbabwe in Africa.  It is difficult to speak at this stage because all that could be said has been said.  I think we are instinctively very sympathetic in this country because of our own background and colonial dominance, a small country and a small country which has had a very strong missionary sense with the extent of Irish missionary and nursing and medical participation in developments on the African continent and to a very large extent in the country of which we speak.</P>
      <P>I strike one jarring note in relation to the present development aid going to the African continent from this country. This has been criticised greatly by leaders in the development aid movement. Our country, along with other countries in the African continent, in our state of underdevelopment needs aid from the developed world although in recent years we have achieved a remarkable status in world politics and on the world scene, for a country of three million people.  We have achieved such status as such a small country in a large globe because of strong moral positions rather than through leverage or dominance and there should be a consensus in this country, in so far as development aid is concerned, for keeping it at a much higher level than obtains at the present time.  The lack of prosperity here is an entirely relative issue in comparison with what is happening in what is described as the Third World and Fourth World.  I must say some words of criticism because our credibility in the world community is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the motion on which we are speaking, I pay a very warm compliment to the person who I think was absolutely instrumental in this peace being achieved.  I am pleased to be able <Col N="104" /> to pay it to someone from our neighbouring island.  The history of Anglo-Irish relations is such that we do not very often have the opportunity to speak in this way.  I believe that the success of the Lancaster House agreement was due, to a large extent, to Lord Carrington and the British Government. Granted, there was co-operation by the participants, but it was a tremendous personal success for Lord Carrington.  I say that in the most bi-partisan sense. He deserves the warm congratulations of the free world and the countries in the EEC for this tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>We were fortunate in this country in having three excellent representatives in the observer force in Zimbabwe in the persons of Senator Cooney, Deputies Molloy and Quinn, along with Mr. Townsend of the Foreign Affairs Department.  It is heartening to see this type of co-operation between Britain and ourselves.  The mind boggles at what might be achieved on this island if the present British Government chose similarly to deal with the events and the problems that have been intractable to date&mdash;but no more intractable than the Zimbabwean problems had seemed before the Lancaster House conference. If the British Government could raise the status of the debate on the problems concerning Northern Ireland and, indeed, all this island and give the responsibility for this huge task, from the British perspective, to Lord Carrington, we might work our way out of problems which would seem to be no less intractable than the Zimbabwean problems might have seemed to be before the agreement.</P>
    <P>Whilst we welcome this tremendous democratic achievement of the peoples of Zimbabwe under the leadership of Mr. Mugabe, the affairs of the African continent will never be satisfactory, in so far as western democracies are concerned, until such time as racism and apartheid are abolished.  There will always be trouble on the African continent until the last State practising racism falls and this country has a significant role, as a small country, to play in that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> I join with the other speakers in extending a very warm welcome to this new State and congratulate the Prime Minister, Mr. Mugabe, while realising that they must have the most horrendous problems on the horizon for all kinds of reasons that have to do with the state of their economy and the formation of their population.  We wish them well in working their way out of their difficulties in joining the nations of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Professor Keating Professor Keating">
      <NameTxt>Professor Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be extremely brief.  I ought to add my voice to that of Senator Harte in thanking the Leader of the House for making time available for this debate and, indeed, pay tribute to his own commitment down the years to the anti-apartheid movement.  I take Senator Robinson's suggestion that the contents of our debate should be brought to the attention of the new Government of Zimbabwe as quickly as possible.  What I really want to convey is, first, that this occasion represents the <Col N="106" /> greatest expression of unanimity that I can ever recall in either House of the Oireachtas in my time.  I wish the people of Zimbabwe to know the extraordinary unanimity of support that exists for them and wish to echo the theme mentioned by a number of Senators that these expressions of joy and goodwill are meaningless&mdash;and, indeed, worse than meaningless&mdash;if we do not honour the pledges of material and other aid and of solidarity with the new State.  If our words have real meaning, they will be expressed by aid of different kinds under different auspices, in relation to diplomatic recognition and, indeed, in relation to the sustenance of this new State through a time which all sides of the House have recognised as being a time of great promise but also of great difficulty in the coming decades.</P>
