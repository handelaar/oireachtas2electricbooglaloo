    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;competent person&rsquo; means a person who possesses the qualifications and/or the experience prescribed by the Minister for the purpose of the particular function which that person is required to perform under this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give a far more precise interpretation to help the exercise of this Bill.  In a number of sections in the Bill, for instance in section 10 and section 31, reference is made to a competent person being engaged by the occupier of the premises or at the request of the Minister to carry out certain tests as they may arise.  It is our contention that this interpretation of the words &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; in these sections is not precise or specific enough.  We feel that the addition to section 2, the interpretation section, of the definition of what a competent person is would make far easier and expedite the exercise of any safety precaution or test that had to be carried out in pursuance of the exercise of the section.  We are asking that the definition of &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; be written into section 2 so that the person who carries out the necessary tests or other work as required by the Act will possess the qualifications as prescribed by the Minister.  In other words, we will <Col N="463" /> know in advance the type of qualifications that a person must have to carry out any necessary tests.</P>
    <P>It can happen that in a factory a person, one of the workers indeed, can be asked by the occupier of the premises to carry out a test on certain defective machinery or plant and as a result of the report from such a test the Minister may not be satisfied as to the competence of the person who was engaged by the occupier in the first instance.  This leads to a delay which could well be avoided if a proper definition were written into the Act in the first instance.  That is the basis of our amendment to section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; is contained in section 10 (1) (a) in relation to the examination and testing of any plant which might have been the cause of an accident or dangerous occurrence, and in sections 31, 32 and 33 in relation to the examination of steam boilers, steam receivers and air receivers respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is broadly similar in its intent to amendment No. 23a of section 10 of the Bill which was tabled by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  He proposed that for the term &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; there should be substituted &ldquo;a qualified person chosen from a list of assessors supplied by the Minister&rdquo;.  The reason for not agreeing with Deputy Mitchell's amendment would obtain in the case of the Senator's amendment also.  The amendment is unacceptable because it would have the effect of reversing what is felt to be the proper sequence of events.  The prime responsibility for the safety of his employees should rest with the occupier, a responsibility which under section 10 could be shared with the owner of the plant.  Therefore, if the plant in question might have caused an accident or dangerous occurrence, the Minister should be empowered to require the occupier or owner, as appropriate, to have the plant examined and tested where that is considered necessary.  The right of the <Col N="464" /> occupier or owner to select a competent person to carry out these examinations and tests should not be restricted to choosing a person on the basis of requirements imposed by the Minister. That would be tantamount to ministerial interference with the independence of the occupier or owner.  Furthermore, it would remove the Minister's discretion to reject the report of the examinations and tests as inadequate.  It is desirable that the occupier or owner should be free to make his own arrangements for the testing of any plant in the first place.  The Minister should have to take the initiative only if and when he is not satisfied as to the adequacy of the subsequent report or the competence of the person undertaking the examinations and tests.</P>
    <P>I might add some further points specifically in relation to the Senator's amendment.  First, it might not always be possible to know in advance precisely which technical and practical qualifications would render a person competent in any particular case to carry out the functions required of him under the legislation.  For example, the results of the examination and testing by a consultant engineer could indicate that metallurgical tests are needed also.  In that event it is essential that the occupier would be free to seek the services of a metallurgist.  Secondly, the equipment needed to carry out the examination and testing could have a bearing on the selection of the competent person.  If the equipment were available only, for instance, in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, then a person from that institute who was qualified to use and had experience in the use of that equipment would be the obvious choice. The universities are another source of competent persons.  Finally, it would be a foolhardy occupier who would not envisage persons with the relevant qualifications and experience if for no other reason than that he would risk his insurance cover being withdrawn or his premium being raised considerably should the insurance company inspector become aware of what was going on.</P>
    <P>In summary I believe that the inclusion <Col N="465" /> of this definition in the Bill would be both unnecessary and potentially counter-productive.  Having examined the general and specific implications of the Senator's amendment, I am satisfied that it would be better not to have the term &ldquo;competent person&rdquo; defined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not beyond the capacity of the Minister's Department to produce guidelines which would be far more specific and more easily interpreted than the words &ldquo;competent person&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that there can be employers who may do a less than thorough job when it comes to carrying out any necessary testing operation on defective plant and equipment.  I do not believe that any employer in the first instance is going to go deliberately out of his way to carry out what would be a wrong test.  Speed is the essence in this matter of ensuring that there can be no future happenings which can endanger or possibly risk further accidents to workers in the factory.  The employer, due to the pressures of the time, may rush into engaging a person less thoroughly equipped to carry out the necessary testing that he would choose if he were giving some thought to the matter.  The Department by laying down certain guidelines in advance to the factory or industry could well ensure that there would not be any unnecessary delay as a result of testing carried out by a less than competent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment on the lines I have suggested would improve this legislation. It would avoid any unnecessary delays due to less than competent persons being employed.  The employer or the occupier when he is engaging such a person, may be acting with the best intent, but due to the circumstances of the time, perhaps pressures from the work force on the floor that tests should be carried out, he may feel that he should employ somebody straight away to do the job. He may not be giving it the necessary thought to ensure that he employs the best available person.  If guidelines were laid down in a far more specific manner than they are in this Bill, the occupier of <Col N="466" /> the premises would be in a better position to ensure that a competent person would be employed by him to do the necessary testing.</P>
    <P>The amendment would help the Bill.  It would not result in the employer taking advantage of a situation or finding that there would be undue ministerial interference in the operation of that plant. That would not be the situation.  Since we are involved in this Bill with safety and prevention of further accidents, I would not regard as ministerial interference the laying down of the qualifications a person who carries out a test should have if it is going to result in better safety measures in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a dilemma, not a very major one.  I can understand Senator Markey's concern about having the competent person described as to qualifications and so on.  On the other hand, I have a lot of faith in the people who sit as trade union representatives on safety committees, and who are the safety representatives who initiate the cause for investigation because they get in touch with the Minister.  Consequently if they are not satisfied that an inspector or somebody appointed to investigate is competent, an argument may start and then an industrial dispute may arise and the investigation does not go ahead.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the Minister can, in fact, turn down the report.  My interpretation of that is that someone would have to complain about the competence of the person and, therefore, in that respect we in the trade union movement would feel that we are covered in this area, that we have representatives on these safety committees who would initiate the cause of investigation.  If you initiate a cause for something to be looked at you are going to make sure that it is done by a competent person.  At the same time I can understand that Senator Markey would like to see it spelled out much more clearly, but the fellows there are fairly big boys who can look after themselves.  Speaking from the trade union congress point of view we would be happy enough that with the section as it is we can deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> I will have one or two things to say on other sections which will explain my attitude. A number of amendments from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been accepted by the Minister.  I do not know whether this is one of them but I am trying to interpret the section on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I find myself in this dilemma that I can see the need for the thing to be expressed in a proper way but on the other hand I can see that there is no danger that anybody who is not competent will be engaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some sense in the amendment proposed by Senator Markey.  I accept that the person on a safety committee would be a competent person.  There is no doubt about that because such a person would know what machinery was installed and a person who has worked with machinery should be competent enough to know whether that machinery is safe.  A person holding a degree would not necessarily be a competent person but a person who is involved in seeing that machinery was safe would be.  He or she could be a fitter or any person who would be on a safety committee and who would have inspected the factory.  A person who installs machinery would probably put in the machinery without regard to anything other than the cost of installing it.  There should be some person of competence there to safeguard the installation of machinery and the person on the safety committee could do that.  Senator Markey's amendment is a good one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 5, to add the following new paragraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(xx)  any premises or land in or on which people are employed in work of an agricultural or horticultural nature <Col N="468" /> including fishfarms and the employees are not members of the owner's family,</P>
    <P>(xxi)  any premises which apart from this subsection is not a factory, in which a computer is operated, or in which machines or machinery ancillary to the working of an office are operated,</P>
    <P>(xxii)  any enclosed place of entertainment in which sound-reproducing equipment is operated,</P>
    <P>(xxiii)  any kitchen or other place in which food is prepared apart from a domestic kitchen in a private house,</P>
    <P>(xxiv)  any sewage plant, sewer, pipeline or manhole,</P>
    <P>(xxv)  any other premises specified in regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Title of this Bill is a misnomer, apart from the extensive time it took from being introduced as the Safety in Industry Bill, 1978, and finishing up after today, it is hoped, as the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, which delay need not have arisen at all, as I have contended. The Minister in the course of his Second Stage speech to the Seanad made a statement that a certain case could be put that this legislation could be called an amendment to the Factories Act, 1955, and certainly it would so appear to me. The definition of &ldquo;factory&rdquo; as contained in the Factories Act, 1955, has been amended by section 3 of the present legislation to bring in the agricultural aspect, meat packaging and food processing factories.</P>
    <P>If in 1980 we are talking about such an important aspect as safety in industry we should remember that industry now embraces a far wider and more comprehensive field than it did five or ten years ago.  The amendment I have put to section 3 indicates the comprehensive field which now is covered by the title &ldquo;industry&rdquo;.  For instance, we hear of the hotel industry, the entertainment industry and the agricultural industry particularly. It is unsatisfactory that this Bill should have so few specific references to safety measures in the field of <Col N="469" /> agriculture, to the work that goes on on land every day of the year where quite an extraordinary number of accidents, many of them fatal, occur.  This Bill should be extended to embrace the categories I have indicated in my amendment, to take in the agricultural sphere, office work for instance which is the services industry, the entertainment industry, the catering industry and the other aspects I have mentioned.  To make this legislation far more embracing than it is we should add the different spheres of occupational fields I have mentioned in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to be nervous. I do not know whether I am going to wear out my welcome in County Louth.  I support the extension of the Bill to agricultural workers, offices and other areas as mentioned in the amendment. However, I am aware that this issue has been discussed extensively with both sides of industry, employers and trade unions.  There is an agreement on a working party.  I was going to put down amendments but having considered the matter I decided against doing so because I believe that the working party is important in this legislation.  A lot more legislation has to come and all the needs will not be met within the next four or five years.  The working party will be much more effective than the legislation itself, because it will lead to other things. Therefore, this working party on safety and health appeals to me.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has acceded to the request of Congress on this.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Senator Markey to allow this issue to be referred to the working party because a lot more is involved than agricultural lands and so on.  I do not want to go outside the section.  The field is so wide that, for example, when one is talking about the question of safety one has to go into the question of permits for work.  The sooner the working party get down to work the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I support Senator Markey's amendment. Regarding paragraphs (xx) and (xxi) it may be very difficult to make these work <Col N="470" /> because the monitoring of them may be very difficult indeed.  Nevertheless, one should extend these definitions under the Factories Act as far as possible.  I appreciate what Senator Harte has said about the working party, but working parties can go on from year to year.  One has only to look at what happened to the Task Force on Child Care to see what can happen and how many years it may take before anything actually develops or any recommendations are made.  In the meantime, one discovers from one's own legal experience, for instance, the number of industrial accidents and the number of people injured in various places of work.  As an interim measure, in any case, the extension proposed by Senator Markey to places of entertainment where sound reproducing equipment is operated, to catering kitchens and sewage plants and so on, could very well be brought in, particularly his paragraph (xxv).  I am not generally in favour of legislation by regulation in this way, whereby Ministers are given power to put in by regulation what is not covered by legislation, but in this area where industries and conditions in factories and places of employment can change so quickly, to give power to the Minister to add in other areas of employment is important.  It would be worth while to extend these definitions to include, under (xxii), (xxiii), (xxiv) and (xxv), the proposals made by Senator Markey, even though, like Senator Harte, I hope that the working party will produce a final solution to the whole procedure.  In the meantime, to protect employees in these areas it would be a good thing to bring in these extensions of the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Markey and Senator McGuinness.  I have great respect for Senator Harte, but if we are to wait for a working party to come up with a solution to this we could be waiting for a long time.  We were waiting for a long time for this Bill, which was intrduced over two years ago and we are finalising it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must provide for the monitoring of noise levels.  It is not a big job and we <Col N="471" /> have the instrument to do that.  We should ensure that there would be some legislation regarding that.  Computers can create a lot of noise, especially in confined areas.  In places of entertainment also where people are working in very confined areas playing musical instruments there could be a noise level problem.  The Minister should accept amendment No. 2 to section 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of this amendment is similar to that of amendment No. 10a which was tabled by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage in the other House.  The reasons why that was rejected at that time still apply.  The Safety in Industry Bill was framed for the limited but very desirable purpose of updating the Factories Act, 1955 and it is not the appropriate vehicle for achieving what the Senator is seeking.  Secondly, the responsibility of the Department of Labour does not extend at present to the kind of premises listed in the amendment. Thirdly, it is doubtful whether the amendment of itself would be sufficient to attain fully the objective behind it. The suitability of various parts of the Bill and of the 1955 Act would need to be examined carefully, as well as the feasibility of enforcing the Acts outside the context for which they were originally drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech on Second Stage in this House I referred to the fact that arrangements had been set in train to establish the working party for the purpose of giving due consideration to occupational safety and health in a broader context than that of industry alone.  I said also that discussions would be taking place with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the FUE in relation to its composition and terms of reference.  It seems that the working party would be the appropriate forum for examination of, and recommendation on, issues such as those contained in the Senator's amendment. In this connection the Senator will recall that I said here in my reply to the discussion on Second Stage that I would arrange for copies of the parliamentary debates on the Bill to be supplied to the <Col N="472" /> working party.  We would have in mind putting a limitation on the length of time that the working party would be given to come up with recommendations.  At this stage I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply indicates the sad situation we have got into with this legislation.  It indicates what might have been.  Had safety in industry been tackled in a comprehensive manner from the outset two years ago we could have been in the position whereby the measures that I am now asking to have added to the Bill could well have been included as a piece of a normal statutory instrument covering safety in industry.  We are dealing with half measures.  The Minister says that what this Bill amounts to is an amendment to the Factories Act of 1955.  If that is what it is let it be so titled and not be called something which it cannot cover by definition.  If safety in industry means anything to me, it means that it covers the safety aspects in every sphere of what is called industry nowadays and that covers the fields of catering, agriculture, entertainment in all aspects, where people are employed and are occupied on a day-to-day basis.  What we are left with is a Bill which has only half-tackled the problem and which by leaving out what it is leaving out is perhaps more defective than what it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could never have a situation where we could expect that any Safety in Industry Bill would cover every aspect.  That is why the last paragraph, No. (xxv), of my amendment covers &ldquo;any other premises specified in regulations&rdquo;. This indicates that the Minister must always be there to publish a regulation covering new fields of industry and employment and occupation which were not there even one year before that.  We have had this sort of situation evolving over the past decade because there have been such tremendous strides in the technological and industrial fields.  People are employed in spheres of industry which were unheard of a decade ago and to find that after two years of hard enterprise we finish up with a Bill which does <Col N="473" /> more than merely amend&mdash;and improve in certain respects, I will admit&mdash;the Factories Act of 1955, but which still leaves out the more crucial part, namely, to cover safety in every sphere of employment is very disappointing.  What good is this Bill going to be to a person working on a farm next week who suffers a serious accident as a result of some defective piece of equipment? What recourse can be had to manufacturers under this Bill as regards that piece of agricultural equipment if the field of agriculture is not covered?  We are finishing up with a Bill which is far more defective than it should be after the lengthy gestation period it has had.  I suggest that the Minister should in all seriousness consider the amendment that I have put down here.  If it is accepted it will result in an Act going into the Statute Book which is far more embracing and far more purposeful and will be far more helpful to people employed from day to day.</P>

It is not as comprehensive as I would wish it to be but I would ask the Minister to give some indication to us as to when he would hope to have further legislation&mdash;I do not want some vague promise saying two or three years or something like that.  When can we hope to have this working party complete their work?  There must be certain submissions in the Department that were received in the course of this Bill going through the Houses which will facilitate the work of the working party.  When can we hope to have legislation which will embrace all fields of employment and industry that I indicated in my amendment?</P>

      <P>I would like to assure Senators that this Bill is a beginning rather than an end.  It is really a start and we certainly will be having some discussions immediately with Congress and the FUE in connection with the establishment of the working party and be getting down to work.

      <P>I should just like to make a point on this section in connection with the aspect of noise which this section covers.  I would associate it with section 13 of the Bill.  I am a bit confused as regards which section is going to have the greater relevance and the greater priority in regard to the implementation of the safety aspects of this Bill.  I know we are dealing with section 5, but section 13 also covers the same aspect of noise. Section 5 appears to be a little bit stronger in the amendment of the Principal Act that is written in here than section 13 in regard to this noise problem.  I shall speak further on that point when we come to section 13 but I would like some indication from the Minister in regard to which section will have priority as regards implementation and effect for people as regards this noise problem. The wording is less satisfactory in one of the sections than it is in the other and yet both are covering the same thing.</P>

      <P>Would special regulations be likely to cover the actual technical level of the noise involved?  The way in which noise is described here is slightly vague.  It is perfectly possible to monitor noise levels and this has been frequently done by scientists in various areas.  Regulations of some kind would be necessary to actually monitor the levels of noise.</P>

      <P>This is just a change in wording from the 1955 Act.  In subsection (1) paragraph (c) the wording is &ldquo;he shall not intentionally interfere with...&rdquo; The wording in the 1955 Act is &ldquo;he shall not wilfully...&rdquo;  I wonder what has been the experience of the Department when they change the wording like that.  By and large, this is a far stronger section than anything contained in the 1955 Act and I accept it and welcome it.  It places an obligation on the employee which was not there in the 1955 Act.  If it was there, it was more or less only implied rather than specifically spelt out.  It is a far stronger section than anything that applied in the 1955 Act.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, line 40, to delete &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;within five days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What I would like to see operating under this section is a time limit for the result of the test to be available to be submitted to the Department and to be acted upon. This is important if we are to have a situation whereby danger of future accidents occurring can be avoided and reduced in the meantime.  I am asking that the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; be deleted and substituted by &ldquo;within five days&rdquo;.  I think the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is far too vague.  I think we should put a time limit on the testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision does not require the plant to be examined and tested there and then because obviously that would not always be possible.  What the provision does in effect require is that as soon as he can the occupier or owner must have the necessary arrangements made for the examination and testing of the plant.  There is every reason to feel confident that these arrangements will be made forthwith.  On the one hand the occupier would be anxious to have it ascertained whether or not there might have been statutory negligence on his part, in which case legal proceedings could be taken against him, or whether or not in the event of a fatal accident, for instance, there might have been contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. On the other hand, the occupiers' insurance company would be pressing to have it ascertained whether or not, for example, it was the design that was at fault, in which case there might not be grounds on which to bring proceedings to court to recover damages against the occupier.  That is the first point I would like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as I understand it, the Senator is proposing that the examination and tests can be done within five <Col N="477" /> days.  I could not accommodate him here because in fact, depending on the examination and tests which the competent person considers appropriate for the particular case, it could take longer than five days to carry them out effectively.  For example, where a control unit was concerned it might be necessary to build a replica of it to simulate the action of dangerous currents.  Another example would be where the examination and tests carried out by a consulting engineer might not alone be sufficient and a metallurgist would need to be called in for further tests.  These are just two examples to show how a limit of five days could be too restrictive, and in view of these reasons I would not be prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that the Minister in saying that the occupier would carry out the tests as soon as he can is leaving a certain vagueness in the matter.  As I indicated earlier, the owner of the factory can be under certain pressures at a particular time and it is something that he may just decide to leave for a while.  We do not want that to happen.  The purpose of this amendment is to get the tests under way.  I accept that the test, if it started might take two days or even a week; complications may occur, but the whole purpose of the amendment is to get the test under way within five days.  That five-day period is sufficient time for the occupier of the factory to get himself organised and straightened out after the accident and to make whatever arrangements have to be made to get tests done by a competent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that writing in &ldquo;within five days&rdquo; takes away freedom of the person in any instance nor would it inhibit in any way the operations of the insurance company.  Insurance companies, in my experience of them, sometimes do not seem to act with that great haste that one would like in these matters and I do not think we should expect them, in the sphere of industry, to act more quickly than they would in other spheres.  I believe that giving a limitation period to <Col N="478" /> this section of five days would ensure that, first of all, the plant-owner must get himself organised straight away.  He has a period; five days is an adequate and reasonable period of time for him to get over the accident and to make arrangements for testing and it is not inhibiting in any way the insurance company from acting.  It can be done in a shorter period than five days if they so wish, but at least it prevents a test being deferred for more than that period, and that is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly see nothing wrong with the five days for the purpose of this Bill, but when I was speaking earlier I mentioned how broad were the implications of the whole question of safety.  I said that I did not think it would embrace all that is necessary adequately to cover safety and health under one piece of legislation.  Take this section. Whilst I can agree with the five days, five days would not satisfy me unless legislation emerges arising out of this particular section to provide that somebody in the plant would sign a document to the effect that the plant or machinery was not to be worked once a major accident happened, for example, if someone was killed or injured.  That is the type and the extent of the question of safety and health we have to think about. I agree with the five days for the purpose of this legislation, but since you cannot get the other major provision into this type of legislation without further in-depth study of exactly how we should go about it, I have no great quibble over the seven days but I would support the idea of five days.  I cannot see that either of the two makes any difference.  To me the major thing is that you can get the legislation on to the Statute Book and get on to the type of legislation that will emerge from this legislation to halt the working of the plant or machinery involved in a serious or fatal accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, one of my own experiences in dealing with people as a trade union official was that a person just walked into a tunnel, a pipe went right through his eye and killed him.  Immediately, arrangements were made to <Col N="479" /> shut off that plant.  Unless you have some protection like that and some written provision many employers will not do that.  Therefore, the question of the five or seven days is to me not of tremendous importance; it is what will emerge eventually from it that I look for.  I support the five days provision.  I cannot see anything wrong with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the section and the Minister can be helped by specifying a brief period like five days.  It seems to me the real power of this section lies in subsection (1) itself, that where there is an accident&mdash;and it may be a major one or it may be a minor one&mdash;it does give the Minister power to issue notice in writing requiring, as is stated in paragraph (a), that the area or equipment be tested forthwith.  The issuing of that notice is the real power in this, because the owner or occupier and indeed the insurance company are both under notice once that notice is issued.  I do not think it is necessary to tie it down to five days or seven days as Senator Harte said.  The provision contained there seems to me to be adequate.</P>

      <P>The occupier has a legal duty put on him under section 10 to have these arrangements carried out straight away.  As I have already explained, the test or testing could take more than five days, and certainly &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is a very strong term, according to our legal advice.</P>

It all hinges on the meaning of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;. &ldquo;Forthwith&rdquo; to my mind means as soon as can be humanly possible to do it, and I do not think we could have a better word there than &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.  It is far stronger as it is than by specifying any number of days.</P>

Subsection (3) refers to the adequacy of the report, the competence of the person, the adequacy of the examination, but it does not refer at all to any delay in the test being carried out, and if it is requested &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;, how long is one to wait for the Minister to chase after the plant-owner to make sure that the test has been carried out and the report submitted? I would accept that the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; would be strong enough if there was a provision in the section whereby the Minister would be able to chase after the plant-owner within a certain period of time if there has not been any action in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 of the Factories Act, 1955, deals with safe means of access and safe place of employment.  As Senator Markey will have seen, the purpose of section 12 of the Bill is to improve on the existing provisions in this regard, by the addition of more stringent requirements.  For example, it will now be necessary to have a safe means of egress from as well as a safe means of access to, every place at which any person has at any time to work.  When consultations with both sides of industry <Col N="482" /> took place between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, the Irish Employers' Confederation made the point that, in some cases, effective compliance with that new requirement could entail having to make physical alterations to premises, and that planning permission could therefore be involved.  If there was any delay in getting the requisite planning permission occupiers could as a consequence, and through no fault of their own, be in breach of statutory obligations placed on them by section 12.  There was a valid point here; so, after seeking legal advice on how best to deal with it, subsection (3) was added to section 12 at Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil.  This subsection will, effectively, give occupiers two years&mdash;after section 12 is brought into force&mdash;in which to comply with its requirements, since during those two years legal proceedings will not be taken against an occupier for failure to comply with them.  The period of two years was felt to be sufficient by the employers' side, and the trade union side did not raise any objections.</P>
      <P>This is the background to section 12 subsection (3).</P>

      <P>Who determines in this instance the sound levels to ensure that noise in the factory is such as not to be likely to injure the hearing or otherwise adversely affect the health of persons employed?  I would prefer far stronger wording on this, something on the lines of what is in section 5, whereby a particular level would be indicated or written into this section.  In other words, any factory owner would have to know in advance that a particular level of noise pertained to his factory and it was <Col N="483" /> his business to ensure that that particular level would not be exceeded. The wording of section 13, as it is, is too weak in that it does not seem to indicate who determines the level of noise under the section.  Is it left to the discretion and judgment of the occupier of the plant or factory himself?  Does he just say: &ldquo;I do not think the noise is excessive&rdquo;?  We know in regard to this problem of noise that it is a very particular and individualistic matter.  What is not noise to one person is excessive noise to another person.  I would prefer if this section included stronger wording whereby a particular level of noise would be appropriate to a particular factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Noise is, in fact, becoming a very major problem and industrialists in general and employers have not been taking it seriously for very long.  There have been from the trade union point of view generally very effective arguments at plant level trying to find out what is the most effective way of reducing noise levels at work.  Obviously the best way to tackle it is at source, particularly where you are dealing with noisy machines such as generators and so on.  There are ways of reducing it: you can have soundproof shields, absorbant lined booths fitted near the offending machines and, of course, there is the question of ear muffs. It does not begin and end at that.  All of those things are negotiable or arguable under the protective clothing provision when you are discussing the conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question is a very serious one.  One argument is that 90 decibels is the limit one can endure; there is the question of the deafening range, the risk range, the safety range and the silent range.  It is a very wide field.  Then there is the question of the type of offenders or the type of protection against noise, the type of offenders to the health of the person or the type of defenders against noise.  So it is a very extensive area that needed examination.  The section itself merely deals with the question of what has already taken place at industrial <Col N="484" /> level, but it does give more effect to the people who have to go in and argue from the trade union point of view at least.  It does give them certain support, and we welcome this section.</P>
    <P>Again it does not go far enough.  As I said on the early sections, it is very necessary to start working as quickly as possible to get into these other areas where, in fact, we can have a good look at the whole extent of the problem of noise alone.  It might be necessary in the final analysis in view of developments and effects on people's hearing to introduce some sort of legislation.  I am not suggesting for one moment that rock groups are going to be put under the Factories Act or anything like that, but, when you are working in an atmosphere all day with a lot of noise sometimes it is not very tolerable to wear ear muffs and it is not very comfortable for somebody who has to do very arduous work.  So the section is acceptable to us in the way it is framed because it gives us a little bit more muscle in arguing with the employer to bring in those protections that I mentioned but it is not the end of the legislation.  It is the beginning of it in this area of noise.  It may well be necessary to have some specific legislation in this area but for the moment I welcome the section and look forward to the question being thrown into the area of the working party as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section in relation to noise and noise levels. We must face up to noise in the modern world.  It is a dreadful thing.  The volume of noise is measured in decibels and the human ear can take so many decibels of sound.  Not alone is excessive noise injurious to the eardrums and to the hearing but it also has a very dangerous effect on many human beings.  Excessive noise causes what I might call a sort of drunkenness and recklessness.  Proof of that existed before this noise problem occurred at all.  We all know of certain parts of Africa where local tribes, before going to war, beat their tom-toms.  In places not quite as far away as Africa tom-toms are beaten too on a certain day in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> In the first line of section 13 the words mentioned are &ldquo;the occupier of a factory or specified premises&rdquo;.  I wonder could we include under the heading &ldquo;specified premises&rdquo; many dancehalls and discotheques because the noise level in those places is even in excess of what we would have in the worst run factory.  I would be very pleased to hear that this section would take in dancehalls and discotheques where the noise is so often at such an intolerable level with very injurious effects to the people who are condemned to listen to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert</NameTxt>
      <P>This section underlines the importance of the safety committee and the fact that a medical representative should be a member of the safety committee.  There is such a variation in opinions on noise levels but obviously a medical doctor attached to an industry would have a feed-back on the human problems within the factory.  Therefore there should always be a medical representative on the safety committee.</P>

      <P>The special regulations on noise have already been made under section 71 of the Factories Act, 1955.  There are some doubts as to the Minister's powers to make regulations under section 71 of the 1955 Act and as to the effectiveness of the regulations themselves. If either of those doubts prove to be justified then fresh regulations could be made under section 13 of this Bill.  The level of decibels was at 90 when the regulation was made in 1975.  At the same time we will keep the position under review.  Depending on the outcome of research the 90 decibles could be lowered later by further regulations under section 13.  Because the decibel levels could be changed it is better to make provisions by regulations rather than to put some specific standard in the Act.</P>

      <P>The Factories Act, 1955, is amended to include either a supply of hot and cold water or a supply of warm water, a rather mundane matter in relation to cleanliness and safety measures in a factory.  But it creates a certain doubt in my mind that the inclusion of this may well mean the exclusion of something else.  It is necessary first of all to read section 53 (1) of the Factories Act, 1955, which reads:</P>
      <P>There shall be provided and maintained for the use of employed persons adequate and suitable facilities for washing which shall include soap and clean towels or other suitable means of cleaning or drying,</P>
      <P>So far, so good.  The addition of provision for either a supply of hot and cold water or a supply of warm water might not be regarded as necessary if the word &ldquo;soap&rdquo; is used as in the 1955 Act.  But there are certain cleansing creams which are available and which can be used in certain jobs and factories.  I wonder whether the inclusion of the words &ldquo;hot and cold water or a supply of warm water&rdquo; may mean that the facility of a cleansing cream alone might be excluded. I would like some assurance that it does not so mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 16 of the Bill is to amend section 53 (1) of the 1955 Act by providing that the washing facilities mentioned in section <Col N="487" /> 53 (1) will now have to include either a supply of hot and cold water or a supply of warm water.  This additional requirement is not considered unreasonable but should there be cases where it might prove to be so exceptions from the requirements of section 53 may be provided for by way of regulations made by the Minister for Labour under subsection (3) of that section.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the number of cases where employees suffer from industrial dermatitis from the use of, say, cement, or other items like this, what Senator Markey says is in relation not so much to cleansing creams as to protective creams that are available to employees.  To refer just to hot and cold water or warm water is perhaps a primitive way of looking at it.  There are certain technical preparations that can protect people against these forms of dermatitis which may later give rise to actions against their employers.  Perhaps in framing a section like this we should allow for the provision of protective or cleansing creams as well as hot and cold or warm water because in some cases hot or cold water is not sufficient to protect against the kind of dermatitis that arises in these industries.</P>

There are other sections in the Bill which I hope to speak on later which deal with training.  But I would like to emphasise here the absolute importance of training of all personnel involved in safety in industry, because there is really no point in us setting up a Bill which provides for safety committees and safety representatives and so on if the safety representatives are not sufficiently trained in the area in which they are working to understand what exactly they are supposed to be carrying out and what exactly they are supposed to be guarding against.  On this section I would simply like to emphasise that the training of the people working at machines is very important, but the training of all personnel involved in this area is equally important.</P>

      <P>I notice a change in the wording here.  I suppose, depending on the angle one takes, it could be a very important or not so important change. Section 31 states that a woman or young person shall not clean any part of a prime mover, and so on.  This has now been changed and the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; has been omitted.  I would like some indication from the Minister about the omission of the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo;.  There is now a prohibition here about a young person not doing certain work.  Now, by leaving out the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; we are authorising the employer of a factory to have a woman do certain work as far as I can see and yet it is work which can be dangerous.  It depends on the angle one takes, but perhaps we should have some indication from the Minister about the thinking behind that.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious section from the point of view of escape routes and so on in industry.  There is a certain amount of protection for people in industry in the sense that they have <Col N="490" /> organisations to function through.  I would like to take up a point that was made earlier on by one of the other Senators.  The Act is described as an Act for securing further provisions for the safety, health and welfare of persons at work.  Does a rock performer come under this definition of a person at work? Let us look at it.  I risked going into one of these places on one occasion&mdash;but never again.  People are actually crowded five and six abreast across a small room where there is no escape route whatever. That is something that we must keep seriously in mind.  The means of escape should be covered.  If it is not possible to do so in this legislation, we should appoint another working party towards that area, because it is a very dangerous situation.  In fact there is one place on the north side of the city which has gone on fire twice.  I do not know whether anyone was hurt, but it is a very dangerous place and I am sure if an examination was made of quite a lot more of these places it would be found that a lot of teenagers are at risk.</P>

I understand that one of the problems arising in this area is that it can take a very long time to get one of these certificates. I understand that both the factory inspectors and indeed the FUE, if I may mention them in the presence of Senator Harte, are worried about this situation where it can take quite a long time to get a certificate about the method of escape in case of fire.  Generally it is because the fire service is undermanned and they simply have not time to deal with these applications as quickly as they might.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that where a premises has proper methods of escape and methods of egress in case of fire that they can get a certificate in a reasonable amount of time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am asking for here is that the meeting of the safety committee and the occupier be held every month.  It is a necessary part of the exercise of safety education as well as the safety operations in any industry that there should be regular and frequent meetings.  As I indicated on the Second Stage the experience of the 1955 Act in relation to the setting up and the operation of safety committees was that so few of them were actually instituted and functioning.  In many instances the employer may not be unduly enthusiastic about the continued functioning of the safety committees. <Col N="493" /> While this Bill does impose on employees an obligation to be far more conscious and sensitive to safety measures in their own place of work than hitherto I believe that, unless there is a certain compulsion on the safety committees to meet on a far more regular basis than six times a year&mdash;it might only be five times a year allowing for summer holidays and so on&mdash;the momentum which it is hoped this Bill will introduce into the safety field could well be lost.  I submit that safety committee meetings should be held once every month.  That is not unduly excessive as to the time lost from the place of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Markey on this.  Under a previous Act where works committees existed it was possible for them to act as safety committees. The general practice in industry is that where works committees function they actually meet once a month.  It should be possible for the Minister to accept this because, in the final analysis, it is not the Minister who will have to make it work. If he lays down that they should meet, the agreement to meet can be worked out by the employers and the trade unions. Depending on the type of employment, it might be nececsary in some cases for the employers to agree to the meetings taking place much more frequently. But once a month should be sufficient for them to meet.  I would support Senator Markey on this.  They are safety committees, after all.  They are there to police the safety regulations in the company, and if anything happens in the interim two months between meetings it can be very awkward to come to some kind of arrangement which would be satisfactory.  If the Minister could accept the one month regulation it would ease the burden on industry and on safety committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to lay down conditions which must be satisfied before safety committee meetings may be held during normal working hours without loss of remuneration to members of those committees. One of these conditions is that, except in <Col N="494" /> the case of emergency, safety committee meetings shall not be held more frequently than once every two months. However, it is important to note that all the conditions specified in subsection (7) are subject to the terms of any agreement between the relevant occupier and safety committee.  In other words it will be possible for agreements to be made which improve on conditions laid down in subsection (7).  In this connection subsection (6) requires the relevant occupier to consult with the safety committee once the safety committee has requested him to do so with the object of reaching agreement concerning various matters, including the frequency of meetings of the safety committee.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Irish Confederation of Employers will be advising its member companies to agree to the holding of safety committee meetings more frequently than once every two months where the need arises or where circumstances warrant it.  In my Second Stage speech I mentioned Part III of the Bill to which section 36 belongs.  In its present revised form joint proposals were put forward by the ICTU and ICE and subsequently approved by the Government.  Both sides of industry are therefore committed to having Part III implemented successfully.  The logical and inevitable consequence of this approach will be for them to ensure that no obstacle is put in the way of safety committees meeting as frequently as individual employers dictate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in paragraph (b) that the duration of such meetings shall not exceed two hours.  We are too restrictive in that regard.  Particularly where meetings are only held every two months there is a certain imbalance there as to the frequency of the meetings and the time given at those meetings towards safety measures.  I would certainly hope that <Col N="495" /> both trade unions and employers will seek to have written into their agreement that meetings be held every month rather than every two months.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak on the subject of training personnel. I mentioned on an earlier section that it was not sufficient just to train people who were in charge of machinery. The whole purpose of this Bill is the establishment and appointment of more safety committees and safety representatives who have obviously to some extent, failed under the 1955 Act.  We know from the Second Stage debate and from other information about this that we have about 270 safety committees out of 18,000 industries that could have them.  We are not concerned only with the establishment of safety committees which can meet statutorily every two months, but with the knowledge of the people on the safety committees, whether they know what they are doing and understand how to provide for safety in their own industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain industries, for instance, it has been found possible to train everyone, all the personnel in the industry, whether production personnel or sales personnel, in the safe operation of any instrument or any kind of machinery involved in their industry.  This is the kind of high standard which should be set before all industries.  Perhaps this is not something which can be brought about by the Bill as now drafted but the proposed working committee should look carefully into the qualifications of the people who serve on safety committees. They should not be statutorily appointed <Col N="496" /> and then we say: &ldquo;There are x workers and x representatives of management on the safety committee. They must meet every two months.  We have fulfilled our obligations under the Act.&rdquo;  To provide a real safeguard for workers in the industry, and indeed also a real safeguard for employers against actions taken by workers employed by them, all the people involved in safety committees and as safety representatives should be trained properly in the whole operation of their industries so that they know what they are talking about and are not just there to fulfil their obligations under the Act, that they will really protect their fellow workers.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the inability of local authorities to discharge their functions in the provision of housing and the maintenance of roads and deplores the Government policy that has led to this situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Connolly on his appointment as Minister of State and to wish him very well in his office.</P>
      <P>The motion I moved on behalf of other members of my party refers to the inability of the local authorities to discharge their functions in the provision of housing and the maintenance of roads.  It deplores the Government's policy which has led to this situation and which was brought about solely because of a lack of finance.  It is not hard to know why local authorities are short of money.  One thinks of the Fianna Fáil manifesto prior to the general election, the document they put before the electorate and which the electorate accepted and endorsed.  It promised the abolition of rates on dwelling houses, car tax and wealth tax.  The fact that money is not being made available to local authorities from the Department of the Environment is causing the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known the Minister of State since I came into this House and I am hopeful that he will do something in the Department to ensure that more money is made available to local authorities from the Central Fund.  There are cutbacks in the Departments of the Environment, Health, Education, Agriculture and several other places.  These are causing great problems.  I do not think there is any problem as great as that created for the local authorities. They are asked to provide sanitary services, housing, fire services, local improvement schemes, maintenance and reconstruction of roads.  With the limited amount of money made available to them they cannot provide all those services. A grant was introduced by the Government known as the environment grant amenity scheme for public parks, and so on.  Of 60 per cent of the people <Col N="499" /> employed under this scheme, one in four must be under 25 years of age.  Money is well spent on public parks.  I am not taking anything from them.  The amenity grant scheme is probably money well spent.  At the same time, it is far more necessary to spend money on the roads because of the condition they are in.  The capital allocation available for housing, sanitary services, fire services and local improvement schemes is very limited. Money will have to be provided because they are all essential services.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that the Department of the Environment should have control over local authorities.  Local authorities themselves, as they will point out, have very little say at the moment. The Exchequer is now bearing the cost since the removal of rates on private dwelling houses, secondary schools and community halls.  The local authorities will receive the amount of money they spent some three years ago, plus 10 per cent.  A figure of 10 per cent, or thereabouts, is a very small increase when one thinks how inflation is now drifting.  Some people are talking about 20 per cent by the end of the year.  Some people are talking about an inflation rate of 21 per cent or 22 per cent.  Having regard to the increase in wages and salaries, and in the price of materials in the order of 25 per cent to 30 per cent, and in the case of some materials much higher, automatically this means much less work is being done.  I am afraid people will get up in arms about this, and it is understandable.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it is a matter for local authorities to determine the priorities of services in their yearly programme.  Local authorities are quite capable of determining priorities, but they have no means of getting money. Money is not provided and, where money is urgently needed they cannot find it, because they are limited to 10 per cent.  At the same time, they have increases in staff costs, increased demands from agricultural committees, increased demands from vocational committees, increased demands from health boards, and increased demands from the Office <Col N="500" /> of Public Works for drainage work.  I think it was in 1978 that we got an increased demand for drainage work as high as 58 per cent.  At the same time, the increase we were getting over the previous year's figure is 10 per cent. When that happens it is impossible for local authorities to carry on.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities are becoming very dissatisfied with the whole situation.  The public are demanding better service for maintenance and improvement of public roads, footpaths, piped water supply, rubbish dumps, provision and maintenance of houses for tenants, fire services and amenities schemes.  You go into an ordinary local authority estimate meeting and meet the manager and his staff who have prepared the estimate for the coming year.  The manager prepares his estimate on figures given to him by members of the local authority over the year showing what they want money for. When money is provided for roads maintenance you cannot get anything to maintain a footpath, and so on.  All the money is used for roads which are run down.  Roads have been deteriorating over the past three years.  In some local authority areas, and even here in the city, there does not seem to be money available to repair potholes. Local authorities concern themselves solely with trying to keep the roads up to a certain standard.  There is very heavy traffic using our roads now.  Road tax was taken off cars but not off lorries, and lorry costs are increasing substantially because of the increased cost of fuel, and so on.  The tax on some of these lorries is £600 or £800 per year, and surely they are entitled to a good roads service.</P>
    <P>If local authorities are to be limited to an increase of 10 per cent, the same limit will apply across the board to the Office of Public Works and the health boards. A figure of 10 per cent is not enough to meet the demands on local authorities for wages and materials.  The demand from the Office of Public Works could be between 10 per cent and 40 per cent. The local authorities have no right to ask these people what they did with the <Col N="501" /> money last year, what they will do with it next year, or how it will be spent.  It is all spent on drainage areas, areas that have been undergoing arterial drainage work, and county councils are obliged to take them over or make a contribution towards the full cost of maintenance. They have no say in the formulation of drainage policy.</P>
    <P>If the 10 per cent applies to local authorities, it also applies to the health boards.  The local authority of which I am a member are unable to meet the substantial demands made by the health boards for supplementary welfare services, the services of the staff of the county medical officer and community welfare officers.  I have not the figure for that percentage, but it is much higher than 10 per cent.  It could be 15 per cent or 20 per cent.  At the same time, the local authority are limited to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have to provide new services under the Water Pollution Act and modern fire services and so on.  They are being asked by the people they represent to provide water supplies to rural houses, to build more houses, to improve and maintain the roads.  There is no way that this can be done.  The responsible Minister will have to take a serious look at what can be done about this.</P>
    <P>Sanitary services are a big problem in rural Ireland.  My local authority prepared a new five-year development plan.  Last year we submitted it to the Department of the Environment.  The estimated cost was £4,369,000.  This year we got an allocation of £77,000.  This is not being sensible.  I hope the Minister will consider how more substantial moneys can be provided.  The Minister issued a circular to each local authority about charging for services and suggested that local authorities should charge people who have water supplies. If that charge happens, we will be taking money from people who are already paying rates.  Perhaps the motive behind the circular is to bring back rates in a mild form.  I saw recently in a paper that some consideration is being given by the Department of the Environment to charging everybody a water rate.  There <Col N="502" /> is not much difference in paying a water rate and paying rates on a house.</P>
    <P>Every local authority in rural Ireland was hoping that money would have been provided this year for maintaining, reconstruction and repair of bog roads because everything should be done to encourage people to cut turf due to the cost of other energy sources such as oil and coal.  Some people almost cannot afford to buy either oil or coal.  Numbers of people from built-up areas come to my county and neighbouring counties to cut turf.  The roads leading into these bogs are hardly passable, and money should have been provided for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, according to a public announcement from the Department or the Minister for the Environment, house repairs and improvement grants have been terminated except grants for mentally handicapped persons, and the amount of grant available to them is £2,400 or two-thirds of the cost whichever is the lower.  Grants are still available for essential repairs and for group water and sewerage schemes. Grants for water supplies or water and sewerage to houses have been cut out completely from 1 February last, as have repairs or improvement grants, reconstruction grants, bathroom and toilet grants, grants for septic tanks and the provision of water to private houses. Some local authorities who have a number of houses without water and sewerage were hoping that the Department of the Environment would make grants available to them.  These houses were built years ago, and it is essential that these services should be in every house.</P>
    <P>In a number of local authority houses built six or seven years ago there is now overcrowding.  I know of a case where originally three people were living in a three-bedroomed house.  Now there are nine people living in the house and there is no means whereby money can be got to add a few rooms to that house.  It is a desperate situation.  A number of houses were built without chimneys, and the people in them will now not get a grant for chimneys.  In 1978 25,000 grants <Col N="503" /> were given for reconstruction and 18,000 for water and sewerage, and these did a tremendous amount of good in rural areas.  They also gave part-time employment to small farmers who reconstructed houses and put in water and sewerage.  In 1973 11,000 houses were reconstructed and in 1978 the figure was 25,000.  It is a pity that reconstruction grants and water and sewerage grants have been withdrawn. The Minister for Education has reconsidered the decision on the school buses. The Minister here should have another look at this.</P>
    <P>The number of local authority houses being built now has dropped.  There were 8,794 local authority houses built in 1975.  In 1977 the number was 6,333, in 1978 it was 6,073 and in 1979, it was 6,214.  Money allocated so far this year to my local authority shows that there is going to be a reduction in the number of houses built this year.  It seems that that trend is going to continue, and one must keep in mind that the withdrawal of reconstruction and water and sewerage grants will mean more people going to their local authorities looking for houses. It will cost the Department of the Environment more to rehouse these people than to give them the £600 maximum grant for reconstruction.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the Minister for the Environment to say that he is now making money available in loans instead of grants, but there is a difference between a loan and a grant.  A grant is an incentive, a loan is a burden.  Grants will have to be brought back or else housing will become a major problem.  In 1976 the average cost of a house was £12,258 and in 1979 the cost of the same house was £23,688.  What will it cost in 1980 with costs still rising?  Cement has doubled in price since this time last year.  The maximum local authority loan is £10,000. The repayment on that is £1,500 a year for the maximum number of years, £128.38 per month or £29 per week.  The income of a person who would qualify for a loan from a local authority is £5,500 and the poor law valuation for farmers <Col N="504" /> is £44.  That loan is subsidised and anybody who would have to borrow money outside of the local authority would have repayments much higher than that.  Reconstruction loans are available up to £4,000 provided that the person applying for the loan has adequate security.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is meant by &ldquo;adequate security&rdquo;.  Maybe it is the deeds of the house so that the local authority would have first charge on it. If it is the deeds of the house you would find the deeds of that house lodged against the original loan, and the only unsecured loan the borrower can get then is £1,000 and God knows £1,000 will not do very much in reconstructing a house nowadays.  Very few people, if any, will have adequate security if I am right in my thinking of what is meant by &ldquo;adequate security&rdquo;. People cannot afford to provide their own houses.  Even people in the higher income group, who are prepared to borrow from a building society or a bank, will find that the money is not there.  A bank will give them a very short period, roughly 10 to 12 years, to repay it, and the amount of repayment there is going to be prohibitive.  The building business at the moment is on the way to folding up.  I know that because I happen to be closely associated with this business.  People cannot afford to buy and they cannot afford to pay people to do the jobs.  It is a serious situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The position confronting local authorities is that with the cost of wages, materials and so on having risen by something of the order of 30 per cent they have to meet the responsibilities with an increase of 10 per cent in revenue.  That puts them into a next to impossible position.  To be fair in assessing the problem confronting the authorities, the circular from the Department to county councils at the time of the Estimates meeting indicated that new valuations would bring in on an average an increase of 3.8 per cent and that in fact the 10 per cent increase would be almost 14 per cent.  However, there are counties where the increase for new <Col N="505" /> valuations does not measure up to 3.8 per cent.  There are some where this increase does not measure up to 2 per cent.  These counties and areas are at a disadvantage, taking the question in the context of the circular from the Department. Some county councils drew the Minister's attention to this and asked as a concession that the shortfall in their cases would be increased by way of supplementary grant to bring them up to the region of 14 per cent increase.  These requests, as far as I know, were turned down, and certainly they have not been granted yet.</P>
      <P>The system of basing the amount of money allocated to a county council on poor law valuation in that county results in a continuing difficulty in areas of low valuation.  This is a big problem that will have to be examined sometime in the near future.  The system of basing revenue on the poor law valuation of the county means that right from the outset some areas are at a disadvantage and will not have any hope of being able to provide the services that are available in other parts of the country, with the resultant growing discontent in these particular areas and in some cases a desire to migrate from them.</P>
      <P>I should have said at the outset that I join with Senator Reynolds in congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment and wishing him good luck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want the Minister and his officials to look into is that at the time when railway services and branch lines were cut down and some areas of the country&mdash;in some cases whole counties&mdash;were left without any rail service whatever, an undertaking was given that areas left in that situation would get special consideration regarding the amount of money to be allocated to those areas under the Road Fund. County Cavan is a county with no rail service whatever except through the town of Kingscourt, which is on the border of Cavan and Meath.  It is the considered and unanimous view of members of Cavan County Council that the industrial development of our county is retarded for want of a proper road structure <Col N="506" /> in substitution for a rail service.  As recently as the last meeting of the county council in Cavan a week or so ago, attention was drawn to this and executives were asked by the council to get in touch with the Department and point out this grievance in the hope that the Minister would honour the undertaking given some years back when the rail branch lines were cut off.  The position with regard to the roads is difficult, and not just for the reason I gave already, that 30 per cent increase in costs has to be met with a 10 per cent, 12 per cent or in some cases 14 per cent increase in revenue.  It goes back a bit further than that.  The winter of 1978-79 was the most severe probably in a century.  That had a very serious effect on the road structure in this country.</P>
    <P>Damage caused to the roads during that severe winter has not yet been made good because the funds have not been available.  Another point is that for a long period roads in most parts of the country were ice-bound and a considerable amount of county council money was spent on gritting the roads to make them negotiable during the frost. The result was that the councils did not have adequate money to carry out the maintenance programme last year. There is a carry-over of these bad conditions into this year when again the money is inadequate and the roads in many parts of the country are in a very bad state.  The councils and the executives of the councils are at their wits' end to know what can be done with the restricted money available to make conditions even tolerably good.  That is the position that county engineers, county managers and county councils find themselves in.  Now it has been stated openly by county engineers that the most they can hope to do in this current year is to fill the potholes.  There is no hope whatever of dangerous bends being removed.  There are dangerous hillocks which restrict the vision of motorists and there is no hope of them being removed. The full force of the county council will be directed to the filling of potholes.  We are in the year of the potholes.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to keep the county <Col N="507" /> council roadmen employed so that at least they can have enough days' work to qualify for superannuation in respect of this year.  The policy forced on county engineers is to dispense as far as possible with the use of machinery, and where machinery could do a more effective job at a lower cost than manpower the machinery will not be used because of the desire, laudable in itself but unsound economically, to keep the men at work. When that is imposed on local authorities there is a great deal of frustration and taxpayers and ratepayers see that public funds are being spent unwisely. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to that and to examine the results if it is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of road structures in parts of the country means that industrial and tourist development is retarded. In parts of Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Mayo and other sections of the country there is no rail service and the road structure is so inadequate that industrial development is held up, to put it mildly.  In our part of the country, in the lakeland district, tourism has a great potential but the access roads to places of tourist attraction is wholly inadequate. Some such places have no roads at all leading into them and you must get in across the green fields if the farmer allows you.  In other places what passes for a road is little better than a dirt track. That is a serious drawback to the people in our area who believe there is a good future for the tourist industry in that rich coarse fishing area.</P>
    <P>Another point of great concern is the cutback in real terms of the money allocated under the local improvements scheme to develop laneways, or boreens as they are known in some parts of the country.  In County Cavan if a number of people are served by a laneway or a boreen and they make application to have it done under the local improvements scheme, up to now the waiting time was five years.  Because of the shortage of money this year it is likely that at the end of this year and the beginning of 1981 it will be seen that the waiting time <Col N="508" /> will be longer than five years.  In County Monaghan, I am told, the waiting period is seven years and in County Leitrim it is something of that order too.</P>
    <P>It cannot be held that all citizens of the State are treated equally if there are in 1980 large numbers of people who have not a decent roadway into their place of abode.  There are areas where milk tankers coming in to serve farmers living along these long laneways cannot negotiate them and farmers have to wheel cans of milk out to the public road so that the milk can be filled on to the tankers there.  Large lorries from delivery firms, carrying animal feed or builders' supplies, cannot negotiate many of the laneways or boreens that lead into the houses where the people live, and that is not a satisfactory state of affairs coming towards the end of the 20th century.  A reasonable person must agree that if there is a shortage of money there must be some cutback, but cutbacks of this nature inflict undue hardship on some sections of the community and some areas of the country.  I would hope that the day is not far distant when it will be found possible to increase these funds adequately for road maintenance and especially for local improvement schemes so that the people can have the basic amenity of a tolerable road into their homes.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Reynolds in deploring the elimination of housing reconstruction grants.  That was one of the most unwise decisions made by any Government Department in this State, because those grants encouraged people to keep their houses in repair.  If they are not able to keep their houses in repair it is only a matter of time until these people are forced to go on the queue for housing by the local authority.  I hope that that unwise decision will be revoked at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of Cavan Urban District Council we were told that the allocation for house repairs in Cavan Urban District is £32,000.  To keep the men at work, which is the policy of the council and, as I said already, laudable, £25,000 will be required for wages and <Col N="509" /> the materials will cost £7,000.  Therefore, the ratio of wages to material is 3.5 wages to 1 material.  That is not a sensible balance.  It means that men are being kept at work without having the wherewithal to get the work done. Recently at a cross-Border conference between representatives of Louth County Council and County Down the indications from the Minister in the Northern Authority were that £10 million was available for the construction of a Newry by-pass, but if that is constructed without another development at Dundalk it will lead to a bottleneck at Dundalk.  The representatives from this part of the country were not in the position to say they had one single penny devoted towards developing this from the Border as far as Dundalk. That is the position we are in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much about roads on this motion except that I feel very sorry indeed for my rural colleagues who must face with foreboding their drives to and from Dublin over the kind of roads we have to put up with, which are getting worse by the day.  I would like to talk for a few minutes about the housing situation which is of extreme urgency and getting much worse in the Dublin area.  On the present trends of population shifts the majority of the increase in our young adult population will be looking for housing in Dublin and the Dublin area.  I have heard of the figure of 30,000 people a year looking for housing accommodation in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trend towards coming to Dublin is a very strong one and it is not being met by any serious attempt to decentralise. It seems to me that we have given up on decentralisation and you have this vast flocking of people from all over Ireland into the already over-strained housing situation in Dublin.  The pressure is such that people do not even need any more to advertise that they might have a flat or house for sale or rent particularly except at the very top of the market.  I remember ten or 12 years ago students or young people or childless <Col N="510" /> couples looking for flats, and in each Dublin evening newspaper there were about at least one-and-a-half pages of &ldquo;small ads&rdquo; about accommodation available.  Now if you look at the evening papers you will see about three-quarters of a column of &ldquo;ads&rdquo; for accommodation and the queues and fighting that go on to get that pitiful amount of accommodation are frightening.</P>
    <P>I think there is an approaching crisis in the accommodation of young people. We should consider a couple of aspects of this but, first, I would like to say that I believe that when we talk about the right to housing, the right of the people to have houses, we should be quite clear that we have an obligation to see that our people have a right to decent, adequate shelter.  Everybody has a right to decent, adequate shelter.  I do not believe that that means free shelter; I do not believe that it means owning the house they live in, but I do believe that we certainly do not meet the criterion of decent, adequate shelter at the moment.</P>
    <P>If I could speak for a moment about the extraordinary emphasis there is in Ireland, unique in Europe, on home-owning as opposed to renting accommodation, I should point out that in 1979, 75 per cent of people in Ireland owned their own homes.  To look at the very prosperous, comfortable well-off country of West Germany, 39 per cent of the people own the places in which they live, and across the water 54 per cent of people in the UK own the homes they live in.  There is an extraordinarily strong emphasis in Ireland on home-owning; an emphasis which I believe we should be trying to discourage and not to go along with.  It is a very emotional thing with people in this country who want to own their own home.  There are various sociological factors which influence this desire to own the home one lives in.  I believe that one of them is that because we have had a very chaotic policy for a long time on housing and a rather unregulated <i>laissez-faire</i> type of free enterprise in the property market, there has been a great fear of insecurity. People want to own their own homes <Col N="511" /> because of fear of finding themselves out on the side of the road if they do not.  It is an extraordinary thing that in West Germany people apparently have no such fears.  In a well-regulated society, there should be no need for such fears.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe that under the very restricted financing and the very restricted terms of reference that Dublin Corporation have they are doing a very fine job in the circumstances.  The fact that they have to have this points system, which is a very strict one imposed upon them by lack of finance, means that they cannot ever, for example, include young single people or childless couples on their list of people to get accommodation.  In fact, it is an extraordinary situation as has been said to me quite often that people are having children to gain the points to get a house. It is absolutely tragic to think of people approaching their whole life in this manner. The restriction on the corporation because of their lack of financing places this burden on many people, and you find people desperate to have a roof over their heads; they know that the only way they can get it is by producing children. It is a crazy sort of thing that results from the kind of system we have.</P>
    <P>In order to cope with what I see as a housing crisis we must not restrict ourselves to blaming people or talking about cut-backs in finances; we must begin to be imaginative about new ideas for increasing the housing stock in the city. The low-rise, high-density development with mixed housing units for different categories of people in the city must be the way forward in Dublin.  The sprawling, low-density kind of development on which we are proceeding by the day as we take more land further and further out on all sides of the city, is creating a sort of Los Angeles, and anybody who knows that part of the world will know what I refer to, this huge, flat, sprawling city where it is so extraordinarily energy-wasteful that it cannot possibly have a future.  We must stop absolutely and consider what we are doing.</P>
    <P>We are told that a unit of housing, a <Col N="512" /> dwelling unit in the city area, costs much more than a dwelling unit out somewhere like Tallaght, or Celbridge, but does that calculation include the extraordinary energy cost of shifting enormous numbers of people over long distances I wonder does the calculation include that.</P>
    <P>I would very much like to hear what has happened to the Kenny Report and all its recommendations on designated land, on controlling land values.  I believe that we must de-emphasise acquiring land out on all sides of the city and we must involve ourselves more in the city.  I heard recently about the very successful work of the national housing cooperative associations, these cooperatives which are in existence and which at the moment are adding 500 houses per year to the housing stock, groups of people who get together, buy their land, employ a solicitor, employ the builder, cut the costs and build themselves a small mixture of housing.  It seems to me that that kind of association, carried on more cheaply and more helpfully, more co-operatively, could be very much encouraged by the Government as one of the imaginative ways of dealing with the housing crisis.  We must find out just how much rented accommodation there is available in this city. We should seriously consider the use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>But I think we should, in order to investigate needs and to guide local authorities, in the census form have a question asking if people are renting accommodation and if they are how much they are paying.  When the Minister, Deputy Barrett, was asked the other day on television what his view was of the housing situation which this motion discusses&mdash;cutbacks for housing&mdash;he said that he was having an inquiry made with local authorities all over the country on what the housing <Col N="513" /> situation was.  The Minister has been in office for three years.  We should have had a report about the housing situation and we should be doing something about it.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House much longer but I believe that we have an impending housing crisis, particularly affecting young people.  The problem is going to be exacerbated very much.  It may be very much exacerbated by an impending Supreme Court decision and I would hope the Minister might be able to tell us what the 40,000 people living in rent-controlled accommodation are going to do when that decision comes about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned also about the housing of citizens of this city and indeed the housing problem in general, as I am concerned about roadways development.  I share with other people the view that proper road development is an important and essential factor in a community such as ours. The motion notes the inability of local authorities to discharge their functions but the matter does not end there.  I want to put on record the problem that has developed here in this city in the not-too-distant past.  I want to deplore the action of certain public representatives and their failure to allow the proper development of the city; the action of public representatives in not allowing to take place the development that has been planned on the best possible technical advice.  We have here in Dublin a serious situation: the social and economic life of the city is being destroyed by traffic congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an established fact that each and every Member is aware of, a situation that was forecast ten years ago by the Dublin Transportation Study which described the eastern by-pass as the most critical single link in the road network proposed.  Even then it was seen that this was necessary and this was the type of development that was ruthlessly rejected last Monday night at the Dublin Corporation meeting by people, some well-meaning, but some who I feel are <Col N="514" /> out to destroy this city and bring it to a halt for one motive or another not in keeping with the common good.</P>
    <P>The development plan of the eighties was published by the Minister for the Environment with the approval of the Government last year.  It identified work necessary to cater for present and future needs and it listed projects for the improvement of the main access routes to Dublin, including the eastern by-pass. The Government last year indicated the necessity for proper roadways, a roadways development that would cost in the region of £40 million.  The Transport Consultative Commission in their report published last month concluded that the port freight activity affecting road traffic was likely to increase at an unprecedented rate in the north port area.  For example, it indicated it could mean an extra 800 heavy trucks, articulated vehicles, operating each day in the next few years.</P>
    <P>The commission said that it was essential in their view that Dublin have a road network which will divert through-traffic from the city centre and provide adequate access to ports and industrial areas.  The implementation of the road investment plan for the Dublin region which is incorporated in the road development plan for the eighties would in time result in such a road network.  So, it can be said that the Government are not at fault here in Dublin where they see the necessity for a major development which to my mind has been sabotaged for political reasons by a small element within our city.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations altogether, the corporation in numerous surveys have indicated the commonsense of this type of approach.  We know that there are many well-meaning people who are concerned about the disruption to community life, about the movement of people from certain areas where road development would take place but at the same time they are not concerned about the same people living in an area which is highly polluted by articulated vehicles which are proceeding through it day in and day out; destroying the life of the <Col N="515" /> community in this highly polluted atmosphere and causing traffic hazards to many people because of their &ldquo;rat-runs&rdquo; through these populated centres.  This calls for major road development in our cities.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of our party to ensure that the necessary road development takes place to meet this need.  It would bring with it a large amount of employment and would stimulate the port area. It is necessary that the port area be developed because the port is the lifeline of the industrial development areas of our city and indeed the area surrounding the city.  If the city is brought to a standstill&mdash;as it will be&mdash;by people who are not concerned, then it is a sorry day for the democratic set-up as we know it when a handful of people can achieve that result.  I would call on the Minister for the Environment to take immediate action to ensure that this city is provided with the type of motorways or link-ways that are necessary to meet the developing technical progress of transportation and to meet the ever-increasing volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>Community life has been disrupted not by the local authority demolishing houses here and there in order to meet genuine needs but by pollution of a very severe order.  The high incidence of chest disease in this city can be traced to the high rate of petrol pollution in our streets.  This is undeniable because surveys carried out by the authorities show the position in this area.  Traffic that is highly pollutant moves through our streets at times at a rate of six miles per hour, spitting out these deadly fumes which we have to inhale as we walk through many of what are now called canyon streets in this city.  They are highly polluted, well above the level that the medical personnel indicate as safe.  These &ldquo;rat-runs&rdquo; through every residential estate now, short-cuts here and there for the articulated trucks, not alone are a cause of pollution but also a cause of a high accident rate because they are using roadways that were not built to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> Some years ago one could expect bacon and eggs for breakfast but now one is lucky if one does not have a juggernaut in the room as has happened on many occasions when juggernauts left the roads and crashed into the homes of people.  Nightly we see pictures appearing on one paper or another showing overturned juggernauts, using roadways that were never intended for such use. Because of the weight factor and the technical development of motors such vehicles are completely unsuitable on these roads and are causing a hazard far greater than would be caused by dislodging a number of people in order to meet the need for the further development of the city in order to ensure that people may live in areas developed for community living, safely removed from the hazards and the problems of development.</P>
    <P>Again, I say it is a sad state of affairs that a group of people would come together to try to sabotage this well worthwhile, worthy development that had been examined on so many occasions by so many technical personnel who come to the same conclusion in its favour.  Life is intolerable in many cases in many areas because of the development of road transport runs that are now taking place.  Unless this situation is eased, we are putting the communities in many other areas at risk because the drivers of heavy vehicles will find their way into many other residential areas and will pollute them and will, at the same time, put them at risk to the same degree as in other areas.  The eastern bypass and the tangent roads are a necessity to this city and again I would call on the Minister to take some steps to ensure that some sanity is injected into some local authorities in order to ensure that justice is done to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Some people have no concern for the future and this has been indicated by their deliberate action in the sabotaging of the road networks proposal.  One must consider the job opportunities, quite apart from the other opportunities, that exist in the development of this £40 <Col N="517" /> million project together with the fact that moneys might have been available or could be available from the EEC to finance a major portion of it.  Are they concerned about the work force?  Are they concerned about people in more industrial areas being able to have commuter type transport moving freely with materials and services so that our lifestyle can be changed in a worthwhile way?  Are we to stifle the development of the industrial areas by bringing traffic to a halt?  We all know the traffic chaos existing in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I said, this particular scheme would qualify for an EEC grant.  Perhaps some people feel Dublin should not have the benefit of this development or should not have the benefit of the moneys that are available.  I do not suggest that any Member of this House is irresponsible, but from what I have heard here, many people have given their view in relation to their own small problem but in this capital city we have a very definite problem.  It is not a question of the Government denying the local authority the moneys.  It is not a question of the Government not saying &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo;. They have given the green light and now we find that the whole scheme has been torpedoed.  Much has been said on this particular road development and I just want to add my voice to say that the Government have indicated in connection with this development plan, which was published by the Minister for the Environment and approved by the Government last year, that there is no question of money not being available. There is no question of the development being held up because of the lack of finance.</P>
    <P>So much for the road works.  To get back to the question of housing, I listened to Senator Hussey speak of the Dublin situation and I can say that she is grossly misled in relation to the contribution she made.  I do not know whether it was a deliberate attempt to mislead the people or mislead this House or whether, in fact, she is being misled.  She indicated that 30,000 people were in need of housing accommodation and I want to say <Col N="518" /> that on the Dublin Corporation housing list there is a total of 4,500 people.  Under construction at the moment in Dublin there are 2,061 houses and 119 senior citizens' dwellings which is a total of 2,180.  Site development work has been completed on 486 sites.  Site development work is in progress or about to commence on 2,444 sites, which gives a total of 5,168.  At the planning stage are 3,500 additional sites.  In addition to that, acquired or listed for acquisition are a further 7,000 sites.  This makes 10,500, and to indicate then that the Dublin Corporation are not concerned or that they are being impeded in any way is a deliberate effort to mislead this House.  Quite apart from all that the number of small dwelling loans which were made available last year was 523 and 201 low-rise mortgage loans.  Repair or improvement grants numbered 695.</P>
    <P>I do not know where Senator Hussey got her information but if she has been misled then the record has been corrected. If she has not been misled and if this is a deliberate attempt to mislead others, then I think that she has done a bad day's work.  I am just as concerned as other people about road development and housing development and in this case one can see clearly that the factual situation in relation to roads and houses in Dublin is not as has been portrayed by those who have spoken in support of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin with further words of congratulation to the Minister on this occasion here.  I wish him well in his appointment.  I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate on this motion which says that Seanad Éireann notes the inability of local authorities to discharge their function in the provision of housing, in the maintenance of roads and deplores Government policy which has led to this situation.  As a member of a local authority I am acutely conscious of the fact that the finance that would appear to be available to local authorities, and certainly to my local authority, in the coming months and in the present year would be of an extent that would retard <Col N="519" /> the objectives and the planning programme of that local authority in fulfilling their target of house construction and improvement of roads.</P>
      <P>Most people will agree that the provision of housing and the maintenance and improvement of roads are the two principal functions that local authorities have to discharge.  I am not suggesting that the rate should be reintroduced but I simply make the point that the removal of rates from private housing has removed a substantial source of funds from local authorities.  When we considered our estimates for 1980, the guidelines given to us were that a 10 per cent increase was allowable.  There was a suggestion that because of new valuations and so on the additional income arising from these would result in a few additional percentage points in the amount that would be available for expenditure in the counties.  In the local authority that I represent that means very little.  In reality we are working on a budget that is just 10 per cent more in 1980 than in 1979.</P>
      <P>We are told that inflation this year is likely to reach 20 per cent.  The increase in wages and materials needed, especially where road making is concerned&mdash;and I have been told that the cost increase of tarmacadam and road making materials over 1979 is about 40 per cent&mdash;is an extremely substantial increase. When one takes these increases in cost and relates them to the 10 per cent increase in additional spending there is, without question, a serious cutback in real terms.  The fact that local authorities are now so restricted in their ability to raise money for the projects within their responsibility represents a further weakening and a further erosion of the powers that local authorities have enjoyed over the years.  To a degree I deplore that in its own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the restrictions which we are faced with through increased overheads and increased costs as against a reduced income in real terms we have to contend with pressure from the public, <Col N="520" /> who are continually calling for improved services of one kind or another.  The position of local representatives or councillors is becoming more and more difficult. They are more and more occupied with explaining that certain services that the general public believe are theirs as a right cannot be provided for some time to come because the finance is simply not there.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the question of housing. Of the two items we are discussing here, road improvements and housing, housing is of greater importance.  The fact that we will have to contend with a reduced output of local authority houses is something that I deplore for a number of reasons.  I certainly do not share the views of the Senator who spoke earlier this evening and who seemed to imply that it was not desirable that people should aim to own their own houses.  The Senator felt that we were unique in that a very high proportion of our people own their own homes as against Germany, Great Britain and continental countries. The motive, the expectation and indeed the ambition of a young couple to own their own homes and to have pride in them are laudable, worthwhile and to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing has undoubtedly increased very rapidly in recent years and figures were mentioned here earlier this evening which indicated that a house that cost about £13,000 to erect in 1976, three years later, cost about £23,000, almost a doubling of the cost.  The effect of this rapid increase in housing costs has meant that more and more people are moving into the bracket where their hope of providing a house from their own resources is becoming more and more remote.  As a result the pressure on local authorities to provide local authority homes for them is becoming greater.  I am also concerned in that it would appear, from the figures that are available to us, that there is a downward trend in the output of local authority houses.  I understand that about 8,000 local authority houses were built in 1976 and that this figure has tended to slide downwards to about 6,000 or slightly <Col N="521" /> more in 1979.</P>
    <P>If we are to accommodate what I regard as the laudable ambition of young people in our community to own their own homes and to take pride in them, and if we measure with that the fact that the cost of housing, the cost of providing one's own home, has grown so sharply over the past few years, then it simply means that more houses will have to be provided by the local authorities to meet the needs of these young people.  I would be interested in the Minister's comment on this downward trend in the output of local authority houses from a peak of about 8,000 in 1976, because it is a matter for concern.</P>
    <P>A private semi-detached house now costs about £23,000.  We need to recognise that the loan of £12,000 that is available to a person from a local authority for the construction of that house is inadequate.  This is a real problem and it will have to be looked at again in the near future in the light of the spiralling cost of providing private houses.</P>
    <P>I regret the decision of the Government to withdraw house improvement and reconstruction grants.  The grant that was paid to an individual was only a reducing part of the cost of doing the improvement or the reconstruction, but nonetheless while it existed it was an incentive to carry out the improvement or reconstruction.  There is a great deal of merit in ensuring that improvements and reconstructions are carried out on existing housing stock.  From the nation's point of view it would be a bad thing. With little investment the houses that we have today could be brought up to a satisfactory and suitable standard as homes for people.  It would mean that we would preserve these and for every one of them that we would preserve we would eliminate the need for the replacement that would be necessary if they are allowed to fall into disrepair and decay.</P>
    <P>I apply the same reservations and criticisms to the removal of the water and sewerage grants.  I do not propose to pursue that point much further except to register my regret that these grants are <Col N="522" /> no longer a fact of life for many people who need them.</P>
    <P>In relation to roads, the reality, as all of us who are members of local authorities know, is that the amount of finance that will be available to county councils and to other local authorities is only sufficient to carry out the bare necessary repairs on the roads in question. Necessary work such as the removal of dangerous bends, the improvement of sight distance, road realignment and so on are not objectives that can be aimed at in this current year. We are down now to a situation where all we can do with the money that is available to us is just carry out, maybe in some cases, a skimpy maintenance programme on many of our roads.  There is no doubt that if that maintenance programme is not adequate&mdash;and I do not believe it will be adequate&mdash;then obviously we will pay the price in further deterioration on our roads and we will be faced with a heavier cost in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate what we can expect will be the progress or the targets in relation to the road development plan for the eighties.  It is only a matter of months since this programme was introduced.  It attracted a lot of favourable comment and a lot of favourable publicity at the time.  I want to know if the targets and the dates in relation to that are being revised and what is the timetable in relation to it now?  Has it changed?</P>
    <P>I recognise that money is scarce and there must be cutbacks of some kind or another.  But there are priorities and I regard housing as an urgent social need. While roads are also very important, the restriction that local authorities are facing now in the provision of houses for people who are in need of housing is something that the Government should have a very serious rethink on.  It should be afforded a greater priority than the Government appear to be affording it.  I would urge that upon the Minister.</P>

      <P>Housing is one of the basic human needs, second only to food and clothing.  As such it can be an emotive issue&mdash;one concerning which people can hold and express strong opinions not least on a political level.  This is a healthy situation and the essence of democracy.  Basically everyone agrees that the national objective should be to ensure a proper standard of housing for every family.</P>
      <P>This principle was first specifically enunciated in Fianna Fáil's White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, published 11 years ago and, despite changes in Government, it has never since been questioned.  It was accepted by the National Coalition Government while they were in office between 1973 and 1977.  The difference in approach between the parties has largely been one of the relative emphasis to be placed on the measure of support to be given on the public and private sectors respectively.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that in their comments on the motion the Senators who moved and seconded the motion sincerely wish to see progress made with the solution of our housing problems.  In turn I would hope that in discussing the motion Senators generally will accept that all parties have much in common and that they will avoid the obvious temptation to score on political points which can do very little to ease the problems of the persons in need of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is desirable to make the position in this regard clear at the outset <Col N="524" /> because the housing situation is an entity. All sectors are inter-related and overlap and it would be counter productive for the Seanad to concentrate its attention on only one of the three sectors and to ignore the effects of policies and the achievement in others.  For that reason, therefore, I suggest that the provision of local authority housing cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation from other important facets of housing policy.  I ask the House to bear with me while I refer briefly to the general housing situation, deal more specifically with local authority housing and then I will touch on some other important and related housing issues.</P>
    <P>Straight away, let me put it on the record that there has been no diminution in the Government's basic aim of ensuring that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every household can obtain for their own occupation a house of good standard, located in an acceptable environment and at a price or rent they can afford.</P>
    <P>As an earnest of our commitment to this global objective, let me cite some relevant statistics.  The number of houses completed in 1979 was 26,500&mdash;an increase of 1,100 over 1978.  The number of private houses completed was 20,300&mdash;an all-time record for this country.  Annual housing completions have been increasing steadily since 1976 when 24,000 dwellings were completed. Nineteen seventy nine was a record year in many ways so far as housing was concerned. The main lending agencies in the private sector advanced £293 million in respect of a record 24,700 new and previously occupied houses in 1979, compared with £172 million for 22,000 houses in 1977.  Building societies again were the main source of mortgage finance in 1979 when they provided £200 million, or 68 per cent of the total. Local authorities paid a record total of £50 million to 6,900 house purchasers, including those eligible under the low-rise mortgage scheme.  House purchase loans of record numbers and value were approved by the lending agencies in 1979.  The amount involved was £374 <Col N="525" /> million and the number of loans approved was 30,100 of which a record 15,833 were in respect of new houses. That demonstrates the Government's practical support for the housing programme mainly through the public capital programme.  The capital allocation for housing in 1980 is £182 million and this compared with an outturn of just £100 million under the 1977 programme.  The public purse is not limitless. There is an end to the purse.  I would love to have a lot more money but I have not.  That is life.  It is like housekeeping.  One gets an allowance and tries to make the best of it.  One uses the money to the best of one's ability. That is what I am trying to do in relation to the responsibilities that have been designated to me by the Minister.  In this context it is significant that in this year's public capital programme allocations, housing got the second highest allocation of all sectors, the highest allocation naturally being in respect of industry and of course this went into providing employment. Any fair-minded person must agree that the extent of the capital assigned to housing this year by the Government is a clear reflection of their resolve to maintain housing construction as a priority area in the national economy.</P>
    <P>The desire to own one's own home is strong in our community.  Recognising that trait, the Government's aim has been to encourage maximum output in the private sector in order to cater for a person who can look after his own needs.  I will develop this aspect later on.</P>
    <P>The public housing programme is intended to meet the needs of people who lack the resources to provide satisfactory accommodation for themselves and their families.  To this end, the local authority housing programme, has been maintained at a steady level, giving about 6,000 new house completions each year. Combined with casual vacancies in existing local authority housing estates, this has allowed for the rehousing annually of between 8,000 and 9,000 of approved applicants off the waiting list.  In effect, this indicates a three-year turnover <Col N="526" /> of all approved applicants on the waiting lists&mdash;at present in the region of 27,000 for the whole country.  It is relevant in this context to say that on 30 September 1979, two-thirds of all approved applicants on the waiting list were families of three persons or fewer.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a programme of 6,000 new local authority houses each year.  The actual figure in 1979 was 6,214, compared with 6,073 in 1978 and 6,333 in 1977.  Because there was a very high number of completions late in 1979, work in progress at the end of that month fell below 8,000 dwellings. However, I am glad to say that by the end of February, the level had been restored to 8,718, a total well above the average monthly figures for 1977, 1978 and 1979.</P>
    <P>Employment on local authority housing programmes at the end of February 1980 was 6,524, which compares favourably with the figures for the previous three years and was substantially higher than the monthly average of 5,635 in 1976.</P>
    <P>This year, as in previous years, the Government's aim is to maintain stability in the local authority housing programme with a further 6,000 new house completions.  However, because of the continued high rate of increases in building costs we appreciate that this will not be achieved without some difficulty. Recent tender prices show that a cost of £20,000 for the average three-bedroomed local authority house is not unusual.  Indeed, in the Dublin inner city area, the estimated cost of a single housing unit is around £40,000.  That is very alarming.  Every fair-minded person in this House must admit that.  I realise that Dublin's inner city is a special case, but I mention this just to put into perspective the enormous demands being placed on the capital available for local authority houses.  I believe that the general high level of tender prices for housing is not unrelated to the overheating which was evident in some areas in the house building industry in 1978 and 1979.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, because of the general stabilisation in the construction <Col N="527" /> industry this year, keener competition will slow down the pace of increases in housing costs.</P>
    <P>The motion which is before the Seanad reflects the dissatisfaction of some Members with the capital made available for local authority housing.  I am not content or complacent about this matter.  As long as I am aware that any family is living in overcrowded accommodation and has to wait indefinitely for rehousing, I will not be happy.  I am realistic enough to know that there are very many urgent demands on public funds and that I can serve those in need by applying the capital available in the best possible manner.  It is a luxury reserved to public representatives not involved in government to deplore the lack of certain public funds without having to shoulder the responsibility of deciding which areas are to be deprived to make good deficiencies in other sectors.</P>
    <P>My concern is that the local authority housing programme for this year, involving expenditure of about £100 million, is well managed.  Expenditure is under the control of 87 authorities, and a large part of the expenditure is on developed schemes which are not subject to detailed control by my Department.</P>
    <P>While I am totally in agreement with the principle of devolution, without the fullest co-operation between central and local administration it can run into problems.  I have sufficient experience of local authority affairs to know how easy it is to be frustrated by lack of action at central level.  Now that I am on the other side of the fence, as it were, and can see things from both angles, I have a better understanding of the situation.  I am less tolerant when I hear such expressions as &ldquo;the inability of local authorities to discharge their functions&rdquo; because of Government policy.  If a local authority find themselves unable to discharge their functions they should ask themselves in the first place what can be done to improve the situation.  Let us not enter into a situation similar to that in some areas <Col N="528" /> in Great Britain where local and central government are at complete loggerheads. The real sufferers, in such cases, are the people who find they do not get the services they deserve and, indeed, which they are paying for.  I will deal more fully with this general issue later.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the local authority housing situation in Dublin which naturally, because of its relative size, attracts much publicity.  Over the years I have heard misgivings expressed about the inability of Deputies from rural areas to understand what some people regard as a largely urban problem.  One of my first actions on being appointed to my Department was to get a full briefing on the housing situation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, what I found was that, while the situation is bad, it has been improving steadily.  In saying so, I have no intention of appearing to be complacent about the position.  But with all the cries of &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;housing emergency&rdquo; in recent months, one could be forgiven for believing there have been new and disastrous developments in the Dublin area. However, the most recent survey of housing needs carried out by Dublin Corporation showed there were 5,463 approved applicants on the waiting list at the end of last year, as against 7,098 at the end of 1978.</P>
    <P>I know there are pressures in the Dublin area which aggravate the situation and that statistics alone cannot give a genuine picture of the problem.  For this reason, Dublin gets special consideration when it comes to the allocation of capital.  This year's allocation for Dublin Corporation represents about one-third of the allocation for the whole country whereas the number of approved applicants represents less than a quarter of the total.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the vast amounts of money provided each year from the Public Capital Programme for the provision of local authority housing. The houses being provided are of good quality, and I should like to reiterate that we must ensure that they go to those families who are really in need of rehousing and who cannot provide housing accommodation <Col N="529" /> for themselves from their own resources.  The provision of local authority housing is costly, not only because of the initial capital outlay, but also the necessity to subsidise current expenditure on the houses.</P>
    <P>The system of housing subsidy in operation since 1 January 1977 results in the Exchequer bearing the full cost of the loan charges incurred by local authorities on their borrowings for the provision of houses for renting.  Local authorities retain the rental income which, together with a percentage of the proceeds from the sales of their houses to tenants, is applied towards the cost of maintenance and management.  The cost to the public funds of subsidising local authority housing has risen dramatically from £16 million in 1973-74 to £70 million in 1980.  The total value to the tenant of the subsidy on a house today is equivalent to £30 per week.  If I had that £70 million to put into other houses, I would do a lot of work.  I am not against that.  I do not want anybody to take me out of context.  This is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The situation must be put clearly on the record.</P>
    <P>Talking of local authority housing subsidy brings me to another form of subsidy which was introduced recently. Following recent increases in interest rates, the Irish Building Societies' Association informed me that they intended to recommend to their members that the societies' investment rates should be increased from 9 per cent to 10.75 per cent, tax paid.  As Senators know, this would have necessitated an increase in home loan interest rates from 14.15 per cent to 16.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, accompanied by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, met representatives of the Irish Building Societies' Association on 22 April 1980 and had a wide-ranging discussion on the matter. Following this meeting, a working group was established to examine, as a matter of urgency, the number of means which had been suggested to reduce or avoid <Col N="530" /> the necessary increase in mortgage rates. The working group presented their report on 28 April 1980.  The Government are satisfied that an immediate increase in building society investment rates was necessary to restore the competitiveness which the societies had lost due to increases in other interest rates so as to enable the societies to retain their existing funds, to generate new funds and to meet the mortgage finance needs of the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Government were concerned about the consequences which a mortgage rate of 16.5 per cent would have on house purchasers generally and first-time purchasers in particular, and on employment in the house building industry. It was decided, therefore, to introduce a temporary direct subsidy at a cost of about £1.5 million a month which would eliminate the need for the societies to increase their home loan rates.  The payment of this subsidy will be kept under review and it is to be hoped that the present record level of interest rates generally is of a temporary nature only. This subsidy is a practical example of the Government's encouragement of owner-occupation.</P>
    <P>Another important way in which people can acquire their own housing accommodation is by availing of the local authority house purchase loan scheme. That the scheme is worth while is evident from the fact that £45 million was paid out in loans last year in respect of 6,200 new and previously occupied houses, compared with £17 million in respect of 4,800 houses in 1977.</P>
    <P>The secret of success of this loans scheme has been the maintenance by the Government of realistic loan and income eligibility levels.  When we resumed office, we found the maximum income for qualification for a local authority house purchase loan was £2,350 and the maximum loan at £4,500 had remained unchanged since the National Coalition Government took office.  We took immediate action.  When I came to the Department of the Environment I made a recommendation to the Minister on this matter and we increased the maximum <Col N="531" /> loan to £12,000 and the maximum yearly income to £5,500.  I have heard nobody complain about that.  Everyone was very pleased about the eligibility limit.  Recent applications show that it was a step in the right direction.  In addition to this record amounts of payments and approvals under the loan scheme last year, local authorities had a total of £89.5 million worth of applications on hand, which indicates the attraction of the scheme to persons in the middle and lower income groups.  The SDA scheme enables local authorities to provide houses indirectly in their areas.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall housing policy must reflect the housing requirements of the time.  In so far as the assessment of the adequacy of existing policy is concerned, up-to-date data must be available to the Government on the need for housing throughout our land.  To be in a position to brief the Government comprehensively on housing needs, the Minister recently asked housing authorities to carry out an assessment of the nature and extent of the need for housing in their areas and to assess the adequacy of the supply and the prospective demand for housing.  In order to assess more accurately the condition of the existing housing stock, the Minister has asked housing authorities to carry out sample surveys of the houses in their areas.  This will ensure that up-to-date, comprehensive and reliable data on the extent of unfitness and overcrowding in our young stock will be available.  The whole exercise will facilitate the formulation of a broadly-based Government housing policy for the eighties.</P>
    <P>Housing, as I said at the outset, is an emotive issue because it impinges directly on the individual and his family.  On the other hand, the second part of the motion we are discussing in relation to road maintenance concerns the community generally.  I should not like to see local authorities taking people out of the country and putting them into the major towns.  That is a matter for the council members.  There are villages where we <Col N="532" /> could put up a scheme of houses, provided planning is in line with development. That is a matter for our councillors, and I am alluding to councillors from all parties.  They should see that people are not whipped out of their own environment and put into the major towns.  There was an old slogan years ago.  When Mary got married the slogan was: &ldquo;Head for the town and get your caravan, and you will get a house.&rdquo; I do not want to see that happening.  It is a matter for our councillors to look into that.  As a man from the midlands, I want to see rural Ireland maintained.  I want to see its schools remaining open.  I would like councillors to draw up plans to ensure that rural Ireland will be well looked after.</P>
    <P>The increasing demands placed on the road system in recent years&mdash;and, in particular, the national routes which carry almost half of the total traffic&mdash;have emphasised the need to ensure, first, the preservation of the system up to a generally satisfactory level of service and, secondly, that essential and urgent improvements to eliminate deficiencies are undertaken at the earliest opportunity.  This Government's commitment to the proper maintenance and improvement of the network is illustrated by the level of road grants made available to road authorities since we took office.</P>
    <P>I am happy to recall that the grant allocations this year total over £53 million, which is double the amount allocated by the Coalition when they were leaving office in 1977.  By way of further comparison, this Government, in the three years since taking office, have allocated road grants totalling £139 million, whereas the Coalition Government in the three year period from 1975 to 1977 allocated grant totalling £68 million.  Furthermore, the sum of £139 million does not include grants totalling £5 million allocated by the present Government immediately on taking office to supplement the 1977 grants made by the previous Government.  Even when account is taken of inflation, it must be <Col N="533" /> recognised that the Government's performance leaves little room for criticism by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Are we getting value for money now? Are county councils getting value for money?  Is machinery hired by councils lying idle for half a day?  Is it lying idle for an hour at a time?  This should be looked into.  This is a matter for county councils.  I have referred to that on a number of occasions.  I would hope that county councils and corporations will ensure that hired plant is used to the maximum capacity.  Money is scarce now.  We must see to it that we are getting value for money, and that is open to question at the moment.</P>
    <P>As a further indication of our determination to improve the standard of the road network, the road development plan for the eighties was published last year.  The twin aims of the plan can be summarised as the satisfactory preservation of the network and the elimination of deficiencies by necessary improvements, particularly on the national routes.  The plan will provide a positive basis for action by the road authorities in the decade ahead and thereby effect a significant improvement in the country's transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Legal responsibility for public roads is vested in the road authorities, and it is their statutory duty to maintain and improve the roads for which they are responsible, so as to keep them fit for the traffic that uses them.  While my Department reimburse a large proportion of the expenditure incurred on road works by way of annual road grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the total expenditure on road works last year amounted to £96.29 millions, of which the local authority expended more than 50 per cent from their own resources. Since the vast bulk of their investment is made up in maintenance works, the condition of the public roads outside the national road network, for which full cost maintenance grants are made by my Department, is dependent largely on the level of funds made available by them, including the amount of their own resources which they apportion to road works.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as he has indicated on previous occasions, is very concerned about the recent deterioration in the standard of road maintenance.  In conjunction with the notification of the 1980 grants, the attention of each city and county manager was drawn specially to the need for immediate and sustained remedial action, particularly in relation to the principal routes, which are those most used by the public.  They have been asked to give priority to adequate provision for maintenance of roads out of moneys available to them.  I am glad to say that the managers, as a whole, while stressing the problems that exist, have responded in a positive and constructive way and have undertaken that everything possible will be done to improve the situation in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>For the maintenance of national roads, grants totalling £9.336 million have been allocated for work this year, which represents a generous contribution in the context of the present financial situation.  In 1977, the corresponding grants amounted to £5,266 million.  As regards other roads, the funds available this year to road authorities should enable them to carry out a reasonably satisfactory programme of road upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road authorities have been reminded of the serious consequences of neglecting road upkeep&mdash;death and injury to road users, damage to vehicles, fuel wastage, <Col N="535" /> loss of previous investments in road networks&mdash;and they have been asked to consider the need for regular inspection and immediate identification and treatment of surface failures.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are problems.  A high volume of heavy vehicles can cause exceptional damage to particular roads.  The problem becomes greater where overloading of heavy goods vehicles occurs.  Again, money is not unlimited, although we would all like to be able to spend more on the roads. Accepting such factors, I have no doubt that much can be done to improve matters, by giving priority in the application of available resources to the most urgent cases and operations and by seeking greater efficiency.  I dealt with that in earlier comments on greater efficiency.  I am asking for that from all of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer briefly to criticism expressed in some quarters of the 10 per cent limit on increases in rate poundages.  I have met many ratepayers throughout the country who were very glad this rates curb, if you like to call it that, was placed on local authorities. They were of the opinion that the local authorities might decide to raise the rates by up to 20 per cent.  We had to look into this situation and we had to take account of it.  I am in favour of putting a limit on the councils because I would fear that a council then might might decide to put a very high rate.  They could do it.  There is nothing to stop a council putting on a 20 per cent rate and then saying &ldquo;Oh well, we want a road and we want this.&rdquo;  We all know we want the roads but there is a limit to the purse. Although final figures for 1980 rates estimates have not yet been received from all local authorities it is possible at this stage to estimate fairly accurately what the picture for 1980 will be.  Local authorities have been able to provide in their 1980 estimates for gross expenditure of nearly 17 per cent more than in last year's estimates.  To put this another way, local authorities were able to budget for a total expenditure of £437 <Col N="536" /> million on non-capital services last year. In 1980 they have been able to budget for an extra £73 million, or a total of £510 million, for non-capital services.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this, maybe I went on longer than I should.  If so I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach will forgive me. This is my first time in this House and I am not too sure of the procedures. I am trying to give an overall picture of the position, but I am reasonably happy that in regard to housing we will be able to keep that moving along as we did.  I am satisfied with the road network that we will be able to do the best we can with the money that is made avilable to us.  I am not happy with the money that the Government are making available to me, and every other Minister in every Department is not happy with the allocation. But, once again, there is a limit on the purse.  There was always a limit on the purse and I do not doubt there will be a limit in the future.  In conclusion, in regard to local authority housing and road networks, I want to see the best value got for the money we have to spend this year, and I ask all members of local authorities throughout the country irrespective of party or political affiliation, to ensure it is brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is his first time here and I want to congratulate him for a very in-depth speech on how he sees the housing and the road problem.  He put a fair amount of effort into it and I wish him well in his new position.  That is not to say that I agree with what he said. Far from it.  Before I go away from what Senator Dowling said a few minutes ago, I hope he is at present having his tea and that he never had a bite of a juggernaut in his front room.  I did not think that the position in Dublin was so serious that every second hour of the day a juggernaut goes into somebody's front room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at the Minister when he mentioned early in his speech that he thought that at a crisis situation such as we are in now all parties had much in common <i>vis-a-vis</i> the problems.  I did not hear too much about the common <Col N="537" /> ground that we had coming up to the 1977 election, and I certainly did not hear too much about the common ground that was in the famous manifesto.  At this stage when one considers that things are beginning to get out of hand for Fianna Fáil it would appear now they are beginning to say &ldquo;Well, of course we will all have those problems and you will have them as well&rdquo;.  It is only fair to preface the few remarks that I have this evening by saying that as far as this Government are concerned, and I am talking about the later part of the Government's term, there is certainly a change of emphasis. There is a big difference between the emphasis that has been placed on the budget for environment generally now and what was being placed on it this time last year.  There was great optimism around here in the last year or two that not alone would the services be maintained but they would be increased generally.  One would wonder, with all the economic planning and all the white papers that this Government produced in the first two and a half years of their term in office, what has gone wrong. Who has been fooled?  If we were to take the Minister of State at his word, and he would appear to have a very good grasp of what he is talking about, it would appear that we are in for a very, very tough time.  While he says that he is fairly happy with what is happening and that he travels around a fair bit, I have not met many people in local authorities either as local authority members or staff, or members of the public who could say that they were happy.  Worse than that, we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, because the real bite, in so far as the restrictions of the budget are concerned, will not be felt until later this year.  I have no doubt we will arrive at a situation in relation to roads and housing where the cutback will be so bad that it will be unparalleled in recent history.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with what the Minister had to say about ensuring that as many people as possible are housed in small rural areas.  We in Galway County Council have four or five clusters of ten, <Col N="538" /> eight, six and five houses in places like Portumna, Loughrea, Kilconnell and Tuam and as a local authority we have to say, &ldquo;We are very sorry.  We cannot proceed with the building&rdquo;, because the Department in question will not tell Galway County Council exactly how much money they are entitled to get this year.  We were told the initial amount a month ago, about two months late, and if we do not get a supplementary allowance very quickly even the builders who used to build for us will have to be let off.</P>
    <P>There is a conflict between what I am saying and what the Minister has said. Last year in County Galway we built roughly 97 rural cottages, and if we are to go on by the estimate that has been given to us we will be able to build only about 25 houses this year.  I will admit that all the services might not be curtailed as badly as that one, but we are heading for 25 rural houses in all of County Galway this year.  I can go on record as saying that I met two very small builders who would be building only two of those houses at a time, the builder and two helpers doing the work. They were told last week by a senior official in Galway County Council that they had better stop working, that they could not be guaranteed that they would be paid for the work they are doing.  If anyone wants to check that out it can be done quite easily at local authority level.</P>
    <P>Judging by the Minister's remarks that he is going to ensure that this kind of thing will not happen, I assume that there is a supplementary budget on the way.  I thought that the Minister might refer to that, but to my knowledge he did not refer to it as such.  Most of the local authorities around the country are awaiting news from this motion here today. If there is to be no more money coming than has already been sanctioned to us and if all local authorities are in the same position as Galway County Council I can assure all people in this country who are awaiting a county council or local authority house that they had better think about another <Col N="539" /> year.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that we should not place all our eggs in the one basket in so far as local authority housing is concerned.  It would be fair to say that you should always have a balance between the number of houses that the Government, through local authority housing, will provide and the number of houses that can be provided for people to build themselves through local authority loans and so on. But is the House aware that there is not anywhere else, other than the building societies, that a prospective house builder can now go for a loan to build his house?</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that because of his intervention the limit was raised to £12,000, and that it was sufficient as evidenced by the number of applications at local authority level.  That is quite right, as any public representative will know, but where else could most of those people go?  Also, we always need to bear in mind the cost of this thing, and let it be on the record of the House that a £12,000 loan will cost roughly £32.50 a week for every week of 30 years.  If the average wage earner takes £80, £90 or £100 a week and pays more than one-third for the repayment on the loan, one could not call him a happy man, particularly if he is married with a young family.  This is a tremendous burden.  I was the first to accept that it was important to raise the income limit to £5,500 and the loan itself from £9,000 to £12,000.  Nevertheless, that is not a particularly good answer, because a certain section of people earning from £70 to £80 could not repay that.  In the past people who qualified for local authority houses were the poorer section of the community, and I do not have to tell this House that we have a new poor at the moment.  Certain sections are caught by circumstances beyond their control; they are not poor enough to be desolate and on the other hand they are not rich enough to be able to take out a loan and build a house for themselves.</P>
    <P>It would appear from the figures the <Col N="540" /> Minister has given and from the way I see local authority building programmes shaping up this year, that we are on a down-spiral.  It might be all right for the Minister to say that the policy might be to do it that way.  That policy is wrong. Considering the problem we have with the value of money and inflation, now is the time to inject more money into local authority housing to ensure that we will have reasonable housing and reasonable comfortable conditions for people who are unable to afford anything else.  The people in that category now are a far cry from the people who got local authority houses in the past.</P>
    <P>Another thing I would ask the Minister in the context of this motion would cut across all political parties: is there any way he can put the boot into the banks to ensure that a man who has got the OK from a local authority to get the loan can get the bridging finance? Great hardship is caused because a man would have been allocated the loan and yet he would not be able to get bridging finance from the bank.  I do not know whose responsibility it is, but many people around the country today would be delighted if somebody could do something about that.  Another thing I would ask the Minister to turn his attention to is that in the event of the banks not agreeing to this bridging finance, serious consideration should be given to paying the loan in four parts.  Somebody who is entitled to the loan will not get any of it until he has a roof on his house. It is only reasonable, because of the tightness of credit with the stores and the builders and so on, to take that extra bit of hardship off by providing that the loan can be paid in four instalments and the first instalment paid fairly quickly after the foundations are in.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council have a shortfall of about £1 million in so far as their building programme is concerned. There is no way that we as an authority can give anything like the type of service and development that we gave last year unless the Supplementary Estimate is on its way.</P>
    <P>To compound matters altogether, a <Col N="541" /> couple of months ago the Department of the Environment saw fit to give a real stab in the back to the owners of thousands of sub-standard dwellings, mostly in the possession of the lower income group, when they decided to take away the reconstruction grant.  The decision to withdraw that grant baffles me.  When £600, which was the grant, would put windows and doors in most houses, why was it decided to withdraw it?</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous problem.  I wish the Minister well.  I believe him to be a very sincere man.  I hope that he will get the programme through as he says, but the figures do not stand up.  If something is not done fairly soon with the roads, 1980 will be known as &ldquo;pothole year&rdquo; and 1981 will see the advent of the super-pothole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new position.  The terms of the motion here are an admission by the Opposition that at all the county council meetings throughout the country this year they have failed to put their case across to the county councils and to the public, because at every county council meeting throughout the country it has been proven that extra money has been allotted.  They tried to make a lot of capital out of the fact that only 10 per cent was available for an increase in expenditure on housing and roads this year, but as we have found in Kilkenny as I am sure a lot of other councillors found in their own counties, over the past number of years the present Government have pumped a lot of money into housing and industry and the local authorities have the benefit of the rateable increase within their own counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on a couple of points Senator Connaughton made. He mentioned the fact that it costs £32.50 per week to service the ordinary loan, but what he did not say was that that was a gross figure.  He did not mention the fact that there is a tax element within that £32.50 and that that is allowable against the weekly charge.  He <Col N="542" /> also said that it is a pity the county councils do not allow payment to be made in stages.  He must not be a very observant member of his own local authority if he does not know that a circular came from the Department not so long ago stating that at the time of the pouring in of the foundations a percentage of the loan could be paid, that when the house was ready for roofing a certain percentage could be paid, and that when the house was finished the rest of the money could be paid.  He should go back and have a look at the situation as has been enunciated by the Department to the county councils earlier this year.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody would deny that there is a problem providing houses for all our people.  We have a growing population of young people who are getting married younger and younger and their expectations are a lot higher than those of years ago.  They expect to be housed as soon as they are married; they make no provision for housing themselves and they expect the taxpayer to provide houses for them immediately after they get married.  That is not a reasonable expectation from anybody in any day or age.  If people are going to get married they should prepare financially, emotionally and in every other way for what they are entering into.  At present in every area we see kids getting married; they move in with their parents and their in-laws and there is an immediate cause of friction.  It is not reasonable to expect the Government or the taxpayers to house these people immediately. They should make an effort to provide for their own housing.</P>
    <P>The standard of housing in local authorities has been mentioned.  The standard of housing in the local authority areas over the past number of years has been far superior to what is being provided in the private sector of the building industry.  The housing programme that was embarked upon by the present Government when they came back into power is one of which this Government and the country in general should be proud.  The members of the Government are not satisfied with what <Col N="543" /> has been done, but we are doing as much as can be done within the limits that the community places upon us, and those are financial to a large degree.  If I buy a bar of chocolate I like to eat the whole bar of chocolate, but if somebody else wants a bit of it I give him a bit of it and if somebody else wants another bit I give him a little bit and I divide up that bar of chocolate into a number of segments which will provide a little bit for each person.  The little bit might not be enough, but you have got to do the best you can with that bar of chocolate or that cake.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers on the Opposition benches have complained about the allocations that have been made for both public and private housing.  One of the big boasts of the Coalition Government was the fact that they built 25,000 houses.  We were saying at that stage that it was not a boast, that they were just doing something that they had to do and that 25,000 was the maximum they could do from the cake as it existed at that stage.  Fortunately, the cake has got a little bit bigger so there is more available for everyone.  We do not boast about 26,000 houses; we do not boast about 27,000 houses per annum.  We just get on and build them.  There are a number of schemes under which people can provide their own houses and all of the schemes are not availed of as they should be.</P>
    <P>The low rise mortgage scheme is not taken up to the extent to which people should take it up.  People in local authority houses, irrespective of their income, can take up a low rise mortgage. They take a county council loan and build their own house, thereby adding to the local authority housing pattern.  We have it in country areas; we have it in County Kilkenny.  In the city of Kilkenny, in my own parish, St. Patrick's, the local parish curate is at present finishing off four houses for elderly people and two houses which will be used for small families or single-parent families, and starting on a scheme of maisonettes which will be used by <Col N="544" /> either single parents or small families. That effort in that parish is sustained purely and simply from the resources of the parish and is an indication as to what can be done by the community, not depending on the Government to provide for the needs of an area.  That should be embarked upon more and more in any place in Ireland.  In Kilmoganny, a small village, a community group got together and built 11 houses on a community basis for sale to people within that community. The houses cost the people who have gone into them £7,500 and they could be put on the open market at present for at least £20,000.</P>
    <P>In Clare Father Harry Bohan and his people have built houses in the smaller community areas that the Minister mentioned. What has happened in the small community areas is that because the houses were there industries followed and villages which had been dead came back to life.  We must place more emphasis on that type of co-operation. We cannot allow the situation to develop where people expect the Government to provide all the houses that are necessary in this country.  We must have community involvement in the building programme.  We must divide up the cake in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
    <P>Roads and the condition of them were mentioned.  It is amazing how a concerted effort has been made by the Opposition within the last five or six months to prove that the roads have deteriorated because the Government are not putting enough money into the maintenance of these roads.  The Government have provided enough money to maintain the roads in this country but a lot of factors militate against the situation on the roads.  There is an enormous growth in heavy traffic.  Juggernauts have been mentioned.  Anybody can see the damage that can be caused on a country road by bulk tankers of all descriptions. Naturally, the fact that these bulk tankers and bulk carriers are on our roads makes the maintenance of roads more difficult.  Also, for the past two winters we had very extreme conditions of weather and this has meant that roads <Col N="545" /> have deteriorated faster than they would normally.  But, having said this, we have not heard at county council meetings for the last two months any mention made of the enormous progress in road maintenance over that period.  At the time the estimates were going through our county councils we had rain pouring down and, at the same time, we had councillors complaining about the roads not being repaired and anybody who would try to lay tarmac under wet conditions would be totally irresponsible.</P>
    <P>The Government have put an enormous amount of effort into their road improvement schemes.  The county council of which I am a member are not satisfied but we are never satisfied because we want our county to progress and no matter what the Minister gave us we still would not be satisfied.  That is a warning to the Minister that we will not be satisfied but we will take what we get and we will use it to the best advantage of the people in the areas which we are elected to represent.</P>
    <P>The people deserve good roads and good housing.  The Government would like to provide a 100 per cent increase in the number of houses being built.  We cannot, as has been said by the Minister, increase our rates to an enormous degree because, irrespective of the fact that rates have been abolished on private dwellings the rates that have to be paid by small businesses at present are a big burden on them and I would not like to see the rates go up any more than 10 per cent.  I think that this option is not one that should be accepted by the House and I sincerely hope that the Minister, with the funds available to him, will continue with the good work that the Government have been doing for years on housing and on road improvements.</P>

Listening to the many statements that have been made here today, from county to county, we are well aware that when the estimates were being prepared a few months ago by the managers in all the counties they were at their wits' end to know what they were going to do with this 10 per cent.  In a reply to a Dáil question a few weeks ago we were informed that we got 10 per cent; Kerry got 5.8 per cent; one county in the midlands got 1.4 per cent.  So, it is far away from the 10 per cent as promised, with inflation at the moment over 22 per cent. Figures I received from the Kerry County Council a few weeks ago show that the increase in tar price was 30 per cent, in diesel oil 100 per cent, in materials 25 per cent and in wages 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>With this in mind I can see that all county councils at the moment who have many jobs under consideration will have to postpone all these jobs.  These are the facts as we find them from county to county at the moment. At the Kerry County Council meeting last Monday I found myself in a position where the Minister's own party controlled the council and they wanted a special meeting held within the next two weeks to deal with finance.  It went to a vote.  We opposed it because we informed them we had nothing to discuss. They went even further than that.  The Fianna Fáil councillors wanted it held in committee and we challenged them as to why they had to hold it behind closed doors.  I wonder what is wrong at the moment.  I would welcome the Minister any time, perhaps in the near future, to meet the Kerry County Council to discuss our many problems because I assure him, if he does not come to Kerry they will be up to meet him in his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also find that where we had <Col N="547" /> private lorry owners working for the Kerry County Council down the years&mdash;we had up to 21 trucks in 1979: up to four years ago there were six employed by the Kerry County Council&mdash;last Monday four extra were called on.  Here, again, we see that we have unemployment, people who are completely out of work.  They have trucks purchased on hire-purchase.  How do those people find themselves at the moment?</P>
    <P>We also find ourselves reduced in regard to local improvements schemes. In Kerry alone we had a cut of £85,000. I would also like the Minister to bear in mind that in this year when we are told to spare energy if at all possible no money was made available for bog roads.  Thanks be to God we had an amount of fine weather in the last few weeks and where turf was cut, it was saved and people were able to bring it out of the bogs because the weather was dry.  What position would we be in if circumstances had been the same as they were 12 months ago?  Unless we can get more money in the near future all our county managers have warned us that there will be redundancies.</P>
    <P>Regarding local authoriy houses, any money we have got in Kerry so far was to complete the houses started in 1979. Not one penny have we got to start one house in 1980.  That is information I received from the county council office last Monday morning.  We find ourselves in Kerry at the moment bringing forward over 80 houses unfinished in 1979.  We would like the Minister to send some money into Kerry because we have everything in order.  The plots of ground are there; all the transfers have taken place; the builders are waiting but we have no cash.</P>
    <P>We also have land made available in Tralee Urban Council area where people can build their own homes.  These are farming co-operatives.  We have 22 in a co-operative in Tralee at the moment who are about to start building their own homes.  These are important but unless <Col N="548" /> we can get more cash we will find young married people paying excessively high prices for flats.  Some people are at present living in completely overcrowded houses and also in caravans.</P>
    <P>Tarbert, where there is an ESB station, may be in dire straits in the next few months if we cannot supply it with fresh water.  A contract went from Kerry County Council to the Department over six months ago and we have not heard one word about it since then.  I would like the Minister to help us out in this matter.  Anything that can be made available at the moment to the county council will be very, very welcome indeed.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan and the Minister himself conveyed that we on this side of the House wanted permission from the Department of the Environment to increase rates above 10 per cent on the existing ratepayers in local authority areas.  Nobody said that. At no stage did anybody on this side of the House say that.  What we did say was that the 10 per cent that we are getting from the Central Fund is not sufficient to carry on the work that has to be done.  I said it earlier, and I will say it again, that out of that 10 per cent local authorities have statutory commitments, commitments to vocational committees. agricultural committees, drainage boards and the demands from these subsidiary bodies are much higher than 10 per cent.  This means that the income to the local authority concerned is reduced below 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1979 the local authority that I happened to be a member of had to contribute 58 per cent of an increase to one drainage district and I said earlier today and I say it again now, that drainage is not and should not be the responsibility of a local authority, particularly now when the income that we have it so much controlled.  There was no question of anybody saying from this side of the House that the local authorities should get permission to go above 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> There is not a human being in this House who realises the problem of the small businessman as much as I do because I happen to be one.  I know his commitments the whole way.  I know the way every charge has substantially increased and some of them substantially increased since the present Government came into office&mdash;postal and telephone charges, ESB charges.  It is a very difficult situation for these people trying to meet the demands on them.  I certainly think that was most unfair.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowling came in here and attacked everybody about the eastern by-pass and he inferred that there were some people trying to sabotage Dublin county.  I do not know if the Senator is a member of the Dublin Corporation but four people of his party voted against this development.  You would think it was the Fine Gael or the Labour Party who were the cause of this.  Far from it, on top of that, 23 people voted for the amendment and 15 people voted against it.  That is democracy.  I cannot see anything wrong with it.  I cannot see his point unless he was encouraging the Minister to do what happened before under a Fianna Fáil Government, abolish the Dublin Corporation in order to put the by-pass through.  I do not know if that was in his mind.  That is how I see it.</P>
    <P>I was looking through the Fianna Fáil manifesto as the debate was going on and on page 27, paragraph 6 clearly states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will introduce a new scheme for house improvement grants.</P>
    <P>When they came into office they increased the improvement grants; they increased the grants for water and sewerage; they increased the grants for reconstruction; they increased other grants such as those for septic tanks but, suddenly all these grants have been withdrawn.  I have read through this manifesto and I cannot find anywhere in it that they said they were going to withdraw the grants.  Nowhere is that said in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan again made the statement <Col N="550" /> that Fianna Fáil do not &ldquo;blow&rdquo; or talk about what they do.  I would suggest to Senator Lanigan that he take an hour or an hour and a half off and read through this manifesto and see what was promised and what has been fulfilled.  If we look at the next paragraph on the same page, it says that Fianna Fáil recognise the importance of encouraging people to remain in rural Ireland and will provide adequate funds for local improvement and amenity schemes.  Not alone that, but in my own constituency they prepared a very glamorous leaflet that I am sure a number of people read. It says that the necessary funds will be made available for local improvement schemes.  The necessary funds that have been made available, as Senator O'Brien said earlier, are such that in Cavan if you apply for a local improvement grant it takes five years; in Monaghan he said it was six years; in my own County Leitrim it is eight to nine years.  Anybody applying for a local improvement scheme there will have to wait eight to nine years for it despite the promise that was clearly given in the manifesto.  If that is not &ldquo;blowing&rdquo; about what you are going to do I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>We look now at page 28 of the manifesto where we find it stated that Fianna Fáil recognise local authority structures so that everyone can better participate in decisions affecting his own community and play his part in the development of local initiatives.  Let us look at that.  Since they came into office all power has been swept away from the local authorities.  A number of people here are members of local authorities. You go to the estimates meeting of the local authority; the manager has sent out his estimate prepared by himself, his accountant and his engineers.  You go through the figures and you want to get a corner taken off, you want a simple footpath on something else done and you are confronted immediately by the manager and his staff.  They say: &ldquo;If you are going to do that footpath you will have to take out something else in the estimate; that is the estimate that I think is necessary; that is the estimate that I <Col N="551" /> prepared on the instructions of the county council over the past 12 months. If you want to get a corner taken off, if you want to get a footpath done, if you want to get a house reconstructed, you will have to show me within that estimate what you are taking out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no point in anybody saying to us that the local authorities are getting sufficient money to carry on&mdash;they are not.  If people like Senator Lanigan who has said that the roads are improving are so blind that they do not want to see them, if they can sit in their own cars and drive all around the place and not drive in and out of potholes, I would like them to tell me what roads they travel on.</P>
    <P>The last quotation I want to make from the Fianna Fáil manifesto is on page 6, paragraph 5.  It says:</P>
    <P>Abolishing annual road tax on all cars up to and including 16 hp from August 1977.</P>
    <P>They were abolished all right for a very short period and the next thing we found what is known now as a registration charge.</P>

That is very much tied up with the motion, but if you rule it out of order, I accept your ruling but I do not think it is a fair decision because that was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you very much.  For a few months we had it free, <Col N="552" /> and next there was this registration charge of £5.  This year it was increased by another £5 and it is now £10.  Money is going to be tighter next year, no doubt, and their will be another increase of £5. Then Senator Lanigan tells us that the Fianna Fáil Party do not &ldquo;blow&rdquo; about what they do.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent a long time telling us about the amount of loans, and how this was increased.  I said earlier and I still say it&mdash;a grant is an incentive to people building a house, and if the Government are serious about getting houses built then they will have to substantially increase the £1,000 grant. House prices have doubled in the past three years and surely it is not unreasonable to expect the Department of the Environment or the Government today to increase the £1,000 grant to at least £3,000 so to encourage people to build their own houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  There is a question of competition, keeping down the cost of local authority housing.  The Minister said that the average price for a local authority house, as quoted by contractors for the country, was £20,000 &mdash;perhaps I misunderstood the figure&mdash;for a three-roomed house and £40,000 in Dublin city for the same type of house.</P>

      <P>Sorry.  I cannot see competition bring down the price because the people who are in the building business, contractors, builders' providers&mdash;I know this from my own business&mdash;find all their costs are increasing substantially.  As Senator Dowling <Col N="554" /> said today the cost of lorries and the cost of running lorries and keeping lorries is enormous.  There is not a bit of hope of keen competition keeping the cost down because there are fewer people in this type of business.  The receivers are moving into a tremendous amount of builders' providers businesses and I am sure everybody realises that we are finding it very hard at the moment to keep floating.</P>

On the Question that the Bill be received for final consideration, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>A small number of amendments have been made to this Bill since it was last before this House and for the convenience of Senators I now propose to explain their general purport and scope.</P>
      <P>Amendments shown as Nos. 1 and 2 on the list of amendments as circulated, arose from a criticism made in the Dáil that the Minister in subsection 5 (2) could provide that decisions on certain questions would be final.  The effect of the amendments is to delete this power; that is the power to provide that the decisions would be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 arose from a possible difficulty in interpretation in relation to subsection 5 (4) that came to notice after the Bill had been before the House. Subsection 5 (4) precludes the Minister from making any provision in a scheme or regulation under the Bill which would affect, to his detriment, the superannuation conditions applicable to an employee, save where such employee exercises an option to have the revised conditions applied to him.  The amendment is to clarify the position in regard to newly appointed pensionable staff.  Two categories are involved.  First, persons <Col N="556" /> who entered the local service as officers after the windows' and orphans' pension scheme was made compulsory and were therefore noh given an option but were included in the scheme under their condtions of appointment.  The amendment will make it clear that the scheme when it is being formally validated under the Bill will not give rise to the need for an option in their cases.  Of course the introduction of a widows' and orphans' pension scheme could not be regarded as a worsening of conditions but some officer might make this claim on the basis that he had to pay contributions.  It was considered desirable therefore to put the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>The second category consists of persons who entered the service on or after 1 June 1978 and had the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977, applied to them. That scheme, which had been agreed with staff interests, came into effect on 27 May, 1977, and existing employees were entitled to opt not later than 1 June 1978, to remain under the previous arrangements.  However, persons appointed on or after 1 June 1978, were put under the new scheme as part of their conditions of appointment and pending amending legislation.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the validation of the new scheme under the Bill does not, because of the wording of subsection (4) of section 5, give rise to the need for options for these newly appointed employees.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House that the amendments now before us were agreed by all parties in the House.  It was well debated in the other House and I am glad to say that we got agreement on this.  What is happening now is that it is validating all the schemes and in future the Minister will be able to bring in new schemes as desirable.  There is no doubt but that it is a step in the righ direction. It is an improvement and I have great pleasure in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted last week to wish the new Minister well in his position so I hasten to bridge the breach and I wish him well in his new appointment.</P>
      <P>I raised a number of questions on the last occasion when the Dáil amendments first came to us.  One of them related to section 13, the right to a new tenancy.  I was concerned that the position in law be absolutely clear so that landlords and tenants alike would know whether they were entitled to a new tenancy.  The particular point I was concerned with was in regard to subsection (2) of section 13 which provides that temporary break in the use of tenement shall be disregarded if the court considers it reasonable to disregard it.  As the Minister is aware, many people grant leases for a term of less than three years at the end of which they ask the tenant to vacate the premises for a few days and they then grant another two years and nine months lease.  In recent times there has been a doubt as to whether or not that break effectively takes away the right of the tenant to what is known as the business equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my reading of section 13 it seems that that uncertainty will continue to prevail because it will be for the court to consider whether a temporary break is reasonable and to disregard it.  It seems to me that where it is clearly the intention of the landlord and the tenant that the break is designed to ensure that business rights are not acquired by the tenant that the law should clearly say so. I raised that two weeks ago when this Bill came before us.  I would like some comment on it.  There were a few other points I raised and perhaps the Minister <Col N="558" /> would deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>During Report Stage concern was expressed that the House had not sufficient opportunity to consider in detail the amendments that were made by the Dáil to this Bill since it was passed by Seanad Eireann.  I appreciate the concern and in my address to the House and in the course of that debate, I endeavoured to explain as clearly as possible the substance of the various amendments and undertook to try to furnish any additional explanations that any Member of the House might find necessary.  I now repeat that undertaking and I hope that Senators will find it possible to agree with me that the Bill has been considerably improved. If, for any reason, any Senator feels unable to agree with a particular provision in the Bill, I trust he will accept my assurance that every provision has received the most careful consideration and every argument raised for and against it, has been thoroughly examined. Sometimes where things are neither black nor white and a balance of advantage and disadvantage is involved, there is room for legitimate differences of opinion as to where a particular line should be drawn.  To the extent that that applies, it would be illusory to suppose that we could all agree about all the provisions.  Perhaps we can agree that the contribution that the Seanad has made to the Bill has been a most useful one, even if the results of that contribution did not appear until the Bill had come before the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Molony referred to the Dáil amendment of section 13 (2) which had the effect of deleting the word &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; from the subsection.  As I explained in my introductory remarks on Report Stage, this amendment of section 13 (2) was possible only because the prior amendment of section 13 (1) (a) which now imposes a separate requirement on a tenant as to the occupation and as to the business use for the purpose of acquiring rights under the Bill. As a result of that redrafting of section 13 (1) (a), a pre-arranged break in occupation <Col N="559" /> or tenancy for the purpose of ensuring that a particular letting remains outside the scope of the Bill will still be possible.  At the same time, under section 13 (2), as amended, any break in business use, provided occupation is continuous, may be disregarded by the court if the court considers it reasonable to disregard it.  Again, it all hinges on the consideration that whereas one cannot use a tenement without occupying it, one can certainly occupy a tenement and not use it for business purposes.  We can see, therefore, that section 13 (2) now caters precisely for the type of temporary break that the Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended should be catered for, that is genuinely unexpected and temporary breaks in the tenement caused by factors such as fire or storm damage, illness and so on.  At the same time, a planned break in the occupation of the tenement, that is a break in the tenancy, cannot be regarded by the court as such a break does not come within the scope of section 13 (2).  It is important to be quite clear that section 13 (2), as amended, is a re-enactment of the existing law as it has been interpreted by the courts.  In the case of the Gatien Motor Company Ltd. v. Continental Oil Company of Ireland Limited, the Supreme Court held in its judgment, delivered in April 1979, that planned breaks in tenancies in order that rights under the landlord and tenant code should not accrue are permissible. In other words, the existing landlord and tenant code permits of contracts being made outside that law.  Section 13 (2), as amended, represents no change in the law as it is.  Therefore, it merely makes more explicit the expression of that law in the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by sincerely thanking Senator Molony for his words of welcome to the House.</P>

    <Title>Arbitration Bill, 1980: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be <Col N="560" /> now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains the legislative provisions necessary to enable two international conventions relating to arbitration to be ratified.  It also contains an amendment of the law in relation to the power of a court to stay proceedings in a matter which the parties have agreed to refer to arbitration.</P>
      <P>The first convention dealt with in the Bill is the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral awards.  This is a United Nations convention which was designed to replace the earlier 1923 Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses and the 1927 Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Both the Geneva Protocol and Convention were given effect to in this country by the Arbitration Act, 1954.  The New York Convention grew out of dissatisfaction with the earlier Geneva provisions and to date has been ratified by 56 countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the New York Convention, and section 9 deals with the grounds on which enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused under the convention.  While the grounds of refusal are largely the same as the grounds of refusal permitted under the Geneva Convention which are set out in our 1954 Act, the New York Convention makes a significant change in the burden of proof imposed on the parties. Under the Geneva Convention it is for the party seeking enforcement to prove that the arbitration agreement is valid, that the award was made by the tribunal provided for in the agreement or constituted in the manner agreed by the parties, that the award was made in conformity with the law governing the procedure, that it has become final in the country in which it was made and that it was made in respect of a matter which may lawfully be referred to arbitration. Under the New York Convention, once the party seeking to enforce an award has made his application for enforcement in proper form, the burden passes <Col N="561" /> to the other party to prove the existence of grounds on which enforcement should be refused.  The Geneva Convention was regarded as placing too high a burden on the party seeking enforcement and as making obstruction by the party resisting enforcement possible.</P>
    <P>Also, the New York Convention applies to a wider range of awards than does the earlier convention.  Under the Geneva Convention an award to be enforceable had to have been made between persons subject to the jurisdiction of different contracting states, and this meant that account had to be taken of questions of the nationality or habitual residence of the parties.  This type of restriction is not repeated in the New York Convention.</P>
    <P>The convention in Article 1 provides that it shall apply to awards made in the territory of a state other than the state in which recognition and enforcement is sought.  Paragraph 3 of that Article, however, enables a state to limit enforcement of awards made in the territory of another contracting state.  The definition of &ldquo;award&rdquo; in section 6 takes advantage of this latter provision on the basis that it is proper that we should undertake to enforce only awards make in a country which, in its turn, has undertaken, by being a party to the convention, to enforce Irish awards.</P>
    <P>Before passing from the New York Convention I might mention briefly that ratification has EEC implications.  Member states of the community are obliged under Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome to bring about the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal enforcement of arbitration awards.  The member states decided that this obligation could best be met by all members ratifying the New York Convention. Thus, ratification of that convention will enable us to meet the obligation imposed by Article 220.  All other EEC states, except Luxembourg, are parties to the New York Convention.</P>
    <P>The other international convention which enactment of the Bill will enable us to ratify is the Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes <Col N="562" /> between States and Nationals of Other States.  Part IV of the Bill deals with this convention.  The purpose of the convention, which was sponsored by the World Bank, is to encourage the flow of private investment into underdeveloped countries by providing an acceptable facility for the resoultion of disputes that might arise between the private investor and the state with whom the investor has made an investment agreement.  The facility provided is the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington.  Panels of conciliators and arbitrators are maintained at the centre and may be called upon by parties to an investment dispute.  Resort to conciliation or arbitration is not, however, obligatory under the convention. It is up to the parties to any investment agreement or to any dispute arising from an investment agreement to decide whether or not they wish to use the facilities of the centre, but once consent in writing has been given to arbitration it cannot be unilaterally withdrawn and the other party can insist on arbitration being proceeded with.</P>
    <P>In giving private interests direct access to an international tribunal in a dispute with a sovereign state the convention brings a novel feature into the international field.  Because a private investor had no status in international law he had no direct access to an international tribunal such as the International Court of Justice in a claim against a sovereign state.  If he wished to pursue his claim on the international plane he had to invoke the diplomatic assistance of his own state, which would not be the most appropriate means of resolving a commercial dispute.  In an effort to fill this gap the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague adapted its rules in 1962 to permit it to deal with disputes between private investors and states but this did not prove successful. Tribunals set up by private organisations such as the International Chamber of Commerce were frequently unacceptable to Governments in dispute with private investors.  Similarly, resort to the courts of the state party to the dispute would not always be acceptable to the private <Col N="563" /> investor.  The convention fills the gap in international law by providing an international tribunal acceptable to both the investor and the state with whom the investment agreement has been made. Because the investor is given direct access to the tribunal in a claim against a state he must forego diplomatic assistance of his own country in relation to the particular dispute unless, of course, the state with whom he is in dispute fails to honour its obligations under the convention.</P>
    <P>The convention has so far been ratified by 75 states, and provision for the use of the facilities of the international centre has been inserted in an increasing number of bilateral treaties dealing with investment.  This indicates that the convention has found a wide measure of acceptance throughout the world.  Ireland signed the convention on 30 August 1966.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions of the Washington Convention are taken up with the organisation of the international centre and the conduct and procedures of conciliation and arbitration and do not require implementing provisions in the Bill.  Article 54 obliges each contracting state to recognise an award as binding and to enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by the award as if the award were a final judgment of a court in that state.  Section 16 of the Bill gives effect to that provision.  Since other provisions of the convention permit applications to be made to the centre for the rectification, interpretation, revision or annulment of an award, which could result in enforcement of the award being stayed, section 17 of the Bill gives power to the High Court to stay enforcement where such applications have been made under the convention.</P>
    <P>An award under the Washington Convention is different from an ordinary commercial award for which enforcement might be sought under the New York Convention.  The Washington Convention award is made by a tribunal acceptable to all contracting states and in accordance with procedures which are <Col N="564" /> known and accepted by all such states. These procedures have adequate safeguards to ensure compliance with the basic requirements of justice.  It is because of this that contracting states can accept that Washington Convention awards should be enforced as if they were orders of a court.  This accounts for the absence from the convention and from the Bill of a list of grounds, such as the list in section 9 in relation to New York Convention awards, on which enforcement can be refused.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Article 55 of the convention, however, the obligation to enforce an award will not derogate from the law in force in any contracting state relating to immunity of that state or of any foreign state from execution.  The only point that needs to be made in regard to this provision is to emphasise that any state against whom an award was made who refused to honour the award by claiming immunity from execution would be in breach of its obligations under the convention and would leave itself open to action on the international plane by the investor's home state on behalf of the investor.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the power of a court to stay proceedings in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement.  Our present law is contained in section 12 of the Arbitration Act, 1954.  Subsection (2) of that section requires a court to stay proceedings in certain circumstances where there is an arbitration agreement to which the Geneva Protocol of 1923 applies.  Subsection (1) provides that, in matters which are the subject of other arbitration agreements, a court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is not sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration and the party applying for the stay is ready and willing to proceed with the arbitration.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the New York Convention requires a court, at the request of one of the parties, to stay proceedings instituted where there is an arbitration agreement and to refer the parties to arbitration.  Article 26 of the <Col N="565" /> Washington Convention provides that consent to arbitration shall exclude any other remedy, unless otherwise stated. Section 5 is designed to give effect to these provisions and to continue the effect given by section 12 (2) of the 1954 Act to the similar provision in the 1923 Geneva Protocol.</P>
    <P>Section 5 applies, however, to all arbitration agreements, not just agreements to which the New York Convention, the Washington Convention, or the Geneva Protocol applies.  Domestic arbitration agreements are therefore being assimilated to foreign agreements and in relation to domestic agreements, as in the case of other agreements, a court will be required to stay proceedings unless the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, or there is not in fact any dispute between the parties with regard to the matter agreed to be referred to arbitration.</P>
    <P>The reason for applying the requirement to stay proceedings to domestic as well as other agreements is that it is desirable that parties who have agreed to submit a dispute to arbitration should be held to their agreement.  I understand that the usual practice of the court in dealing with applications under section 12 (1) of the 1954 Act is to stay the proceedings instituted, in other words, to proceed on the basis that the parties should be held to their arbitration agreement. This is also the position in the continental states of the EEC so that one result of section 5 will be to bring our law into line with those countries' laws.</P>
    <P>I trust the Bill will be acceptable to the House.  Ratification of the New York Convention, apart from enabling us to comply with an obligation imposed by our membership of the EEC, will bring our rules relating to the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards into line with those applying in most other countries. As I have mentioned, the Washington Convention was sponsored by the World Bank and it is appropriate that Ireland, a member of the World Bank, should ratify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I <Col N="566" /> have spoken in this House since the new Minister came to visit us here and, as a man from a neighbouring county, Mayo, I should like to wish him well&mdash;at least until the next general election&mdash;in his present position as Minister.</P>
      <P>This Arbitration Bill, 1980, is a very simple matter in relation to which I shall not have much to say.  Basically it enables us to honour our international obligations.  As a country with a very healthy foreign policy, a country which is involved to a tremendous extent in imports and exports, and with such international obligations, naturally it is acceptable to us.  Of the two conventions to which we are addressing ourselves here, it seems to me that the most laudatory is the Washington Convention which is sponsored by the World Bank. It is obviously desirable that we should be a party to this since Ireland is a member of the World Bank.  It seems to me a very necessary convention.  It deals with the question of the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other countries.  It deals with issues concerning private investment in under-developed countries.  Obviously there is a problem in this investment area in the Third World because, while such investment is very desirable, whilst it has all kinds of implications for the people of the Third World, and for international peace, there is obviously a commercial problem due to the instability in many of these countries.  While in the developed world there may well be the will in the commercial community to invest in projects in such countries, the instability that exists in many of these parts of the world makes this investment a very risky type of activity.  Obviously this move by the World Bank to provide this facility for the resolution of such disputes that might exist between the private investor and the State where the investment is made, gives that added necessary stability to the investment which should increase substantially the level and flow of funds into the Third World from the developed world.  It is a very significant development.  Very happily we agree with it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> The other convention, the New York Convention, is a replacement of the previous Geneva Convention and the Geneva Protocol.  From reading about this New York Convention it seems that it is putting the onus of proof, in terms of arbitration, not on the person or individual or company instigating proceedings, but on the defendants to show reasons why the action of the protagonists is not justified.  It is probably healthy.  I imagine that, under the previous convention, where the onus of proof was entirely with the proposer of the arbitration it would be extremely difficult.  Having regard to the problems of attempting to prove this in another country it was probably very unwieldly and this is probably necessary.</P>
    <P>This, again, is in line with our international obligations.  It has EEC implications under Article 220, simplification of formalities governing reciprocal enforcement of arbitration awards.  I gather that all EEC states, with the single exception of Luxembourg, are parties to this New York Convention.</P>
    <P>This is an uncontroversial matter. The details were teased out substantially before it was brought to the notice of this House.  I want to assure the Minister that this Bill has the support of our party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have mentioned, ratification of the New York Convention will bring our rules relating <Col N="568" /> to foreign arbitration awards into line with those obtaining in other countries. This is important even given the fact that foreign arbitration awards rarely, if ever, come before our courts for enforcement, which indicates that arbitration awards are generally complied with.  It is important that foreign commercial interests contemplating contracts with Irish interests will know that our system accepts the internationally recognised rules in this area.</P>
      <P>The Washington Convention, perhaps, has most relevance for the underdeveloped countries.  However, once ratified by this country, it will ensure for any Irish interest which enters into an investment agreement with a foreign country an acceptable tribunal which, with the agreement of the parties, can be used to have any disputes arising resolved in accordance with rules that ensure fairness and justice to each party.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by thanking Senator Staunton, my western political colleague, very sincerely for his kind welcome.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 June 1980.</P>
