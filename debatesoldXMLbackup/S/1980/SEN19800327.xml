      <P>This Bill derives from the employment guarantee provisions of the national understanding negotiated last year by the employer organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government.  Under the terms of the guarantee, the Government and employers are each contributing £10 million towards a £20 million special joint public and private sector employment <Col N="1496" /> programme with a view to making good a shortfall of up to 5,000 jobs in the employment target for the year.  This programme is being supervised by the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment who were specially set up to oversee the implementation of the measures on employment in the national understanding.</P>

      <P>It was not.  The employer organisations proposed that the employers' contribution to the special employment programme should be collected by way of a surcharge on the employer's social security contribution. The Bill, in addition to establishing a statutory employment guarantee fund provides, therefore, for the deduction of a special 0.35 per cent levy to be known as the employers' employment surcharge and which will apply only for the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1980.</P>
      <P>The national understanding recognises the creation of more employment as the central objective of economic and social policy.  A deep sense of commitment to expanding employment opportunities is shared by all of the parties to the understanding. The employment guarantee expresses that commitment in a practical yet imaginative way.  The tripartite committee cast their net widely when inviting suggestions for the special job creation programme.  They had a speedy and gratifying response from both the private and the public sectors.  As a result, many extremely worthwhile projects and schemes, which may not otherwise have been undertaken, were given the goahead. I shall describe some of the more noteworthy of these initiatives in more detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> I paid tribute in the Dáil to the work of the tripartite committee.  I am sure that Senators, too, will join with me in applauding the signal achievements of the committee.  Their approach to the task of determining the content of the special job creation programme was both responsible and sympathetic.  As chairman of the committee I was greatly encouraged by the constructive, cooperative attitude of the industry, employers and trade union representatives, and their ready appreciation of particular sectoral needs.  Their joint initiative leading to the introduction of the employers' temporary subvention has already a very wide welcome.</P>
    <P>The proposal for an employment guarantee was formulated in the context of the employment target for last year of an increase of 25,000 in numbers at work.  When the tripartite committee met for the first time last September they concluded that there would be a shortfall in this target and decided, therefore, that the employment guarantee should be implemented.</P>
    <P>We have every reason to be proud of our employment achievements during 1979.  Final figures are not yet available, but the indications are that total employment grew by about 15,000 in a year in which we encountered many economic difficulties both at home and abroad. This is not far short of the record performance of 17,000 net new jobs achieved during 1978.</P>
    <P>Published statistics on the trend of industrial employment are available only for the first half of 1979 but these point to an increase of the order of 9,000 in employment in transportable goods industries over the year.  Employment in the construction and services sectors was also buoyant for much of the year. Drawing these trends in industry and services together, employment in the non-agricultural sector in 1979 may have grown by up to 20,000 on a net basis.  Numbers employed in agriculture are, however, reckoned to have fallen in accordance with their long-term trend with the result that total employment for <Col N="1498" /> the economy as a whole expanded by somewhere in the region of 15,000.</P>
    <P>The favourable trends in employment last year were reflected in the statistics of unemployment, redundancies and vacancies. With only one or two interruptions, the live register, adjusted to take account of seasonal movements in numbers, showed a continuing downward trend. Numbers on the live register in 1979 were over 11 per cent lower than a year earlier.  The number of redundancies notified to the Department of Labour fell for the second year running.  Moreover, the total of vacancies notified to the National Manpower Service was up substantially on 1978.  In fact, there were labour shortages in some areas.</P>
    <P>We have fared considerably better than the majority of our EEC partners. The average unemployment rate for the EEC as a whole moved up slightly last year from 5.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent of the working population.  Ireland, on the other hand, recorded a remarkable reduction in unemployment&mdash;from 8.8 per cent of the working population in 1978 to 7.9 per cent last year.  Indeed, our unemployment rate has fallen by almost 2 percentage points from its 1976 peak of 9.8 per cent.  The average EEC unemployment rate over the same period increased from 4.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>We should not, however, blind ourselves to the difficulties which a deteriorating international economic climate will pose for employment in 1980.  It is expected that economic growth in both the OECD and the EEC will be much lower than last year.  Accompanying this lower level of activity will be a rise in unemployment in most member countries, an increase which will be quite sharp in certain instances.  The Commission's annual report, published at the end of last year, on the economic situation of the Community and economic policy guidelines for 1980 predicts that the average unemployment rate for the Community will increase to 6.2 per cent.  The report's assessment of our situation suggests that growth will remain moderate in 1980 and that, in <Col N="1499" /> view of the initial impact of dearer imported raw materials and the effect of wage indexation, there could be unfavourable consequences for job-creation which might well lead to a deterioration in unemployment, given the rapid rise in the labour force.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, as I affirmed in my budget statement, the Government are acutely conscious of the need to do everything to support and increase employment. It was with this objective in mind that I specifically structured my budget so as not to hit the sources of growth and employment.  Notwithstanding the restraint which necessarily had to be imposed on public expenditure this year, I made priority allocations for particular activities which I saw as contributing in a significant way to increasing soundly based employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>Investment in infrastructure provides a great deal of on-site employment and also greatly facilitates the task of the industrial promotion agencies.  I provided, therefore, for a 32 per cent increase in Public Capital Programme spending on infrastructure.  I decided also to increase substantially the budgets of the industrial promotion agencies.  Córas Tráchtála have been allocated 31 per cent more than they spent in 1979, while the allocation for the Industrial Development Authority is 21 per cent up on last year. These represent increases way above the level provided for generally in the 1980 Estimates.</P>
    <P>These brief remarks on the employment situation will give Senators some idea of the general frame of reference within which the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment have been examining proposals for the special joint public and private sector employment programme.  The committee have met so far on nine occasions.  They have drawn up certain criteria for their guidance in the allocation of moneys from the employment guarantee fund.  These criteria provide, for example, that the fund should be used to support (i) the creation of new jobs which would not be created in the usual course, (ii) the maintenance <Col N="1500" /> of existing jobs which would otherwise be discontinued, or (iii) the bringing forward of permanent jobs which would otherwise not have commenced until later.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, the contribution per job would not exceed £4,000 but, in circumstances where the provision of facilities would have a demonstrably positive impact on the attraction of investment and employment to a region, the committee may allow a higher upper limit.  This in itself is clear evidence of the committee's commitment to support worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>£20 million was available under the national understanding for allocation to the special employment programme.  The committee have to date reached agreement on broad allocations amounting to £18 million and should complete the allocation of resources in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already of the committee's support for the employers' temporary subvention.  The Government have been obliged to terminate the employment maintenance scheme as from the end of this month as a result of EEC objections to the scheme.  As this scheme helped to safeguard the jobs of many workers in the clothing, textiles and footwear industries, its withdrawal would have the effect of putting many of these jobs immediately at risk.  The tripartite committee accordingly decided to apply portion of the employers' contributions to the employment guarantee fund to financing a new scheme which will operate from 1 April until the end of the year.  Under the terms of the scheme, a subsidy payment of £5 per person employed will be made to firms for a period not exceeding 26 weeks and a payment of £4 per person for the following 13 weeks.  The scheme will be administered by a steering committee of employer and congress representatives.  Firms employing more than 100 persons will be required to submit development plans as a condition of qualifying for the full benefits under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The committee also decided to support the proposal made by the Taoiseach <Col N="1501" /> that moneys should be made available from the employment guarantee fund for a programme of job creation through the provision of sports and other recreational facilities.  This programme will be administered by Cospóir, the National Sports Council, and will involve the construction of several major community sports and recreation centres, as well as a number of smaller-scale projects at various locations around the country.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education will shortly be submitting a detailed programme for approval by the tripartite committee.  As I explained in the Dáil, this is a major new initiative and will not be in substitution for Government spending on youth and sporting organisations.  The facilities to be provided under the programme will be available to entire local communities.  Indeed, projects will not be supported from the fund unless a clear assurance has been given that they are not for the exclusive use of a particular group or groups.</P>
    <P>Other noteworthy projects or schemes supported by the commitee include: a temporary extension of the employment incentive scheme to cover the payment of a temporary supplementary premium of £10 per week in respect of all eligible persons under the scheme and a further temporary supplementary premium of £10 per week in the case of each eligible person who has also been on the live register for at least 26 weeks in the 12 months immediately preceding employment under the scheme.  This is unique among the employment measures in that it provides a particular incentive for reentry into the labour force of the long-term unemployed.  The supplementary measures came into effect on 31 December 1979 and are due to terminate on 30 June next.  A 1,000-job public sector programme including environmental improvement schemes, temporary youth employment projects, tourist amenities and county development team projects. An AnCO scheme for the recruitment of 200 additional engineering apprentices. Construction of an airport at Waterford. Provision of a dredger and pilot launch <Col N="1502" /> for Waterford Harbour to be built by Ross Company Ltd., New Ross.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the employment guarantee fund is jointly Financed by the Government and by employers. The Government's contribution of £10 million will be provided from moneys to be voted by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The employers' £10 million will, at the suggestion of the employers' organisations be raised by way of a surcharge on the employer's social insurance contribution. The original intention was that the surcharge should be collected under the pay-related social insurance system and that deductions should commence before the end of 1979 but this was found not to be practicable.  The tripartite standing committee accordingly agreed that the introduction of the surcharge might be deferred to 6 April 1980&mdash;the beginning of the 1980&mdash;81 contribution year.  I should add that this did not interfere in any way with spending on approved projects as the Government, last December, paid £3 million from their contribution into a grant-in-aid account opened specially for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The tripartite committee also agreed that the surcharge should not apply in respect of public sector employment as the Government were contributing separately to the employment guarantee fund.</P>
    <P>The text of the national understanding specifies a surcharge of ½ per cent on the employer's social security contribution. The tripartite committee confirmed, however, that the purpose of the surcharge was to raise £10 million and that the rate of surcharge should be determined accordingly.  The Government have, therefore, at the request of the employer organisations, taken a great deal of care with the calculation of the required rate of surcharge.  The rate required, on the best information available, is 0.35 per cent.  The surcharge will apply only for the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes the necessary statutory provision for implementation of the employment guarantee provisions <Col N="1503" /> of the national understanding and I commend it, therefore, for the approval of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any money made available to help unemployment is welcome and particularly at present when there is a widespread growing fear about future employment prospects. Having said that, it must also be emphasised that this fund is being set up largely through the good offices of employers who will contribute up to £10 million to the fund.  The contribution forthcoming from the Government can be obtained by pruning down on other Estimates for other Departments and other sections of the national economy. It should also be said that we are not unique in having such schemes to help people in difficult times.</P>
      <P>This fund is being provided within the context of circumstances which are most unfavourable for future employment. The Minister is already on record as stating that there are great doubts that the employment targets for 1980 will be achieved.  With a projected 1 per cent growth rate only for 1980 one can envisage that this will have certain adverse effects on the employment levels.  We are all aware of the vast increase in the school leaving population and so many thousands of young people will be coming on the market from June onwards that anything which can be done to ease the burden on their parents is welcome.  Parents are expressing great concern about finding suitable and adequate opportunities for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there have been various hints and nods about certain cuts in living standards which might be expected by the public next year.  This does not set up a favourable atmosphere or climate for receiving the ultimate co-operation of trade union organisations and the work force.  That has to be borne in mind when considering the effect this fund will have on easing and softening the burden of unemployment.  Inflation is now raging at such a rate that there will be a very substantial&mdash;indeed, excessive, and I <Col N="1504" /> would almost say shameful in the present day circumstances of world economies&mdash;increase in prices between now and the end of this year.  This will mean a reduction in demand for certain products which will mean a cut-back in employment in the manufacturing industries related to those products.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have already put on record their concern about credit.  The tight credit restrictions we will see over the next year will likewise have an effect on investment and the creation of employment opportunities.  In the context of all those rather unfavourable circumstances facing us we see this fund being set up.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the work I have seen done by the IDA in conjunction with various bodies such as chambers of commerce and local industrial development organisations in trying to create certain employment opportunities and in trying to create production methods which can substitute for imported materials.  There has been a good response by various chambers of commerce and local development organisations to the scheme set up over a year ago by the IDA.  In one region they received something like 60 or 70 projects which were set out in quite considerable detail by the people who were interested in creating new employment opportunities and, out of those, of course, will come some positive employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the textiles industry. We did not move early enough in applying more sophisticated methods to the textiles industry.  For example, West Germany at least a decade ago went into the upper strata of this industry where rather more sophisticated textiles are the norm.  We did not realise early enough that developing countries in the Far East and in the Third World generally, would have to be given the option of going into the textiles industry for employment creation in those countries.  We paid the penalty for not moving quickly enough into manufacturing textiles in a rather more sophisticated way.  We must raise our sights in this Field.  We cannot continue <Col N="1505" /> subsidising the industry in competition with Third World countries.  There is a political aspect involved in allowing Third World countries to go into the textiles employment field.  We must raise our sights and standards in the textiles industry in Ireland in future.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with winding up the fund.  Subsection (2)  provides:</P>
    <P>The Fund shall be wound up when the aggregate expenditure from the Fund (inclusive of payments out of the Employment Guarantee Fund grant-in-aid account) reaches £20,000,000, and any balance remaining in or to the credit of the Fund shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister may direct.</P>
    <P>I hope that, since the employers are contributing to this fund with the specific intention of maintaining, preserving and creating employment opportunities, the Minister will not allow any balance of funds remaining to be disposed of other than in that sphere.  That would be a disservice and a reflection on the motivation behind the fund.</P>
    <P>It is mainly through the goodwill of the employers that this Bill is here before us today.  The Government can obtain funds by pruning expenditure in other Departments.  It is interesting to read in the Estimates presented a month ago that the employment guarantee fund showed the largest percentage increase over 1979 under any departmental heading that I could see.  This gives us an indication of the rather severe times which lie ahead of us and I hope those severe times will be short.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not oppose this Bill but there are some qualifications about the manner and purpose of the use of the fund which might be appropriately mentioned.  Even in these rather dark days of slowdown of growth in the United States and Europe, one should try to concentrate on development plans rather than on mere maintenance of existing output and employment. <Col N="1506" /> Maintenance subventions, however necessary, must remain temporary expedients to be justified by the breathing space they provide for adjustment, adaptation and change&mdash;in other words, for the retraining, re-equipment, modernisation, or whatever may be needed, to put employment and output on a sound, lasting basis.  This is a point which applies to all firms, not just to the larger firms employing 100 or more. Some years ago small expert teams were organised, when we were considering entry to the EEC, to study the conditions necessary for the survival and development of particular industries.  Perhaps there is a role for them in the context of this employment guarantee fund.</P>
      <P>What we are dealing with in many sectors, especially the labour-intensive industries like textiles and clothing, is not just the effect of present depressed world conditions, which one might expect to be off-set once we entered again a cycle of stronger growth.  Essentially we are dealing with a situation in which there is a permanent threat to the viability of certain industries coming from increased competition from newly industrialised areas of the world: Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and Brazil. This competition is accentuating and making more immediate the threat to labour-intensive industries which have not adapted to change.  It is a threat which is made more acute by the prevalence of sluggish trade conditions in major markets.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore the need for us to hold our place in world trade in more normal times, not by clinging on to outmoded and non-competitive forms of production, but by constantly moving up the scale in technology, quality, design and value added.  As Senator Markey said, we should be moving on to more sophisticated products appropriate to our higher income and employment expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, I suggest, is the only valid and effective response to the difficulties we are now in.  I believe the Minister recognises this.  I was glad to see from a report in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> that <Col N="1507" /> the Irish Congress of Trade Unions also recognise it.  Their vice-president, Mr. Dan Murphy, is reported as saying there was a danger of being over-cautious and missing the opportunities which new technology presented in terms of eliminating boring jobs, moving people to interesting occupations, reducing working time and securing a substantial share of the increased wealth which higher productivity would bring.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of misunderstanding about the growing competition in certain sectors from the newly industrialised countries of the Far East. Anxiety is understandable in particular sectors where markets are being penetrated and taken over to a large degree.  But there is a tendency to forget that the industrialisation of the Third World is necessary and desirable for human progress.  There is a tendency to forget that the overall effect on output and employment in the western world itself is beneficial.  These newly industrialised countries are importing far more than they are exporting.  They are running into debt to do so.  They are large and expanding markets for the exports of the older developed countries.</P>
    <P>The net trade balance of the older developed countries with these new developing countries has been positive in recent years in all but two categories of manufacturers: clothing and other consumer goods.  The older industrial countries are, for example, still increasing their exports to these new countries in chemicals, agricultural and industrial machinery, machine parts, road vehicles and so on.</P>
    <P>One may ask what is the net employment impact of all this change in relationship between the developed and developing countries?  The studies that exist show that the net employment impact on the older countries has not so far been adverse.  There has been, on the contrary, as OECD estimates suggest, a substantial positive employment impact over the period 1973 to 1977 of close to 200,000 jobs annually in the OECD area.  In other words, the older industrial <Col N="1508" /> countries have been developing additions to employment through their net trade surplus with these newly industrialised countries.  There has been also, as one would expect, an upgrading of employment in the older developed countries because the jobs created by exports to the developing countries are in more skilled occupations with more value-added than in the jobs displaced by imports from those countries.  I think it is well to offer these general observations so that our efforts to maintain and develop employment will be set in a broad, enlightened and sustainable framework consistent with our favourable attitude to Third World development and not in a narrow, protectionist one.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I make another general point?  I suggested in public a few months ago, and would like to repeat in the context of this debate, that we should beware of a tendency to over-emphasise employment as our principal policy aim. I say this not because increased employment is not an extremely important objective but because another objective logically precedes it.  Increased production on an efficient basis must be the first priority in this highly competitive world. If we seek this first and achieve it to a high degree, the great boon of new and secure employment will be added.  But to the extent that we fail to raise output on competitive terms or stop moving up the scale in technology and value-added we shall be missing opportunities to create durable new jobs.  The worst possible combination from the employment aspect would be a low rate of growth, an overprotective concern for less efficient industries, high grates of increases in money incomes and prices and an intolerably large external deficit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the statements made about it by the Minister.  The affairs and the activities of the tripartite committee are, of course, confidential to a high degree.  Consequently as a member of that committee, representing the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I feel that perhaps I should not <Col N="1509" /> go into detail in respect of the committee. However, in introducing the Bill the Minister specified a number of areas in which the tripartite committee have assisted and supported projects including the provision of a dredger for the Ross Company, the money to be provided by the Waterford Harbour Commissioners.  It is a fact that the tripartite committee have given support of a certain nature to this project.  It well may be that this is dependent on certain moneys being provided by the Waterford Harbour Commissioners.  I would like to ask the Minister in the event of it not being possible for the Harbour Commissioners to provide the necessary funds in support of this scheme, if he will seek to have the provision of a dredger made possible by some other means either through further assistance by the tripartite committee or out of governmental resources.  It is very important that the Ross Company should be given this contract.  About 300 jobs are at risk in a small area such as Ross. If the company have to close down, there will be a spill-over into other areas in County Wexford and perhaps throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of the dredger will not solve the problems of the Ross Company. It will help to tide them over for about six months during which time I suggest that the Government and the Minister should have a look at the real problems affecting the company.  The Ross Company are a shipbuilding enterprise and, unfortunately, Irish fishermen and even the Government are not giving orders for the provision of boats and vessels to Irish shipyards.  Most of the orders from fishermen around the coast are unfortunately going to other European countries, mainly the Netherlands. If this company's problems are to be solved on a permanent basis, the problems of other shipbuilding yards around the country will also have to be solved.  If employment is to be maintained and extended in all these sectors the Government will have to do something, perhaps give grants through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, to ensure that <Col N="1510" /> Irish shipyards get a fair share of the orders for boats and vessels and so on for Irish fishermen and others.</P>
    <P>In referring to the employment scheme the Minister said that it had to be abandoned because of EEC commitments and objections.  I do not know how valid the objections are but I do know that other member countries seem to be getting away with absolute murder. Only the other day Mrs. Thatcher stated that France seemed to ignore completely EEC regulations and provisions. Perhaps the Minister could take this matter up and give us some information about the non-adherence of some member countries of the EEC to their own commitments.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill.  It would be true to say it follows in a natural order of progression from the manifesto of 1977. In my opinion that still stands as one of the outstanding manifestos or programmes I have seen.  The major priority was and still is the creation of more jobs.  Once again let it be stated that we are in a unique position.  This has often been stated before but it cannot be stated often enough, that half of our population is under the age of 25.  That makes the task of providing jobs for our young people in particular a tremendous undertaking, a tremendous responsibility. Already we have signs that the strategy is working.  The creation of between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs in 1979 was indeed a remarkable achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister gave very encouraging figures with regard to employment. The average unemployment rate for the EEC as a whole rose last year from 5.5 to 5.6 per cent of the working population, whereas we had a decrease in unemployment from 8.5 per cent to 7.9 per cent.  That is a remarkable achievement and it puts shame on those who go on with the constant complaint that we are getting worse and worse. Since 1976 when we were at our peak as far as unemployment was concerned, our unemployment has dropped by 2 per cent but sadly unemployment in the <Col N="1511" /> EEC increased during that period from 4.9 to 5.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill was stated quite clearly by the Minister.  Everybody can read it for himself.  It proposes to work on the lines of the creation of new jobs which would not be created in the usual course.  That shows the imaginative approach of the tripartite committee in tackling the unemployment problem.  Secondly, there is the maintenance of existing jobs which would otherwise be discontinued.  It is a fact known to everybody that existing jobs are in grave danger at present because with the advance in technology, new types of machinery, implements and even clothing are coming on the market every day.  It will require all the ingenuity of the tripartite committee and the Government to safeguard as far as possible the jobs that already exist.  Thirdly, there is the matter of bringing forward permanent jobs which otherwise would not have commenced until later.  This is very important.  There is mention of a figure of £4,000 per job.  It seems a very big figure but when you relate it to the advantages that will accrue as a result of people being usefully employed it is a very reasonable figure indeed.  I have already commended the tripartite committee. I wish them every success indeed. They are doing a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>All of us should be determined to work more efficiently.  Unfortunately at present many people who have the name of working for, say, eight hours in actual fact work for four and dodge along for the rest of the time just filling in the time in the hope that the job will be prolonged.  That is one of the great diseases in the country at the moment.  This attitude has crept in on us; yes, we would like to get jobs but at the back of our minds we have a reservation; yes, we would like the jobs but no work.  Work is a thing to be very proud of, it is something we should all love to do.  If we could get that message across to the people, then the battle for full employment within our State would be won.</P>

      <P>I am sure we all <Col N="1512" /> welcome the creation of this fund and hope that it will improve the employment situation.  I would just like to draw a little attention to the possible direction of the schemes that may be brought forward by the tripartite committee for this fund and to say how necessary it is that such schemes should be directed towards areas where there already are, in fact, as the Minister pointed out, labour shortages and unfilled jobs, directions where there are hopes of creating real and permanent productive employment. However desirable it may be to provide schemes for things like environmental improvement, these are, as it were, jobs which can tide-over temporarily periods of unemployment but will not provide productive and real industrial employment or other kinds of permanent employment for the future.  In a way, what is called today environmental improvement schemes are today's answer to the famine walls and congested district piers of the past.  They provide needed employment, they provide something for unemployed people to do.  They are desirable in themselves but they are not a permanent solution.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to see on the list in the Minister's speech that one of the schemes is to be an AnCO scheme for the recruitment of 200 additional engineering apprentices.  As has been seen in a recent article in one of our national newspapers, this is one of the areas in which there are still, in fact, labour shortages both at technician level and at the higher technological levels of university graduates.  Anyone who is involved in our educational system will know that there are certain areas where people can look for jobs with success even though there are so many school leavers coming on the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that in the early sixties there was a major survey of our educational system carried out under the auspices of UNESCO of which the chairman was Professor Patrick Lynch. Even then it was pointed out that far too much of our educational system was geared towards producing arts graduates and people who wanted to go into banking, <Col N="1513" /> law, medicine and so on and far too little towards the technological sector. Yet in 1980 while the position has improved somewhat, the same tendency is still there.  There are far to many people trying to enter law schools and medical schools, to go into banking and commercial jobs, which are looked on as sort of white collar jobs as opposed to jobs in industry where in many ways our school leavers and graduates could be of much more use to the economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to press on the Minister's attention that this fund and the schemes thereunder should be, as far as possible, directed into industries and into areas of employment where there is hope of genuine expanison and permanent employment in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The article to which Senator McGuinness has just referred published yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i> revealed an equation which simply does not add up when one is considering the position of young people looking for jobs in our economy.  While all the career planners are urging young people to go into industry and at a time when one-third of the work force is engaged in industry, a survey conducted by AnCO reveals that less than 3 per cent of those leaving school see their future in industry. This survey was carried out not only in the west of Ireland but in Dublin. This is at a time when the head of the IDA forecasts that there will be between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs available in electronics within the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a problem which should merit urgent action by the Minister.  It can be tackled on two fronts.  First of all, we have got to get it across to young people long before they leave school that there is a future for them in industry, in electronics and in all the other associated trades.  They should be preparing themselves for a future in industry.  To do that, we have got to look at the subject of career guidance as it appears on the curricula of our schools.  In half of the second-level schools there is no career guidance teacher and in those that have <Col N="1514" /> career guidance as a subject it all too frequently consists of a local industrialist coming in to give the leaving certificate pupils a pep talk.  I do not think that it is realised that career guidance should start very much earlier than that.  Children are capable of being assessed at primary school level.  This should be done; they should be streamed and turned in the direction in which we want them to go.</P>
    <P>The other front on which we should be working is to convince parents that their children will get an equal, of not better, education in our vocational schools.  The tradition in rural Ireland is that after primary school the girls go to the convent and the boys to the brothers.  When one suggests that there is an extremely good vocational school which has lots of places, where they will not be sitting one on top of the other in tin huts, the parents react as if one were suggesting condemning their children to a term in Loughan House.  This is an attitude which is responsible for putting more square pegs in round holes in this country than anything else I know of.  It is something we should take very seriously and tackle.</P>
    <P>We cannot underestimate the influence of parents in the choice of their children's career.  One hears all too frequently nowadays some very sad stories. I happen to know of a very clever young girl who is now in her second year in law in university.  She will probably qualify and she may be a good lawyer but the only thing about it is that she does not want to be a lawyer.  She wants to be a model or work in a shop and sell clothes. Because she is very intelligent she was encouraged by the career guidance teacher to go for law as she has a very good leaving certificate.  She is extremely unhappy and frustrated.  The attitude of parents over the years has been to encourage young people to go for an academic career.  We are turning out more and more doctors from our universities and the frustration of these graduates when they find after all the investment of time and money that they will not be able to get a job in their own country is quite appalling.  It is high time <Col N="1515" /> that we had a good look at where we are going.</P>
    <P>That is the only point I wish to make in this debate except to say that I welcome the Bill.  I regard it as a reaffirmation of the Government's commitment. Since this Bill is an integral part of the tripartite committee it is a restatement of our national commitment to the protection and creation of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcomed the national understanding.  It was a new approach where three sections of our community, the trade unions, the employers and the Government got together to negotiate something for the benefit of the community as a whole.  The national understanding covered a far wider field than normal trade union negotiations.  It covered increments, social policies and, among other things, it covered production. It also dealt with the creation of jobs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the creation of jobs, the Minister has told us what the Government intend to do and have been doing in this area.  We have the figures of the jobs that have been created over the past two or three years.  Also we have a tangible move on behalf of employers through this fund to show that they are committed to increasing jobs.  At times it has often been felt that employers may have been more concerned with increasing production rather than actually increasing jobs.  This is a commitment to increasing jobs.</P>
      <P>As Senator Whitaker has said, we have to increase production initially to be able to increase jobs.  If we are to increase production, we have to be competitive. I was very disappointed to read in the national press today that in a situation where the Government are aiming to create jobs and the employers are creating a fund to create jobs, a certain trade union is congratulating itself on the gains it has obtained in wages increases for its members over and above the national understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the tripartite committee have delineated the type of jobs which they hope to create: one, the <Col N="1516" /> creation of new jobs which would not be created in the usual course; secondly, the maintenance of existing jobs which would otherwise be discontinued; thirdly, the bringing forward of permanent jobs which would otherwise have not commenced until later.  This is something which may not come into being without this fund.</P>
    <P>Mention must be made of the fact that the employers' temporary subvention has been stopped because of EEC regulations.  To a certain extent it is a disappointing situation because this subvention was to assist industries, particularly the textile industry, that were in difficulty due to the cost of labour.  We find that on certain occasions they have been enjoying the benefit of this subvention and suddenly when it comes to an end there is a threat of closure and a loss of jobs.  In other words, during that period in certain cases there has been no attempt to become more efficient to meet the competition which they have to meet. Some of them have another chance and with the use of this fund they now have a chance to be competitive again.  The Minister in his speech said that firms employing more than 100 persons in this connection will be required to submit a development plan as a condition of qualifying for full benefit under the new scheme.  I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on the Bill at this stage.  The comments were general and comprehensive, and were particularly helpful to me.  This Bill is not all-embracing.  Its aim is to make good a shortfall as far as possible. The decisions of the tripartite committee should be seen in that context.  I sympathise with the view expressed by most Members who spoke here that our priority must be to concentrate on productive employment particularly in the technological areas.  The fact that in the balance of the jobs being provided for under the tripartite committee, there may be provision for jobs that are not productive is not at all to negate the principle that has been stated by Members <Col N="1517" /> here and to which the Government firmly adhere.</P>
      <P>I will just deal with most of the points in principle that have been raised by various Members.  That will enable me in this brief though wide-ranging debate to reply to the points on the Bill and to make some general comments on some very important general principles that were mentioned by speakers this morning. The provisions here are not in substitution for anything that the Government or the Minister for Finance, in particular, has cut back on in public expenditure. To present it in that way would be completely to misunderstand the purpose of this Bill.  Senator Kennedy is right in that one cannot go into specifics here because there is a degree of confidentiality involved in the jobs mentioned this morning.  Most of them had already been approved in principle before the Government provisions for public expenditure for next year were announced. In those provisions I and the Government concentrated particularly on the principle I now take to be endorsed by the Seanad, namely, the establishing of foundations for continuing and long-term investments and employment. In response to Senator Markey I deliberately did not use the expression &ldquo;cuts in living standards&rdquo;.  Expressions can sometimes be misunderstood or presented in a wrong way.  I would have said, &ldquo;reductions in our income expectations&rdquo; which is a very different matter. We are all faced with the realities that have been sketched out by very many Senators this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to absorb certain problems that are forced upon us from outside, and in doing so we have to ensure that our own considerable capacity to adjust will be strengthened.  That means an adjustment of income expectations, if for no other reason but that the actions of the oil-producing countries have transferred at one hefty stroke the purchasing power from the countries dependent on energy to the countries producing it.  I agree with Senator Whitaker's analysis in relation to the effect <Col N="1518" /> which these matters have had on the developing countries.  We must adjust to that and to the fact that the developing countries in particular have to use the opportunities and advantages of lowcost products, because of the low level of earnings.</P>
    <P>To compete within the developed world, we must at least keep to a standard which they are adhering to.  Our income expectations cannot go beyond what is being accepted as the norm within the community.  That was the case last year and I make particular reference to the indexation provisions of the national understanding which were unduly generous.  That is not my opinion but the considered opinion of the Commission of the EEC that was endorsed by the Council of Ministers of the EEC. It is in that sense that we must have a reduction in our income expectations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the textile industry, which was touched on, and in particular the arrangements we have for the substitution of the employment and maintenance scheme, I agree that it is vitally important, in view of the reality of the Third World countries that Senator Whitaker has referred to that we do not engage in what would be for us unwelcome competition with these countries, competition in which we could not and should not succeed at their expense. Some of the elements in our textile industry have not been prudent enough to take the necessary steps in their marketing and production to ensure, in the light of this inevitable pattern which has been clearly visible over the last number of years, that they could adjust to avail of the undoubted opportunities that are there particularly up-market in this area.  While some have failed to do that, it would be overstating it to say that we failed where many of our partners have succeeded.  Very many of the textile industries established here, particularly over the last 15 years, have secured their position both in terms of production and marketing, in the higher bracket of the market particularly where there is still great scope to the extent that they are not at risk at this time.  The vulnerability of our textile industry <Col N="1519" /> generally is less marked than that of many of our partners in the European Economic Community.  It is regrettable to the extent that some did not recognise this reality and now we have to react. Reacting is never a very positive approach in terms of economic planning and development, either nationaly or in terms of industrial sectors.  Now that the reality has been brought home to us, I feel that it is something, in our employment programmes generally, in our approach to readjustments and reallocations of resources in this area, that the Government will bear in mind in ensuring that we can cope with this new reality.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that it is not just in the interests of the developing countries that they be allowed the opportunity of developing their potential.  As Senator Whitaker said, the experience over the last number of years has been that the developed countries have developed their potential and expanded their employment programmes not at the expense of the developing countries, but to some extent, through the contributions of the developing countries.  As we, in a sense, reach a point of saturation in the consumer capacity within the developed world, we have to ensure that in reorganising and rationalising our industrial programming, we give scope to these countries, if only for the selfish reason that they will provide the markets as their economies expand for the products that otherwise cannot, and will not be consumed at a level that we need in our economies at this stage.  That reason is not the most pressing because if one were to approach it only from a selfish point of view in terms of our national or regional interests within the EEC, one would have to accept that reality.  That theory is the one that is called the interdependence of the new economic world order, which is recognised now in the way it was not before.  It is also right and essential that we should recognise their right to development in the same way as we would promote our own.</P>
    <P>The environmental schemes, or other <Col N="1520" /> schemes such as the temporary subvention scheme in substitution for the employment maintenance scheme are of course temporary expedients.  No member of the tripartite committee would suggest that it is any more than that.  It is meant to deal with problems that surfaced as long ago as last September in certain areas.  To that extent one of the great advantages of the tripartite committee was their flexible approach to needs as they arose.  The best example of that was their readiness to introduce this new scheme in substitution for the employment maintenance scheme.  If the committee did not agree to do that, it would have been impossible for the Government to do it because to introduce a scheme similar to that which has been terminated because of the EEC regulations would obviously be at least against the spirit of the EEC regulations in the whole area of competition policy and it would not have lasted any length of time.</P>
    <P>The temporary employment subsidy scheme in Britain will also be terminated from the end of this month.  This subsidy is being provided from the employers' element contribution to that fund, and it is being administered by a joint committee of the employers and the trade unions.  Because they are involved in that sense, the scheme should not in any way run counter to the regulations in the EEC which direct their attention more to Government actions as distinct from those of other sectors.</P>
    <P>In relation to the obligation to move on to more sophisticated production techniques, to train parents and children to think in terms of these priorities and having got them to readjust their thinking, to provide the training programmes for them to exploit these new opportunities, the Government and I as Minister for Finance with responsibility for economic planning, are very conscious of this.  This morning I attended a meeting of a Cabinet sub-committee which is concentrating on the area of training technicians and technological graduates and of ensuring that in our allocation of resources to various <Col N="1521" /> Departments we concentrate on these areas.</P>
    <P>There is a great need at second and third levels to reallocate resources and to redirect the attitudes of parents, in the first instance, and teachers and all concerned. This will have to be a continuing programme right through the next decade.  The reality is that there is the risk that even those we train in these areas&mdash;we have at least the advantage of an available pool of potential skills in our young people&mdash;may be tempted away from here to other countries who have a different demographic structure from what we have at the moment.  We have to ensure having regard to the trends, for instance in Germany, France and the Netherlands where the problems of the next decade or two will be the problems of having an adequate pool of skills and labour to maintain their industries, that we will not suffer because some of our people trained here would have better opportunities abroad.  I assure the House that in terms of the allocation of resources and the priorities within those allocations, and also in the programme for training and education generally, we will ensure that we are specifically geared to cope with the new era of technology in industry and in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the next year in terms of employment both in the OECD and the EEC is not encouraging.  These are realities we have to face.  As Senator Cranitch said, the fact is that the trend here has if anything been against that trend elsewhere.  When unemployment generally has been increasing among our partners it has been decreasing here. That was not always the way.  That at least gives us the essential confidence in our capacity and determination to succeed. There may be a tendency to over-emphasise employment, which is of course a very important element.  There is the objective of increased productivity. All of us have to be very conscious of that.  I, in framing my budget, was very conscious of that in terms of the inducements in the new income tax schemes <Col N="1522" /> announced to ensure that people would see that it is vitally important they give of their maximum and not feel penalised as they earn more as a result of the increased productivity which they will promote through constant attendance at work and constant commitment when they are at work.  This increased productivity does not just depend on the worker.  It depends on the readiness of industry to adjust to new production techniques, to invest as a mark of confidence in themselves, as a mark of trust in their work force, and a mark of confidence in new technology and to continue through their training programme at management level to ensure that there will always be this progressive and continuing forward approach to increase productivity and job satisfaction and guarantee our place.</P>
    <P>About 50 per cent of our total production depends on exports and that is certainly higher than any of our partners. Other countries such as Germany or the Netherlands may have a greater internal capacity to consume home manufactured products but if we were depending on home consumption we would very soon go into a decline.  For that reason, it is not just enough for us to respond in the way that our partners respond in terms of productivity, commitment, determination and investment in new technology, we have to move ahead to exploit the possibilities and to ensure that we can nearly guarantee continuing secure employment.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Kennedy, who has been a member of the committee longer than I, would agree that it has been a very encouraging and reassuring experience for all who have been concerned in it.  In relation to the Ross Company, as a matter of course the committee will keep in very close contact and will ensure that the proposals I have just referred to will be implemented as envisaged by the committee.  I cannot say that agreement in principle has been reached with the Waterford Harbour Commissioners.  Now the Ross Shipyards have got a breathing space, and this is just one example of the kind of thing the committee have been doing <Col N="1523" /> very successfully through the agency of this fund.  It is important as Senator Kennedy said, that Government agencies of every kind be encouraged although there are EEC regulations that must be taken into account.  This is something that the Government are very conscious of in relation to that shipyard and in relation to others also.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy was not here when I mentioned in passing the United Kingdom scheme for a temporary employment subsidy, which is also being terminated this month.  I certainly will watch closely for any obvious or not so obvious breaches of regulations by any other country, particularly from any of our main competitors.  We are the last country who can afford to restrict our capacity and watch others, by breaking the rules or by paying no attention to them, exploiting the situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to matters like environmental schemes and so on, the committee would be the last to suggest that these are other than productive in the sense that I mentioned.  Senator McGuinness touched on these matters.  Nonetheless, when one looks at the broad package that will eventually emerge from the committee, it represents a balance which provides for employment, not just for the short term, but also in the long term in many cases and also represents very real balance in favour of what we could loosely call productive employment.</P>
    <P>This is initially a Bill for a particular purpose.  The House understandably took the occasion to make some observations which I found very useful, and all generally in line with Government policy in this area.  When the problems are obvious the solutions are equally obvious.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey asked a question, which I can deal with on Committee Stage which I hope the House can take now.  It is important that we get this Bill through in view of the need to replace the employment maintenance scheme.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Minister said when replying to the debate, in dealing with this question of the substitute scheme for the employment incentive scheme, that this supplementary premium that was paid in some industries was found to be contrary to Community rules, that some other scheme to meet what that scheme was doing, but at the same time not in such open breach to Community rules, would be introduced using this fund.  I understood from the Minister that the mechanism for avoiding conflict with the community is to take these payments from the employers' contributions.  How realistic is that hope when the section sets out that the fund will be under the control and management of the Minister?  It will be quite clear that the money paid in these schemes will be money paid by the Government and consequently the difficulties with the Community will continue.  Will the Minister seriously argue that he will keep the funds segregated into two separate parts, a post office account for the employers' contribution and a post office account for the Government contribution? Will the Minister comment on those points, please?</P>

The fund will, of course, be under the control of the Minister.  I specifically said that this part of this provision, for this purpose, <Col N="1525" /> would be administered by a joint committee.  That was the decision of the tripartite committee.  They will administer it from that portion of the contribution which comes from the employers.  There is only one fund.  I would ask the Senator to read very closely what I said in opening the debate, to take account of what I am saying now and not ask me to state anything more emphatically than that publicly because it will not be in our total interest to make any further public statements in relation to it.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1527" /> SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his speech gave five examples of the sort of project which will benefit under this type of guaranteed employment fund.  I agree with the wording of section 3 as regards the general application and motivation behind such a fund.  Two of the five examples the Minister gave are construction of an airport at Waterford and the provisions of a dredger and pilot launch for Waterford harbour to be built by Ross Co. Ltd., New Ross.  I am quite sure that each of these two projects is very commendable, but I am also quite certain that there are probably a few dozen other projects of similar consideration around the country.</P>
      <P>Have the tripartite committee given any thought to drawing up criteria, in deciding what sort of projects should get funds, if there should be a labour or a capital intensive element in them?  If a capital intensive element is given greater consideration rather than a labour intensive one, we would not be too long in exhausting a guarantee fund of £20 million. The construction of an airport appears to be something which should not come under the heading of a fund such as this. We are talking about a guarantee employment fund.  The construction of an airport appears to me to be a completely new project which, perhaps, should be financed under some other heading rather than under a fund such as we are here drawing up.  I would like the Minister's comments on those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I went into detail on each case I would not be able effectively to re-assure the Senator.  Can I just tell him, generally, that the breakdown would be between, in the first instance, 1,000 jobs in the public sector covering a range of activities?  The cost of those is somewhere of the order of less than £5 million.  Schemes to pay temporary supplementary premiums under the employment incentive scheme would <Col N="1528" /> be of the order of £2 million.  Others, such as the one the Senator has touched on, are by way of contributions to programmes that are being undertaken. The contribution in the case he has referred to is of the order of £705,000.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that in terms of regional development and the potential of that area the desirability of having an airstrip there has been for a very long time represented by the industrial and business interests of the area as being very important.  It provides in the course of construction considerable employment in addition to the contribution it will make towards generating further employment and enhancing the attractiveness of the region for investment. It was the committee and not the Minister who came to that conclusion.</P>
      <P>There will be a balance between the moneys available from the fund and the moneys made available by capital investment from other interests involved.  I should say in this context that there are proposals made by the employers, the Federated Union of Employers, which, in fact, in one instance also is quite in line with the particular proposal that the Senator has mentioned in respect of Waterford, but they make proposals in respect of certain industries and in respect of certain regions.  On balance, the Senator can be assured that his concern has been adequately taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  I would also accept that the tripartite committee in their good judgment decide what schemes the fund should be devoted to.  My observation on the matter is that the question of an enterprise like an airport should be financed out of some other source than what is titled &ldquo;an employment guarantee fund&rdquo;.  An employment guarantee fund is really motivated to help industries in certain emergency situations, to undertake new projects&mdash;a new airport could not in any sense be considered a new project but projects which would be new to the Irish economic sphere&mdash;and get these off the ground.  I would have thought that <Col N="1529" /> the guarantee fund would be for such projects.  I still maintain that surely the financing of an airport should be provided out of some other source rather than this guarantee fund.</P>

      <P>I had better make it quite clear that if one is to argue as it appears now to be argued by the Senators, that because temporary jobs have been made available the outlook is very poor or that it would be much better to have guaranteed permanent jobs, I do not think there is much merit in that approach. The purpose of the understanding was in a particular year to meet a shortfall if that shortfall occurred. That shortfall is being met.  That is the whole purpose of the understanding and the committee's deliberations on that.  One should not condemn it because it meets its own terms of reference and does not meet terms of reference that Senators are now suggesting it should have.</P>

On the schemes or projects that will be implemented from the fund the Minister in his speech set out the criteria for the allocation of moneys from the fund.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Obviously the first priority would be new jobs that would generate other jobs.  That is No. 1 criterion.  Again when one is dealing with a limited fund like this one tries to limit the amount of the cost per job.  That is <Col N="1534" /> the second criterion.  No. 3 relates to jobs that will enhance the investment climate of the area.  These are among the criteria the committee consider and on the result of these they determine which ones will get money from the fund.</P>

      <P>I would not ask for that information as that information would be confidential, but I am interested to know why the Minister says that this could apply to jobs in the commercial area.  I would like him to deal with the position of a commercial undertaking which normally would go to Fóir Teoranta as a last resort.  Of course, Fóir Teoranta's terms of reference permit them to lend only for projects which can be made viable.

We may have to introduce them to Fóir Teoranta or some other State agency.  Fóir Teoranta apply commercial criteria perhaps not as strict in the first instance.  In a situation where some other public representative might come in contact with the commercial undertaking in difficulty unable to get assistance from Fóir Teoranta, I would be anxious to know would it be worth my while sending them to this fund for assistance?

      <P>Can we take it that this fund will be financed on a fifty-fifty basis between employers and the Government out of Exchequer funds?  If so I must then move on to section 5 just to make my point.  I have done some sums here and it would appear that the contribution of 0.35 per cent derives from calculating a shortfall of 5,000 jobs and the criteria laid down by the tripartite committee of a contribution of £4,000 per job will bring us to a total of £20 million.  It is obviously estimated that that would warrant a rate of 0.35 per cent to give 50 per cent of that from the employers' side.</P>
      <P>The Minister in an earlier comment stated that he would expect this fund in 1980 to cover about 3,500 jobs.  That, working on the same criteria, would arrive at a total of £14 million.  The 0.35 per cent, based on reckonable earnings in 1980, could possibly bring in a larger contribution than in 1979 on a 1979 reckonable earnings basis.  To me the rate could be too high on the basis of only 3,500 jobs benefiting out of the fund this year.  The rate on the employers of 0.35 per cent could, therefore, be too high or could mean that there would be a balance left in the fund at the end of the year going on that rate of 0.35 per cent. This brings me on to section 7 and the point I made earlier in my Second Stage remarks about the winding up of the fund, that where the balance of the funds goes is left to the discretion of the Minister.  I would like this to be tightened up because I believe that if there are any moneys left in this fund they should be spent within the terms of the criteria of the fund.  I have made some points there as regards whether the rate of 0.35 per cent is too high on the basis of the Minister's 3,500 jobs and it will still mean that the funds are going to be financed fifty-fifty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention. First of all, the Senator will be aware that the original calculation was a rate of .4 per cent.  It was precisely to ensure that the employers' contribution would not exceed £10 million, that on revision it was determined at 0.35 per cent.  I can only tell the Senator that the indications <Col N="1539" /> are that, if anything, 0.35 per cent contribution from the employers will be less than £10 million.  This is something which the employer organisations accept. The likelihood of an increase or an excess over £10 million from that contribution is not very real.</P>
      <P>If there is a small shortfall, which is what is anticipated, from the employers' contribution, this will be made up from the investment from the contributions made by the Government.  The possibility of there being a surplus from the employers' contributions is very unlikely in view of the revision downwards of the provision of the .4 per cent surcharge to .35 per cent.  This is something which the employer organisations have accepted.  I do not think there is likely to be a surplus at the end of this from the employers' contribution point of view.</P>

The social insurance fund, so far as I know, is the fund that covers all types of unemployment benefit.  If it is, it would appear to me to be a somewhat inappropriate fund in which to put the surcharge from the employers.  It also brings into consideration the point I made earlier, that if there is going to be contributions made from this fund towards capital projects rather than purely labour-saving or labour-employment projects, it would appear to me that the use of a social insurance fund to hold such moneys would be completely inappropriate.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>To delete subsection (3).</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Molony.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I had outlined most of the arguments to support my amendments to delete subsections (3), (4) and (5) of section 13.  To sum up the position, we ask that the necessity for the certificate be removed altogether because it does not, as I outlined yesterday, enhance the consumer's position, and that is what we are on about in this Bill. Secondly, it puts the motor dealer in a most difficult and unjust position in regard to the discharging of what could be an almost impossible onus of proof and also in discharging an onus of proof in which he deals with a person whom he has never had a commercial transaction before.  Thirdly, I mentioned the danger that we are encouraging unscrupulous dealers, in order to avoid the difficulty over the onus of proof where they fail to provide any certificate, to provide false certificates.  By any standards that is something to be avoided.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in another amendment to this section, proposes on the face of it to remove the criminal liability aspect of the section.  In fact, he does not do that at all because, as long as the obligation to provide a certificate remains, a criminal liability can arise under the Consumer Information Act.  Therefore, it is not fair to say that he is removing the criminal liability.  I do not think the case has been made by the Minister to single out the motor trade for this treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give full support to Senator Molony on this amendment.  The present situation in regard to the law governing the driving of cars on our roads is a disgrace.  There ought to be a proper system of ensuring that only roadworthy cars are driven on the roads.  Something like what I understand prevails in the other countries of Europe, and in particular in the United <Col N="1542" /> Kingdom, the compulsory testing of cars after three years, should be introduced here immediately.  I would be prepared to argue very strongly in this House with anybody that this is a cost we cannot afford to avoid.  I know it is not the Minister's duty to deal with this matter. But it is a total pretence to bring in a system of certification.  It is worse than a pretence because it is going to provide in some kind of way an excuse from doing what is so badly needed to be done.  Here we would have a certificate, now without criminal consequences other than those suggested yesterday, to be issued; but when is such certificate to be issued? When a car is sold through the motor trade&mdash;on that occasion and on that occasion alone&mdash;irrespective of the age and condition of the car, once that certificate, a certificate without criminal sanction, is issued, the car may be used for ever and a day on the Irish roads. Under a proper system cars of a particular vintage require to be checked annually by competent people to ensure that they are roadworthy and safe for all those concerned&mdash;drivers, their passengers and other users of the road.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that if we leave any element of certification in this Bill it will do damage.  If it allays the public mind to any degree with regard to the situation, if it lets anybody in a Department off the hook or if it lets the Government of the day off the hook, it makes the public think that they can afford not to provide money, if money is involved to set up a proper system of ensuring that cars are roadworthy.  I have here a report which was set forth in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7 December under the heading, 99.6 p.c. of cars have some defect.  This was the report of a random safety check carried by the Dublin Road Safety Council.  The announcement was made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  I quote from the newspaper concerned:</P>
      <P>Fuel wastage causing excessive pollution, poor brakes and faulty headlamps are too prevalent in cars on Irish roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> An alarming 99.6 per cent of drivers are behind the wheels of cars suffering from at least one defect...</P>
    <P>...the pollution being poured out by cars in Dublin has helped make it one of the dirtiest cities in Europe. But, apart from the pollution, cars using too much fuel are also an economic hazard and more liable to breakdown or momentary failure...</P>
    <P>...43 per cent were using too much fuel because of incorrect tuning.</P>
    <P>We checked on exhaust emission this year for the first time because of the high pollution level and the high price of petrol...</P>
    <P>Of the cars examined 62 per cent had misaligned headlamps while a further 11 per cent of headlamps were defective.</P>
    <P>The council found that poor brakes continued to be a problem.  I would have thought, if anything, that these figures are likely to be biased in understating the defects.  If there is any voluntary element in the making available of cars for checking on a random check of this kind, and there must be, the people who are aware of defects of one kind or another are unlikely to want their cars to be checked for fear of the consequences. Therefore, the situation may be worse than this presentation suggests.  The Minister may say that he agrees, but I will say to the Minister that the section as proposed in this Bill would have had a distorting effect tradewise and damaging consequences to decent traders while not doing anything except provide an excuse for not doing anything about this problem.</P>
    <P>It is right that the criminal element should have been taken out of this but there is no sense at all in leaving in a certification system.  If someone has a car which has been sold to him with a condition that it is free from a defect which would render it dangerous to the public but if it is found to be defective, the buyer brings an action alleging that the condition is breached and in the ordinary way he proves that case.  It is his business to prove that the car suffers <Col N="1544" /> from the defect.  If we ended this section with section (2), itself revised, that would be the situation: that, I understand is the situation of anyone who will have a civil claim on any of the implied warranties which are set out in section 10.</P>
    <P>If the seller under the proposed ministerial amendment gives a certificate, by giving the certificate he will maintain that ordinary position.  But if a man buys a car without a certificate he is in a more favourable position.  Forgive me, I think I have put that wrong.  If the buyer gets a certificate the presumption is that the car is free from defect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, do I take it from the Senator that the percentage of vehicles he outlined includes new vehicles?  He mentioned that about 96 per cent of the cars on our roads are defective in some way.  Did he include new cars in that percentage?</P>

To answer the question, the Dublin Road Safety Council simply carried out a free car check and there is no indication as to whether it included new or old cars.</P>
      <P>If the certificate is not given there is a presumption that the defect exists at the time of delivery.  Therefore, if the buyer has a certificate he will receive the benefit of the presumption that a defect did not exist and he is back in the position of an ordinary plaintiff in an action for breach of the implied conditions.  It is not in his interest to keep that certificate. It is a burden on his title.  It subtracts from the value of the car.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is very much in the interest of the seller, if he is faced with any action, to have issued a certificate.</P>

      <P>This will have the unfortunate consequence of tempting people who ought not to, to issue certificates and it will tempt people who ought not to, to lose certificates.  It will place a burden on the seller to maintain systems of proof of the existence of certificates, without this Bill having any element whatever in ensuring that they represent some solid type of examination worked on by or on behalf of the seller. What is the position of a seller if, for example, he loses all record of a certificate which he issued?  The employee who issued it may have left that employment. The seller would be faced with a claim way down along a line, a chain of buyers, and at all stages in that route it is going to be in the interest of the owners of the car, after the original seller, not to have that certificate.  If we are breaching that privacy of contract it is dangerous to let the matter of proof become affected by the introduction of an artificial rule of this kind.  Changing the ordinary way in which these matters which are in themselves meant to be difficult to prove or check will be affected.  What would be the action here would be that the defect exists at the time of delivery and the car owner will have the difficult business of proving that the defect did not exist at the time of delivery.  I fully support Senator Molony's first amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald said this is a comparatively useless provision&mdash;and totally useless depending on how far he pushed it&mdash;because cars will not be maintained properly and there is no system of ensuring that they are tested regularly by the Department of the Environment or some other Department.  I agree that it is very necessary and desirable that there should be a system of ensuring that cars on the road are kept in good condition and are tested from time to time.  However, I cannot see that merely because that is not done at present we should not have a provision of this kind in this Bill.  In other words, two wrongs do not make a right. Just because one thing is not done <Col N="1546" /> properly is no excuse for not doing something else properly.</P>
      <P>The ideal situation would be that cars would be sold free from any defects and, in particular, free from any defect that would endanger people's lives.  In this Bill we should do our utmost to ensure that cars are sold free from any such defect.  At least we will be making a good start on ensuring that cars will be free from these defects.  If the other provision comes into operation in due course, then we will have gone as far as it is possible to go from a statutory point of view in ensuring that cars are free from defect.</P>
      <P>Merely because Senator FitzGerald is dissatisfied with the provision of maintaining cars I cannot see that that is a good reason for not having the provisions that are in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment put down by the Minister seems to be to ensure that the certificate will be given and if the seller does not give it, he is in a much weaker position.  The purchaser has only to prove that the defect exists. He does not have to prove it existed at the time he bought the car.  It certainly puts him in a much stronger position. The result of this will be that the seller of a car will give the certificate in question and will ensure that he has a copy of it signed by the purchaser.  He will have some system of ensuring that, if the occasion arises, he will be able to prove he did give the certificate.  His obligation then is somewhat less than if he is unable to prove he gave a certificate which places him in a very weak position.  The purpose of the amendment is not to put the seller in that kind of situation but to ensure that he will give the certificate so that he will not be put in that situation.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on some of the remarks made by Senator Ryan.  I accept that two wrongs do not make a right.  I wonder whether he chose his analogy carefully because, in effect, that is what we are doing.  That we do not have a system operated by the Department of the Environment is a wrong in itself.  The fact that we are trying to right a wrong by creating another <Col N="1547" /> wrong is just the point.  I would take what he says in that way.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  This is not the way to deal with the problem of roadworthiness of our cars for several reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but first of all it is a very unreliable way to make a start. Secondly, it is unjust.  This is the major thrust of our response.  Thirdly, it leave the way open for unscrupulous motor dealers and car owners who want to abuse the system.  For those reasons, the Minister's amendment is not at all acceptable.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the manner in which a motor dealer might prove that a certificate was given, but he did not go into it in any great detail.  I wonder how that is to be done.  It is likely that in many of these cases the person who brings the legal proceedings will not be the person who received a certificate in the first instance at all.  What is the position where a secondhand car owner or the person twice removed from the motor dealer alleges that he has a car and no certificate was given?  The presumption even for that is in his favour.  What is the motor dealer to do?  Go back to his books and find whether a certificate was issued or not?  What is he to do? Produce a copy of a certificate signed by somebody else?  Surely no court could accept that as a proof of anything unless the person who had signed it was in court to give evidence.  He has nothing to do with the arrangement at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motor dealer is left in an impossible position unless some other provision is to be made with regard to these proofs.  How he is to prove the certificate was supplied?  Quite apart from having to prove the non-existence of a defect he must prove that he gave a certificate to somebody who is not suing him at all. Perhaps he will not have an idea of the whereabouts of that person.  If he has no idea of the whereabouts of that person under the legislation as drafted at present, <Col N="1548" /> nothing comes to his aid.  There is a simple presumption against him and that is it.  Frankly I cannot see that that is just in any sense.</P>
    <P>I accept that the purpose of the Minister's amendment is to ensure that the certificate will be provided.  The point Senator FitzGerald was making is that it will be to a buyer's advantage to say that no certificate existed.  The seller will want to show that a certificate, even a false certificate, was issued.  A false certificate would be the best thing for a motor dealer to give if he is to acquit himself well under this difficult section.  The buyer is far better off in saying there was never a certificate in existence.  Then he does not have to prove that the defect in the car existed at the time.  The presumption is in his favour.  He goes into court and he does not even have to say there was never a certificate.  He simply alleges, in his pleadings presumably, that there was not a certificate.  The onus of proof is put on the other party.  It is ludicrous and unfair.  It is no way to try to deal with a very serious problem and I think it is a sham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point Senator FitzGerald is making.  He is assuming that the certificate would say that the car is in good working order.  That may not be the case.  I should like the Minister to comment on what I am saying.  The Bill says that the Minister may make an order that a certificate has to be given and shall be given by the dealer if the Minister makes the order.  It does not say what that certificate might be?  That certificate could be the proof that the car was examined and inspected before sale, which would be an advantage to the person buying the car.  In other words, the dealer gets in a secondhand car without even looking at it and sells it to somebody else.  The Bill, as it stands at the moment, does not tell us what that certificate will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered thoroughly all the arguments which have been made on this matter, both by Members of this House and by representatives outside the House of the various <Col N="1549" /> interests in the trade.  I have given much thought to the effect which the removal of the offence element will have both on the motor trade and on the motorist in whose interest the section was drafted in the first place.  From the point of view of the motor trade, the important change which I propose here is that failure to issue a certificate will not now be a criminal offence.  This was the fundamental argument made in the Dáil and in the Seanad and in all the representations which I received from the representatives of the motor industry.  They were particularly concerned about this element of the creation of an offence with regard to the certificate and, following the arguments that were put forward, I have tabled the amendment that is before the Seanad today.</P>
      <P>Instead of the criminal offence, if the certificate is not proved to have been given in an action brought under subsection (2), I now propose that it will be the responsibility of the motor dealer to prove that the dangerous defect involved did not, in fact, exist at the time of delivery.  From the motorist's point of view, the retention of the certificate requirement is important in that it would focus specifically on those aspects of a motor vehicle which could, if defective, prove dangerous.  The requirement to issue a certificate was a specific recommendation of the NCAC who, I should emphasise, saw it more as a consumer protection measure than a road safety one.  The amendment which I propose increases this protection.</P>
      <P>The certificate is not designed as a road safety measure or as a substitute for an MOT test on the lines of the UK system.  The certificate is a consumer protection measure as it requires the dealer as a party to the contract of sale to give the certificate.  A certificate granted by an independent third party would afford no protection to the motorist in pursuance of a breach of contract claim. I agree it is desirable that an MOT test should be introduced in the near future.  I accept the point made by the Senators.  I hope Senators also accept the point that this is not directly my responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> There is a fundamental misunderstanding about this contract situation and I will try to clear it up.  There is no contract between the seller and a second buyer.  The only third-party involved is one who is using the car&mdash;say a son, who is using the car with the father's permission. This is using it with the owner's consent.  A garage man sells a car to Mr. X.  Mr. X sells to Mr. Y.  The certificate is not carried on to Mr. Y. A new certificate has to be issued when X sells the car to Y through a garage.  It is important to clarify that element because it is coming up again and again in the arguments made by Senators.  It is not intended that this certificate will be an ongoing situation.  It is part of a contract between a buyer and a seller and will not go on to the third person who, in turn, buys from the first buyer.  This is important. The only third person involved is one who is using the car with the owner's consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask about the effectiveness of the Minister's amendment. I presume we are taking all the amendments together.  Under subsection (2) where the condition is implied, is it possible for a motor dealer to get somebody to sign an acknowledgement that he is contracting out of his rights? Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (2) provide the exceptions to the application of the implied condition.  The first exception that is agreed between the seller and the buyer is that the vehicle is not intended for use in the condition in which it is to be delivered to the buyer under the contract.  There is no provision that it is not to be used.  The provision is that it is agreed between the purchaser and the seller that it is not to be used.  A very simple device for avoiding any implied condition would be for a motor dealer to require somebody to sign an acknowledgement.  If I were advising a motor dealer, that is the way I would have to advise him, given the difficulty he would have in proving the passing on of the certificate.  He would be far better off if he had a note saying it was agreed between them that the vehicle was not intended for use in the condition it was delivered to the buyer.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is possible to avoid the implied condition altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>A secondhand car may be sold and some defect may arise a year later.  Where there is an agreement signed by somebody that it was not intended for use in the condition it was in, what is fair and reasonable about that?  Somebody may say: &ldquo;There is something wrong with the engine of the car.  I have a friend who is a mechanic and he will fix it for me.&rdquo;  If a motor dealer gives that as a reason, it is perfectly fair and reasonable. It will save an awful lot of problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some provision has to be made and consequently it seems to me that this is very well dealt with.  In that situation a statement that the buyer does not intend to use it is made and signed by both parties.  If there is any doubt about that later, or if a conflict arises or proceedings arise, then it is for the court to decide whether in all the circumstances it was fair and reasonable to make this provision.  You have to provide for that kind of situation and this seems to be a very good way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept, of course, given the section as we have it, that we have to provide for that type of situation. I am merely drawing attention to the problem being created by the section.  I accept what Senator Ryan said.  It will arise regularly.  It is perfectly fair and reasonable for somebody to buy a car from a motor dealer and say: &ldquo;I have a friend who is a mechanic and he will fix it for me.&rdquo;  The court would have to toss a coin to decide what to do.  The problem is created more or less because of the general approach being taken to section 13.</P>
      <P>I might also make the point which we made on Second Stage, but which we have not mentioned, in relation to section 13.  There is a very simple way of avoiding this.  It happens already in the motor trade, and it will happen more and more and particularly in relation to secondhand cars, that motor dealers advertise in the newspapers under private numbers.  In future they will avoid coming within the section because they will not appear to be motor dealers.  There is nothing at all in the section that tries to deal with that.  It is a problem which prevails at the moment.  An unscrupulous motor dealer, to avoid breaches of this section, will merely have to place an advertisement in the <i>Evening Herald:</i>&ldquo;Such and such a car for sale, Dial such and such a number.&rdquo;  The purchaser does not know he is a motor dealer and the section is avoided.  The most unroadworthy car can hit the road.</P>

The costs of motoring are already bad enough in this country as is the cost of insurance.  These will be affected by the burden that is being imposed on motor dealers.  In fact, there are two ways of looking at the interests of the consumer and I can assure the Minister that he is not the sole standard bearer in this particular respect.  I would come back to the point that I have put to the Minister in relation to the people who sell cars privately when in fact they are motor dealers.

It fuels my fears, worries and suspicions about the section, because this is the only place in the Act where the word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is used as opposed to &ldquo;order&rdquo;.  The Bill is full of delegated legislation but in this one particular respect &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is used in respect of the delegated legislation instead of &ldquo;order&rdquo;.  The very subtle distinction is that orders must come before this House while regulations do not.  That is something I was informed by the Minister for the Gaeltacht who attended here last week.  I was surprised at that.  I must say that the most controversial <Col N="1559" /> sections in the Bill have regulations that can be made by the Minister without reference to the Houses and in almost every other section of the Bill there is provision for orders.</P>

      <P>The idea of the regulation is that this is something that will be discussed with the motor trade in redrafting the form of the certificate and so on.  It is not something for the Houses of the Oireachtas as such.  It is something for the Department to draft working together with the Department of the Environment.  This brings me to the point raised by Senator Jago regarding the form of the certificate.  This is something that will have to be discussed with the motor trade itself with all of these.</P>

      <P>I think the idea behind subsection (2) is excellent but I would prefer if there were some way possible to break the subsection into two subsections so that we might have a consequential amendment elsewhere.  I <Col N="1561" /> think it would make for clarification of the section if subsection (2) ended with the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; on line 22, page 9. Then the next part might read &ldquo;subsection (2) shall not apply&rdquo;.  Having made that drafting suggestion I would suggest that subsection (2) should only be excluded from application where the complete sale of the vehicle is by agreement in writing so that there is no argument afterwards about the deal.  A point against the seller and very much in aid of the consumer is that there is a piece of paper in existence that takes the seller out of the implied condition in subsection (2).  Then there may be other matters agreed between them as to what has to be done.  That is part of an overall bargain that lies outside of the transaction. It should only apply where the whole agreement between them is a written agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>In my intervention on Second Stage, I explained why I was concerned about the unqualified, open-ended liability which this section attaches to one particular kind of financial transaction.  The Minister touched briefly on this in his reply on Second Stage but he did not push his conclusion beyond saying that it is fair that the finance house should bear a certain amount of liability.  That is precisely the point.  I would accept that it would be socially justifiable that a certain amount of financial <Col N="1562" /> liability should attach to finance houses in this particular kind of case but not a liability shared with the seller which is unlimited in time and amount.</P>
      <P>For clarification, perhaps I may briefly recall what I said on Second Stage.  The issue is really whether a finance house should be liable in particular transactions while the provider of finance is not liable at all in other cases.  I instanced three kinds of transaction.  The first is I pay for a car by drawing down my overdraft.  In that case no liability attaches to the bank in connection with the transaction and nobody is suggesting it should.  The second case is where I borrow from a finance house myself on a hire purchase or credit sale contract and I pay the supplier with the proceeds. Again in that case no liability attaches to the finance house and I have not heard any suggestion that it should.  Now we come to the third case which is the one in point here.  The finance house acquires title temporarily to a car because it pays the supplier direct and then collects the money from me on a hire purchase or credit sale agreement.  It is in that case, and in that case only, that this section makes the finance house jointly and severally liable with the supplier for the quality of the car&mdash;for its road-worthiness.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage I did not follow the logic of this.  I can see that the legal position is different.  I accept that abuses can arise if finance houses are too liberal in financing sales or enabling sellers to push their wares and, therefore, on social grounds there is a case for imposing some liability on them.  I suggested on Second Stage that, on the social front, surely the Central Bank can do something to make sure that finance houses do not extend credit too liberally for any undesirable purpose or, indeed, for any particular purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now again ask the Minister whether there are really adequate social grounds for differentiating as much as this section does between one form of financial transaction and another.  I suggest again that surely the supplier should bear the principal liability and the finance house be liable only in a secondary and limited <Col N="1563" /> way, not perhaps exceeding its original financial part in the transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would argue in support of Senator Whitaker generally that the finance house should at least have a right of indemnification from the supplier.  I do not think it is just that it should be liable for misrepresentations made by the seller or for the seller's breach.  He is the man in the market place and knows all about it and the finance house ought to be able to recover from him while being as liable as the seller to the consumer.  Perhaps Senator Whitaker would not go as far as that with me but that part I am content to have.  Again, I would think that there is a distinction.  There is no good going around as legislators trying to protect people who are able to spend large sums of money on consumer objects of one kind or another.  I think there should be an overall monetary limit to the sort of sums where this section applies.  The UK have a monetary limit which was fixed six years ago at £10,000; maybe we could double that.  If somebody is getting finance for the acquisition of a yacht or something, I do not see why there should be an involvement in this way of the finance house.  A more important point is to get the indemnification, the right to recover from the supplier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything that has been said in relation to indemnification. It is most unjust that a finance house should be left with liability when the supplier who was perhaps responsible for the unhappy differences which arose in the arrangement should be left unscathed, so to speak, by proceedings afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point that Senator Whitaker mentioned, I frankly do not see that the Central Bank are the appropriate party to try to deal with the real problem that has been in existence for some years now.  Many people would not ordinarily purchase a television set, a motor bicycle or whatever if they could not afford it but now finance houses are in a position to have arrangements with the suppliers <Col N="1564" /> of these goods so that they can advertise their wares in their windows at, say, £2 per week or monthly instalments instead of the total cost.  I think finance houses have a very definite responsibility in this field.  The reality is that they are operating in a lucrative financial market. They are encouraging many transactions that would not otherwise take place at all.  For that reason they should be every bit as liable as the seller of the goods to be responsible to some extent if something goes wrong with the goods afterwards.</P>
    <P>Because of the peculiar three-cornered situation we have when the hire purchase companies actually become owners of goods, tremendous legal problems are presented to us sometimes where the buyer, in reality the person who uses the goods, has a problem.  He frequently must sue the hire purchase company.  We need to look at our consumer credit legislation and bring it far closer to reality.  The reality there is that some of these finance houses induce transactions that would not otherwise take place and they have a responsibility.  In fact I would go a little further than the provision goes and question whethere it is proper that it should be limited only to consumer transactions. For example, I know of young people who are in the agricultural contracting business and they have too many machines.  The reason they have too many machines is that they can obtain them through the finance houses. Perhaps they should be more wise and sensible but there are many young people who involve themselves in a new business and they take on too much. Finance houses are all the time too willing to lash out funds to them.  If something goes wrong with second-hand equipment the finance house has no liability; the person has no equipment but he must continue to pay the instalments and he is thrown into a situation where his new business runs into bankruptcy problems.  I am not talking about the person who is purchasing a yacht&mdash;that is just one example.  There are other examples of items necessary for a business that would not come within the definition as set out in the Bill. <Col N="1565" /> On Second Stage I pointed out that the jockey who buys a saddle for his racehorse is covered but if he intends to use it on his hunting horse it is not covered.  The consumer definition is fine, It is a good idea in the Bill generally but there are sections which have to be looked at again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The section imposes on a finance house joint and several liability for breach of contract and for any misrepresentations made by the seller.  The type of transaction covered by this section is not a hire purchase agreement but nevertheless the section is a necessary supplement to Part III of the Bill which deals with hire purchase.</P>
      <P>The buyer in the situation covered by this section is not a hirer and the property and the goods pass immediately to him on purchase.  The problem is, however, that the buyer may be left without recourse.  When the seller has been paid in full directly by the finance house he would rely on the defence that he had not sold the goods directly to the buyer and, therefore, he was not liable to action for breach of implied warranties or conditions.  The finance house, on the other hand, could resort to the argument that they were responsible for the provision of finances only, which would constitute their primary business as distinct from trading in goods.  Therefore, they could argue that they did not sell the goods, the overall result being that the buyer is apparently stripped of any source of redress should the goods later prove defective.  It can be said of this type of transaction that it compares with a hire purchase agreement in that it hides the true function of the finance company. Although they call themselves finance houses, the way that they have chosen to so business means that they become dealers in goods.  Moreover, the finance houses would press the buyer for the repayment of the money paid to the seller, that is, the price of the article bought by the buyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this section is to remove any doubt that may militate <Col N="1566" /> against an effective redress for a buyer where a pre-existing arrangement operates as between a seller and a finance house.  Both parties are hereby deemed to be a party to the sale and both shall be liable to the buyer for any breach of the contract of sale or for any misrepresentation made by the seller. The finance house would in any court action by the buyer be jointly and severally liable.  Even if the buyer took his action only against the finance house, the latter could enjoin the seller in the action. Furthermore, if the finance house only provided part of the purchase price, it could, under a continuing agreement with the seller indemnify itself against any loss over and above its financial input in any particular case, the point made by Senator FitzGerald.  There is nothing in the Bill to restrict the finance house from indemnifying itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that explanation but it does not effectively answer the difficulty that I expressed which was not against the finance house having a liability because of the particular nature of the transaction. As the Minister said this means that legally the finance house becomes a dealer in relation to goods in this particular kind of transaction.  What still worries me is that the liability that the finance house assumes is an unlimited one.  It is joint and several with the actual supplier and if at any time in the future a misrepresentation about the quality of the goods should be proved and the original supplier is not then available to answer or to give redress for that, then the whole liability, not only for the original financial contribution but for any damages arising attaches to the finance house.  What I was questioning was not the social justification for imposing some liability on finance houses in this particular kind of transaction where the purchase might not take place without their intervention&mdash;where they lend themselves to the pushing of wares&mdash;but whether it is altogether fair and reasonable that that liability should be of a completely unlimited character in time and amount. <Col N="1567" /> I am not quite sure I understand the remark the Minister made about indemnification.</P>

      <P>With regard to indemnification, if the finance house only provided part of the purchase price it could under a continuing agreement with the seller indemnify itself against any loss over and above its financial input in any particular case.  The thing to remember is that what we are doing here is protecting the interests of the consumer rather than the interests of the finance house.  It is up to the finance house as such to protect and indemnify itself. What we are doing here is trying to protect the interests of the consumer.</P>

      <P>I know it is not the intention that banks as opposed to finance houses could become liable under the section, but I know some concern has been expressed that, even with the <Col N="1568" /> amendment that was made in the Dáil, an ordinary bank, with regard to a normal commercial transaction over the passage of a cheque, could become liable in certain circumstances.  There is the position that has been described of the client of a bank operating an overdrawn account.  There is there an implied agreement to repay the money.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that there are circumstances in which an ordinary bank may become liable under this section.  I am not absolutely certain that they would become liable, but I can sympathise with a view that has been expressed that they might become liable given the circumstances where a bank customer is operating an overdrawn account and he draws a cheque to pay for a particular item.  There is in those circumstances at least an implied undertaking on the part of the bank customer to repay the amount of the cheque he has drawn.</P>
      <P>Take the situation of someone who has an overdraft and draws, let us say, £1,000 to buy an item.  There is an implied undertaking, if that person is operating on an overdraft, that he or she will repay that £1,000 to the bank.  The bank, effectively, paid the person who supplied the goods, it is fair to say as well.  We have an institution, a bank, who pay the seller and we have at least an implied undertaking, on the part of the drawer of the cheque, that that person will repay, in the example I gave, the £1,000 to the bank.  In those circumstances it seems to me to be possible on a construction of section 14 that the bank could become liable.</P>

      <P>With respect, I think it is conceivable that the bank could become liable.  I am merely trying to be of assistance here.  I know that it is not at all the intention that a bank would become liable.  Where there is an overdrawn <Col N="1569" /> account and a person draws a cheque it is the bank who actually pay the consideration to the seller of goods.  I know that is not the way we ordinarily interpret it.</P>
      <P>On a strict construction of section 14, however, the constituents are that in relation to the sale an agreement is entered into by the buyer with another person who is acting in the course of a business.  The agreement there is that the drawer of the cheque at least implies agreement to repay that money to the bank.  There must be at least an implied agreement in circumstances like that. The section says: &ldquo;...for the repayment to the institution of money paid by the finance house to the seller in respect of the price of the goods, the finance house shall be deemed to be a party to the sale and the finance house and seller shall jointly and separately....&rdquo;  I believe that in circumstances, as I have outlined them, it is possible on a strict interpretation of section 14, that the bank will assume responsibility.</P>

Where there is an overdraft situation, effectively the cash moves from the bank.  If I have no cash and if I draw a cheque on my bank for £1,000 and I have an overdraft, the bank are the people who transfer the £1,000. It is done in an ordinary, regular system of things that has us all believing that I am paying it.  The reality is that the bank <Col N="1570" /> are paying the cash.  I have no cash.  I draw a cheque and cash is transferred through the clearing house system from the bank to the seller.  I know that it is not the intention and I am not suggesting for a minute that somebody is trying to do something in this section that he is not saying.  I believe that on a strict construction of section 14 that interpretation is possible.  A simple amendment could regularise the position.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 8, to delete &ldquo;other than for resale&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The original idea behind the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;other than for resale&rdquo; in the definition of a guarantee was to confine its meaning to guarantees aimed at the ultimate user of the goods.  This, of course, aligns completely with the normal meaning of a guarantee.  However, it has been brought to my notice that the phrase, which I am now proposing to delete, could have the effect of enabling suppliers of guarantees to circumvent their liability under the Bill on the technicality that the guarantee which they supplied was supplied in connection with goods for resale and in consequence was not a guarantee within the meaning of the Bill.  Clearly, such a situation could arise where, for instance, a manufacturer sells goods to a wholesaler or a distributor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now satisfied that it is not really necessary to specify or imply target groups for whom a guarantee is intended. Anyone buying the goods and using them should have a claim under the guarantee if something goes wrong and this would be a normal and reasonable interpretation.  I believe that following this amendment the statutory and ordinary <Col N="1573" /> meaning of guarantee will be effectively harmonised.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 15, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 18:</P>
    <P>In subsection (2), page 10, to delete lines 14 and 15 and substitute &ldquo;person supplying the guarantee&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is merely a drafting amendment and it has two effects. First, it makes it clear that the obligation to state the name and address of the guarantor rests with the guarantor. Under the former wording there could have been possibilities of confusion as to whether a person offering a guarantee would mean the guarantor only or any other person along the distributive line as well.</P>
      <P>The amendment also removes the words &ldquo;and against whom claims should be directed&rdquo;.  I feel it is as well to do this since the intention of this subsection is that the name and address of the guarantor should be given with the guarantee.  The retention of the words involved might mislead someone into thinking that a guarantor could evade his responsibility by directing claims against someone other than himself.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 10, line 26, to delete &ldquo;the seller&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the manufacturer or other supplier&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This, again, is a drafting amendment.  Its effect is to remove any confusion there might be as to the person committing an offence for non-compliance with the section.  It is clear that the person involved is the supplier of the guarantee, in other words, the manufacturer in most cases.  It is possible that the use of the word &ldquo;seller&rdquo; in <Col N="1574" /> the subsection as drafted could be misunderstood to mean someone other than the person who actually supplies the guarantee.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point I could have made on section 15 if I was in the House but it is applicable to several sections.  I do not know what is the position properly construed.  I think all these sections, section 15 to 19, should be reviewed to ensure that there can be an exemption from the obligations of the sections in cases where the goods are being sold to a buyer who is not dealing as consumer and where it is fair and reasonable between the parties that the sections should not apply.  If there is a deal where there is a guarantee element it might be written into a contract of 250 pages in which there are two people engaged in a very large deal.  It might constitute a document, notice or statement.  Maybe the Minister can tell me that the whole thing is already taken care of in the language.  The whole thing should be clear that in any case where a person receiving the guarantee is not dealing as consumer that these sections do not apply.  It is fair and reasonable that they should not where there is a fair and reasonable bargain.</P>
      <P>The second point that requires consideration is what is the position about guarantees given in relation to goods which form part of a service which is dealt with in Part IV of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The best retort to that is to ask the question.  I take it these sections relative to guarantees apply only in transactions with consumers. If they do not, then we are having a fundamental change of the law of guarantee. We should be very clear as to the effect this may have in transactions of a kind that the Minister's Department may never have seen.</P>
      <P>There was an unfortunate word used in the insurance code in 1930 which put the banks in the position that they could not give guarantees.  They were happy enough for a while to rely on the interpretation of the Act but it meant that they could not give guarantees without breaching the insurance code because they had not got a licence under the Insurance Company Act to carry on insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should all be aware that guarantees arise as only part of large transactions where one of the elements may be the supply of goods by one party to the other.  Maybe his subscription for the shares in the company could be goods that are guaranteed to reach a particular standard.  I believe that there are characters in this country who will not know for ten years if the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act has changed the fundamental law of guarantee in relation to the transaction where one of the side elements may be the supply of goods. Unless there is a very keen awareness of the need for the change in the law of guarantee I urge very strongly that it be kept to those cases where there is protection required, where an ordinary consumer is acquiring goods.  In these cases fair enough, the guarantee section seems to be right.  Where we have people fully dressed, fully educated, well advised and their pockets full of gold, ambition or avarice, they do not need any statutory protection.  Let them bargain for their interests, the equal parties they are.  Unless we want to change the law in any case where we think there is need to ensure that the deal is a fair and reasonable one, that it needs to be expressed in statutory law that the contract of guarantee having regard to all the terms is a fair and <Col N="1576" /> reasonable one, otherwise I think that people will bargain as they do now and some day somebody will stumble on these sections and not be aware that they apply to the particular situation.  They may not even be conscious of the fact that the language used in a paragraph of the document constitutes a guarantee as it is defined in this.  The safe course for us is to deal with the mischief that we know about and not start changing the law in relation to situations which we do not know are creative of mischief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a legal man the Senator will excuse me if I get some advice on this as I go along.  I understand that the situation is that if there is a guarantee offered it is covered.  If there is a major contract being negotiated the details of the negotiation will form the guarantee.  The contract will be a separate thing altogether rather than the guarantee that will be offered.</P>

      <P>This may well arise more under section 15 than section 16 but it applies to the guarantee field.  I understand that the practice is arising, certainly in the motor trade if not elsewhere, of warranties being offered to purchasers where the warranty is given by a warranty company who are a different body entirely from the people who are actually supplying the goods.  This is a sort of separate transaction in a way.  I wonder if we could be sure that the terms about guarantees would cover a warranty offered in these circumstances, where the actual warranty company may not have any considerable connection or any connection at all indeed with the people who are supplying the actual goods?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  We have to look sometimes to see what might happen not what is designed to happen under the section.  What about the case where a contract is made and there has been no reference to a guarantee but a couple of months afterwards the question of a guarantee arises or if a guarantee is delivered with the goods, as sometimes happens with goods that one buys in a shop?  You go in and you strike your bargain and you know absolutely nothing about a guarantee or you are not concerned about a guarantee and this section does not apply.

      <P>Sometimes retailers provide their own written guarantees undertaking to service, repair or otherwise deal with goods purchased from them.  In such a situation it would be unduly onerous that the retailers should carry liability not only in respect of his own guarantee but also in respect of any guarantee offered by a manufacturer for the same goods.</P>
      <P>This subsection is intended to cater for this type of event.  It states that it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved by the buyer, that the seller had not made himself liable under guarantees delivered where he has provided his own written undertaking that he will service, repair or otherwise deal with the goods following purchase.  The type of retailer who would most likely offer guarantees on his own part would be one dealing with a specified range of goods such as a retailer in televisions who would have available his own maintenance staff to give effect to the terms of his guarantee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>the seller shall be liable to the buyer for the observance of the terms of the guarantee... unless he expressly indicates the contrary.</P>
      <P>Does subsection (2) mean that, if the buyer gives a written undertaking that he will service, repair or otherwise deal with the goods following purchase, in that case, even without indicating to the contrary, he automatically avoids being responsible for the terms of the guarantee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacturer would <Col N="1580" /> remain liable but the supplier would not? In circumstances where, for example, goods are imported and somebody buys them in a shop, is it not rendering the whole system of guarantee worthless if the supplier provides an undertaking to look after the goods for some ridiculously short period so that he avoids completely any liability he might have under this section, especially if the manufacturer is a foreign company or foreign body?</P>

      <P>All that is fine if we are dealing with consumers.  I have thought for a long time that it is a dreadful disgrace that we have lived with these guarantees that were in fact taking away people's rights.  I can see all sorts of transactions where people will write letters, where people will do quite important pieces of business, where they will be supplying goods, and they will not know that there is a criminal offence involved under the provisions of this.  We are creating criminal offences without a <Col N="1584" /> clear need to have it so.  Perhaps there is something of which we have not heard, but why can we not limit it?  Why is the concept of dealing as consumer, which is written all over the implied warranties area, not continued into this guarantee area?</P>

      <P>The subsection makes void any term of a guarantee which purports to make the guarantor the sole authority to decide on whether goods are defective or whether a buyer is entitled or not to present a claim.  Surprising as it may seem, such claims by manufacturers sometimes appear in guarantees. For example, the expression &ldquo;our decision on all questions relating to alleged defects shall be conclusive&rdquo;.  Such clauses are no doubt useful to the manufacturer in fortifying his argument, with a customer but they do not in law take away the consumer's right to go to court to settle a genuine dispute.  Any attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts is held to be against the policy of the law and completely ineffective. Another legal maxim supports the consumer&mdash;no man shall be a judge in his <Col N="1585" /> own cause.  Not even a judge may try a case in which he has a direct personal interest. Therefore where the validity of any such claim by a manufacturer is in doubt, nevertheless this subsection declares unequivocally that it is void.</P>

      <P>The matter is not at all clear as Senators and the Minister suggested.  In the equivalent sections in the misrepresentation code in Britain, or like provisions, the question has been raised as to whether the restriction on exclusions has effectively limited the right to provide for arbitration.  I notice in this Bill that the Minister proposed to the Dáil and had the Dáil agree to the proposal to delete words which appeared in the first draft of section 42&mdash;&ldquo;the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;or arbitrator&rdquo; were deleted. Every other word in that section appears in the UK equivalent of this Bill&mdash;The Misrepesentation Act, 1967.  I do not know the Minister's opinion of this whole question.  We have a provision for arbitration.  There is no question of taking away the court's right.  The court has got certain basic rights with regard to these situations.  Is an arbitrator not acting on behalf of one of the parties if he is acting as an agreed arbitrator?  Is he not acting on behalf of the guarantor? Should he not be the sole authority, if the parties agree that somebody is to be an arbitrator?  I do not want there to be any risk that because an arbitrator may be acting on behalf of supplier as well as the buyer he cannot act at all by virtue of this section.  We want to be quite clear that there is a right for an arbitrator to be agreed between the parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was represented to me by the Confederation of Irish Industry that the provision of the sections on guarantees as presently drafted would unfairly put Irish manufacturers at a disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> their foreign competitors. This point was also raised by Senator FitzGerald on Second Stage and <Col N="1587" /> by a number of other Senators.  The essence of the case made was that manufacturers of imported goods could escape liability for the enforcement of guarantees given with goods since they were outside the jurisdiction.  Irish manufacturers on the other hand would be completely liable for fulfilling their terms of their own guarantees, a fact incidentally to which they do not object. What I propose, therefore, is that in the case of imported goods the importer will be liable for the fulfilment of the terms of the guarantee as if he were the guarantor. If therefore the buyer is unable to legally enforce a guarantee because the manufacturer is outside the jurisdiction, he will still be able to obtain redress against the importer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual time at which the buyer of goods is deemed to have accepted them is of critical importance when it comes to considering the remedies available to the buyer for breach of contract.  Normally if a seller breaches a condition of the contract, for example, proper title or merchantable quality and so on, the buyer is entitled to reject the goods, to get his money back and claim damages.  Once the goods have been accepted, however, the breach of conditions must be treated by the buyer as a breach of warranty only.  This type of breach only entitled the buyer to claim damages.</P>
      <P>Section 34 of the 1893 Act provides for the buyer's rights to examine the goods bought before he is deemed to have accepted them.  Section 35, on the other hand, states that the buyer is deemed to have accepted them when the goods have been delivered to him and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, or when, after the lapse of a reasonable time he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts have held that section 35 prevails over section 34 and a buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods if he has carried out any act which is inconsistent with ownership of the seller notwithstanding that he has not exercised his right under section 34 to examine the goods before acceptance.  One example of a case which illustrates the existing precedence of section 35 over section 34 is that of Harding &amp; Company Limited versus Hillar and Fowler, where notwithstanding that the buyer had not had the opportunity of examining <Col N="1589" /> the goods, a resale and delivery of the goods by the buyer, an act deemed to be inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, deprived him of the right of rejection. It is clearly unfair that the buyer should be robbed of his right to examine the goods by the provisions of section 35 of the 1893 Act.  Accordingly the Bill rectifies this situation and qualifies the application of section 35 in a transaction involving a sale of goods with the provision of section 34.  The effect of the new section 35, which is section 20 of the Bill therefore, will be that the buyer will now have a reason to examine the goods he buys before being regarded as having accepted them.  Thus if the goods prove unsatisfactory the buyer will not now be prevented from having his rightful remedy, that is the rejection of the goods.</P>

      <P>This brings us back to the Schedule where there is the provision that an exemption clause shall not be enforceable to the extent that it is shown that it should not be fair and reasonable to allow reliance on the terms.  Section 2 (3) provides that where a question arises as to whether a term of a contract is fair and reasonable, regard shall be had to the criteria set out in the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that very hard to see in the section.  By any standard an exclusion clause as part of a contract would stand unless it were shown that it was unfair and unreasonable that it should be allowed to continue to stand. That implies that the onus of proof in that particular respect would have to be on the consumer.</P>

      <P>Could we have that very clearly?  The provision is that in the case of a contract of sale with an exemption term the exemption term shall not be enforceable to the extent that it is shown that it would not be fair and reasonable to have an exemption.  Who, but the buyer, would be concerned to prove that and to show that?  In the United Kingdom the position is that such a term, if in a contract, would have to be shown to be reasonable by whoever was claiming it was reasonable to exclude the implied terms.  So the burden of proof would be different here from what is the UK position in terms of the Unfair Terms Act, 1977.  It is for those claiming that a contract term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness to show that it does.</P>

      <P>May I suggest an amendment to section 61 on a point which has been raised in some textbook as to whether there is the right to rescind a contract of sale of goods where innocent misrepresentation has survived the Sale of Goods Act?  Section 61 (2) of the Sale of Goods Act only saves the rules of common law and the right to rescind is an equitable right, not a common law one.  I would suggest that the doubt be ended by&mdash;in our case&mdash;inserting the words &ldquo;and of equity&rdquo; after the rules of the common law in subsection (2) of section 61 of that other Act.  I think this is the right place to raise the point but I had in my mind the introduction of a new subsection on this.</P>

      <P>We had some discussion with the Minister's colleague last week about the corresponding section, to section 26, (1) (b).  The paragraph relates to the title and warranty as to title and my complaint is again about the deletion of the words &ldquo;or known&rdquo; from the paragraph.  Effectively, what the position is is that the buyer, even though he knows of a defect in the title, will take a better title than he knows himself to be taking and it seems to me to be something that is undesirable.  I do not think it advances the consumer's position any one bit to have left the words in and I would ask, why the words &ldquo;or known&rdquo; were deleted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an added protection for the consumer.  It is absolutely <Col N="1595" /> vital that the seller must inform the buyer of all such&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>But the hirer knows perfectly well that there is a defect in the title here and he is entitled to sue for damages.  I am querying the deletion of the words &ldquo;or known&rdquo;.  They have only one meaning.  I suggest that we put in the words &ldquo;or known&rdquo;.  Then the buyer would have to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>He might not know.  If they are left in, the seller could say that the buyer had known or should have known.  What we are trying to do is to put a responsibility on the hirer to be aware of the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The words were in the original Bill and were deleted. This was probably gone into in the 1946 Hire Purchase Act.  I should have thought that the original words &ldquo;or known to the hirer&rdquo; would stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's point, if it were the case that the buyer should have known or ought to have known, I would not make the point, but it is not that.  Very frequently in legislation one sees the expression &ldquo;known or ought to have known&rdquo;, or something similar.  We are not talking about a case where he should have known.  It is a question of whether it was known.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there may be need somewhere in this part of the Bill to repeat the definition of &ldquo;merchantable quality,&rdquo; that is if you are going to have <Col N="1596" /> a definition of merchantable quality, such as you have in the new section 14, where there is reference to goods &ldquo;of merchantable quality&rdquo; and the provision that any reference to unmerchantable goods shall be construed accordingly. The Act to which the definition is extended in section 14 is the Sale of Goods Act.  It is only where the word &ldquo;unmerchantable&rdquo; appears in the Sale of Goods Act as read together with Part II of this Bill that the word is given the extended meaning.  If I am right about that, that extended meaning does not come into section 29.</P>
      <P>When you construe section 29 of this Bill, you use the word &ldquo;unmerchantable&rdquo; without the benefit of the extension of the word in section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act.  But the word &ldquo;unmerchantable&rdquo; as in section 29 is not in the Sale of Goods Act and does not get the benefit of the extension which is made by subsection (3) of section 14 of the other Act.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with this point in another context in relation to an entirely different range.  As we stand at this moment, there is an implied condition that where goods are subject to a hire purchase agreement they shall be of merchantable quality.  There is no definition at the moment of what goods are of merchantable quality.  These words are such as the court may construe but we are now proposing to say because we here properly import into section 28 the implied terms of section 14 that goods of merchantable quality shall be fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought and add &ldquo;and as durable&rdquo; as it is reasonable to expect with regard to any description applied. I would argue very strongly for the deletion of the words &ldquo;and as durable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A word like &ldquo;durable&rdquo; has a kind of meaning which cannot be applied to everything one buys.  There is an old distinction known to the Roman Law between fungible and non-fungible goods. Fungible goods are goods which as you use you consume.  You use a loaf of bread by eating it but you do not use a chair properly by knocking it into <Col N="1597" /> little pieces.  There are goods whose very nature is that they are not durable but there are lots of goods of that kind to which the word &ldquo;durable&rdquo; does not apply. It is not the appropriate word at all. They may not be of merchantable quality; although they are fit for the purposes for which they are commonly bought they are not &ldquo;and as durable&rdquo;. Durability does not arise in relation to them.  This will only fox up the market situation in relation to secondhand goods.  There are people who are so poor that they can only afford to buy secondhand or thirdhand shoes that are priced accordingly and carpets that are half worn out and glad enough they are to have something to put over a cold floor.  In the first place I am dubious about the value of the definition. Merchantable quality is defined here as meaning that goods are saleable, that they are fit for the purpose for which they were sold in so far as is reasonable, having regard to the price paid for them. If you bought a shirt for 10p you would be glad if it was there the following morning considering a cigarette would nearly cost you as much.  An improvement in the definition as I suggest would prevent much waste of money in terms of the number of actions that would be likely to be brought for reason of this inclusion of the words &ldquo;as durable&rdquo;.  One man's need is another man's toy.  There are all sorts of different purposes for which goods are bought.  I would argue that the words &ldquo;and as durable&rdquo; should be left out of section 14 and, therefore, not carried forward to section 28.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a prolonged discussion on section 14 on the whole question of durability and I do not think it would be appropriate to go back to it now on section 28.  The Senator in the earlier part of his contribution made reference to subsection (2) of section 28. He was referring to 14 (3).  If I go through subsection (2) here and give as detailed information as I can it might be of assistance to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection corresponds with section 14 (2) of the 1893 Act.  Again the objective must be stressed, to afford the credit buyer the same implied terms as were given to a cash buyer under Part II.  Accordingly, the structure and purpose of this section corresponds with the aforementioned section in Part II.  A merchantable quality as a concept is not defined in this subsection or in later subsections.  Instead it will be seen that the text of the present subsection stated that there is an implied condition within the meaning of section 14 (3) of the 1893 Act, as set out in the table to section 10 of this Bill.  The current requirement as regards merchantable quality under hire purchase agreements is determined by section 9 (1) of the Hire Purchase Act, 1946.  That section stated that goods let under a hire purchase agreement are of merchantable quality except where they are secondhand and this fact is stated in the memorandum of agreement.  The condition is said not to apply as regards defects of which the owner could not reasonably be aware.  The improvements made under the present subsection (2) are that merchantable quality would be deemed to be inherent in every hire purchase agreement regardless of whether the goods are new or secondhand, or of whether the owner is aware of defects in the goods, subject to the two exceptions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection.  Again I stress that the two exceptions are those which are governed by the dictates of commonsense.</P>
