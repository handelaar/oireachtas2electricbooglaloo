      <P>I have notice from Senator Molony that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The sanction of the Minister for the Environment for Puckane sewerage scheme, County Tipperary.</P>

      <P>With respect, the business we get is regulated by the procedure of the other House.  I am only mentioning that incidentally to make the complaint that in this House we are being offered an Order Paper with 11 Bills on it in the knowledge that the other House, to which these Bills will have to go back if we make amendments on them, is adjourning tomorrow.  It makes a farce of this House's part of the legislative process.  It is being used as a rubber stamp.  We have a succession of Ministers of State here with little interest in and little knowledge of most of the Bills they are presenting here, not having dealt with them in the other House.  The whole thing is a farce.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to discuss Developments in the European Communities before the summer break?  The thirteenth report deals with the period from mid-1978 until 1 January 1979.  An order of the House guarantees that we would have an opportunity of reviewing the Communities twice annually.  It is highly desirable that the House should have an opportunity to discuss these three reports that are now on the Table of the House, especially since not only the Community but the country is going through a lean time economically.  Can we have an indication of when we may have a discussion on these three reports?</P>

      <P>I would like to support everything Senator Cooney has said.  I have looked through the first nine Bills on the Order Paper and there are some major items of legislation included amongst them.  I sincerely hope it is not intended that these Bills will be dealt with today and tomorrow, in time for them to go back to the Dáil to be amended if necessary, because it is just a physical impossibility.  We are going to do a great injustice to the institution of the Legislature if we expect the Seanad to deal with a fraction of the Bills listed.</P>

When we were on the Opposition benches a few years ago we said the very same thing.  This is something that might be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see if the matter could be rectified.</P>
      <P>I can assure Senator Molony that there is no intention of rushing through any business before us.  We will be sitting three days next week, and maybe the week after to conclude business.  As regards Senator McDonald's question, I will certainly look into that and perhaps I will be able to reply to him tomorrow morning.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the constituencies for the election of Members to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Constitution requires, that the number of Members of Dáil Éireann be fixed from time to time by law and that the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years with due regard to changes in the distribution of the population.  The Bill is similar in form to the other Acts for revision of the constituencies which have been passed over the years but it differs from those other revisions in one important respect.  The difference lies in the fact that, for the first time, the scheme of constituencies contained in the Schedule to the Bill has been drawn up by an independent commission.  In setting up the Constituency Commission to advise on the formation of Dáil constituencies the Government were fulfilling the undertaking to that effect given before the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> A detailed explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill.  A set of maps illustrating the proposed constituencies has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library and I have arranged to have a set of maps on a smaller scale provided for each Deputy and Senator.  I do not think it is necessary for me, therefore, to comment in any detail on the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the sections of the Bill, these are similar in form to the corresponding sections of previous Acts for the revision of constituencies.  The sections contain the standard provisions of a Bill of this kind, including a designation of the constituency for which the Ceann Comhairle may be returned unopposed at the next general election and the usual provisions for adaptation of the register of electors and for the treatment of split polling districts.</P>
    <P>The most significant provision in the Bill is section 2 under which overall membership of the Dáil is fixed at 166, an increase of 18 on the present membership and two fewer than the maximum number permissible under the constitutional provisions on the basis of the 1979 census returns.  The Government, in setting up the Constituency Commission, indicated in the terms of reference that the number of members to be provided for should be not less than 164 and not more than 168.  In the event, the commission recommended an overall membership of 166 for the reason that that number best facilitated the formation of a county-based scheme of constituencies. While the total membership proposed is the largest since the foundation of the State and 18 more than that of the present Dáil, there is, I think, general agreement that the increase is fully justified by the increased population and by the heavy workload which is placed on Deputies in modern times.</P>
    <P>As regards the Schedule to the Bill, which contains the details of the proposed constituencies, these are identical with those drawn up by the Constituency Commission.  The Government's position is that the recommendations of the commission constitute a package which they have decided to accept <Col N="1225" /> and to recommend to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The scheme of constituencies proposed is largely a county-based one, involving only three breaches of county boundaries.  I feel sure that Senators will regard this aspect of the proposed constituencies as particularly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Seanad to the question of the variation in the population-Deputy ratio in the proposed constituencies.  At each revision of constituencies since the High Court ruling in the O'Donovan case in 1961, the Budd judgment, the variation in the population-Deputy ratio from constituency to constituency was restricted to 1,000 persons, or about 5 per cent above or below the national average.  In the scheme of constituencies now before the Seanad, the variation from the national average exceeds 5 per cent in the case of five constituencies.  The variation ranges from +6.28 per cent in Carlow-Kilkenny to -6.42 per cent in Mayo East.  Senators will find a discussion of this matter in chapter 3 of the commission's report.  It will be noted that the commission came to the conclusion that there is no rigid tolerance level and that the test in every case must be the one referred to in the Supreme Court judgment in the case of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961, namely, whether &ldquo;failure to maintain the ratio between the number of members for each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention (of the relevant part of the Constitution)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of the Government, to place on the record of this House our appreciation of the manner in which the commission have performed their task.  I am sure that Senators will wish to join with me in expressing thanks to the members of the Constituency Commission&mdash;to the chairman, Mr. Justice Walsh and to the other members, Mr. Healy, Clerk of the Dáil and Mr. Meagher, Secretary of my Department&mdash;for the thorough and expeditious manner in which they did their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of welcoming the Minister to this House and I gladly do so.  In connection with this Bill, I exempt him from the charge I made earlier in regard to Ministers of State coming in here with Bills in which they have no interest or knowledge.  I exempt the Minister with regard to this Bill in common with every other politician who will look at the Electoral (Amendment) Bill because they all have a deep interest in it and some knowledge of the subject.</P>
      <P>I should like to echo the Minister's words of gratitude to the members of the commission.  They undertook a novel task, novel in the sense that they were dealing for the first time with the revision of Dáil constituencies, though they had a precedent from their distinguished predecessors who dealt with the European constituency boundaries and the ice to that extent was broken.  They had the more delicate task of revising the boundaries of the Dáil constituencies. The fact that they have discharged this task in a way that has received, acclamation is too strong a word, but certainly outstanding and nearly unanimous approval from a sensitive body of people whose future could have depended on their work, is an indication that they discharged that work in a very sensitive way.  It is quite an achievement to carry out that task and to please so many people nearly completely.  They also have to be complimented for the speed with which they produced their report.  In that connection one would be tempted to remark that the Government have maintained that level of speed in the way the Bill has been processed from drafting stage to Report Stage through the other House, and has come hot foot from the other House into this House.  I think the Bill appeared in the Dáil only yesterday.  Whether there is any political significance in the fact that the Bill has appeared the very next morning in the Seanad as top of the bill I do not know but we can make our own interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Bill that the number of five-seat constituencies is increased, because it is a recognised fact <Col N="1227" /> that proportional representation works best in the larger constituencies.  Obviously the more five-seat constituencies there are the greater will be the accurate application of proportional representation. It is a pity that they are confined to the cities but, for reasons of geographic spread and the distance and inconvenience that would follow for rural Deputies, I suppose it is a matter of common sense that they would be confined to city districts.  There are a number traditionally outside the cities where that tradition existed and people were used to working on the basis of a five-seater.  I am glad to see they have been maintained.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism that the commission recommended an increase of 18 in the number of Deputies.  The Minister makes the point that there is general agreement that the increase is justified because of the increase in population and because of the increased workload Deputies have to bear.  I go along entirely with the Minister's thinking in this regard.  The workload Deputies have to bear is increasing all the time because so much of a Deputy's work is&mdash;to use the modern jargon&mdash;at the inter-face between the State and the individual.  As the State is impinging more and more at the request of the individual, there will be more room for the Deputy to act at that particular point of contact.  There are more State schemes and more opportunities for Deputies to become involved where citizens come in contact with the State in some form or another.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling of hope among some Deputies that the appointment of the ombudsman is going somehow to lift this burden.  I do not think that is going to happen.  It is a misunderstanding of the role of the ombudsman in relation to what the Deputy must do in his daily grind.  There was also a feeling that if citizens' advice bureaux or similar offices could be set up all around the country they also would remove much of the burden of constituency work from Deputies.  Many of these have been set <Col N="1228" /> up, and possibly they have taken some work from Deputies, but by and large people regard these offices or bureaux as another manifestation of the State.  The motivation that drives them to a Deputy in the first instance is the very thing which would stop them from seeking the help of these offices which they regard as State offices.  They come to the Deputy because they feel there is a certain sense of obligation due from him to them, and principally because he is a familiar figure and they can rely on him to deal for them with the strange faceless creature known as bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>Occasionally, but they are not encouraged.  The work load of constituency business is going to continue to increase.  But even worse than that, I find&mdash;I do not know if others in the Oireachtas share my experience in this&mdash;that Members of the Oireachtas in their own constituencies are actually in competition with each other to get constituency work to do.  When one hears Members of the Oireachtas crying about all the work they have to do I think they are shedding crocodile tears because much of this is self-inflicted.  It is not just a question of members of different parties busily competing with each other for constituency business; members of the same party are competing with each other for constituency business.  This is happening all over the country.  It has reached this pitch in Roscommon.  There are two Fianna Fáil Deputies in Roscommon, Deputies Leyden and Doherty, who regularly review the planning permissions that have been granted by the county manager.  Each of them then has a set letter which he writes to the successful applicants congratulating them on their success and saying if they can be of any further help in the future they will be glad to do so, implying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not mention particular cases.  I will deal in general terms with the work load of Members and the need for extra Members.  I gave that as an example of Deputies putting work on themselves.  Deputies are constantly complaining they have not time to do research in order to contribute to Dáil debates, that they need more secretaries and more research facilities, and they spend all their time literally chasing constituency business.  There are instances&mdash;and these I can quote if the Chair will permit me&mdash;where a particular matter was taken up by a public representative of one party.  The citizen met a public representative of another party and made the query &ldquo;How is that thing going?&rdquo;.  The second public representative obtained an answer and told the citizen who, in due course, met the first public representative and mentioned to the first public representative that that citizen had seen another public representative who had finished off the matter, to be met by an indignant barrage of abuse from the first public representative, &ldquo;How dare you change your business from me to that other fellow&rdquo;.  That is the level to which this business of representation has come and that is possibly the reason why we now need an extra 18 Members in Dáil Éireann, not to process legislation more thoroughly, or in greater depth, or more expeditiously or more efficiently, but to ensure that the messenger boy role will be done.  This messenger boy role unfortunately is one consequence of PR, although not entirely a consequence of PR because in the United Kingdom where they have single seat constituencies it is still a large part of Members' work, but not I am sure under the same pressure.  There is competition between parties and within parties; there is a strong desire for Members to show they are prepared to go to all lengths to represent people in the most menial and trivial way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the constituency work is necessary and much of it has to be done to try to ease the bureaucratic clogs that occur sometimes and prevent a citizen from getting what he is entitled to, or <Col N="1230" /> getting it on time.  The elected representative has a very useful and real role to play in that regard.  I am not saying all constituency tasks Members get to do are pointless or unnecessary.  A good number of them are, and a good number of the things Deputies and Senators intervene in would happen in any event without their intervention.  But there is a certain fraction of cases where intervention is necessary, where the Deputy can explain in more detail to a Government Department or a local government office in the country the particular circumstances which perhaps a constituent did not explain adequately and can clear a bureaucratic clog.  That is a perfectly acceptable and proper role for a Deputy or public representative to play.  I accept that entirely as part of the democratic process.  What I said earlier is not to be taken as in any way denigrating that role but unfortunately, because of the pressures of PR, Deputies have gone further than that and are now literally seeking out cases in which they can make representations.</P>
    <P>As long as we have PR, that will continue to be the case and so long as that continues to be the case there is reason to increase the number of Deputies by 18.  The commission deserve great credit for the way in which they have managed to preserve county boundaries.  County boundaries are of long standing and had such tribal tales in Irish life that they should and have to be preserved because to breach them upsets people unduly and out of proportion to what a stranger might imagine should be the consequence of breaching them.  The commission were sensitive to this and observed county boundaries by and large.  Some people, a minority of Deputies, will be dissatisfied and will feel that the commission came down hard on them.  That is inevitable because one change has a domino effect throughout the country. Having regard to that consequence of changing, the commission have done a remarkable job in disturbing the present position so little.  I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate them once again and to thank them for their work.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for the way it received this Bill and I thank Senator Cooney for his remarks.  When the commission were set up to carry out this task it was as a result of an undertaking that we gave before the last election.  The Government accepted the report as it was given to them by the commission.  It will be hard to please everybody on all sides of the House: some will not be happy; but, taken all in all, the commission have done a very good job.  Everybody knows that it is the people who will decide who will be the Government of the day.  We have seen over the years when governments altered constituencies, the people decided who would rule and who would not rule.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Members of the House, the judge of the Supreme Court and the two distinguished public officials. I would like to record my appreciation to all the staff who helped the commission in their work of amending or revising the constituencies.</P>
      <P>Senator Cooney referred to the work load on public representatives.  I agree with him that it is increasing: people have got more demanding, they know their rights now and rightly so.  If there is clogging up in the process in various Departments people think public representatives will be able to help them. I am glad to say that Members of the House have been more than helpful. Taking everything into consideration, I am happy that the commission have carried out this task in an exceptionally good manner.  When the Bill becomes law I have no doubt that people will decide who should be in Government.  I would like to thank all the Members for their co-operation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am familiar with it but I am informed that it would require amendment of the Constitution.  In the other House I helped the Minister on this and, therefore, I am familiar with it.  Article 16.6 of the Constitution requires that provision be made for the return of the Ceann Comhairle without an election. However, the return of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle without an election would need an amendment of the Constitution. I regret to say that may have to wait for another day.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle takes on nearly the same role as the Ceann Comhairle now.  I agree with the Senator's remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This section contains the usual consequential provisions for the treatment of polling districts split by a constituency boundary.  Subsection (1) of this section provides that where a polling district is split between two or more proposed constituencies, suitable polling arrangements will be made for the electors concerned either by joining a part or parts of the divided district with an adjoining district or districts or by constituting each divided part as a separate polling district.  The provision is necessary because of the time taken in the ordinary course to go through the formal procedure for making a polling scheme.  I can let the Senator have some details of subsection (2) also if he wants an explanation on that.  It provides that such an arrangement is temporary and will have effect only until new polling schemes are made.  Any changes will be subject to the sanction of the Minister as are polling schemes and will only come into effect on the dissolution of the Dáil following the passing of this Bill.  The Minister is empowered to modify any such proposed arrangement when confirming it.</P>

      <Col N="1235" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural grant is paid to local authorities so that they can give relief of rates to land holders.  The reliefs in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1978, expired at the end of last year. This Bill is necessary, therefore, to allow for the rating reliefs to be given to rated occupiers of agricultural land in the present year and in 1981 and 1982.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the rated occupiers of land holdings with a valuation of £20 or less will continue to be, in effect, fully derated.  For holdings with valuations between £20 and £33, rates will be payable only on the part of the land valuation between £20 and £33; no rates will be payable on the first £20 of those valuations.  Rated occupiers with valuations of £33 and over, but less than £40, will be relieved of 80 per cent of the rates on the first £20 valuation and 30 per cent of the rates on the valuation over £20.  The cost of the reliefs will amount to an estimated £37,725,000 in 1980. The cost is made good in full to local authorities through the agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>The change from the reliefs which applied in 1978 and 1979 is that the ceiling on the valuation of holdings to which the reliefs apply is fixed at £40 in the Bill for each of the three years to which the Bill applies instead of being linked, as it was under the 1978 Act, to whatever lower valuation limit might apply to whole-time farmers for income tax purposes on 1 January of each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets out how the valuations of separate holdings in the occupation of the same person are to be dealt with so as to decide whether the total valuation is within the £40 upper limit.  This is contained in subsection (2) of section 1 which replaces the provision in the 1978 Act.  It sets out more clearly than the earlier provision how the total valuation <Col N="1236" /> is to be arrived at.  Under the 1978 Act the Minister could, by order, defer the arrangement under which valuations outside the county would be taken into account in arriving at total valuation. Orders were made in 1978 and 1979 mainly because of the technical difficulties in going outside the county.  The need for doing this no longer exists and subsections (2) and (3) of section 1 of the 1978 Act are, therefore, being repealed by section 5 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of technical amendments are contained in sections 2, 3 and 4. These remove doubts and make it easier to apply agricultural grants under the 1976 Act to land added to county boroughs, boroughs or urban districts by boundary extensions.  I commend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing is that the Minister has a great neck to come in proposing a Bill which has the effect of dramatically and drastically increasing the rates burden on a huge number of Irish farmers while telling us that the Bill is essentially to allow for rating reliefs to be given to rated occupiers of agricultural land.  That is so crass as to be dishonest because the whole purpose of the Bill is to reduce the rating relief entirely so far as the farmer down to £40 valuation is concerned and adversely change the rating reliefs under that.  To try to present this as a relief Bill when it is imposing additional burdens is quite ridiculous and makes a farce of language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a farmer in the Minister's own county on a £40 valuation was paying £174.78 in rates in 1979.  This year as a result of the Minister's Bill he will be paying £430.40 at a time when farm income is dropping, when the farmers on that size of a holding should be receiving encouragement to reinvest, at a time when we hear that the reinvestment in terms of fertiliser is dropping drastically.  Members know that without fertiliser, production cannot be increased let alone maintained.  Instead of leaving money in the hands of the farmer to invest in increasing his <Col N="1237" /> production, the Minister through this Bill proposes to take it from him in this heavy and draconian way.  In County Offaly a farmer with a £40 valuation, and that is only a small farmer as the Minister of State knows, is going from rates of £174.78 to £430.40.  Those who are good at sums can work out the percentage increase.  It is several hundred per cent.</P>
    <P>A farmer with a £50 valuation in County Offaly is going from £242.75 rates to £538 this year.  The Minister says in his opening remarks, &ldquo;This Bill is necessary, therefore, to allow for the rating reliefs to be given to rated occupiers of agricultural land in the present year and in 1981 and 1982&rdquo;.  Yet, he is imposing those huge increases.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a farmer in County Mayo with a £59 valuation and there are such farmers in County Mayo. Senator Staunton gave us the figures here yesterday.  There are 90 farmers with valuations of £70 and over so we can assume that there would be well over 100 farmers in that category.  In 1979, that farmer paid £496.42 in rates and as a result of the Minister's efforts he will have to pay £1,029.55 in County Mayo where land is marginal.  This is the Bill that is presented to us as a rating relief Bill.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there are similar examples of massive increases being imposed on farmers as a result of this measure.  Having regard to the poverty and dire straits into which the Exchequer has been let go by the Minister and his colleagues in Government, one need not be too surprised that draconian steps have had to be taken but one must be disappointed that they are now beginning to affect the small farmers of Ireland, the people to which Fianna Fáil traditionally looked for support and where traditionally they got that support.  It comes badly from that party to reward those years of support with the draconian increases in rates proposed by this Bill.  It is a measure of the desperation of the Exchequer for cash that that party would do something so politically inept and untypical of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> There seems to be something wrong, something perverse in government thinking that leads to extra rates being imposed on small farmers while freedom from rates is maintained for large and expensive dwellinghouses.  It is a long cry from the party of the poor man, who prided themselves on having no backside to their breeches, when they are prejudicing the small farmer in order to keep well in with the wealthy merchants of this country.  It is crazy social legislation. I am not surprised that the Minister's opening speech was so scanty. It contained no justification whatever, no economic, fiscal or administrative arguments for making these changes.  It was just a bland announcement that the changes are being made and there was a cynical and dishonest attempt to present them as relief.</P>
    <P>I will be glad to hear from the Minister when he is replying to this debate the reasons, the philosophy as to why his Department have found it necessary to reduce the threshold for the abolition of rates relief.  I will also be glad to know why he has decided that it is time that the small farmers should get this financial blow and to let me know why there is a need to continue exemption for expensive dwellinghouses.  Was it a conscious decision that it had to be done, that the only way the shortfall could be met was at the expense of the small farmers of Ireland?</P>
    <P>I will be glad to hear from the Minister also his justification for having to bring in this Bill.  If one stands back and looks at it there is one compelling justification as far as the Minister and his colleagues are concerned, and that is, they are stuck for money.  The Minister and his Department must know this especially: he must know that his Department is flooded with letters from unfortunate public representatives doing the donkey constituency work we referred to earlier, trying to get grants from his Department.  The number of letters that are needed to get action towards getting a grant is quite extraordinary.  The reason is that there is no money and the administrative machine is being used to <Col N="1239" /> show down the whole process.  As a result of that the bottom of the barrel is being scraped.  I do not mean anything disrespectful to the small farmers of Ireland when I put them in that category when it comes to taxing them through the rates system.  Their incomes will not render them liable to income tax, because their incomes are dropping and their inputs are increasing but they are going to be caught by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance did not want to hear anything about this when he said that a farmer with £40 valuation would not have any tax to pay because he has not got the income. When I pointed out that under this Bill he would have a huge increase in rates the Minister said that that was another day's work.  It is all money coming into the Exchequer.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Finance know well that if they want to get money from the small farmers it is not through income tax, because they have not got the income to sustain an income tax liability, but they will get it through the unjust system of increasing rates.  We all know the well-founded arguments, and arguments which are a common case between all sides of the House, about the injustice of rates as a system of taxation. First of all, it is based on the Griffith valuation and as Senator O'Brien demonstrated here yesterday this leads to great variations between different parts of the country and even within different counties.  You could have farms with the same valuation having a totally different productive capacity to pay the same burden of taxation in the guise of rates.  It takes no account of the efficiency of a farmer in investing in his holding to improve his productivity. There is no account taken of the personal responsibilities of the farmer in respect of support of his wife and children.  It takes no account whatsoever of geographical location or farming potential.  All these arguments have been made before but they are equally valid to make again now in the face of this Bill which imposes a huge financial burden on the small farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> I am disappointed that there are not more members of the Government Party opposite to debate this important Bill because I would like to give them some more examples of how their colleagues and their supporters will be affected.  For the benefit of Senators in County Roscommon, a farmer with a £40 valuation in 1979 paid £217.26 in rates if he was able, having regard to the fall in his income.  This year he will be receiving a demand for £531.60 and, if Senator de Brún votes for this Bill, he is imposing a 100 per cent block increase on his small farming neighbours in Roscommon.  The new Senator from Wicklow, one of the many people with information from Seanad Éireann, will be able to bring back to his constituents, the information that a farmer in Wicklow on a £40 valuation whose rates bill last year was £201.24, in 1980 will get a rates bill for £492.80.  There are a good many big farmers in Wicklow.  Take the farmer with the £59 valuation.  Last year his bill was £349.93; this year his bill goes to £726.88 and possibly one of the first votes in which the new Senator will be involved will be to vote that imposition on his fellow farmers in Wicklow.  That is what the reality of the Party Whip means.  In County Galway, for Senator Dunne's information, in 1979 on a £40 valuation a man had a rates bill of £213.48.  In 1980, that poor farmer in Galway&mdash;bearing in mind some of the £40 valuations in Galway, I would not like to have to try to make a living out of them&mdash;will have to pay £523.20 if Senator Doolan and his colleagues vote for this Bill.  It might be of some interest to Senator Hillery if I give him some figures with regard to the £40 valuation farmer in County Clare.  In County Clare, £194.76 was his rates bill in 1979. I give the figures also for the benefit of Senator Honan who is possibly more frequently and in closer touch with the small farmers in Clare than Senator Hillery.  Senator Honan and Senator Hillery, by voting for this Bill, will be increasing the burden on that small farmer from £194.76 to £476.40, over 100 per cent increase.  That is the reality of the Bill that is being presented to us as a <Col N="1241" /> relief measure.  I have already indicated the theoretical reasons why rates are an unjust form of taxation.  It is a disgrace that the affairs of the country have been let get into such a mess that the Fianna Fáil Party, the party which prides itself on being the friend of the small farmer, is now reduced to this grubby stratagem of imposing heavy penal taxation to try to cure the ills of the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>It is false rhetoric to say that this is not a Bill about relief. That seems to me to be nonsense.  It is about relief.  To say it is equivalent to putting income tax on farmers is also twisting the facts.  I could not let the occasion go without pointing that out.  I see no reason why the Senator should take this view or indulge in that type of rhetoric, given that a Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill existed in 1978.  It is not as if this is a new Bill or a new title.</P>

      <P>The Senator is a legal man.  Words either mean what they say or they do not.  To say the Bill was introduced for some false purpose or some hidden purpose is bending the meaning of words.  From a legal man, I expect much more straight talking about the Bill.  The Senator had messages for many people on this side of the House.  I noticed he had no message for me or for my friends in Sheriff Street in relation to rates on agricultural land.  To compare the paying of rates on land and rates relief on housing seems to be stretching the purpose of rates.  There are 750,000 or so dwellings in the country.  Rates relief given on those dwellings is enjoyed by many ordinary people who are glad to have rates relief on their houses but the very many services the State has to provide to enable farmers to make their land productive, justifies payment for those services.  The question is, what is a fair amount of rates?  This Bill gives relief.  The fact that there is a reduction in relief is beside the point.  It is giving relief.  I want to make that point.  I am <Col N="1242" /> not involved in the agriculture business directly but I challenge the Senator on the tone he adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the increase in the number of farmers being drawn into the rates net, the House should bear in mind the taxes imposed on the farming community by this Government in the last year.  I listed them yesterday and, in order to get this question into proper perspective, I will run down through them quickly today. They were: the 2 per cent co-responsibility levy, Bord Bainne levy, dairy inspection levy, 30-day test, veterinary inspection fees at factories and the Agricultural Institute levy.  If we take, in conjunction with these levies, the abolition of subsidies for lime and fertiliser, subsidies that applied to the south-western countries, we will get the picture into proper perspective.  This decision to take more rates from a certain section of the community comes at a time when there is despondency on the land with regard to future prospects and rising costs.</P>
      <P>It is worth pointing out that in <i>Farm and Food Research</i>, a periodical published by An Foras Talúntais, we are told in the issue of December 1979 that on a full-time farm costs were 53 per cent of gross output in 1978.  With the rapid increase in costs over the last 12 months, I am sure it is reasonable to suggest that the percentage of costs to output is closer to 63, perhaps even 65 per cent.  There is a dramatic increase in the farmer's costs, a drop in his income and a growth in inflation.  If the farmer were to maintain the same standard of living as he had a year ago, he would need to be in a position, in order to keep pace with inflation, to have a 20 per cent increase on his return.  There is little possibility of a 20 per cent increase in return when his costs of production are increasing very dramatically and when, in addition to that, the Government come along and impose further taxation by way of increased rates on the farming community from £40 poor law valuation upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I drew attention to the <Col N="1243" /> mistake it is to base taxation and rates on these Griffith poor law valuation figures.  Senator Cooney has dealt again with that today.  I do not intend to develop it, except to state again that it is well known that poor law valuation figures under the Griffith scheme do not justly apply in the light of present day circumstances to different areas of land. It has been proven that there are areas of land of high productivity carrying a lower poor law valuation than areas quite convenient to them that are less fertile or less productive.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw the attention of the Minister to some other facts from the farm management survey of 1978 in the <i>Farm and Food Research</i> periodical for December 1979.  The heading is: &ldquo;Some of the Main Results from the 1978 Farm Management Survey.&rdquo; Average family farm income per farm, part-time and full-time combined, was £3,300.  For a full-time farmer the average was £5,305.  The important point was that there was a big difference between farms of different sizes.  The average income for the 15 to 30 acre group was £1,902.</P>
    <P>I put to the Minister that there are farms in the 15 to 30 acre group in parts of the country carrying a valuation of £40.  Farms coming close to 30 acres are certainly in the £40 bracket in some areas of the country.  The average income for that type of farm in 1978 was £1,902.  In paragraph 3 there were big variations between areas.  Incomes in Munster and Leinster were 25 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively, higher than the national average.  Incomes in Connacht and Ulster were 42 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, below the national average.  My view is that this increase in the rates demand on people on over £40 valuation will impose a very severe hardship in some parts of the country.  Unfortunately, no exception is made in the Bill.  If the poor law valuation figure of the farm is £40 or over, irrespective of whether it is overvalued or not, this new rate charge will apply.</P>
    <P>Just over 50 per cent of all farms, <Col N="1244" /> part-time and full-time, had a family income of less than £2,000.  When we consider figures like these, it is apparent that this new measure will impose severe hardship on a big number of people in the farming community.  For full-time farms alone, under 24 per cent had incomes of less than £2,000.  It is quite likely that numbers of these people, with incomes considerably under £40 a week, will have this added burden which in general on a £40 farm works out at something like £200 to £250 increase in rates.  These rate demands will have to be met.</P>
    <P>I believe it was a mistake to introduce this measure calling on farmers with a valuation as low as £40 to have to pay the full rate.  In conclusion I will read one paragraph from the Foras Talúntais December 1979 issue of <i>Farm and Food Research</i> which points out:</P>
    <P>The distribution of income within farming on a regional basis is also a cause for concern.  In 1978 the average income for full-time farms in Connacht and Ulster was about 40% below the national average.  There were about twice as many low income farms in Connacht as in Leinster, Munster or the three counties of Ulster in that year.  Many of the causes of low incomes in the poor regions cannot be remedied in the short or medium term and, if we are concerned to maintain a viable rural population in all regions, we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the community as a whole will have to be a net financial giver to, rather than a net taker from, farming in many areas of the country for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>If we take that in conjunction with all the levies, six in number, imposed on the farming community last year, if we take the withdrawal of subsidies for lime and fertilisers in the poorer areas where a greater application of lime and fertiliser is necessary if they are to reach a viable standard of living and if we take in conjunction with all that this added imposition, the net result will be to cause undue hardship amongst a big section of the farming community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> When we take into account the drift there has been from the land and the hopes there were of improvement in conditions on the farm as a result of our joining the EEC, it is regrettable that at this juncture with all the uncertainty that prevails the Government see fit to impose this added burden.  We may describe it as rates relief.  In so far as it is rates relief for a very small sector of the community it is simply a continuation of what existed before.  The alteration comes when we get as far as the £40 valuation where no relief whatever is provided from that rate band up.  It is simply a continuation of relief to one group, an abolition of relief to the other group.  That is a fact and there is not much sense in quibbling about it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the sentence from the Official Report of the Dáil of Thursday, 24 April, column 2016.  At the conclusion of the debate in the other House, Deputy L'Estrange drew attention to the fact that not one Fianna Fáil backbencher had come in to back the Minister on this Bill.  This leads to the conclusion that there is doubt in the minds of the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil, especially those from rural constituencies, as to whether this is a measure that should be openly supported or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose the Bill.  It is peculiar, as Senator Cooney said, from the point of view of a party that purports to be the lifeline of the weaker sections of the community, that we have to go to Sheriff Street for a Senator on the Government side to support the Bill.  I will be listening very carefully to the rural Senators from the Government side, to hear what their view is.  Constituents who are trapped in the over £40 valuation category will not take too kindly to a Government supporter who openly votes for this Bill.  All is not well with this regime because, in days of yore, no Fianna Fáil Government, to their credit, saw fit to nail the type of people the Government are about to nail now.  It would lead one to believe they are in dire straits as far as their financial arrangements are concerned. <Col N="1246" /> Having listened carefully to what the Minister for Finance had to say yesterday, it would seem that as far as the agricultural community is concerned there is no light at the end of the tunnel. In relation to this Bill and to others, the admission by the Minister for Finance that the resource tax may not be concluded or cease to be operated after this 12 months, was something which will raise the eyebrows of many thousands of farmers.  It will also raise eyebrows today, when you consider that there is a dramatic drop in the threshold from £60 to £40 on which people will have to pay rates.  I am not too sure that the £40 poor law valuation is the threshold which will be held for much longer.</P>
      <P>This Government have allowed themselves to get into such a financial knot and mess that they will stoop to anything to get themselves out of it.  We must accept that taxation of any category is scrutinised closely before a Government would impose it.  Taxation must be equitable and be based on ability to pay. It must be seen as a vehicle to motivate extra production, whether in agriculture or in industry.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the type of taxation Fianna Fáil have been imposing on farmers in the last year or two, it is easy to see why we have arrived at a situation where production is static.  All the economists openly say in order to boost the economy, agriculture must expand and production must continue to increase. There were times when we had 2, 3 and 4 per cent increases in production and in agricultural exports.  This year we are in a static situation.  The basic reason for this is that the Rates (Relief) Bill, together with the other Bills which I will mention in a moment, have eroded the confidence of farmers, big and small. The Minister and other people might be forgiven for saying what would a man under £40 valuation have to worry about, we are imposing the rates only on people above £40 valuation?  There is no reason to believe that a guarantee could be given that in the year to come and in the not too distant future farmers on £30 and £20 valuations will not be within the rate net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> There is lack of confidence on the part of many farmers who in normal circumstances, would invest in extra stock and extra machinery.  In the normal course of events we would hope to sell on foreign markets the extra production thereby achieved and, in the final analysis, it would mean extra nonagricultural jobs.  It appears to me that there are people vested with the responsibility of looking after agricultural affairs and some of the agricultural organisations who have accepted promises, or so-called promises, that will not materialise.  I am putting on the record of the House today that the future of agriculture for the next couple of years is in serious jeopardy.  It is true that the Rates (Relief) Bill on its own might not upset the apple cart.  The problems facing the agricultural community are driving farmers to react in the way they do.</P>
    <P>I want to say to people who might not be <i>au fait</i> with agriculture, that in years gone by when farmers were called on to increase production they rallied to the call.  The goose that lays the golden egg can die.  The greatest disincentive, as the House is well aware, is the belief that at the end of the day, even with your best endeavour, you will wind up worse off at the end of the year.  This causes a chain reaction and allows a situation to develop where people will rest on their laurels.  I am surprised that the Government should pursue that policy because, in fairness to them in years gone by they did the reverse.</P>
    <P>I am all for people paying their fair share of rates and tax.  Senator Mulcahy might be under the impression that when comparing rates on agricultural land and rates on houses, people who do not understand the agricultural scene would say that farmers are getting away with murder.  That is not true.  We pay direct and indirect tax in various ways.  There are certain farmers who are well able to pay.  I hope they will be asked to pay and made pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> The country's problems start when you stifle production.  When the Industrial Development Authority, for whom I have the height of praise, create industrial jobs there is a furore, excitement, front page headlines.  We have been reasonably successful in that line but it is true to say that our natural agricultural industry has not had sufficient notice taken of it in recent times. There is far too great an emphasis on taxation.  Farmers will be more than worried by the comments of the Minister for Finance yesterday.  This rates relief Bill is an extra nail in the coffin. Irrespective of what anybody says, the only relief in it is for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had come before the House in previous years when former Ministers for Agriculture had arrived back from Brussels with something reasonable by way of a price increase for farmers, we would not have felt so badly about it. What has happened?  We spent a year fighting what we call the farmers' super levy.  Indeed, every other country did the same thing.  There was no reason to doubt at any stage that it was socially unjust, that it would not actually be implemented and, of course, the super levy was dropped.  It was dropped at the expense of a reasonable increase in the incomes of Irish farmers.  We got a so-called 4 per cent increase.  In real terms not alone did we not get an increase but in the price of most commodities we took a decrease immediately after the Minister for Agriculture came back from Brussels.</P>
    <P>This is directly relevant to the rates relief Bill because the farming community would pay this with a heart and a half if they got a reasonable increase in the price fixing arrangements in Brussels. Our Minister and Government came badly out of that price fixing.  As I mentioned here yesterday, the price of cattle at our factories is decreasing.  It is certainly less than it was 12 months ago. Our sheep industry is on the floor because of the French problem.  Barley growers are in trouble.  They are offered only £80 a ton for their produce by the grain merchants.  The price of a gallon of <Col N="1249" /> milk at the moment is the very same as it was last year.  Where is the 4 per cent there?  It has been eaten up by the processing industry and it certainly has not got back to farmers.  When this Bill becomes law, as I am afraid it will, it will be another straw to break the camel's back.  We have had a series of all types of levies.  This is probably one of the worst wallops the farming community have got.  It could be argued that money paid by a farmer in rates could be claimed against income tax but, in a year when the farmers' real incomes are decreasing by as much as 25 per cent I am absolutely certain that the category of farmers between £40 and £60 valuation will have no income tax to pay. Therefore they cannot claim for that.</P>
    <P>The poor law valuation system is unjust. I realise it would take a lot of money to set it right but we will never have equitable taxation until that system is tackled.  From the point of view of ability to pay, this rates problem is most inequitable.  A farmer with £39.50 valuation will not have to pay any rates but, the minute he goes over £40, he is automatically involved.  While there is some marginal relief for him, as rates move up along the line they get extremely heavy.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the point I am making, take a farmer with a £40 valuation in County Galway in 1977.  He was liable to pay £174.  In 1980 that will be £523. There will be some adjustments on that but there would have been some adjustments on the 1977 figure as well.  A farmer in County Galway with a £50 valuation in 1977 paid £241.75.  In 1980 he will be getting a bill for £654.  As I say, the same adjustments will apply. Such farmers are certainly a little bit above the average farmer in County Galway but we have several of them.</P>
    <P>The bigger farmers with £59 valuation paid £302 in 1977.  This year they will be expected to fork out £771.  This is a tremendous leap and it all happened in the lifetime of this Government.  There was a tremendous amount of talk about the £75 valuation in the 1977 general election and, while no guarantee was <Col N="1250" /> given as such, there was an unspoken and unwritten guarantee to the electorate that, if Fianna Fáil got into power, we would not be talking about £30, £40 or £50 valuation as a taxation threshold.  That is why I say in this House today that not for one moment do I believe that the £40 threshold will be allowed to stay.  I have no doubt that this Government will become so entangled that they will have to single out the farming community for extra attention, as they are now doing.</P>
    <P>This so-called rates relief Bill imposes great hardship.  Due recognition will not be given to farmers who, for one reason or another&mdash;their land may be highly valued; they may be in bad health; they may be very heavily in debt&mdash;have great loans hanging over their heads.  No notice can be taken of all those things in this rates relief Bill.  Where there is severe hardship, suitable legislation should be put through to let those people off the hook.  When a farming family gets into a very serious position, the law is not the law at all unless it takes due note of severe hardships.  There is no doubt that there are people within that category who will be well able to pay but I am speaking about the people who are severely handicapped in one way or another.  At a time when farmers' real incomes are dropping by as much as 25 per cent, this Bill will make very bad reading for thousands of small farmers.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators have asked, &ldquo;If this Bill is as obnoxious as you say it is, why has there not been greater farmer reaction to it?&rdquo;  When this Bill was before Dáil Éireann many farmers knew they were classified as rateable for tax but the penny did not drop until they got the bill through their door.  In the past couple of weeks there has been sheer amazement on the faces of many farmers at the size of the bill they got. This really sinks home when the bill is received.  I have no doubt that, because of the situation in agriculture, several thousands of farmers will find it terribly difficult to pay.  I make a last petition to the Minister to ensure that there is provision in this Bill that, where hardship can be proven, due note of it will be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> If the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture do not soon change their views radically on the method of taxation, both direct and indirect, for the farming community, we will not be able to rely on agriculture to provide the type of incentives and extra production that will get this economy out of trouble.  I know it has all been said before in recent months.  I want to put it on record that, unless there is a major change of policy, the Government will certainly contribute to the general downfall of the economy.  There are certain things this Government can do to help themselves but, unfortunately, they are taking no notice.  It would be very difficult to explain this Bill to a farmer who has borrowed heavily to do the best he could on a small farm of 40 or 50 acres.  He is expected to pay this in the best interests of the country.  On the other hand, he cannot get his grant for land drainage, or his cattle house, or farm buildings, or whatever, for six to nine months because the Government have no money.  It would be very difficult for this Bill to make sense to that man.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that, when this Bill becomes law, farmers will get what they are entitled to and get it fairly quickly.  They have to pay the rates very quickly.  In recent months the grants situation has got out of hand.  I am asking the Government, if and when they take money from farmers, to give them back what they are entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few observations I should like to make on the Bill which we are discussing here today. While I accept that it represents the continuation of existing rate reliefs for one group of farming ratepayers, the reality is that it removes rate reliefs from another group of farmers.  It is to that aspect that I should like to address my remarks.  The Bill raises the rates burden on several thousands of farmers with land valuations between £40 PLV and £60 PLV.  The effect of the removal of the rates relief from these people represents pressure on two aspects of their <Col N="1252" /> situation.  It represents increased costs and, on average, as far as I can calculate from information I have received, the increased cost to a farmer with £40 PLV is approximately £6 per week; the average increased cost to a farmer with £50 PLV is £8 per week; and to those on £59 PLV, the increase is approximately £10 per week.  Therefore, it increases costs to the farmers involved.  If you like you can express it in another way.  It also represents a reduction in the disposable income of farmers.</P>
      <P>In my county the greater part of 1,000 farmers will be affected by this removal of the rate reliefs in the band between £40 and £60 PLV.  Mostly they are medium to small farmers.  They are a category of farmers in a critical bracket where their survival as viable farmers is concerned.  I regard that as perhaps the most serious aspect of the situation.  Farmers within that bracket will be under the most severe pressure in the next five to ten years.  If their farms are to survive as viable farm units, providing a livelihood for a farmer and his family, they can only do so through intensive development and modern and effective farming methods, all of which will require substantial development and working capital.  Therefore if through this legislation we take away a sum that varies between £6 and £10 per week, we are draining away the development and working capital which farmers in this bracket require for their economic survival.</P>
      <P>Their position is vulnerable.  Their position deserves grave consideration from all of us with responsibility and an interest in seeing the promotion of a successful agricultural industry.  There are the additional pressures on them of growing inflation and unfortunately reducing incomes.  On other occasions I have referred to the fact that farm incomes are now indisputably on the slide. Of course, the smaller the scale of farming, the smaller the farm size, the greater is the adverse impact of the sliding scale of farm incomes.  Therefore, we are talking about a category of people who are extremely vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Senator Mulcahy spoke on this Bill.  I will say this for him.  He broke the silence on the Government's side of the House.  He charged in, made his contribution and left.  To some degree he suggested that Senator Cooney was not being totally straight in his presentation of the facts.  Having listened to Senator Mulcahy, I cannot but admire the agility of his own footwork because, while he emphasised the fact that this Bill continues relief to a certain category of farmers, he very shrewdly avoided making any reference to the point a number of other Senators are concentrating on today, that is, that it takes away that relief from another category of farmers who enjoyed it up to now and who require it.</P>
    <P>He said that Senator Cooney had a message for practically every other Fianna Fáil Senator in the House except himself.  He asked Senator Cooney for a message for Sheriff Street.  There is, of course, a message for Sheriff Street in what we are talking about, and for every other concentration of urban population. It is this: young people in Sheriff Street or any other urban complex will be looking for jobs.  They will be seeking employment in a situation in which unemployment is increasing.  Therefore, if we permit a situation to develop in agriculture where its capacity to retain people who are now living on farms has diminished, and where the young people of rural Ireland are forced into an overcrowded labour market, the message for Sheriff Street is this.  If prosperity in agriculture declines they will find themselves competing for jobs that are already scarce with growing numbers of additional competitors who, if conditions were right, could find a livelihood and a future on the land.  For all of us that is really the message.</P>
    <P>On another occasion Senator Mulcahy said there was a need to show equity in farm taxation, not in relation to the Bill but another one.  Of course I agree with him.  He also referred to the rift in understanding between town and country.  All of us, including Senator Mulcahy and others, who recognise that this rift is there, and who also recognise <Col N="1254" /> that conditions in agriculture are being misrepresented, should do our utmost to set the record right.  Do we have equity in farm taxation or equity in taxation generally?  Let us have equity in the capacity of the people who are required to pay it, on their ability to pay it on their income and on their disposable income. If we accept that principle then, of course, we have to reject the whole principle of rates, resource taxes, and so on. These are levied without regard to the income capacity of the person involved to meet these charges.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect to the point I made about the competition that can arise from people coming of the land and competing for industrial jobs.  If we can inject into agriculture both the confidence and the capital it requires for expansion and development, we can provide increasing job opportunities on the land and take away the pressure from the labour market.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure that that will always be a top priority.</P>
    <P>I believe, for the reasons that I have outlined, the removal of rates relief is striking a dangerous blow at the confidence of the farming community, a confidence already undermined by growing inflation, by increasing farm costs, by the imposition of a multiplicity of levies and duties and taxation measures. The effect of this Bill, perhaps not in isolation but tied in with various other measures, is to nibble away at and extract bit by bit capital required for the development of Irish farms.  The combined impact of all these measures, including this Bill, is to shake confidence in the development of agriculture particularly among farmers whose valuations lie between £40 and £60.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to look at this from the point of view of equity across the whole field of taxation.  We cannot look at it from the point of view of farmers' taxation alone.  Over the years before we joined the European Community, we had to assist the farming community and one of the means of assistance was relief on rates.  Also a <Col N="1255" /> considerable amount of money was spent on development in the farming area.  That money came from taxation paid by people in other fields.  Since we joined the European Community through prices alone the farming community has gained.</P>
      <P>It has been said that this is not a relief Bill but, taking one figure alone, if the rate in the £ is £10, the farmer on £33 valuation pays £30 instead of £330 if this Bill was not there.  A farmer on £39 valuation will pay £173 instead of £390 if it was not there.  Today we have a problem, that is, to get jobs for the community. One of the areas in which we are looking forward to getting jobs is the small industry area.  Today if you have a small industry and a valuation of £40, that industry has to pay the full £400. There is no relief there.  It is definitely a relief Bill in the agricultural field.  When you look at other areas in our community, especially with the big increases in oil prices, relief is necessary there too. In equity you cannot continue the same relief to one section of the community which is improving while another section is coming up against greater difficulties.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Senators who have spoken in this debate.  I listened with great interest to what they had to say.  At the beginning of the debate I tried to explain as clearly as I could what the Bill does.  It might be no harm if I were to go over that again.  So much has been said about things that are not in the Bill at all that it is easy to forget what the Bill is about.  It is about a relief from rates for rated occupiers of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, for 396,871 land holders with valuations of up to £20, there is full relief of rates on land.  Secondly, for 58,684 land holders with valuations between £20 and £40, part of the rates are relieved.  Add these two together and you get a total of 455,555 holdings which get full or part relief of rates under this Bill. These are the small holders.  People with up to £40 valuation under this Bill may <Col N="1256" /> get a relief which costs the best part of £38 million in this year alone.  The relief is not limited to this year.  The Bill applies to this year, next year and the year after.  I am talking about 1980, 1981 and 1982.  No amount of talking about other things should be allowed to hide from us what the Bill does.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the remarks made here by a number of Senators. Senator Cooney said the purpose of the Bill is to increase the burden of rates on farmers.  This is not correct.  Farmers could not get any relief of rates unless a Bill is enacted.  That is why we had to bring in a new Bill.  The previous Act expired on 31 December 1979.  To ensure that the full burden of rates on farmers under £40 rateable valuation is eased a full Bill is now necessary.  Senator Cooney said it is wrong to give relief on big houses and not to small farmers.  He seems to forget that farmers big and small get full relief on their houses whether their houses are big or not and this relief on farmers' houses costs the Exchequer about £11 million in this year.  This Bill gives relief to small farmers on the rates on their land.  The only farmers who are outside the relief are farmers with £40 rateable valuation or more.  These may not be big farmers but they are not what we call small farmers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I come from the farming community and am involved in it.  There is a lot of belly-aching and crocodile tears and the Opposition in some cases want to play the two roads.  They want to go down one road and if it does not suit at the end of it they want to come up again and go another road.  Senator Cooney stated that the Bill would affect adversely farmers under £40 rateable valuation.  That is not true.  The purpose of the Bill is to give relief, not to take it away.  Without this Bill there can be no relief of rates for the 455,555 rated occupiers of agricultural land who will benefit from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien might like to know what the Bill does in respect of County Cavan.  It gives relief in 1980 of £1.945 million to land holders in County Cavan. <Col N="1257" /> It gives relief of 71 per cent of rates which would otherwise fall on the farmers. I hope I am clear on this.  Senator O'Brien said a good deal about farm income. In the Dáil on Committee Stage, I dealt with taxation, which does not arise here.  I share the Senator's concern for the small farmers.  He says that most of them are in the western part of the country. The Bill gives relief in 1980 to small farmers of 71 per cent of the rates in County Cavan, 73 per cent in County Galway, 67 per cent in County Donegal, 69 per cent in County Kerry and 88 per cent in County Mayo.  Senator Howard referred to County Clare, where 82.4 per cent of farmers are under £20 valuation and 12.1 per cent are between £20 and £40 rateable valuation.  A total of 94.5 per cent are in the standard rate situation and 82.4 per cent pay no rates.  The total over £40 valuation in County Clare is 5.5 per cent.  I would like to get this record clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about it. Senator Cooney referred to Laois and Offaly.  In Laois 68.9 per cent under £20 rateable valuation pay no rates and 16.8 per cent are £20 to £40 valuation.  The total under £40 rateable valuation is 85.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>I now return to County Offaly where 69.4 per cent are under £20 valuation, 18.5 per cent are £20 to £40 valuation, bringing the total there to 87.9 per cent. The number over £40 valuation is 12.1 per cent.</P>
      <P>Senator Connaughton said the £40 valuation threshold will not last for very long.  I will forgive him because he has not been a Member of the House for long and he may not have studied the Bill.  The Bill states that the £40 rateable valuation threshold is for the years 1980, 1981 and 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I wanted to <Col N="1258" /> clarify the situation.  The Senator spoke also about the many things that have to be weighed in the balance when the whole question of farming income, taxation and investment is being considered. The Senator knows that the Bill will benefit the vast majority of the occupiers of land in County Galway.  I am going to come up with a very interesting figure now.  In County Galway 97 per cent of the land holdings are under £40 valuation. I could not believe it but that is a fact.</P>
      <P>It was Fianna Fáil who de-rated all farmers under £20 valuation in 1967. We are continuing that de-rating in this Bill.  For the whole of the country 79.8 per cent are under £20 valuation.  Farmers between £20 and £40 valuation amount to 11.8 per cent, making a total of 91.6 per cent in the whole country. The total over £40 valuation is 8.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>If the farmer is paying income tax, he can write off the rates against tax.  I do not wish to get into taxation because we are dealing strictly with the Rates (Relief) Bill.  I want it to be clear that he can set his rates off against the tax account.  For some Members you would think that it was the end of the world.  I have given the figures and I want to make it clear that the Bill is for three years.  If we had not brought in the Bill we could not give the relief that I am talking about to the farming community.</P>
      <P>Of course, there are other scales of relief as well.  As a Government we have not got confetti money.  We never had confetti money and any future Government will not have it.  We have to strike a balance.  I come from the midlands, as Senators know, and no farmers have complained to me.  We are talking about taxation.  Most of the farmers now are swinging over to accounts and anyone will tell you that.  They are even swinging away from the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To conclude, I want to thank Members for their contributions and I hope that I have cleared up any confusion that existed or most of the problems that have been raised.  I hope I have dealt with them adequately.  I have given the <Col N="1259" /> percentage breakdowns.  To hear some people talking you would think that we have put our arms around the farmers and herded them into a corner.  We certainly have not and we have no intention of doing that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about one or two points.  In subsection (2) (b) the Irish Land Commission enjoy an exclusion.  Do I take from that that the commission are financially embarrassed or that the Government do not want to increase the load on them, or is it that they are not enjoying the benefits the Minister has outlined that the farming community are getting? On the question of the categories of farmers who the Minister has very dramatically outlined to the House are going to benefit from the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill.  The Minister said that the Bill gives relief to 71 per cent of total farmers who are under £20 valuation.  Surely the Government or, indeed, the civil servants who assisted in the drafting of this Bill are not seriously considering levying rates on farmers under £20 valuation who in the main qualify for free dole and home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course this Bill is necessary from the point of view that this system of taxation must be changed.  This is very important. The Minister said that only 8.4 per cent of the farmers in total have valuations in excess of £40.  It will give some people some idea of the proportions of the burden of rates when I say&mdash;and I challenge the Minister to <Col N="1260" /> deny it&mdash;that the total amount of hard cash paid by farmers this year will exceed the total amount of money which was paid by the entire community before the Government removed the burden of rates from householders, and this when only 8 per cent of farmers are liable for the full brunt of rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given the figures even for his own constituency where a farmer with £40 poor law valuation last year had a demand of £180 whereas this year that demand goes up to £441.60.  In our constituency&mdash;the Minister and I have in common that we come from the same Dáil constituency&mdash;farmers with £50 poor law valuation had a demand last year for £250 and that has shot up this year.  Despite the fact that farm incomes, as the Minister knows, in the midlands have drastically reduced this year, the rates bill was £250 in 1979 and it is £552 this year.  That is a sizeable demand on people who are barely turning over.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a realist and he understands the position that his neighbours are in.  I would not accuse him of thinking that everything is rosy down in the midlands, but the burden of rates this year is going to affect people adversely to a tremendous extent.  The Minister is imposing this increased burden on a farmer with a £59 valuation in Laois-Offaly who had a demand for £313 rates last year.  His demand this year is £651. The Minister may have more exact figures than those but they represent about the same proportion.</P>
    <P>We are talking about that increase in the demand and people are misled into thinking that this is the only thing that farmers pay and that they can write it all off against tax.  Instead of reducing the number of people who can benefit under this Bill, the Government, knowing the situation in the country, should have gone directly in the opposite direction. They should have raised the threshold for farmers under this section to £60 instead of coming from £50 to £40, in the other direction, because this is necessary.</P>
    <P>The various levies that people are ex-Offal <Col N="1261" /> pected to pay this year out of reduced incomes, have been clearly stated.  Some of the earlier speakers on the Bill mentioned the various milk levies and the agricultural price increase package out of which people are expected to meet the demands of this Bill.  There are nine or ten different levies.  This is a cause for tremendous unease and it is something that the Minister should consider seriously.</P>
    <P>The rating system has outlived its usefulness.  It is about 150 years old.  That kind of yardstick is out of date.  Having regard to the fact that the 396,891 farmers under £20 poor law valuation in the main are entitled to free dole under the Poor Law Valuation Act, how can the Minister seriously say that he is giving them an exemption and letting them off paying rates?  Are the Government considering taxing the people who are on the dole, getting unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit?  We should stop fooling around and look at the problems in the areas where there is real need.  There are 396,891 farmers under £20 poor law valuation.  We are talking about incomes of £7 or £8 a week having regard to last year's figures and that represents a family farm income.  On our side of the river Shannon they do not even qualify automatically for dole and for assistance, whereas in other parts of the Republic they get a fair and more humane crack of the whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald referred to subsection (2) (b).  It provides that the Irish Land Commission holdings will individually be regarded as being in separate occupation for the purpose of determining entitlement to relief.  This is in line with previous legislation on the matter, so there is no alteration there at all and I want to assure the House on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House on percentages.  I dealt with that matter in detail, but under section 1 (2) the agricultural grant allowance will not apply to a person who is rated in <Col N="1262" /> respect of land having a valuation which in aggregate equals or exceeds £40.  This is the only change in the allowances provided by the Bill.  This represents a change from the 1978 Act under which the ceiling for entitlement in any year was expressed to be the threshold for liability to income tax on 1 January of that year in the case of a full-time farmer. If the 1978 Act provision were to continue in respect of 1980 the ceiling on the rates relief for 1980 would be £50 valuation.  Rated occupiers with holdings in different county health districts, or in areas added to urban authorities as a result of a boundary extension made after 2 March 1976, will have such holdings aggregated on a national basis for the purposes of the £40 valuation limit.  The form of national aggregation provided for in the Bill is slightly more limited in scale than the corresponding provisions in the 1978 Act.  The 1978 Act provided that all land would be aggregated.  The present Bill confined national aggregation to areas that benefit from rates relief under the Acts, for example county health districts and urban areas extended since 2 March 1978.</P>
    <P>To hear people throughout the country talk you would think we had created havoc with this Bill.  Study reveals that in the whole of the country 79.8 per cent of the holdings are under £20 valuation.  I can give the number of holdings in any county and any information regarding them to the House if it requires them.</P>

In County Galway 97 per cent of the holdings are under £40.  One would think from Senator Connaughton that we had surrounded Galway.  That was never the intention of the Minister, myself or the Government.  I want to clarify it in case I am talking too quickly and Senators may not hear me.</P>

      <P>I would like to put a few queries to the Minister on this section.  I admire his performance in replying to the Second Stage and also now.  I am impressed to hear that the thing is being clarified when in fact it is becoming more confused.  I know the Minister is drawing a very subtle distinction between holdings and rated farmers.  On two occasions in his reply he practically said the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; and then quickly reverted to &ldquo;holding&rdquo;.  There is a very subtle and significant difference.  In the west, where I come from, there are very many farmers who find that they may have half a dozen demand notes representing half a dozen holdings that are aggregated.</P>
      <P>It would have been very helpful if the percentages the Minister gave in his reply to Second Stage had been circulated with his Second Stage speech and then we would have an opportunity of studying them.  As far as I can recall, the figure he gave in relation to County Clare was something like 92 per cent of all holdings.  As far as I know there are about 11,000 farmers in County Clare and the greater part of 1,000 would be caught in the £40 to £60 bracket.  What number of farmers in County Clare in the £40 and £60 PLV bracket will lose out as a result of this measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a breakdown of the figure in exact holdings, because some farmers and landowners may have a couple of holdings. I just want to clarify a point in regard to County Clare, which I regard as quite a well-to-do county, and it is my boss's county as well.  Under £20 valuation the figure is 82.04.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <P>Holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, percent.  I will <Col N="1264" /> deal with holdings later; I am giving percentages.  Under £20 valuation&mdash;82.4 per cent; for £20-£40 valuation the figure is 12.1 per cent, making a total of 94½ per cent with valuations under £40. The balance of 5½ per cent have rateable valuation of £40 and over.</P>
      <P>I do not think Senator Howard need worry about these holdings.  A farmer could have three holdings but they are added and treated as one holding.  The figures given are of a general nature.  In County Clare the number of holdings between £40 and £60 valuation&mdash;I want to explain here that there may be two or three holdings grouped into one&mdash;is 697. For example, a farmer could have some land in Ennis and other land in Kilrush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving this information.  He has given me so much he has set me looking for more. Rather than deal with percentages, could he give me the figure for the total holdings in County Clare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give those figures in a moment.  I have them all broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would consider extending the relief in this Bill?  He, like everybody else, is aware of the difficulties and hardships that exist.  The figures he has given the House, for which we are grateful, clearly indicate that the burden of rates&mdash;which is greater than it was a couple of years ago if you count the actual cash that changes hands and goes to the local authorities&mdash;falls on 8 per cent of the farmers.  This means they are paying more in rates than the total population of the Republic paid three years ago.  Included in that figure was the urban population of the city of Dublin who made an enormous contribution in rates.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, that is an alarming figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last two years farmers have suffered substantial decreases in their income and they are faced with a decrease again this year.  Let the Minister take <Col N="1265" /> any commodity he likes&mdash;cattle, sheep, barley, milk, beef.  Between levies and the reduction in prices, farm incomes are reaching crisis proportions.  In the main, farmers working on overdrafts or term loans are finding extraordinarily grave hardship and difficulty in trying to meet the huge 20 per cent increase in rates that are being charged.  Instead of reducing the number of people the Minister will benefit&mdash;and I agree people under £20 valuation are entitled to the farm dole or unemployment assistance by virtue of their incomes&mdash;would he not have regard to the difficult situation and the period farmers are going through and extend the benefits upwards, rather than restricting them to people who are under £40 valuation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my mind made up on this.  Senator Cooney referred earlier to Ministers of State coming in and he alleged they were not well briefed, if I understood his statement correctly.  I think he corrected that statement later and stated that I was pretty well briefed.  I was present with the Minister on all occasions in the other House when the Bill was going through there.  I saw this Bill being drafted.  I am not saying I am a know-all on the Bill by any means, but I can, clearly and distinctly, give the House any information on it that is required.  For the many years I have been in parliament that has been my style.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Senator McDonald said, the answer is no.  Senator Howard clearly wanted to know the total holdings in County Clare.  The figure is 23,529.  As I stated earlier, this could be a grouping of holdings&mdash;the total of what the rated occupier would own. That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to any amendments, this is the Bill I presented here this morning, and this is the Bill we are bringing into law.  I am satisfied.  Looking at the overall situation, rating has been a controversial subject over a long number of years.  Farmers with private dwellinghouses, some very big, do not pay any rates.  They get the same relief as the people in private dwellings in the city of <Col N="1266" /> Dublin who have no farms at all.  Some people have said&mdash;I have not&mdash;that this should be looked into.  We have no intention of looking into it.  We are satisfied to give them this relief.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify a point.  Look at the percentage this is going to affect, remembering that they can write this off in their income tax accounts.  We have to be fair. I have known most Members of this House for a long number of years and I am glad to say my relationship with them has been quite good over the years. But I have to be frank, I am not amending any part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well briefed on the Bill; as a matter of fact he is too well briefed on it so far as his side of the story is concerned.  We will come back to the percentages for a minute, lest we have a 100 per cent victory. We want to make sure the situation will be portrayed as it is to the farmers of Ireland.  The Minister talks about 97 per cent in Galway.  That would indicate that only 3 per cent of the farmers in Galway will actually be in the rates net.  But I am saying, as Senator McDonald has said, that the hardship involved and the amount of money that particular section will pay bear no relationship to their earning capacity.  I do not have to tell a rural Member, in a year when incomes are falling dramatically, that they will never get the chance of putting the rates against income tax.  They will not be eligible for income tax because they will not have enough income.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister is making a very good case for the Government, and I congratulate him on that but let it go out from here today that the vast majority of the people now caught in that rates net will not get any income tax relief from it, because they will not be paying income tax.  That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say the Bill will not be amended and because he has the necessary voting power behind him that is exactly what will happen.  Is it not true to say that there will be tremendous hardship on a farming family who are unable to meet this particular rates bill?  I <Col N="1267" /> count it damn bad law that there is not some note taken of the problem.  The Minister said that one would assume from what I said earlier that he was closing in on County Galway and squeezing the life out of all the farmers.  All I have to say is, if he continues the line of action his Government are taking, that is exactly what he will do.</P>
    <P>This is only one of about ten different types of taxation that have come before us.  Do not let it be said that the farmers are happy and that the Minister or anybody else has not heard their reaction to this.  As I said earlier, when rates bills were sent out very recently, there was whole-scale reaction.  Notice should be taken in the Bill of severe hardships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>On Radio Éireann news this morning there was an item to the effect that some farmers because of the steep increase in interest charges were in difficulty and not able to pay for land recently acquired.  It was reported that they were offering these farms to the Land Commission but apparently the Land Commission have no money to take them.  Would the Minister consider a waiver of rates schemes for farmers in that position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for Galway County Council and every other county council now.  It is there in the provisions.  We have to get this right.  I want to make this absolutely clear: in cases of real hardship local authorities can always write off the rates.  Let us take Galway as an example.  I was amazed, and I double checked the figure to see if it was correct, when I discovered that 9 per cent of the holdings in Galway were under £40 valuation.  It was proved correct.  The rates on land and houses in <Col N="1268" /> the year 1977 was £107 million.  This year farmers are being asked to pay about £45 million in rates on land.  If we had not brought in this Bill they would be paying £38 million more and another £11 million if we had not taken rates off their houses.</P>
      <P>Look at it in a broad context.  I am satisfied.  I come from a rural constituency. I live in a rural area, as a good many Members of the House know.  Not one farmer has come to me yet and complained.</P>
      <P>I was in on the discussion of the Finance Bill in the Dáil when Fine Gael wanted the notional system brought in for a year.  I am against the notional system because if one has a bad year one is stuck with it.  Fine Gael were not serious about the notional system and I will tell Senators why.  When their amendment was put, they did not call for a vote.  They shied away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We honoured any commitments we gave at that time.  To get back to the Bill, the truth hurts.  You cannot have your loaf and eat it.  As I said earlier, no farmer or rated occupier in my constituency complained to me, either by word or letter.  I travel through my constituency quite a lot.  In the clinics I attended, not one person told me this was wrong.  Nobody wants to pay rates or tax.  Like everybody else I want to pay as little tax as I can.  That is human nature.  We have to run the affairs of the State and of my Department.  Everybody is demanding more of the cake, whether it is there or not, but there is a limit to the money I have available to me.  There is always a limit but taking everything into consideration I cannot understand what all the belly-aching I heard in both Houses is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that but I would like it to be clearly understood that the county manager has a certain amount of discretion in these matters. Even without actually committing himself, if the Minister said such cases would be entitled to sympathetic consideration that might influence county managers when administering the waiver of rates to take on the spirit of the Bill, expressed by the Minister at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>County managers have powers in cases of hardship to write off rates, and to make a reduction of rates, I always found county managers reasonable men.  I am glad to say that.  If Senator O'Brien or any other Senator has a case of hardship, I do not see any reason why he should not bring it to the notice of the county manager with all the relevant information.  I do not see any problem here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this argument, but I would like the Minister to clarify one matter.  He gave an impressive figure of the amount of money ratepayers were saved this year.  Is it not true to say that in two humble counties&mdash;Laois and Offaly&mdash;the amount of money that will be levied on rates this year will be on a par with the amount of money collected three or four years ago, before the rates were removed from dwellings?  This is significant, especially since the Minister's own figures indicate that this money is being contributed, paid or squeezed out of 12.1 per cent of the population of householders in County Offaly, and a somewhat smaller percentage of people in County Laois.  The Minister, being a <Col N="1270" /> practical man, must admit that last year a farmer with a valuation of £40&mdash;to take the easy figure&mdash;paid £180 in rates. As a result of Government policy this is being increased to £441 this year.  This will cause considerable hardship.  There is no use saying the farmer can write it off against rates.  He was not asked to pay rates until this year.  This will cause considerable hardship taking into account the decline in agricultural incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Rates from 1978, 1979 and 1980 went up 10 per cent.  I would like to remind Members of the House that I got a number of requests, even since I took over the portfolio, mainly from Opposition councillors, Deputies and Senators who were not satisfied with the 10 per cent rate.  They wanted to raise it more.  If my Minister had not brought in the ceiling, what would farmers be paying?  County councils and local authorities throughout the country could increase the rate by 20 per cent on the farmers, rated holders and business people.  That was why we did that.  If we had allowed a free-for-all, business people and rated holders could be paying another 60 per cent instead of 10 per cent in 1978, in 1979 and now in 1980. They could even be paying an extra 100 per cent.  This is the situation.  You cannot have your loaf and eat it.  I am satisfied that the introduction of this ceiling was the proper thing to do.  In my own constituency, a number of business people and rated holders congratulated me on that stand.  They said the county councils and local authorities would have gone to town on the rates if the Minister had not stepped in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this right. If we had not put a ceiling of 10 per cent, what would have happened?  What would the farmers be saying to every local authority?  I was a member of a local authority for a number of years and I know what matters used to come up at meetings.  When it came to striking the rate the farming and business community <Col N="1271" /> asked us to go easy on them. Other members on local authorities know that also.</P>
      <P>I want to confirm that where local authorities see cases of hardship, under the Act, they can always reduce rates, halve rates or write off rates.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a cumbersome procedure, but often we are told of cases of hardship.  I have no doubt there are some genuine cases of hardship. Sometimes it is alleged that there is a case of hardship, but when it is checked a different picture emerges altogether. This is a function of the manager to decide on.  Knowing county managers throughout the country&mdash;I often had a difference of opinion with managers, not of a personal nature but on policy&mdash;they have carried out their responsibilities in this manner very fairly.  Where there were cases of hardship, the person rated was helped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In his enthusiasm to make his case, the Minister said something that, on reflection, he might have preferred not to have said.  He said that but for the 10 per cent call from the Department of the Environment local authorities would go to town altogether. I know the Minister is regarded as a reasonable man on all sides of this House and in the other House, and I would not like it to go on record, without correction, that it is the Minister's considered view that legal local authorities would go to town on the ratepayers if there was not a check on them from above.

      <P>As a member of a local authority I am glad that was the intention.

      <P>I cannot understand why it is not desirable that a hardship clause should be written into this Bill.  It is all very well to say that the county managers have powers to do that, equally it would be a pity if this type of hardship clause were left to the manager.  We are very lucky that we have so many fine county managers but nevertheless the degree to which they would acknowledge hardship in the strict sense of the word might not alleviate hardship, which are two different things. I cannot understand why we could not have some agreement on this particular Bill.  A clause could be inserted to cover the case where genuine hardship was proved and in the eyes of the law those people would get certain relief.  That is very important.  The Minister has not convinced me yet that it is impossible to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be accused of interfering with the freedom of local authorities.  I have no intention of following Senator Connaughton's suggestion of interfering because the local authority are the best judge of individual personal hardship in respect of any case. I do not think it would be right of me to interfere.  The local authority are in the best position to judge the situation.  This Bill is a relief Bill to the extent of £38 million.  As I said earlier in regard to hardship cases, I would not like to interfere in a situation where, in my opinion, managers of local authorities throughout the country perform their duties in this respect very well.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is not possible to collect £38 million from people under £20 valuation and certainly that there would be no moral obligation on people on that level of income to pay that kind of money?  It is a necessary relief and the Minister should admit that.  The only question I was arguing was that he should have <Col N="1273" /> taken the relief upwards rather than downwards.  He should not have restricted the number of people who, in all fairness, are entitled to relief this year.</P>

      <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1976, provided for the extension of reliefs granted under the Rates on Agricultural Land Relief Acts to areas added to county boroughs and urban districts as a result of boundary extensions made on the passing of the Act on 7 March 1976.  This section, together with sections 3 and 4, contains a number of technical amendments and adaptations of the Act so as to facilitate administration of the reliefs in such urban areas and to remove any doubts as to the application of the reliefs.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides, for the purposes of calculating allowances in respect of land which was added to a county borough, borough or urban district after 7 March 1976, the rate to be used shall be the municipal rate.  The Act provided that the allowances were to be calculated on the basis of the general rate in the £.  This expression relates to county councils only.

      <P>No, allowances under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts are not given to occupiers of agricultural land in county boroughs or urban districts.  Agricultural land in these areas get relief under the Local Government Act, 1940, and various City Management Acts.  These are permanent reliefs, unlike those under the agricultural grant.  Urban district council reliefs for land are 40 per cent; boroughs, except Dún Laoghaire, 25 per cent; Dún Laoghaire Borough, 50 per cent; Dublin County Borough, 50 per <Col N="1276" /> cent; Cork County Borough, 50 per cent; Waterford County Borough, 30 per cent; Limerick County Borough, 40 per cent.  Land in urban areas will continue to benefit from rates or relief as outlined above.  The reliefs for urban land are not recouped by the Exchequer. The total land valuation in the country is approximately £7 million, of which only £101,000 is in urban areas, including the boroughs.  The Rates on Agricultural Land Relief Act, 1976, provided for the application of the agricultural grant and allowances to land which might be brought within the county borough or urban district as a consequence of extension of the boundary.  The extension of the agricultural grant to such land generally facilitates the extension of urban boundaries by removing one source of objection by farmers, loss of agricultural grant rate relief.  The boundary extensions which have taken place since the passing of 1976 Act are Drogheda Borough, Bray Urban District.  Youghal Urban District, Tralee Urban District and Waterford County Borough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that there is some irony in the fact that we are debating a Bill which is misleadingly titled and imposes a very heavy burden on a substantial extra number of farmers and does not give relief to farmers, other than maintain a situation which has existed for a long time.  It continues relief to a certain number of farmers.  The figures I quoted to the Minister on Second Stage are from his own Department in reply to a question tabled by Deputy L'Estrange in the Dáil yesterday.  As is clear from the figures the increased burden is very substantial. The irony is we are debating the Bill and we are going to vote this extra burden into being when outside the House there are farmers protesting about their financial predicament at the moment.  I do not know what democracy means or whether there is any connection between reality and bureaucracy but there is something drastically wrong with a system that can lead us into imposing these heavy financial penalties on farmers who are protesting that their incomes are dropping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break for lunch I dealt with this in some detail.  The Bill expired on 31 December 1979.  Some Members of the House have not got the message that the Bill is giving relief.  The Minister had to bring a Bill before the Oireachtas in order to give the rates relief.  Other than that, legally and statutorily it could not be given.  In County Galway in Senator Connaughton's own area, 97 per cent are unover £40 valuation.  Only 3 per cent are over £40 valuation.  We cannot shed crocodile tears and go around like Simple Simons and go one road and then go another.  When the Leas-Chathaoirleach asked me to amend various sections of the Bill I was honest and said I would not.  If I was going to do that I would tell the House that, but I was not.  Look at the whole country, 91.6 per cent is under £40.  The balance all over the country is only 8.4 per cent.  The farmers have relief on their houses.  Farmers paying income tax can offset the rates against their income tax account.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives relief to the tune of £37 million a year rates on the land.  No amount of talking can hide that. Everyone understands how rates are arrived at.  The valuation of the property is multiplied by the rate in the £ struck by the local authority.  Since we came back into office we had a ceiling on the amount by which the local authority could raise the rates.  A number of farmers and the business community throughout the country have said that without the ceiling, the rates would be very much higher.  The local authority would probably increase them by 100 per cent instead of the 30 per cent in the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> I stated earlier the total number who were involved and what the situation is.  All rates in 1977 on land houses were approximately £107 million.  This year, the farmers are being asked to pay about £45 million in rates on land.  If the Government did not bring in this Bill, they would be paying £38 million more and £11 million more on housing.  We have to get the correct facts.  I gave various instances throughout the country, county by county.  In the midlands I gave a variation of percentage on what people say are very well-to-do counties but the farmers' valuation in these counties under the £40 valuation was 94.5 per cent in County Clare.  Over the £40 valuation they are only 5.5 per cent.  We have to put this in its proper perspective.  I am satisfied that under the Bill we are putting through the House if there is any hardship the manager of the local authority has power to look into it, and he can waive the rates on any holding in the case of hardship or he can make marginal relief.  I was asked earlier if I would include it in the Bill.  I did not include it because the managers of local authorities have the powers.  I do not want to interfere with local authorities because they are the people best able to judge the circumstances of the particular landowner or ratepayer.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I went through all the various points that were brought up on the Bill.  I have explained the reason why it is called the Rates Relief Bill.  If we had not brought in the Bill, we could not do this. I want to make it clear that this is for 1980, 1981 and 1982.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1980 which I made on 23 May 1980 under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>This order extends for a further six months the currency of a statutory ban on the operation of new company owned motor spirit stations by oil companies, created by the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972.  That order, as amended, is due to expire on 18 July 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply and distribution of motor spirit has been the subject of legislation since 1961.  The 1961 order, made following an inquiry held in 1960 by the Fair Trade Commission, was for the purpose of regulating the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, the system under which a retailer agrees to handle one brand of motor spirit exclusively.  The commission had found that, while the system had certain merits, it tended to encourage an excessive number of petrol <Col N="1281" /> outlets.  Shortly after the making of this order, the Fair Trade Commission and the petrol companies reached agreement on certain principles designed to limit the increase in outlets.</P>
    <P>There was concern through the sixties that the guiding principles were not having their intended effect of limiting the number of outlets and that the regulation of the solus system was leading the petrol companies to increase the number of directly operated outlets.  At the Minister's request, the commission held an inquiry into the growth in outlets in 1970.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission, in their report of that inquiry, argued that the growth of the control by the oil companies over the retail market needed to be halted for a time in the public interest as it felt that this development would lead to dominance over the retail trade by the petrol companies and increase the risk of certain restrictive practices.  The subsequent 1972 order halted this development for three years. It was reviewed by the commission in 1975 and on their recommendation extended for another three years until the summer of 1978.</P>
    <P>The ban was further extended to 18 July of this year by means of orders made in 1978 and 1979 in order to allow the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out a further inquiry, which I requested early in 1978.  This inquiry was concerned with the operation of the current Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Orders, any matters germane to the operation of the orders and also the conditions which obtain in regard to agreements under which petrol stations, which are company owned but not company run, are operated.  The commission in the course of this inquiry also looked into a recent development in the trade which I regarded as being very relevant to the inquiry. This was the announcement by one of the petrol wholesalers that supplies of petrol would be withdrawn from uncontracted retailers who could not take a specific minimum delivery of petrol.  Special sittings to deal with this issue only were held in March last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> I have now received the commission's report of their inquiry and, to facilitate examination of it and the taking of action in relation to their recommendations, I have extended the current statutory ban on the operation of new company owned motor spirit stations by petrol companies for a further six months.  The report, which will be published, is now the subject of urgent examination, and I expect to be introducing legislation based on those of the commission's recommendations which I accept, later in the year.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the order.  The order, however, may not be amended but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>
    <P>This is an uncontroversial measure and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the Seanad.</P>

It is a little unsatisfactory to have to discuss Bills, regardless of the uncontroversial issues, against the background of the lack of the publishing of the Dáil Report because we can have a better debate here when we have knowledge of the views expressed in the Dáil.  The only relevant difference between this debate and what occurred in the Dáil is the fact that the Minister has received the commission's report since the Dáil sitting and the extension for six months which he seeks in this Bill is entirely reasonable and has our support.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Pyramid Selling Bill, 1980, is to prohibit the inducing of persons to participate in pyramid selling schemes and to provide for other matters connected with such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill says, the inducing of people to participate in pyramid selling schemes is no more than a confidence <Col N="1284" /> trick.  The promoters of these schemes make exaggerated and misleading claims about the profits participants can make on their investments, and there is greater emphasis on the cash benefits to be derived from recruiting further new participants than on profits from retail selling. New participants are required to make investments which, particularly when a scheme has been in operation for some time, they not only have little hope of profiting from but the actual investment is at risk.  The volume of goods sold to participants is excessive and the number of participants is far too great.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily, a distribution organisation is set up with the sole object of supplying consumer demand at economic prices. To achieve this, care is taken to ensure that the volume of goods offered for sale is not excessive and the selling organisation is structured to ensure that the retail distribution function is carried out as efficiently and economically as possible.  In the case of a pyramid selling organisation the emphasis is on trade within the organisation rather than on retail selling. The promoter's objective is to induce as many people as possible to make investments in what is represented to be a direct selling scheme.  In return for their investments participants are supplied with a stock of goods; they are given the right to sell the goods to other participants and/or consumers; and they have the prospect of profiting from the recruitment of further participants.  Participants are recruited on the &ldquo;chain-letter&rdquo; system and, at least in theory, there is no limit to the number of participants or the stock of goods traded within a pyramid selling scheme.  In the US, Britain, Australia and elsewhere it has been found that within a very short period of time a grossly excessive number of participants can be recruited and they are all trying to sell on a flooded market.  Participants have little or no chance of recovering their investment let alone profiting from it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to protect people who, in the main, genuinely believe they are joining honest selling organisations. They are people who have been conned <Col N="1285" /> by exceptionally skilful sales people who would deny vehemently that they are promoters of pyramid selling schemes. We have seen transcripts of the sales talk delivered by these promoters, and <i>prima facie</i> they are very convincing.  People who are induced to join these schemes do not always have to part with a lot of money, but there is an unfortunate tendency for people who join and fail to make a profit on their investment to get in deeper either in an attempt to recover their losses or in the belief that a larger scale participation would improve their chances of success.</P>
    <P>If people insisted on getting straightforward answers to a few questions before joining a selling organisation there would be no need for this legislation. What market survey has been carried out?  What is the size of the market in my particular area?  Will I have exclusive selling rights in that area? Can I get my money back if I cannot sell the goods?  Why should I pay for promotional literature or training to sell the goods?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is quite clear that people need to be protected, and that is what the Pyramid Selling Bill is designed to do.  It defines pyramid selling chiefly by reference to its two peculiar and objectionable characteristics&mdash;the prospect being held out to participants of rewards merely for recruiting new participants, and the requirement that participants should make a payment to a promoter or an existing participant.</P>
    <P>Three main offences are being created&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) inducing a person to become a participant in a pyramid scheme,</P>
    <P>(b) receiving a payment or other benefit from a person who is a participant or who has been invited or applied to become a participant,</P>
    <P>(c) inducing a person to make a payment to or for the benefit of a promoter or participant.</P>
    <P>A person guilty of an offence under the Act on conviction on indictment will be liable to a fine not exceeding £10,000 <Col N="1286" /> or up to two years imprisonment or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill which will entitle a participant who returns goods supplied under the scheme to a refund of his money.  It is also provided that any agreement between a promoter and/or participant and another person shall be null and void in so far as it provides for the payment of money.</P>
    <P>I believe that my concern about pyramid selling is one which is shared by everyone in this House.  I am satisfied that this Bill will deal fully with the problem, and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Minister that he has our support in the passage of this very necessary legislation. Reference was made here this morning in the Order of Business to the difficulties that Senators were presented with in dealing with legislation coming before the House and also the fact that it seems the Seanad is being used more as a rubber stamp than anything else in the context of the fact that we have nine Bills before the Seanad today.  My views of the subject became a good deal more severe when I discovered after the Order of Business this morning that the Bill itself was not available to us.  It is only within the last hour that the Bill has become available to us.  I accept that it is in the Minister's hold, but it is not an adequate way to deal with legislation.  I accept the crying need there is for the legislation, but it is a very bad precedent. Indeed, this is not precedent.  It happens very regularly and it is unsatisfactory and unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that everybody in this House will support the thrust and purpose of this legislation.  It is a complex Bill and it may have ramifications beyond those that we see at the moment.  One of the great advantages of the bicameral legislative system that we have is the fact that legislation is analysed extremely well over a long period of time and great consideration is given to all aspects of the Bill.  For that reason, even though we might pass this legislation, because of the <Col N="1287" /> absence of a reasonable opportunity to examine all of its very detailed provisions it may be that we are enacting something that we do not intend or wish to enact.  I do not blame the Minister for this.  I recognise that it is a system that has grown and it is seen particularly at this time of the year.  The Dáil finishes tomorrow evening.  If we choose to amend this legislation&mdash;not that we are going to be given the opportunity to do it despite the fact that in theory we have the right&mdash;there must be on the Minister's part a very grave reluctance to have us interfere with this legislation now because his obvious desire is to have this Bill law as soon as possible. The cold reality is that if we amend it it is not going to get back to the Dáil in time for the Dáil to consider our amendments. From a practical point of view.  I want to criticise this type of approach, particularly in relation to a Bill like this. On the face of it it is simple and very necessary in its purpose, but it is complex and may have effects far greater than those that we see at first glance.</P>
    <P>I also would like to congratulate the Minister.  I think it is the first time that he has appeared in the House since his elevation to high office but perhaps I am wrong.</P>

      <P>I do not think he has been here in relation to any consumer matters.  I welcome him and wish him very well in his job.  Perhaps the most important comment that the Minister made in the course of his address was when he said that if people insisted on getting straightforward answers to a few questions before joining a selling organisation there would be no need for this legislation.  That is very fair, and I accept it.  I am not inclined to accept, though, that the passage of this legislation will stop this type of problem.  The only way we can stamp out this problem is to ensure that people who are <Col N="1288" /> vulnerable to approaches by such conmen as the type of people who generate this sort of selling practice realise that it it is to their detriment to involve themselves in such a scheme.  We are not going to solve the problem until we do this. Anybody who promotes this type of pyramid or chain letter selling lacks very much the degree of integrity that we like to see in the business community.  Unfortunately I cannot accept that converting an undesirable business into a criminal offence is going to stop the practice.  It certainly is going to inhibit its operations. It certainly is going to create extra difficulties for people who promote this type of activity, but in the heel of the hunt the importance of this legislation is not just that it becomes a criminal offence but that everybody in the country who is vulnerable to the type of approach that these sweet-talking salesmen engage in must realise that it is to their absolute detriment even to listen to them, let alone participate in the activities promoted by these gentlemen.</P>
      <P>Even though I have regretted the fact that we are not getting the opportunity we should get to consider the legislation, I feel obliged to compliment the draftsmen of the Bill.  It must have been an extremely difficult problem to place on any parliamentary draftsman's desk. It is difficult to define chain-letter activities or pyramid selling or whatever we choose to call it.  It must have been extraordinarily difficult for them to define exactly what they meant by pyramid selling schemes, and also to define the level of activity in such a scheme that should be criminal.  It really is only a first glance and first consideration I have given to it, but it seems to me to be a well-drafted Bill so far as achieving its purpose is concerned, the purpose being to make a criminal offence out of the activities of promoters and participants in pyramid selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already indicated the offences that arise under the Bill and has also in the definition section identified the offence aspects of pyramid selling. The idea behind these sales is not at all to sell goods to consumers in the ordinary <Col N="1289" /> sense.  On most occasions that businessmen involve themselves in this type of promotion they are doing it because their products are such as would not sell in ordinary commercial circumstances. So from the very start you can almost invariably take it that the type of product promoted in this type of scheme just would not stand up to the ordinary business difficulties that people have in marketing products.  The horrible part of it is that the promoter of the scheme is not so much concerned with the disposal of his product as with the acquisition of sales people.  It is particularly reprehensible because it is done on a private basis, frequently to private individuals who feel that their ordinary work, employment and so on does not generate enough income for them.  They are very frequently in financial need themselves.  They are easily conned by the sweet-talking salesman who promotes this type of activity.  They fall into it and, as the Minister has very properly pointed out, these people often find themselves in deeper financial trouble after a short time in these schemes and in order to try to extricate themselves, as they believe, they find that they have to go in deeper, and the deeper they involve themselves in participating in pyramid selling the deeper come their troubles and financial difficulties and the more difficult it becomes for them to get out at all.</P>
    <P>The problem that we are trying to deal with here is not going to solve many of the offensive sales practices that are so prevalent today.  We need to enact legislation providing for a cooling-off period in relation to any direct door-to-door sales.  Many people, particularly housewives, who meet salesmen at their doorstep are particularly vulnerable to the very experienced and very well-trained sales talk of some door-to-door salesmen.  These people are entitled to a reasonable time within which to reflect upon their transaction, speak to other members of their family and decide whether they really want the item they have bought, whether they need it or whether they have been conned into purchasing the article they have bought <Col N="1290" /> at their doorstep.  Many of the articles sold in this way are articles that people would not think of buying if they were not induced by sales talk into buying.</P>
    <P>Often I think pretty worthless encyclopaedias and other expensive reading material are sold in this way. People are told these are very desirable things to have available in their homes as reading material for their children.  When people's good intentions in relation to their family are appealed to in this way they find it sometimes very difficult to resist the temptation.  Methods of easy repayments for the initial outlay in the purchase of these encylopaedias or similar type products are further inducements.</P>
    <P>The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill which was passed by this House not so long ago and which will become law fairly shortly will be of assistance here, but we need to do far more in relation to the education of consumers and people who are vulnerable to this type of approach.  I appreciate that the Director of Consumer Affairs has not been in business for a very long time but he has been there for a couple of years.  I do not know what he is being paid.  I do not want to suggest that he is not earning his salary but I really wonder whether we are satisfied that the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is working as well as it should be.  I, more than most people who are not privileged to be Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, am probably sensitive to advisory advertisements that the Director of Consumer Affairs would publish, but the impact that the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs appears to be making is very slight if it is there at all.  The passage of legislation like this and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill is all very fine in itself but it is not going to achieve anything in real, significant terms unless the ordinary Seán Citizen is alive to the dangers faced in dealing with some sales-people.</P>
    <P>I hope that the office of the Directror of Consumer Affairs is sufficiently well financed.  There have been complaints about that previously.  I wonder whether <Col N="1291" /> he is sufficiently independent.  I argued very forcibly on the Consumer Information Bill that he should be established in an agency removed from a Government Department, that he should have an independent budget and that he should be sufficiently well staffed and resourced to ensure that he can carry out his functions. At this remove from the passage of the Consumer Information Act and the establishment of his office I do not believe that he has made the impact that he should make and I am sure that he would like to make.  I wonder just how much of this is due to the lack of resources on his part.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on the inclusion in the Bill of a provision for the court claims that are known as piggyback claims.  At section 6 of the Bill, the penalties section, there is provision for compensation to be paid to a victim of a pyramid sales promoter whereby where the promoter or a participant is convicted in court the court will have the right to award a portion of the fine imposed to the victim by way of compensation.  That is very practical in the context of consumer legislation generally, because it removes the necessity that ordinarily lies on the consumer to bring his own independent civil action to recover compensation. It is more likely, therefore, to be seen as being of immediate consumer advantage than the Bill would be without that provision.  Although constitutional difficulties might arise, I regret that the amount of the compensatory aspect of the fine cannot be greater than £500. The right that is given to include in the fine a compensatory element is limited, as I read the Bill, to orders of the District Court or orders of the Circuit Court on a District Court appeal and, therefore, has a ceiling of £500 on it.</P>
    <P>I imagine that if one were to compensate properly not just witnesses at the hearing but all people who are known to have suffered at the hands of some pyramid sales promoter, the figure might be far in excess of this.  It is making fish of one and flesh of another to allow compensation to the abused consumer who <Col N="1292" /> has on the one hand given evidence in court on the hearing of the criminal charge against the promoter while on the other hand denying the same right to another consumer who was not called to give evidence.  I appreciate that the Minister's Department are trying to be practical in their approach in this sense, but our legal system is such as to discourage actions by consumers to recover compensation for wrongs done to them by unscrupulous business people, and I think that this is an ideal solution.  I accept that there are difficulties involved in it but if provision were included in this Bill for a hearing on indictment before a Circuit Court judge or a High Court judge where the limit is £10,000, very many more consumer victims could be compensated than are going to be under the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other points that I would raise in relation to the contents of the Bill but they are more appropriate to Committee Stage.  I would like to conclude by stressing again the fact that, although we are moving in the right direction in passing this legislation, and I accept that it is necessary, I do not believe that it is going to have the impact it needs to have unless at the same time a major publicity programme is engaged in by the Director of Consumer Affairs or by the Minister's office to advise the public of the dangers inherent in pyramid selling.  Despite the fact that this has been raised in the Dáil and in this House before and there have been questions asked about it in the Dáil, despite the fact that this legislation has gone through the Dáil and is now coming before us and will almost certainly be law within a week or two, I promise you that if you walk down Grafton Street or Liberty Square in Thurles or any street in the country and you stop ten people one after another and ask them if they know what pyramid selling is, the vast majority of them would not have a clue. If you put the question in that way none of them would have any idea what you were talking about.  If you said something about chain letters, unless they had immediate and bad experience of it themselves in a commercial sense, <Col N="1293" /> they would think back to chain letters that went around in their school days that were more a joke than anything else.</P>
    <P>So what is needed here is something far more than the passage of legislation. We need to give the Director of Consumer Affairs the resources to get out and to sell the message to the public that there are unscrupulous business people&mdash;I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;, they will now be unscrupulous criminals&mdash;who engage in this type of practice and who will continue to do so.  The mere making of a business practice a criminal offence is not going to stop it, and the courts will deal with people in the best way they know how but there is difficulty over enforcement. People frequently will be too embarrassed to go and report their own failing, because they feel it is a failing if they have been conned and they will feel that the amount is small enough and they will not do anything about it.  There is a problem about enforcement and the only real way to deal with this problem is to get out and educate our consumers.  It arises in far more areas than this, but this is a particularly cruel way of hitting at vulnerable people.  Perhaps the Minister has considered it already.  If he has, he may be able to tell me what plans he has to advise people of the dangers in this respect and the fact that it will now be a criminal offence to participate in these schemes.  If he has not done that I urge him and beg of him to undertake the type of programme that I have advocated to educate people.</P>

    <P>This Bill is another contribution of this administration to the development of a better consumer policy.  It does no harm at all to dwell for a moment on what Senator Molony was touching on, which was the need for the education of <Col N="1294" /> the consumer and for help in that regard. I do not think this Administration has anything to be ashamed of in this area.  I jotted down some Bills we passed: the Consumer Information Bill, 1978; Sale of Goods and Services Bill; Occasional Trading Bill; Packaged Goods and Quantity Control Bill.  They are all flowing forward and in line with the EEC commitment to the development of a proper consumer policy.  Ireland is playing its part there.</P>
    <P>Under the Treaty of Rome the EEC are committed to the development of the quality of life.  It is only natural that the consumer&mdash;drowned as he is in various new products, subjected to the abuses and frustrations that arise from increasing complexity in terms of production, new materials, new methods of promotion and so on&mdash;at the end of that chain will end up in a confused state, and legislation is needed to protect him.  This legislation has to come under a number of headings.  I want to remind the House that the EEC are using the mnemonic HIRER to draw attention to the fact that the consumer needs to be protected.  Under (H) his health has to be protected; (I) he has to be properly informed; (R) he has to have the possibility of redress; (E) his economic position should not be attacked by virtue of consumption; and (R) he has right of representation in case of appeal.  It is a neat way of thinking.  I see this Administration taking long strides and making headway.  I think Senator Molony was a little critical and should have praised the Administration a little more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about original.  It is good legislation and the Senator said so.  It goes further than similar UK legislation.  The fines are sufficient to be a deterrent and to introduce some fear into the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with a very vicious sinister form of promotion.  I agree with Senator Molony that the sooner we start talking about these people as criminals <Col N="1295" /> and not as promoters the better.  There is something good about people who promote, but criminals are different. Very often pyramid selling induces people to involve their friends and relations in these schemes.  By definition they are going to go sour.  Not only will an individual end up economically deprived but he will end up with permanent breaks or estrangements in families or relatives.  This is a particularly vicious form of selling.  Therefore, I welcome the arrival of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I did a few sums while I was waiting. If a pyramid selling operation goes through four layers, ten at a time&mdash;you involve your brother and he involves his cousin and she involves a friend and so on&mdash;you have about 100,000 consumers. If it goes through four layers where 20 individuals have to be contacted at a time, you are talking about the population of this country.  That puts it in perspective.  It is not on; it is vicious.  I welcome the Bill in the effective way it has provided legislation to obstruct this type of operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give a particularly strong welcome to this Bill.  Is mithid é.  My earliest recollection of a chain letter, which is something similar, goes back a number of years.  The activity which brought about the need for this Bill is a particularly undesirable and disreputable form of activity directed against people who are relatively innocent or one could say, ignorant in a sense.  It is necessary for the Administration to protect the members of the public against the actions of what one can only describe as very smooth operators whose only concern is to try, without engaging in any productive activity, to make money for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings normal trading activity into disrepute.  It is all the more important that the public should have confidence in the ordinary practice of business and trading, because in modern times the number of jobs being created in relation to industry is about two to one in favour of service.  It becomes very important <Col N="1296" /> in any community that the correct practice of trading should be protected against disreputable activity of this nature.  It amounts to an enticement of innocent people who do not have any experience, getting them to con their friends because they find themselves landed with goods they have agreed to buy, without realising that the whole place is flooded with those goods and they are very frequently over-valued anyway.</P>
    <P>There is a limit on how far you can go in educating people.  Generally speaking, people are so confused by what is going on around them, especially advertising, that they do not have much time to think about things that do not involve them.  It is only when they get caught out they learn.  In other words people learn the hard way.  I agree that as much publicity as possible should be given to this legislation.  In my view the penalty being introduced&mdash;in particular in relation to a person who induces people to become involved&mdash;of a possible £10,000 is fairly adequate.  It is the kind of penalty that would scare the daylights out of the sort of operator we are talking about.  The danger of being fined £10,000 should bring that sort of activity to a halt.</P>
    <P>If you ask people about any legislation that has been introduced over the last 20 years, only the odd person will know what you are talking about.  In that sense I suppose the public are depending on the Legislature to too great an extent.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome, as other Senators have, the new and novel proposal that the courts through the fine would be enabled to provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it is not new it is welcome in this case.  It will provide for a return of some of the money to people who were caught out.  One feels a great deal of sympathy for them, although in some cases through a touch of greed they may have been enticed into some operation.  If there is a recurrence &mdash;and I do not think there would be much of this&mdash;there is a possibility of unfortunate people being recouped some <Col N="1297" /> of their money.  This is a welcome measure.</P>
      <P>I must agree with Senator Molony's criticisms about the whole string of legislation we are getting at this stage. We have had this experience over the years.  This House cannot compel the other House to finish legislation earlier. We always get a bottleneck coming up to the recess.  I do not think that leaves us in a position of being a rubber stamp entirely.  I agree that it is quie difficult from the point of view of a Minister in the sense that he wants to get his legislation through and therefore would not be inclined to accept amendments, unless there is something really serious in the legislation.  Nevertheless the debates on these measures are worth having.  From experience in dealing with legislation, my conclusion is that you do not find all the possible flaws in legislation until it has been tried out for maybe five or ten years.  The debate itself will not make legislation that much more perfect. Nevertheless, it can be useful.  I fully support this Bill and welcome it from the Government side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little to say about this Bill except that it is necessary and I believe it will be effective. I have not had much personal experience of the practice of pyramid selling, but I can see how attractive such a scheme may appear when it is described as direct selling, because that implies that a participant will save money by cutting out the middleman.  I agree with the Minister's description of it as a confidence trick, because it is primarily concerned with the cash benefits to be derived from recruiting new participants into the scheme rather than with the benefits from retail sales.  Pyramid selling takes no account of the demand or the need for particular goods.  The object seems to be to attract salesmen. Therefore, it is particularly objectionable in that the promoter is not concerned that the market may be flooded with a resultant loss to the participants, certainly not to the promoter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals effectively with the <Col N="1298" /> problem, first, by making it an offence to induce a person to take part in such a scheme.  Secondly, it will be an offence to accept payment from someone who has applied to become a participant in the scheme.  Thirdly, it will be an offence to induce a person to make a payment to or for the benefit of a promoter or a participant. The Bill also provides that any agreement between a promoter and/or a participant and another person shall be null and void in so far as it provides for the payment of money.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, effectively closes loopholes in the law which allow the practice of pyramid selling to flourish.  In this Bill, which is another stepping stone in our path to effective consumer protection, the Legislature are concerned to protect the consumer from himself, from his own ignorance, from his own gullibility.  One can only do this to a limited extent, and one can only do it effectively in so far as the consumer is willing to be so protected and in so far as he is aware of what the Legislature are doing.</P>
    <P>In previous debates in the House we discussed the importance of consumer awareness, of the need for an informed and an educated consumer.  In so far as the EEC have laid down guidelines for consumer protection, they suggest that the consumer should be protected by legislation, that the consumer should be educated and informed, that the consumer's health and safety should be protected and that the consumer should be heard.  Basically the right of the consumer to be informed is the foundation of all these other rights.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask Deputy Meaney, as the Minister responsible for consumer affairs, to consider publishing a pamphlet setting out in simple layman's language the provisions of all the consumer legislation we had since the 1893 Sale of Goods Act.  The consumer is entitled to know what laws are there for his protection, and the better informed the consumer is the easier the Minister's job will be, and everybody will benefit.  I also hope that the Minister will consider including in the booklet the functions of <Col N="1299" /> the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has been keeping a remarkably low profile lately.  I am not suggesting that the director should take it upon himself to gallop around the January sales, but it is a fact that the law is being flouted.  The Consumer Information Act made the marking down of prices illegal in certain circumstances.  That law is being flouted.</P>

      <P>There is no use passing any consumer legislation unless we have the mechanism to see that it proves effective. I would also like, finally, to agree with Senator Molony's point that some legislative brake be put on doorstep sales.  It is is very difficult to get rid of a door to door salesman.  One may be very busy when he comes to the door and often the most effective way to get rid of him is simply to buy what he is selling.  It is only when one thinks about it afterwards that one finds out what one has let oneself in for.  Some legislative brake should be put on doorstep sales.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all Senators who contributed to this debate, and to thank Senator Molony for his very kind remarks.  It is good to know, as I expected, that everybody is in agreement that the sooner we get rid of pyramid selling as we know it, or used to know it, the better for the community, for the consumer and for everybody involved. As I said in my brief, it is really a con-man job.  It is a confidence trick perpetrated on the public at large, and that really is the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned&mdash;and this has to do with the rushing of legislation through the House&mdash;that the Seanad would become a rubber stamp.  Nobody would like to see that happening.  That would be very bad for democracy.  This Bill could have been here approximately three weeks ago.  We were discussing it in the Dáil; and Deputy O'Toole and <Col N="1300" /> Deputy Enright were discussing a certain amendment and I asked for time to consider it and to check up on what I was saying.  I did not believe in shooting it down if it had merit.  We went back to the draftsmen and I got legal advice on it.  We were not able to get into the Dáil again until yesterday evening.  I was quite happy that the Bill covered all aspects, but Deputy O'Toole was not as happy about it.  We had a discussion on it.  Not to be wasting time, I asked him if he would he be happier by having the word &ldquo;attempt&rdquo; inserted.  He said he would, so we included it.  That had to be drafted into the Bill and that caused a certain delay this morning.  I regret that very much, but I was in a hurry to bring the Bill through.  I regret that it was not here for the past three weeks.  I also regret that Senators did not have an adequate opportunity to study the Bill.</P>
    <P>I share Senators' views on drafting.  It was a hard and difficult Bill to draft because it is not that easy to define pyramid selling and introduce legislation that will stay within the Constitution and within the constitutional rights of certain firms and so on.  Pyramid selling was more in vogue approximately eight years ago than it is today; approximately seven to eight years ago legislation was first suggested.  When the news got out that legislation was to be brought in there was evidence of an immediate downturn in the activities of the people involved in pyramid selling at that time.  It was hard to bring in this legislation.  Other business came up and it was put aside.  It did not raise its ugly head for many a day again.</P>
    <P>About three years ago, approximately, there was a slight increase in the incidence of pyramid selling.  Today it is not very much in evidence.  I do not want to confuse pyramid selling with selling at house parties in the different parts of the country.  They are two different matters altogether.  Sometimes people are inclined to confuse them but there is really no relation between them at all.  That is not what is known as pyramid selling in my part of the country.  The Senators know what I am talking about.  At cersumer' <Col N="1301" /> tain house parties certain goods are sold. As I said when I introduced this Bill&mdash;and everybody knows it&mdash; pyramid selling is inducing and recruiting participants.  It has nothing to do with the quality of goods, the amount of goods being sold, what was marketed, what was happening in certain areas and so on.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill will do more than inhibit pyramid selling.  It will outlaw the entry fees required of new participants.  Without the prospect of such payments, the profitable element from the promoter's point of view is removed.  That is when it inhibits.  The entry fee was required, and this was the profit for the promoter.  Some Senators also discussed compensation.  I am advised&mdash;and I accept that advice&mdash;that a more open provision for paying compensation out of fines, that is, covering convictions on indictment, was undesirable because a jury might well be swayed by the compensation question rather than the offence proper.  It was feared that convictions would in some cases be set aside on appeal because the proper conduct at trials had been significantly obstructed or otherwise affected to the detriment of the due administration of criminal justice, which must in Ireland be regarded as incorporating the constitutional principles concerning fairness of judicial procedures.  For the same reason the Consumer Information Act 1978 provides the compensation only from fines imposed on summary conviction. I thought I should mention that matter as well.</P>
    <P>There were other matters referred to. Pyramid selling is an activity which has received wide publicity.  I would not be as pessimistic as some people about the consumer awareness of pyramid selling. I agree, however, that there is need to bring the message home to the consumer. Apart from any educational role to be exercised by the director, I shall endeavour to ensure that enactment of this measure is accompanied by adequate publicity.  If I may pass a remark at this moment.  Already on radio one day a person who was deeply involved in consumer <Col N="1302" /> affairs mentioned that this Bill was going through the Oireachtas, without anybody asking him.  I was very grateful for that.  The same gentleman, who is well known on television, mentioned on another occasion in the past that he hoped some day it would be done away with.  He took the opportunity, without being asked, to let the public know it was about to come to an end.  I liked that very much.  I think that was a very good turn and a desirable way to put across to the housewives, who are the consumer, how their business should be conducted.</P>
    <P>People were talking about contracts with door to door salesmen, contracts outside the place of business and so on. Senator Molony draw attention to contracts outside the place of business.  As far as I am aware, there are proposals coming to hand to deal with those matters, to regularise them and to protect the consumer.  This will cover the door to door seller who barges in on you when you are in the middle of getting a dinner, or maybe bathing children, or one thing or another.  You are completely flustered and buy something on the spur of the moment.  This will create a cooling off period.  These could also be covered by EEC proposals.  We have many EEC proposals coming through for consumer protection, and I hope to bring some more within the next twelve months.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy really struck the nail on the head when he described how many people could become involved in a very short time.  Also Senators Brugha and Cassidy mentioned some of the more undesirable elements in pyramid selling, which we are now getting rid of. There are proposals that the director should publish pamphlets outlining provisions on consumer legislation.  I shall look into this question of getting the director to publish information about this measure by way of pamphlets or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Subsection 4(2) which provides for the return of payments to participants in certain cases and certain conditions, seems to provide for a situation that should only be regarded as needing interference for a transition period rather than something that will always require attention.  Perhaps the Minister could explain precisely what is intended, or the circumstances intended in subsection (2), because it seems to be more appropriate to a transition problem rather than a problem in the long term. Just to clarify the position: it provides for compensation for one of the parties where the value of the goods has deteriorated while in the participant's hands.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about making this a criminal offence, we should not be out to compensate people who insist, in the future, in participating and promoting such schemes.  The recipient, if I understand the definition correctly, is either the original promoter or the person who promotes next to the participant himself. He is the person who received the money, he has handed on goods for it. He is participating in an illegal activity. This section proposes to enable the money to be paid back and the goods to be returned, but where the goods have deteriorated the promoter should be compensated.  It is completely against public policy that such a person who is insisting on engaging in criminal activity should be compensated in this way.  I would ask that it be removed.  Maybe I misunderstand the purpose of it.</P>

      <P>The Senator is referring to section 4(2).  It would be contrary to natural justice, regardless of the <Col N="1304" />&ldquo;desirable elements and the undesirable people&rdquo; we mentioned, to expect repayment in full if the goods or articles being returned are damaged because of negligence of the person looking for the refund.  There is no provision in the Bill for deciding how much should be deducted for damages.  That is another awkward point.  It is left for agreement between the promoter and the participant in the first instance, and it is open to them to let a court decide any issue. This is the beginning.  A participant is alive, goods are another matter.  I can see the point the Senator is raising and appreciate his anxiety to punish anyone involved in it, that not alone should they be fined but they should also pay through the nose as regards the goods.  I wonder if such a clause would hold up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>When the President signs the Bill it becomes law.  In those circumstances someone who was engaged in this practice may say he will give you back the money if the goods are returned.  That is fair enough but if the goods have been damaged through the fault of the participant he should pay compensation to the promoter.  What we are talking about is a transitional problem.  Take the situation which may develop in five years time where a promoter, despite the fact that it is a criminal offence, persists in engaging in this criminal activity.  It now appears he is to be compensated.  That is completely against public policy and it astonishes me that we should enact such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that Senators will not misunderstand my concern about this, if somebody strikes a bet with a bookmaker he cannot use the courts to recover if the bookmaker decides not to honour his obligation because we do not regard that as a type of activity that should be protected by law.  The law of contract which determines that particular matter is clear in this respect.  I have always disagreed with the view, I think it is wrong, but nevertheless that is the way it is.  For example, a man who uses girls and lives on their immoral earnings cannot go to court to recover money that one of them has kept, as he would see it wrongfully, <Col N="1305" /> from him as it is against public policy that that type of activity should be condoned in any way.  There are several analogies and several examples in the law that stand on this type of subject. Here, we are not only saying that the contract is not recognised by law; it is actually a criminal activity.  Yet, we are setting up our courts system to assist such a person.  I think it is outrageous and it should be removed from the Bill.  I certainly want to table an amendment to remove that section from the Bill and I ask for time to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take it at the first stage.  People decide to start off this chain of pyramid selling.  They go along with, let us say, cosmetics and they present the cosmetics to the first layer of people.  Of the ten people who are retained or participate in the scheme let us say that two of them, through their own neglect or otherwise, damage the goods.  The promoter of this has engaged in criminal activity.  His contract is illegal and the Bill provides, if I understand section 4, for redemption to the participant, the person who was &ldquo;conned&rdquo; into this. He goes back and says, &ldquo;I am giving you back the goods and I want my money back&rdquo;.  He wants to get out of the situation. The law will actually facilitate the <Col N="1306" /> promoter in giving him a cause of action against the participant.  I think that goods belonging to a promoter engaged in this type of activity should be confiscated. The Bill does not do that and I will ask that it go that far but I object that the administration of justice, the system that we have in Ireland that is already without sufficient resources to fulfil the reasonable and legitimate demands of the public, should be used to recover the illgotten gains and assets of a criminal.  That is exactly what this subsection is doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there are circumstances in which it could be done.  I will give the Minister an example.  If a person engages in, let us say, spear fishing and uses his car for the purpose, his licence can be taken from him.  That is an example.  The confiscation of property is quite a different thing although I do not think it would be a bad thing if property used in the commission of a crime like this were confiscated.  I am not asking that we go that far but I am objecting to the fact that our courts system can be used by a criminal to recover property which he has given away in the commission of a criminal offence. That is exactly what we are doing and it is wrong.  I would urge the Minister that at least the matter be postponed and that we be given time to consider this most serious departure from everything that is known to the law and the application of public policy to the law.  I ask the Minister that this matter be left over until tomorrow, that we be given time to consider it.  We have had very few people in the House today to deal with this matter.  I certainly was not aware of this until I got this Bill this afternoon. I am extremely concerned about it; it is against public policy and it is just the type of example that I was referring to earlier when I said that rushing legislation through the House is most undesirable.  I would ask the Minister to give this matter time for reflection.</P>

It is just like the pimp who cannot use the court system to recover money from a prostitute; just as the person who has a bet with the bookmaker cannot use the court system to recover <Col N="1308" /> money from a bookmaker.  That is a very innocent activity and is recognised as legal.  I am sure there are Members of this House who go to race meetings and strike bets.  The person who has a bet on a horse cannot use our court system but the criminal can do so under this legislation. It is highly objectionable and I would ask the Minister to give us time to reflect on this.</P>

Will he not accept that there is a principle in common law going back a long time that where it is against public policy to allow somebody to use the courts the courts have the right to refuse a person access to justice in those circumstances?  Here the courts will have no such right because it is a statutory right that is given to the criminal.</P>

The precedent that I want to use is the principle of common law that the courts cannot be used where it is against public policy that the courts should be used.  That is the base of my argument. Let us just compare what is just and what is not just.  The criminal is entitled to justice.  Even under the Gaming Acts, is it wrong if it stops a bettor from suing a bookmaker?  If the legislature decided that as a matter of policy he should not be allowed access to the courts, who has got the better case to recover money through the courts&mdash;the bettor with a defaulting bookmaker or the convicted <Col N="1309" /> criminal under this legislation?

It is essential that the Bill be seen to be fair because at the end of the day we will have to deal with real situations, with fairs and markets and agricultural produce.  People will be on the borderline of being charged and we need the courts to decide what is fair and what is not fair.  We will have to say to the public that this is a fair Bill and that it is in the interests of the general public.  I think that the best way to prove that beyond doubt is that any man who is charged and who has committed an offence has access to the courts and that the courts will decide.</P>

      <P>Senator Molony in his brilliant discourse stated that a person who lays a bet cannot bring an action against a defaulting bookmaker and he gave that instance in support of his argument. If a betting man cannot bring a case against a defaulting bookmaker to my mind more is the pity.  I do not think justice is being done there.  It would appear to me that in this Bill the section under discussion is making an effort to see that justice will be done, and for that reason we should accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not advert to the problem raised by Senator Brugha.  It is just a difficulty we have when we are trying to disgorge legislation a rate of knots that we should not tolerate.  There is a <Col N="1310" /> better solution to the problem.  There should be a provision in this legislation to enable the court that is charged with the issue of the criminality of the matter to have the power to confiscate the property and dispose of it as it thinks proper, considering who has the right of ownership and dealing with it in that way.  That would be just and it would certainly deal with the situation where a party has the property but where they have a commitment on it, either having bought it or having committed themselves to passing it on to somebody else. That would deal with the situation.  What we are doing here is different.  We are creating a separate civil action for the criminal to pursue a separate action in court.  That is quite a different thing.</P>
      <P>This legislation is legislation that we were given this afternoon.  I accept it is not the Minister's fault, that there were delays in the Dáil.  I accept that the system that allows this to happen is wrong.  I have raised a point which I think has merit in it.  I accept that there are difficulties involved, and that to create just legislation and legislation that will work&mdash;I accept Senator McGowan's point on this&mdash;it must be seen to be fair.  This is a new departure that is contrary to our existing policy, that runs against precedents that exist for years not only in statute law but in common law.  The section should be looked at again with a view to its repeal altogether, or certainly its removal, and the provision of some other section in the Bill providing for disposal of property and giving the court that deals with the criminal aspect of it the right to determine rights of ownership.  I accept that we are disagreeing on this point.</P>

      <P>No.  It is not unfair.  Let us consider exactly what we are doing.  I am asking for an opportunity, for time to prepare an amendment.  I accept there are needs on all sides.  I accept the points that Senators Brugha and McGowan made.  I believe that that subsection is offensive to public policy and is a new departure in terms of our law, both <Col N="1314" /> statutory law and common law.  I am asking for time.  This House sits for three days next week.  I am asking for time to consider an amendment, to draft it and to have it circulated.  I am reducing this whole point to that one issue at this stage.</P>

      <P>I must be adamant on this.  It was my reasonable approach to a spokesman of the Senator's party that was the reason for this Bill being three weeks late in coming here.  I want to be quite clear on this.  I am not rushing this legislation through at all.  There are certain matters that we have considered in the Department.  The Senator has made his points very forcibly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I want to support my colleague by regretting that the Minister should state that he will not accept an amendment which might mean waiting until next November.  In so far as the Order of Business in this House is concerned the fact is that for a very considerable length we have had very little legislation in the form of Bills coming from Dáil Éireann.  We are now being forced in two, three or four days to go through a flood of legislation and apparently amendments will not be accepted because that might necessitate the Government waiting until November.  It is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Molony's comments and his very able exposition of his views on this matter.  Perhaps we all would like further time for discussion but we do not share his views on this Bill on this side of the House.  The matter of pyramid selling is of very considerable public concern.  We have had a full discussion on the matter. If it is held up now it is a question of <Col N="1315" /> holding it up at least until the autumn. Although one would like to facilitate the Senator it does not seem to be very practicable or feasible to do so, even though one appreciates greatly the comments and points that he has so ably made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise one point, because I do not want to be misunderstood. I have objected to subsection (2) of section 4 but it is not simply a question of that.  People from all sides of the House recognise that a problem existed. I want the opportunity to draft an amendment, and that is being denied me. It is unfair.  I am reluctant to use the word but it displays an arrogance on the part of the Minister and I am surprised and disappointed to experience it.  There are Members of this House who were not here for our discussions, who were engaged in other business.  I am asking for an opportunity to get time to draft an amendment and have it circulated so that the point I have made can be considered. That is all I am asking&mdash;no more.  The Minister may say that our colleagues in the Dáil delayed the matter for three weeks because they sought amendments.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is their right and their duty, and is what we are being denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister facilitated the Dáil for three weeks.  Will he facilitate us for 24 hours?  In fairness, in order to give me time to draft an amendment I would ask that this matter be postponed until next week but if the Minister, unreasonably, refuses that request I ask him at least for tomorrow, even though that will not be adequate for me to draft the type of amendment that I need to get over the problem and meet the requirements of fairness mentioned by several members of his own party. What the Minister is saying at the moment is this: he believes subsection (2) deals with everything.  I say no.  I want the opportunity to prepare an amendment, draft it and circulate it.  He is denying <Col N="1316" /> me that opportunity and he knows that he is denying me that opportunity.  It is wrong and unfair of him.  I propose voting on that.  It is not just that I object to subsection (2) but is also because I am being denied an opportunity to table an amendment.  I feel that the privilege I have of being a Member of this House is being flouted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the example of a person taken to court, prosecuted under our new legislation and not convicted. I put forward the case where there were still goods in question between two people, between A and B and where B wanted to recoup the goods.  As the court decided there was not a criminal offence they have the right to go to court.  We are saying that if there was damage by the party who was supposed to have committed an offence that should be considered and taken into account. There does not have to be a conviction. That is the point I want to make very strongly.</P>

They would have the right to sue on the return of goods if <Col N="1317" /> there was damage done to them.  That law exists already.

      <P>That point has just occurred to the Minister.  It is the last shot up the sleeve and it has not impressed me.  The point the Minister makes does not advance his cause one iota because the law of bailment deals with it.  Perhaps the Minister is not familiar with the law of bailment, but it deals with it.  I would ask the Minister to allow me time to draft the amendment which I have sought time to draft.  The minimum amount of time will do me.</P>

He admits it was first issued in January of this year.  All Senator Molony is asking for is time to circulate an amendment which can be debated here next Tuesday if the Government agree to it.

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>On subsection (4), the compensatory fine or the piggy-back claim, I made the point that I felt it could possibly also be employed in the event of a conviction on indictment.  If I heard the Minister correctly he said the danger was that the jury might be over-influenced by the compensation question. I wonder whether that could possibly be the case.  I would have thought that this subsection, and the consideration of a compensatory fine, would arise on sentencing, in other words, on the fixing of a fine.  Of course, that is not a matter which concerns the <Col N="1321" /> jury at all.  It is entirely within the jurisdiction of the judge's functions.  I want to stress that it has nothing at all, good, bad or indifferent, to do with the jury.  Perhaps again, for that reason, the Minister might consider deferring the Report Stage of the Bill and if there is any merit in that point we can consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is discussing subsection (4).  Is that right?  It provides for several things really.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that the compensatory fine is limited to where a conviction occurs either in the District Court or on appeal to the Circuit Court but, certainly, where the matter is dealt with on a summary basis.  I say where there is a conviction on indictment, it would be desirable to have it.  The Minister says the objection to that is because of the fact that a jury might be involved and they would possibly be over-influenced by the question of compensation. My response to that is that surely this whole question of a fine is not a matter for the jury at all.  The accused is convicted and consideration of the sentence or the amount of the fine is exclusively a matter for the judge and has nothing to do with the jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not.  I do not see what that has to do with enabling the court to include in its fine an amount to compensate the victim.  The jury would know absolutely nothing about that.  It would not be discussed at all.  All that is being discussed in the jury's presence are the facts which would show that the accused had committed a criminal offence. On the conviction of that person, the court in deciding the amount of the fine it should impose, can consider using part of that fine, so to speak, to compensate the victim.  That is a matter for the judge. It would never arise in the presence of a jury at all.</P>

They feel sorry for me, of course.  Why would they not?  If it were possible for the judge afterwards to say when he was sentencing the person convicted, &ldquo;I would consider taking a certain course in relation to this matter if I understood you were to compensate the person from whom you stole the car,&rdquo; I do not think the jury would be influenced.  If, on the other hand, in this type of situation where a person is charged with promoting pyramid selling and is convicted in the eyes of the jury, the jury, of course, will feel sorry for the victim, but how will that affect the question of compensation, of using part of the fine as compensation?

      <P>Where a district justice imposes a fine of £500 he is given the power, under this section, to give £300 of the £500 to somebody who is conned out of £300.  This right is not being given to a Circuit Court judge or a High Court judge.  The amount involved here is £10,000.  They can impose a fine of £10,000.  If somebody has suffered damage to the extent of a couple of thousand pounds and the judge decides to impose <Col N="1324" /> a fine of £5,000, he simply orders that £2,000 be paid out to the victim of the damage.  For the life of me I do not see what the presence of a jury has to do with that.  That has nothing at all to do with humanity.  I am sure juries are very human and have great humanity in considering these matters but, with every respect to the Minister, what he has said to me is utterly irrelevant.  The jury will consider the facts of the case as presented to them.  They will decide either to acquit or convict.  If they convict the jury retire.  Their job being done they leave and the judge may then decide to apportion part of the fine as compensation for the victim.  That has nothing to do with the jury.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions in the past when dealing with similar sections in other legislation I referred to offences in relation to bodies corporate.  A servant, an agent, a director, or any person who is associated with a corporate body, through his mere neglect, may find himself guilty of a serious criminal offence. The section is in the form used by the Government down through the years.  It would be fairer to everyone concerned to insert the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; before &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;.  A director who merely failed to read his minutes, and thereby became associated with the commission of a crime, may be unfairly convicted merely as a result of failing to do something.  The neglect should be pitched at a different level, a higher level, and it should have to be wilful neglect rather than mere neglect.  Perhaps the Minister might like to consider that between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the words &ldquo;neglect on the part of the director or responsible officer&rdquo;, is to ensure that if his neglect is the real cause of the offence, he also should be liable.  That is quite acceptable.  With regard to the words &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;, somebody once said nothing was a sin if you did not take enjoyment out of it.  If an ordinary person has an unlicensed television set that is an offence.  It could not be proved that it was because of his wilful neglect that he had not got the licence.  It is enough that he neglected to take out a licence.  I see no point in changing section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means by his reference to nothing being a sin unless you take pleasure in it.  I do not understand that reference.  The points he makes about the person who fails to get a television licence is quite a different matter.  You are dealing in that case with the principal, the person himself.  If you talked about the lodger in the owner's house and the owner had failed to get a television licence that person, perhaps through neglect, would be capable of being deemed to have committed a criminal offence, but the law is not designed that way.  The law the Minister is referring to refers to the principal, the owner of the television set.</P>
      <P>I am talking here not about a principal, but about a servant, or agent, or somebody who is merely associated with a company that engages, in this instance, in pyramid selling.  A director of the board of that company may have failed to read a minute in which it was proposed to promote pyramid selling. The fact that he does not read the minute is nothing more or less than neglect.  Had he read the minute and decided to go ahead, that would be different.  It would be wilful neglect.  He did not pursue it. He did not say it was wrong.  I think this is unjust.  I know that for years and years the establishment have used this hallowed device to cover offences in relation to bodies corporate.  I do not really expect any change in it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is common. The purpose of the words &ldquo;attributable <Col N="1327" /> to any neglect&rdquo; on the part of a director or responsible officer is to ensure that where his neglect is the real cause of the offence he also should be liable.</P>
      <P>The subsection is in common form. The provision occurs, for example, in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970, section 8, the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, section 22, and the Consumer Information Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>Many other statutes have in fact gone further in imposing criminal liability on directors and others.  They go so far as to impose liability where the offence was merely &ldquo;facilitated&rdquo; by neglect.  Examples are the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, section 6, the Auctioneers and Estate Agents Act, 1973, section 25, and the Employment Premium Act, 1975, section 7, and the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.  It has, however, been accepted that such a provision goes too far and that formula is no longer followed.</P>
      <P>I have to concede to the Senator that there are precedents for inserting &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; before &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;.  They occur always in the context of the phrase &ldquo;facilitated by&rdquo; evidently as a concession intended to mitigate the severity of that provision, a provision which, as I have said, has now been dropped.  I am, however, advised that the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is tautological in this context.</P>
      <P>Neglect or negligence is in law a breach of a duty to take care, and where that breach of duty is the real cause of an offence primarily committed by the company or firm it is proper that the director or officer who caused it should also be liable.  It is a matter for the court to determine the degree of his culpability and the extent of the penalty which should be imposed upon him.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the Senator's views.</P>

I already had cause to use the word arrogant, and I regret to use it but I have to use it, and if he insists on this measure going through now his action is nothing else but arrogant.  I have made a reasonable case.  I accept that there were differences on it.

      <P>I add my voice to that of Senator Molony.  Senators will excuse me for not following the substantial point that is in issue because I was at a meeting of a Joint Committee during most of the time of the debate so I cannot express any opinion on the matter except to note what Senator Molony said in an eloquent way.  He is very learned in his and my profession, and his opinion should be heard with very great respect. It is a matter for the agreement of the House as to when to have the next stage. Senator Molony suggested Tuesday.  If that is agreeable to the Leader of the House, it would give Senator Molony appropriate time to draft an amendment to a Bill which is in other respects entirely welcome, indeed overdue, but which contains a provision to which he takes great exception, and in respect of which he will propose an amendment to the House at Report Stage.  I urge Senators opposite to continue the excellent feelings that there are between all Members of this House and to agree to give this side of the House time to do their duty and to allow the Seanad do its duty to see that the legislation which comes to it is properly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Senators' attention to the fact that in Dáil Éireann it was noted by Deputies on the Government side that this type of crime has been going on for a very long time, since the sixties. Deputies on the Government side of the House claim to have been the first to have drawn the Government's attention to this in the sixties and have been pressing for legislation since then.  The Second Reading of the Bill was given in Dáil Éireann on 22 May, approximately a month ago.  It comes to us accompanied by other Bills.  It is an important matter which affects the status of people and their rights.  Senator Molony has made points that are substantial and serious with regard to one subsection of a section and is prepared to draft something which would meet it.  The Minister's draftsman would no doubt be able to advise him as to the quality of the proposal from Senator Molony. Goodwill should maintain the business of the House and we should not, simply <Col N="1330" /> because we are coping with a lot of other business, say it might have come to us before now, that everything that we do here is absolutely pointless.  We know perfectly well that if the Bill is enacted, if damage is done by this subsection, we will not be able to restore that damage, people will be injured by it.  We know the public business is such that an amending Bill will be delayed as this Bill was, if Senator Molony is proved right in his view of what the subsection means.  I urge the Senators opposite to agree to a reasonable period.  I do not remember an occasion&mdash;there may have been one in my 11 years here, but I do not remember it&mdash;when stages have been forced through in the teeth of opposition.  They have been rare enough for me to have forgotten them, which is an odd way of putting it, but it is normal to have these matters agreed, and I press for that agreement.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.</P>
      <P>The amount which could be made available to them out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas when Córas Tráchtála was first set up under the Export Promotions Act, 1959, was limited to £1 million.  This statutory limit was raised by subsequent Export Promotions Acts, the most recent being that of 1977 which raised it to £45 million.  The Bill under consideration at present proposes to raise the limit to £90 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have made a most valuable contribution to the development of Irish exports which, in the period 1959-79, have risen from £130 million to £3,498 million.  I am sure that no one in this House will need to be convinced of the excellent return to the Irish economy which moneys made available to Córas Tráchtála have provided.  Senators are well aware of the importance of the board's task, the efficiency of their operations and their adaptibility in <Col N="1332" /> meeting the developing and changing needs of our exporters.</P>
    <P>As industrial activity accelerated over the years, Córas Tráchtála's operations were extended to provide exporters with the more sophisticated aids and services they needed in changing market conditions, to assist them in opening up new markets and consolidating their position in existing ones.  The board's present regime of aids and services is extensive, ranging from information, advice and basic market research to specialist services in the field of market research and from incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets to the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  All these services are kept under constant review to ensure that they support adequately the changing needs of our exporters.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, total exports during 1979 rose to £3,498 million which represents a value increase of 18.2 per cent over the previous year.  Córas Tráchtála are confident that 1980 will feature another solid export performance. The statistics available so far in relation to this year bear out this expectation.</P>
    <P>In the period January to end-April 1980 total exports were valued at £1,289.1 million, an increase of 28.2 per cent over the same period in 1979.  The main increases came from manufactured goods, excluding food, drink and tobacco&mdash;30.2 per cent, food, drink and tobacco, 22.3 per cent, live animals, 38.4 per cent and raw materials and fuels, 31.1 per cent.  In this period, exports to the UK amounted to £567.8 million or 44 per cent of the total.  After the UK, the continental countries of the EEC bought the largest proportion of Irish exports during the four months concerned&mdash;£427.1 million, 33.1 per cent, while North America accounted for £80.6 million, 6.3 per cent, EFTA for £49.9 million, 3.9 per cent, and all other markets for £163.7 million, 12.7 per cent.  This reflects the continuance of the gradual change in the geographical distribution of our exports since our accession to the European Economic Community, <Col N="1333" /> resulting in a considerable lessening in our dependence on the UK market&mdash;which, in 1974, took 56 per cent of our exports&mdash;although, of course, the UK still remains our most important customer.</P>
    <P>Export expansion on such a scale in the first four months of the current year augurs well for the future and, in my view, vindicates Córas Tráchtála's confidence in our export performance for 1980.  The net result is likely to be a value increase in the year's total exports of about 20 per cent&mdash;despite a world recession involving a poorer performance by most of the major industrialised economies than last year.</P>
    <P>The overseas office network which Córas Tráchtála maintain is an invaluable source of support to our exporters. They now have 22 overseas offices, in 19 countries and all five Continents. They are particularly alert to the requirements of Irish exporters to the EEC which, in the free trade situation, is, of course, our largest potential market. Through their offices in the EEC member states, Córas Tráchtála keep in close touch with developments, and are well equipped to furnish exporters with expert advice and market intelligence in this vital area for our trade.</P>
    <P>The expansion of Córas Tráchtála's export promotion activities over the years has inevitably resulted in increases in the board's rate of expenditure.  Payments to the board by way of grant-in-aid up to 31 December 1979 amounted to £37,956,885 which leaves a balance of £7,043,115 unissued from the existing limit of £45 million.  This balance is insufficient to meet the board's financial requirements up to the end of the present year in respect of which a sum of £7.98 million will be needed.  The present Bill is, therefore, designed to relieve the statutory constraint involved and to make provision for a reasonable period ahead.</P>
    <P>The House is, no doubt, already aware of the expansion and improvement in Córas Tráchtála's services for 1980 as set out in their export promotion programme for 1980.  It will be appreciated, <Col N="1334" /> however, that the cost to Córas Tráchtála of maintaining existing services and providing new ones is susceptible to the same inflationary pressures as any other costs.  In these circumstances, I am sure that Senators will agree that Córas Tráchtála should have adequate funds at their disposal to provide the vital services to our exporters on which the development of our exports depends so much.  With this in mind, I confidently recommend the increase&mdash;by an additional £45 million&mdash;of the statutory limit on the grants which may be allocated to Córas Tráchtála, to enable that organisation to pursue their vital role in the promotion and development of our exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is obviously non-controversial.  It relates to the activities of CTT and their need for legislative sanction so that the increased funds which they need from time to time can be agreed by this House and in that there is a consensus and we accept the Bill which the Minister has introduced. He will have our support on it.</P>
      <P>There are certain aspects concerning the export position which need to be commented on.  I note that the Minister quotes the statistics of exports from this country from the period January to April this year, total exports valued at £1,289 million, an increase of 28.2 per cent over the same period for 1979. There are problems here.  The Minister mentions the increase in terms of money value but not in terms of volume.  In an age of inflation running at a rate of 20 per cent and Córas Tráchtála in their own report referred to volume increase as well as monetary increase, it is salutary to include the volume increase because the money in itself is not a very realistic barometer of the volume of exports from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another flaw in that the Minister in quoting statistics and quoting a percentage&mdash;the £1,289 million from January to the end of April, an increase of 28.2 per cent, was helpful to him&mdash;did not give the up to date information. The Central Statistics Office <Col N="1335" /> have available to the general public statistics for May of this year.  I am not holding the Minister personally accountable&mdash;he is being briefed&mdash;but I wonder why the Minister's speech does not include May statistics which are alarming. Exports from this country for May run at about £334,500,000.  They are alarming because from year to year and month to month there are increases in the value of exports if one is to take any account of inflation, and as an exporting nation that is our lifeline.  To compare months in 1979 and 1980 and the increase in export sales, for January this year compared to last year, they were up £71 million; February, up £66 million, March, up £72 million, April was up £76 million but May is only up £17 million.  There is an alarming downturn in exports in relative terms in that the export statistics for the month of May at £334 million in money terms show an absolutely static position since February this year.  In this age of inflation when exports are vital&mdash;and exports imply jobs&mdash;this downturn is alarming and note should be taken of it.  I regret that the Minister's statistics did not relate to that.  The increase from January to the end of April in terms even of money values was 28.2 per cent.  If, which would be more realistic in the debate this evening, the figures were taken as from January to May as against last year, there was a drop of about 6 per cent in the increased level.  The trend is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one other comment about CTT, not necessarily in criticism but to put certain matters into perspective.  The fact that CTT are the arm of Government in the export promotion field does not necessarily mean that they can assume responsibility for all the exports from this country.  When we talk of the statistics in a debate on CTT there is a tendency to relate credit to them for their performance.  Of course we can give them considerable credit for the work which they are doing in that field to which I have been a witness both in this country and outside.  They have done a <Col N="1336" /> tremendously valuable job for this country over a large number of years, but at the same time their involvement in exports of live animals, for example, is minimal.  In so far as industrial exports are concerned, we have very many sophisticated multi-national manufacturing companies performing in this country at present who already have sales outlets, market analyses and corporate headquarters in various places around the world who use the services available to a minimal extent.  However, that is not taking away credit from CTT for the work which they have been doing.</P>
    <P>I note that they have been tremendously helpful to the medium and small manufacturers and have been a very useful arm of Government in this country in the work which they have been doing. I do not want to be unduly critical because of the fine work they have been doing, but I find it a little unsatisfactory that when we are discussing the question of funding CTT&mdash;and the amount of money involved is fairly substantial&mdash;the last published accounts which are available to the House are the accounts for 1978 and we are practically into July 1980.  They are not isolated in this and many other semi-State bodies are a little bit slow in arranging publication. The 1978 reports were published around September of last year so on a <i>pro rata</i> basis we have another two or three months to wait, although I gather there is a possibility they may be available at the end of July.  It seems to me that, for a year which ended December last, with a bit of a push the reports should be available to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the general public by the end of April.  Discussing these events in the absence of even last year's report in the latter days of June in the following year is not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>This staggering downturn in growth is going to have a downstream effect throughout the country.  In the foreword to the last CTT report which was published they state that even then&mdash;1978 which was a satisfactory year&mdash;in relative terms 1978 had volume growth over 1977 of 17.5 per cent but in <Col N="1337" /> 1977 it was much higher.  For example, the growth rate in volume terms in 1977 over 1976 was about 35 per cent.  The 1978 performance at 17.5 per cent in money terms was a proportionate rate of about half in the last published year. These report statistics are fairly alarming. This is hitting very much at what we are all trying to achieve in this country in creating more jobs and getting us out of the present recession and depression. CTT themselves recognise this in their 1978 report when they say that even reflecting on what they considered to be a good year, 1978, they took the view that the growth rate would need to be more than 50 per cent higher in each successive year if the Government's job creation and maintenance aim is to be achieved.  We are speaking about this Bill in a period of extreme difficulty in world conditions and in export markets.  We are with the Minister on the Bill; we recognise in broad terms the work CTT have been doing and we wish them success in these very difficult times.</P>

      <P>Córas Tráchtála have been one of our great success stories and in relation to the expenditure upon them, the actual benefits and returns are extremely high.  This is very much borne out in the figures which we see here.  This very excellent organisation are the envy of many other countries and are, I understand, being copied by quite a few other countries.  At times, perhaps, we fail to realise the enormous support which is given to our trading partners, who are also our trading competitors, by their embassies.  We are inclined to think in terms of the embassy of the United Kingdom, the embassy of France, the embassies of the various other western European and other nations, in purely political terms and not to realise that a very substantial part of their staff, even a majority, take a trade role over and beyond the normal support given by the proper diplomatic staff of the ambassador and other members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this country are very fortunate in our own diplomatic service, but it is necessarily very limited.  Its very small size means that it has to concentrate <Col N="1338" /> basically on political matters.  In this respect we are at an enormous disadvantage, which often is not realised.  It is excellent that this extremely efficient, small and effective body, Córas Tráchtála, are able to fill this role in a way which quite clearly is getting support on both sides of the House and from industry and the people at large.  I am very happy to support them.  I have had some personal experiences of their tremendous efficiency and help and it is a real pleasure to see the excellent progress that they are making. There are many comments which one would like to discuss in relation to exports generally but perhaps we will come to those on some other occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister will, at this stage, be able to help me with any answers to these questions.  I need not put them in the form of questions so as to embarrass him if he did not have the information available.  I have been considering what effect on our export trade to the United Kingdom the strengthened sterling has been having.  One reads all about the UK recession and so on, but the purchasing power internationally of sterling has obviously been increasing since we joined the EMS.  There are reasons for that which have not much to do with the trading position of the UK.  Perhaps at some other time the Minister could tell us what, for example, has been the movement in the proportion of exports to the UK since we joined the EMS.  Has there been any sign of a change in the general trend towards an increase in our exports to the continental EEC?  It will be interesting to know whether that has been accelerating or what has been happening to it.  I do not want to be stinting in my praise of CTT and I join in what everyone else has said about them, but we should always try to find out what the realities are.  How much of our increased exports are related to the captive markets of new industries that have been coming on stream?  How much of CTT's work is due to that and how much is a consequence of IDA attraction of new industry?  The IDA have their own way of selling what they produce.  It would be <Col N="1339" /> useful for the formulation of public policy to know these things.</P>
      <P>The third point which has occurred to me with regard to, for example, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, is that both bodies give services that benefit people who make money. Concentrating on that but having regard to getting our exports up and so on, at certain points it may be possible to begin to charge people for their services.  Is there any process in operation in CTT whereby they can collect fees for any of their services?  Can they sell their services to people who are getting benefits from them?  Public money is in question and I imagine that has been looked at.  I think they call it grants-in-aid when they are talking about the public purse but I would not mind hearing that CTT had got a contract whereby they were making £1 million out of telling somebody what to do with his goods.</P>
      <P>The fourth question arises out of sheer ignorance.  Do CTT concern themselves at all about the export of services as distinct from the export of goods?  EEC requirements obviously require the Government to drop the export sales relief in relation to services, but there would not seem to be any EEC requirement preventing CTT from stepping in there to do what they could about making new business for services of every kind.  Looking at Senator Conroy I would think immediately of educational services and there are other things of that kind which we could be selling in this beastly world to the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one or two comments.  I welcome the Bill and I join with my fellow Senators in praising CTT for the work that they do. I take Senator Staunton's point that it is not CTT who do the exporting, it is the firms.  That does not take from the fact that CTT do a very fine job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will draw the attention of the House to another measure of how effective our export drive is.  We have been capturing a larger share of world trade each year. <Col N="1340" /> Our market share has gone from something like .36 per cent to something over .4 per cent.  Those figures are not dead right but they are of that order. Even though it is a small amount it is good to see that our export services are expanding at a rate that means that we are capturing more of the world's trade. At the moment and in the immediate future world trade is going to be very tight.  It is still expanding but not at an accelerating rate.  If our exports manage to maintain the drive they had now that world trade is tougher, then the performance is all the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I had a pet scheme that we discussed before he went into office. It was a conviction that what is important is to see more and more Irishmen and Irishwomen as sales executives working abroad pushing Irish products.  If we cannot see them doing that then the export effort is intangible in terms of people visible and active.  We had the idea that a special project should be promoted to get a group of young people to do specialised training, improve their language capacity and learn more about the typical problems of export marketing.  I am not so sure how that has progressed.  Maybe the Minister would like to tell us.  My own information is that certainly something is happening. I hope that now he is in the seat he will be making things happen in that regard.</P>
    <P>My view in relation to the export drive is that we should be more aggressive. The future of the country depends on our export policy.  Many people, including Senator Whitaker, have been pointing out time and time again that our economy must be export-led.  As we develop an industrial base, wider in terms of the range of products and technology we cover, and deeper in the amount of employment that we have in each part of each sector, our export drive must be more intense and aggressive.  When any Minister or politician goes abroad one expects him to go abroad selling hard and to make no apologies about it.  Sometimes I hear comments about our Minister for <Col N="1341" /> Foreign Affairs being interested just in commercial matters.  Why not? Somebody like President Giscard d'Estaing moves around the Middle East and he comes back with 9 billion dollars of orders and makes no apology for it.  An example of being more aggressive is always asking for Irish products.  There is no point showing you are very clever and saying, &ldquo;Well, they would not stock Irish whiskey here&rdquo;.  Ask for it, even if you do not drink it.  It means that the barman will say that somebody came in today and he was asking for Irish whiskey, even though it might be some bar in Africa.  Ask for the Irish product and be aggressive about it.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend also the work of some of the semi-State bodies who are promoting our exports.  Senator FitzGerald raised the question about CTT themselves.  They effectively export in the sense that they provide specialised training for people from other countries.  I am thinking also of Aer Lingus who, with their entrepreneurial effort selling their expertise abroad, are in the export business.  The recent report of the National Economic and Social Council, which refers to entrepreneurial activity in the semi-State bodies, indicates that they want to do more of it, but they feel a little bit of constraint in certain ways.  I hope that any constraint that they feel will be lifted and they will be able to contribute even more to the export drive.</P>
    <P>Finally, a question to the Minister about export credit guarantee systems.  I have raised this matter with him before. Some improvement has taken place but we are still not as good in this country as they are in the UK in terms of the availability of these schemes.  I know of instances where firms operating in the country who have subsidiaries working in the UK will often work through the subsidiary in the UK in order to make use of the export credit guarantee scheme that is available there.  Doing so means they will be pushing a British product rather than Irish products which would be handled from Ireland.  The Minister might make a comment on that. <Col N="1342" /> I welcome these extra funds for CTT and I wish the Minister well in his role as seller of Irish products and promoter of Irish products abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of welcoming this measure which is very useful, very important and very necessary.  In the almost seven years that I was in the European Parliament I had the opportunity of seeing CTT people work extremely hard and efficiently. One met so often small Irish owners or managers of businesses who depended so much on the wide range of facilities and services that our CTT experts were able to give them.  They were able to arrange for small business people to meet clients and to have interpreters available, and they gave a very comprehensive service.  They certainly have assisted very many small firms to get into the export market where otherwise it would have been extremely difficult for them.</P>
      <P>I have held the view for some time that Córas Tráchtála are very much under-financed.  I do not for a minute suggest that this is a criticism of CTT themselves.  As Senator Mulcahy has said, we need to be more aggressive, and I agree very fully with the view that he has taken.  The Paris office is one of the biggest ones but for a long time you could count the number of CTT people in the Federal Republic of Germany which is a huge market very favourably disposed to Irish products.  You can count the staff there on the fingers of one hand, if not on one finger.  This is not sufficient and is not giving our people a fair crack of the whip.  In addition, these people have to mount considerable stands, for instance in the Berlin show which is semi-political inasmuch as you have to fly the flag in the city of Berlin not just as part of the Community but on an east-to-west basis.  This is very necessary.  I do not know if it could be looked upon as an economic endeavour, nevertheless, it is one of the shop windows that a lot of work, effort and cost goes into every January.  The Cologne fair or some similar shows would be much more worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> I have grave fears that our staff have not got the back-up service or the numbers that they need.  I would ask the Minister to look at the infrastructures of CTT.  I do not wish to sound in any way critical, but at the same time there must be support and it is the only way that we can get out on a strong export drive. Each of the seven mainland EEC countries differs at least slightly from the others, so you would need to be almost tailor-making products for the different markets.  We need more expenditure on research and more research facilities. CTT assist in all these ways, but that is not at all sufficient.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister himself embark on many more export promotion tours.  As a politician who had the opportunity of travelling a lot I have observed that in most other countries, especially in the ones that are not great democracies, politicians enjoy a very high status.  Now that we have additional Ministers of State they should be almost full-time on export promotion because they are able to open many doors.  Perhaps CTT and the exporters could utilise more politicians. Many of the Members of this House who have international names and who are well known for their expertise in the various fields should be utilised to a greater extent and they should be asked to contribute the time in the interests of conserving jobs and expanding our export drive.</P>
    <P>I know that agricultural exports do not touch CTT at all but I have held the view for a considerable time that the processors who can rely on systems such as intervention lack the will to sell.  It is a shame that practically all meat processors in this country are putting their maximum allowable amount into intervention.  That is the lazy way out. That is the kind of <i>malaise</i> that restricts our exports and it hinders the creation of new jobs.  We should look very seriously at that.  If the country is going through a difficult or a tough period then all guns should be blazing and we should be making that all-out effort.  It is not just a matter of the Government or any particular <Col N="1344" /> sector.  We should appeal to people to express their nationalism in a determined sales drive.  If they believe in the future of the country, if they believe in making it a better place to live, then let them put their shoulders to the wheel to ensure that we get every possible job out of being able to sell different kinds of products.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy made a very important point about asking for Irish products.  I was with a number of Irish Members of the European Parliament at a meeting of ACP in Abidjan a few years ago.  We were staying in a rather expensive Government hotel which was outside the town and they had a night club there which was quite respectable but the fee was high.  The waiter thought of a number when he brought around the drinks.  It was £64 or £65 a night bed and breakfast and each drink was about £10.  After the first few nights I insisted on Guinness.  I have never had a glass of Guinness before or since but on the third night they produced a barrel of Guinness.  We had free drinks for the first few nights because we were quite indignant that they did not have it.  Eventually they produced it.</P>
    <P>The people who seem to have the best export network are Tullamore Dew, owned by Irish Distillers.  Of all the Irish products this is the one commodity one could find on five Continents.  I compliment them on their tremendous drive.  If one firm is able to produce a commodity that can be found in five Continents, more firms should be able to follow that example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I only advocate the best.  There is room for more co-operation between Departments.  I have not seen sufficient interaction between the Department of Foreign Affairs and CTT.  I do not say there is not co-operation, but there are only a limited number of CTT offices.  We should have many more embassies and there should <Col N="1345" /> be a CTT officer in each embassy.  In the cities where we do not have a CTT office we should have a CTT consul attached to each embassy.</P>
      <P>We are a small nation.  We cannot claim to be wealthy but the premier function of our embassies should be 90 per cent sales.  It is not sufficient to impose the cost of a flag-flying operation on the taxpayers.  Each embassy, even if it is only a listening post, should have a very high percentage of a sales complement and I hope we would have a consul in charge of exports or in charge of sales or, better still, have a CTT man seconded specifically working through the embassy. I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister's efforts continued success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Senators in welcoming increased support for CTT.  The House should compliment them on the tremendous work they have done consistently with very limited resources.  I would like to think this is only the first of many steps in recognising the need to put money into an organisation like CTT. We should recognise that the market place is a very difficult stand these days on the world scene, where CTT are operating.  They have to face up to different pressures of the day and, at the same time, maintain respectability.  The rules of trading are always fair.  Those of us who read reports realise CTT have to contend with many pressures.  When we read about bribes and allegations of major amounts of money being contributed to promote sales we realise how difficult it is for an organisation like CTT, with limited resources to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Honour and credit are all the greater for an organisation that had a small beginning and has a tremendous impact on the whole economy.  Everybody in rural Ireland should recognise that the work done by CTT is a credit to the nation. It is a pleasure for Members of this House to be associated with increased support for this organisation.  We have only to look at our imported goods to see that some of them are being relabelled. All these tactics are unworthy <Col N="1346" /> of the countries which adopt them. These are the type of tactics, pressure and difficulties CTT come up against. Whether they are promoting whiskey, tweed or any other Irish product, they have to sell aggressively, they have to be aware of new markets and they have to spend money to keep in touch.  They have done great work and I hope this new legislation will encourage them to expand and that from the fruits of their expansion will accrue tremendous benefit for what is already a very progressive and a very healthy story from the CTT point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I would like to express my support for this Bill.  I do so with particular pleasure because it provides an opportunity of praising the excellent work which has been done by Córas Tráchtála over the past 20 years. I was a member of that board for the first six or seven years of its operations, and I could not help but think that even those of my colleagues of that time who were of speculative mind and used to very large figures&mdash;they included the late Mr. Joe McGrath and the late Mr. Percy Reynolds&mdash;could hardly have brought themselves to believe that we would by now have paid sums approaching £90 million to Córas Tráchtála.  They have been efficiently disbursed in that particular direction.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy very kindly recalled my constant preaching of the gospel of salvation through exports.  Might I add to that that there is a condition of salvation, namely, that we should not only maintain the competitiveness of our goods and services but extend the range of goods and services which are competitive. This depends on two things: on our incomes not rising too fast and on productivity increasing sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another element in my gospel is that world production and trading structures are constantly changing.  One of the big changes already underway, and which will be accentuating as we approach the end of the century, is a switch as between the developed world and the developing world in the kinds of commodities that enter effectively into <Col N="1347" /> trade between us.  We are in the developed world and will have to be constantly moving up the scale in technology, in design and quality and particularly in the value we add through the production process if we are to keep our place.  We will have to be moving since we will be forced to yield ground in consumer orientated products to the less developed countries.  We will have to move more and more into sophisticated high technology goods and into capital goods.  We ought to keep these things in mind in planning the future development of production and trade.</P>

On behalf of the board and staff of CTT I would also like to thank them for the expression of appreciation of the work of CTT over the last number of years.  I will be delighted to pass on to the board and the chief executive the expressions of appreciation. I will try to go through the various points raised&mdash;please excuse me if they are slightly disjointed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of volume as well as monetary increases raised by Senator Staunton, I can assure him that the volume increase is also there, as is reflected in last year's figures and in the figures for the year before.  He said I had merely referred to the period January to April.  I was trying to take a third of a year and give a picture of what happens in a section of the year rather than taking month by month, because in various months you can have pick-up situations, as we had in May.  I can assure the Deputy that the figures for January to May are on target for CTT's annual export target of £4,200 million for this year.  The actual increase this year so far from January through to May is about 22 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  As I said the target in the five months from January to May and including May's figures, has shown an increase of 22 per cent, which is consistent with CTT's forecast for the five-month period.  You will have dips, considerable increases and maybe variations from month to month, but over the five-month-period they are on target.</P>
      <P>The Senator made another point.  CTT are not fully responsible for all our exports. There are other people, not that many, but quite a number are exporting who do not use the services of CTT.  He also mentioned multi-nationals, I can assure him that many multi-national organisations operating here are becoming more aware of the services available through CTT.  To my own knowledge they are using the services more and more and I am delighted to see this.</P>
      <P>CTT in their promotional programme could not be as successful as they are unless our industrialists were producing products of high quality, proper design and standards.  Our industrialists, workers and CTT deserve credit for the export performance we have seen for some time past&mdash;from £130 million in 1959 to £3,498 million in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also made a point about the report which I am informed will be issued in August.  Senator Staunton referred to percentage growth and the fact that there had been a decrease year by year.  One must look at the base from which one is working.  For example, in 1978 exports were £2,700 million, in 1979 they were £3,500 million, in 1980 they were £4,200 million.  It is very difficult to keep up high percentages when one is dealing with an ever-increasing base.  I agree fully, and I would like to emphasise that CTT and our exporters are facing extremely difficult world conditions. <Col N="1349" /> The fact that they are so successful is a tremendous tribute to CTT and to our exporters generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy in his contribution, for which I am very grateful, mentioned co-operation between CTT and our embassies. This was also mentioned by Senator McDonald.  I can assure Senators that there is total co-operation between CTT and the embassies.  When Deputy O'Kennedy was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in July 1977 one of his first tasks was to emphasise that our embassies were not just flag wavers but that they were to be involved in trade.  In many areas where we do not have CTT offices our embassies have trade consuls.  In some cases the trade consul is a CTT official.  For political reasons, the organisation of embassies within Moscow was such that a trade consul was appointed rather than CTT opening an office there.  The same happened in Nigeria and Poland.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy mentioned the sales executive scheme.  This is a pet subject of his and of mine.  I am delighted to be able to tell him that the first course for executives described as a European language and export marketing training programme was held in the College of Marketing and Design, Parnell Square. It went on for six months and the first 15 students came out only last Friday.  It was an intensive German and French course.  Eight weeks were spent studying sales and export documentation, EEC regulations, selection of agents and so on.  There were four weeks of in-company training with Irish exporting agents.  Then, there was a two-week visit to France to take in on-the-ground experience. Depending on the placement of these people, this course will be continued in future.  I am delighted to be able to say it has worked out and I am hoping that it will continue to be successful. Senator Mulcahy and other Senators spoke about an aggressive export effort. If Senators study the export promotion programme of 1980 as published by CTT they will see a full and aggressive programme of activity for 1980.  Senator Mulcahy also mentioned our export <Col N="1350" /> credit guarantee scheme and compared it with that of the United Kingdom. Senators will recall that last year I introduced a Bill to assist the building industry in their export efforts.  There was considerable criticism from the building industry that the insurance industry were not fully supportive of the building industry's efforts in export work.  The Bill was introduced to close that loophole, by giving facilities to the banks in this country to provide the type of guarantee required. That met one of the great complaints being made by our exporters about our export efforts.</P>
    <P>As far as the difference between the British ECG scheme and our scheme is concerned, CTT carried out a survey on behalf of the Department to find out exactly what difficulties were being put in the way of our exporters and our export efforts through any lack that there might be in our own credit insurance schemes. The results of that survey showed that few of our exporters felt the need for an expansion up to the ECGD level.  I accept the point made that there is considerable selling through UK offices. This unfortunately is one of the problems of the structure of our industry, which is to a large extent multi-nationally owned.  They have their marketing and, to a great extent, their research and development based outside Ireland.  We are, through the IDA and also with CTT, encouraging greater placing of sales forces operating from Ireland rather from their home parent companies of the multi-nationals.  As the years go by, there will be greater marketing from the Irish companies than through the parent organisations.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the importance of small industries and the importance their contributions could make to our export efforts.  This has been fully recognised by CTT.  To get to the small industrialists based around the country this year CTT decided to open three offices&mdash;to move away from the central office in Merrion Hall and to open regional offices.  Offices will be opened in Cork, Limerick and Sligo this year.  CTT want to get out into the field and meet <Col N="1351" /> the small industrialist engaged in his first venture into the export market who might be nervous, or who might feel some reluctance to travel to Dublin because a visit to Merrion Hall might appear to be too impersonal.  What we are doing now is that we are getting to the small industrialists in the field&mdash;in places like Cork, Limerick and Sligo&mdash;and in the future I hope there will be an expansion of that regionalisation.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also mentioned the fact that there are small staffs in some of the CTT offices around the world.  He mentioned in particular Germany and referred to the Berlin Fair. What happens in a fair, such as the Berlin Fair, is that the main work of designing the stand, the construction of the stand and so on, is done in Ireland.  It is then transported out to Berlin, or to any other show involved.  It is erected there.  It is made of Irish materials.  It is Irish designed.  You do not need a large office staff on the spot to organise it, because it is all done by a very specialised section of CTT in Ireland.  I accept the point that if resources were available there could be extra people in the field.  However, I can assure the Senator that the effort in Germany in particular has been highly successful from an Irish point of view since we became members of the European Community, and I hope it expands further in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also mentioned the need for export promotion tours.  I can assure him that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and I have been very involved in leading export promotion tours throughout the world.  I visited various parts of Europe on a number of occasions, Japan twice, Korea, America and Africa.  This trade mission concept is one arm of an overall package of promotional work done by CTT, but it is an important arm.  It is something that will be continuing in this year.  The Minister has already undertaken a number of visits, and there will be further trade missions later in the <Col N="1352" /> autumn and I will have the honour of leading three of them.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also referred to the grant-in-aid.  Even in this year of budgetary constraints in most sections of Government services, the grant-in-aid for CTT was increased this year from £6.09 million to £7.95 million, an increase of about 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned one particular company and his visit to Abidjan and the fact that he succeeded in securing a supply of a particular product in a night club.  Knowing the promotional campaign run by that company on that continent I am surprised that a product like Guinness was not available in a night club of all places, but I am delighted to hear he was successful in securing a barrel for himself.</P>
    <P>I am also very grateful to Senator McGowan for the warm welcome he gave the Bill and the points he made. Senator Whitaker referred to the need for exports and an export effort.  I can only endorse what he says: two out of every three jobs in manufacturing industry in this country at the moment depend on exports.  That gives the House an idea of how important our export drive is.  I can assure Senators that everything that can be done to assist CTT, our industrialists and our exporters will be done.  I agree with what the Senator said about the change in trading patterns throughout the world and the need for high technology products to be exported from Ireland and Europe generally.  In the years ahead some of the older traditional products will be manufactured in what we now refer to as the Third World.  This is reflected in the IDA's present programme.  They are putting great emphasis on new technologies, the electronics industry and the health care industry.  Of new jobs coming into the country and being approved by the IDA for grant assistance, the whole emphasis is on high technology, because that is where the future of this country lies where we, as a Government, are going, where the IDA are going and where CTT are also going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Senator FitzGerald referred to the effects of the depreciation of sterling on Irish exporters and exactly what has happened there.  Membership of the EMS and the subsequent divergence in value between the Irish pound and sterling presented Irish exporters both with problems and opportunities.  The situation now is that all export transations are in foreign exchange, including those in the United Kingdom.  For marketing reasons quoting in the currency of foreign customers has a number of attractions both for the customer and the exporter.  First, the customer is not faced by a continually fluctuating final price which is directly responsive to exchange rate changes and, secondly, for Irish exporters to the United Kingdom there is a unique advantage arising from the absence of UK foreign exchange controls on their purchases from Irish suppliers. This reinforces the benefit we have enjoyed in the UK market to date of not being considered a foreign supplier.</P>
    <P>CTT have discussed with a number of exporting firms and financial institutions the best means of both exploiting export opportunities when faced with currency movements in all markets and ensuring that firms take appropriate steps to protect their interests in all foreign markets.  As a consequence of these discussions, CTT brought three services to the attention of exporters and we are using these now&mdash;the quotation advice, overseas customer visits to Ireland and advisory services.  These are all available now to potential exporters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank Senators for their welcome to this Second Stage, for the interest they have shown in the debate and, once again, to assure them that I will pass on to the board and staff of CTT the warm feeling expressed for their efforts in this House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Trading Stamps Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senators will, by and large, be aware of the public debates which arise from time to time as to the merits and value of trading stamp schemes, and that it is not, therefore, necessary at this stage for me to go into detail on the economics or actual operation of such schemes.  Suffice it to say that the legislative approach of other countries in the matter has varied from outright prohibition in certain cases to a more flexible regulatory approach in others.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before the House opts for regulation as distinct from prohibition. Its nature and scope springs from a close study by the Department, over some years, into trading stamp business as it developed in Ireland.  One major finding, in favour of regulation instead of suppression, was that it is the features of certain schemes, and not so much the schemes themselves, that are disquieting.</P>
      <P>The type of stamp trading which is covered by the Bill is the general kind of scheme organised by a specialist stamp firm which serves a number of different retail outlets.  Excluded are &ldquo;private&rdquo; voucher or stamp schemes&mdash;that is to say, schemes which are organised by a single retailer or his supplier and under which stamps are redeemable from that retailer or supplier alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say here that the major trading stamp company in Ireland has recently moved away from the usual system of central redemption of trading stamps for goods in their own depots, to a situation where stamps can now be redeemed directly for goods or services in the various retail outlets operating the franchise.  Examples of the services which can be obtained in return for the stamps of one company, at least, are hairdressing and dry cleaning.  This structural change in the operation of the major company involved has prompted <Col N="1355" /> changes in various sections of the Bill, notably sections 6, 7, 8 and 9, and these were effected by amendments in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have also received the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry, of consumer interests and, of course, the stamp companies, on the Bill.  In its present form, therefore, I feel that the Bill takes into account the interests of both retailers and consumers.  It is concerned with the needs of retailers, because of their susceptibility on one hand to pressure to sell stamps, and, on the other, their legitimate need to adopt competitive devices, but the predominant concern is that the interests of consumers as stamp holders should be best served.  To this end, the Bill adopts the approach that all pertinent and relevant facts about trading stamps themselves&mdash;and about the companies which promote trading stamps schemes&mdash;should be made fully available and accessible to the buying public.  The facts I have in mind would include, in respect of the stamps themselves, information as to their real value in terms of purchasing merchandise and, in respect of the companies, information as to their financial standing, for there is no evidence to suggest that the buying public generally lacks shrewdness of judgment or common sense in determining good value for money.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  Excluded from the definition of a &ldquo;trading stamp&rdquo; is a stamp, coupon, voucher, token or similar device which is redeemable from the seller of goods or his supplier or from the person who provides the service.  Such schemes come closest to being the acceptable type of competitive tool for retailers that trading stamps are sometimes claimed to be.  Moreover, because of their limited spread in terms of use such schemes do not pose the same problems for consumers in the area of price comparisons as do the more widespread schemes.  Independent stamp operators on the other hand&mdash;meaning the specialist stamp firms which serve a <Col N="1356" /> number of different retail outlets&mdash;will be covered by the provisions of the Bill. Such operators are few in Ireland but it is, ironically, this very fact that often leaves them in a position, by the use of the franchising system, to influence the structure of competition in the retail trade.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that only a company within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1963, having a place of business within the State, will be permitted to carry on business as the promoter of a trading stamps scheme.  More importantly, however, the section waives the right of a private company which is the promoter of a trading stamp scheme not to annex prescribed accounting data to its annual return.  This provision aims to make sure that the public can get essential facts about the stamp company's financial state and the likelihood of its remaining solvent.</P>
    <P>One of the allegedly essential features of the business of the trading stamp company is the operation of the exclusive franchise.  This is the system whereby the stamp company allocates stamps to one retailer, or to a limited number of them, in the same line of business in a particular area.  The justification offered for the system is that it prevents direct competition among stamp-giving traders in the same business.  I am sure that all Members of the House have heard complaints, from time to time, from traders who claimed to have been refused the right to participate in a trading stamps scheme for reasons which, in their eyes, were less than sound economic or business ones.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill tackles this problem.  It provides that the unreasonable withholding by a company, which is the promoter of a trading stamps scheme, of a supply of trading stamps will be an unfair practice within the meaning of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The section does not pass judgment on what is deemed to be unreasonable. The determination of this can clearly depend so much on the circumstances of individual cases and in the operation of the investigative <Col N="1357" /> machinery that is available under the Restrictive Practices Act, the differing circumstances of different cases can be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with the notion of the &ldquo;cash option&rdquo;.  This option has two main objectives.  First, it provides for the indication of the worth of the stamps in cash, thus aiding rational comparison with the value of goods offered in exchange for stamps.  Secondly, it offers the stamp holder the right to choose between redemption for cash or for goods.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the cash option, namely, to permit stamp holders to calculate the worth of stamps in merchandise, would be frustrated, of course, if adequate provision were not made for the availability of catalogues where goods are offered in exchange for stamps.  Section 6 makes such provision and obviates the possibility of confusion among stampholders by making sure of a reasonable time-lag between the replacement of old catalogues by new ones.</P>
    <P>Two of the offences created in section 7 deserve elaboration.  An alteration in exchange values clearly affects, in turn, the real value of the stamps held by shoppers.  Where more stamps than before are required to obtain goods in exchange, this is, in effect, akin to a price increase.  Hence, an offence is being created where exchange values in catalogues are altered without the Minister's prior approval.  Likewise, the expectations of stampholders can be seriously jeopardised if specific goods publicised in a catalogue, and for which shoppers had been collecting stamps for the purposes of an exchange, are found later to be unavailable from the stamp company.  Accordingly, an offence is being created, too, to prevent this type of situation.</P>
    <P>The Sale of Goods Act, 1893 provides for implied conditions and warranties in contracts for the sale of goods.  Such conditions and warranties are, of course, being improved by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill which, I <Col N="1358" /> hope, will be enacted shortly.  In the context of the present Bill, however, there is no good reason why goods exchanged for stamps should not carry the same implied undertakings as to quality and fitness.  Both Acts will accordingly apply in their entirety to trading stamps transactions as if cash sales were involved. Section 8 of the Bill makes the requisite provisions in this respect.</P>
    <P>Generally, stamps are offered to shoppers at retail outlets.  It is at this point of doing their business, therefore, that shoppers should have access to certain basic items of information relating to stamps offered with the goods purchased.  Section 9, which was also in the Dáil the subject of amendment, makes obligatory the display of specified items of information which are considered to be those most fundamental to the shopper.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with a kind of misrepresentation which is peculiar to stamp trading business.  This poses as a type of promotional inducement in the form of a statement which describes the worth of stamps in terms of the money the prospective collector must spend in order to receive them.  Misleading though they are, these statements, nonetheless, can serve their purpose by enticing consumers into shopping in the outlets concerned. The use of such deceptive claims should clearly be stopped and section 10 has been drafted for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is section 11 of the Bill which declares contracts of a specified type to be void.  This section is emphatically a protective provision for traders, as distinct from consumers. Complaints have been made to the Department, predominantly by petrol retailers, that their suppliers have sometimes compelled them to offer trading stamps by reason of their operating from leased or licensed premises.  Terms of leases, which have a promotional emphasis from the viewpoint of the lessor, have been invoked for this purpose.  That such can happen is a most unsatisfactory and inequitable state of affairs.  It is contrary to any principle of fair play that any trader should be forced <Col N="1359" /> into doing a business that he does not want to do particularly when, as some complaints have alleged, the trader must fund the cost of the unwanted business from the profit gained on his normal business.  Section 11 is designed to put an end to this practice.  Given its objective, I am sure it will have the full backing of the House.  Its purpose is none other than to ensure that lessees and licensees of premises cannot be forced to handle trading stamps on foot of a condition of a lease or licence.  The section will not curtail competition or limit the competitive use of stamps by those traders who themselves choose to handle stamps by agreement with a stamp company. Nor will it affect the contractual obligations as between a retailer and his customers where the retailer decides, of his own free will, to offer stamps and the fact that he offers them acts as an inducement to shoppers to take their custom to him.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned previously, I feel that the Bill strikes the right balance between the regulation of stamp companies, the legitimate interests of retailers and the absolute right of consumers to get a fair deal.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had an open mind on the whole question of trading stamps.  I am just a little bit disappointed that the Minister in the first paragraph of his statement wrote off the necessity for going into the economics behind it.  In fact, the economics of trading stamps intrigue me and I would love to have somebody explain to me why they are so attractive, both from some traders' point of view and indeed from the promoters' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a general feeling of objection to promoters making money without providing any particular service to a consumer.  I suppose such a view could equally be applied to the whole question of advertising, and for that reason I am cautious to approach the question of trading stamps on the basis of such an argument.  I must say that I would like to know a good deal more about the motives involved for promoters, what the <Col N="1360" /> benefits are to them, and the views of traders.  Surprisingly enough, we have not received any submissions from any bodies.  Certainly, I did not receive by way of circular or otherwise any submissions from anybody in relation to this Bill.  That may indeed be for the reason that interested bodies were not aware that it was coming before the Seanad today. It only came through the Dáil last night.  I am not going to go back to a point I made several times so far today, but it is just another aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have heard what business interests had to say about it. The Minister referred to the fact that they were consulted.  Unfortunately we do not know their views; we do not know whether there were any dissenting views expressed to the Minister.  In the Dáil the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, outlined the history of consumer interests in this matter.  She referred to the Fair Trade Commission report in 1971 or 1972 in which they made no recommendation on the matter but offered the view that trading stamps were an undesirable method of sales promotion and an unsatisfactory method of savings.  I sympathise with that view.  She went on to refer to the reports of the National Prices Commission who initially recommended a total prohibition of trading stamps but later in May 1973 recognised legal difficulties involved in producing such legislation and recommended instead a higher cash redemption value for stamps and that advance notice be required of changes in the number of stamps needed for items in a gift catalogue.  So far as I can see this Bill does nothing to raise the cash redemption value.  It merely seeks to control it, as and from now.  Perhaps the Minister has reasons for not accepting that particular recommendation of the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I would like to have heard also the Minister's views on the legal difficulties involved in prohibiting the business of trading stamps altogether.  As I say, I am open-minded about it.  I accept that the Minister's Department have considered this matter very carefully and have <Col N="1361" /> decided, presumably, if one can judge from the views of the National Prices Commission, that for legal reasons it is difficult to prohibit them altogether and perhaps it is better to regulate.  Certainly if it is legally difficult or legally impossible to prohibit them&mdash;and, again, there are no reasons before the House as to why this should be the case&mdash;I accept that the exercise of the alternative option of regulation is an important one and for that reason I welcome the Bill.  It is a necessary Bill if we are not going to prohibit trading stamps and I am glad to see that it has come before us.</P>
    <P>I do not know either whether the Director of Consumer Affairs was consulted in relation to this Bill for his views on the subject.  In relation to the various people who were consulted about this matter I do not think that his name was mentioned.  From the Minister's script I see that various interest groups were consulted, including the Confederation of Irish Industry, and consumer interests and of course the stamp companies.  I do not know which particular consumer interests were consulted. I would like to know their particular views on the subject but we do not have that information.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, the man responsible so far as we are concerned about consumer interests and consumer concerns in Ireland, has not published any report in relation to the matter.  I am sorry that the Minister has not dwelt on that.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have an open mind on the matter.  My sympathies would be toward prohibition but it seems to me that the case is not being argued here at all, which I think is a pity.  The Minister clearly has at his disposal the arguments of consumers whoever they were, or whoever presented their views, and the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry, the views of traders but he has not offered us any of those views.  I feel that we just are discussing the question in a little bit of a vacuum.</P>
    <P>As to the regulation proposals, it is very difficult to find offence with any of them.  Obviously the only way of controlling <Col N="1362" /> it was to oblige a promoter to operate through a company.  This provides the facility of having available certain records in the company's office that consumers can consult if they wish to consult.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the financial records in the company's office will be sufficient? I wonder whether it would not have been better to put this whole matter under the control of the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to some aspects?  I accept that in relation to other matters it is properly within the area of the Restrictive Practices Commission certainly so far as dealings between the promoters and traders are concerned. The consumers have a very high interest profile in this matter, or should have.  I think that the Director of Consumer Affairs is not being given sufficient function in the course of the making of these regulations.  If I remember correctly, there is a power under the Consumer Information Act to grant to the Director of Consumer Affairs certain other rights or functions.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on that.  I would be delighted to hear that he will be given a very active part to play in the whole area of trading stamps.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the other contents of the Bill itself, points that I have to raise would be more properly raised on Committee Stage.  The type of situations being dealt with in the Bill are to be welcomed if we go for regulation.  I certainly am pleased to hear the Minister express concern in his statement, and through the provisions of the Bill itself, about traders who are left out in the cold, so to speak, and do not have the benefit of trading stamps when their competitors in an area might have such benefit: I accept that the Minister has some difficulty in deciding what is reasonable or unreasonable and writing it into the Bill, but I wonder whether some criteria for the consideration of what is reasonable or unreasonable should not have been written into a schedule to the Bill.  After all, the obvious type of questions that will occur to all Senators in relation to the matter is <Col N="1363" /> whether it is reasonable for a trading company to move into a village and to offer one petrol station the facility of giving trading stamps and not to the other.  If the competitor complains to the Restrictive Practices Commission that he has been left out in the cold and if the promoter of the trading stamps company comes along and says he could not give it to both as it would destroy its purpose as a sales promotion gimmick, is that reasonable or unreasonable?  That type of problem is very fundamental to the question.  I would feel happier if some criteria were written in.  Generally, I do not like putting in a phrase like what is reasonable and throwing it aside, hoping that somebody will be able to sort it out somewhere, whether it is the courts or the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I appreciate that there are particular problems associated with it in the context of the provisions of this Bill but, again, I feel that the legislation would be better if there were general criteria laid down that the Restrictive Practices Commission or whosoever would have to consider determining what is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased to see in section 8 of the Bill that the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill will actually apply to trading stamps transactions. It is most important.  There is no doubt that the existence of trading stamps to some consumers is very attractive. I know of many people who collect hoards and hoards of these stamps.  I can appreciate the lure of the stamp but, at the same time, when you see the number of stamps that have to be accumulated to buy a very small and relatively inexpensive item of household equipment or whatever you wonder whether all the trouble is really worthwhile.  I doubt it.  I am pleased to see that in relation to such transactions the consumer or the purchaser in these circumstances will have the benefit of the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill and the Sale of Goods Act.  It is very necessary that they would apply to such transactions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I presume that trading stamps only apply to what we might call consumer contracts under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill.  It is hard to imagine trading stamps being used in relation to items of equipment that might be sold to people other than those who purchase as consumers.  The Minister might offer something on that.  If that were the case, would it not be better to write into the provisions of this legislation that where a consumer buys trading stamps he is to be regarded as a buyer dealing as a consumer, because as the House is aware the rights that are attracted by a buyer dealing as a consumer under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill are far more comprehensive and real than the rights given to a mere buyer.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can really offer except to say that I welcome the Bill in so far as it regulates but I would ask the Minister to offer us some views on the question of why he decided it was better to regulate rather than prohibit completely.  I would specifically like him to tell us the views of the consumer interests he consulted, who those consumer interests were represented by and what were their views.  Certainly if the consumer interests are happy with this I will not object to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in general.  It is wise not to prohibit things of this kind in so far as they are not of themselves harmful.  So long as sales promoting schemes like this do not deceive the people and so long as they are not harmful in any way, giving as they do give a certain incentive to people to save up to get gadgets, some household equipment or things of that kind that they could not ordinarily afford, I do not think they are harmful.  I believe that a lot of people take pride in their ability to acquire goods in this way and it would be a great pity to deny them whatever pleasure they get out of it so long as they are not being fooled in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has gone a good part of the way to ensure that the consumer gets <Col N="1365" /> value.  That is the basic point I want to make.  I am against prohibition in general.  Schemes like this should be regulated so as to ensure that they are fair in every way to the promoter and to the consumer, to ensure that people are not tricked, fooled or deluded in any way.  I take it that that was the approach of the Minister, and I believe that in striving to attain it he has done a reasonably good job.  Perhaps matters may come up on Committee Stage that will help to improve the Bill but in general I am of the opinion that the Bill was approached in the right way.  If after some time in operation it is found not to be as entirely successful as the Minister and as I hope it will be, perhaps there will be an opportunity to amend it.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has received the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry, of consumer interests and, of course, the stamp companies.  These are the three main sections of people involved and the Minister has got their views.  He has studied them and he is now presenting a Bill to meet the wishes of all three sections.  Business being the highly competitive occupation it is, it is a pity to deny people the right to offer some attractions in the hope that that will at least attract the attention of the customer.  As long as the customer or consumer is not fooled or deluded by some gimmick, then I believe that the trader has a perfect right to engage in that type of activity.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to see that the stamps should be marked at their real value and that those promoting the stamps will not be allowed suddenly and without notice to change the number of stamps that are required for any particular article.  A catalogue is published and housewives&mdash;the people who mainly collect trading stamps&mdash;see that, for example, 250 stamps are needed to get a certain gadget.  Then a new catalogue or list is issued and the housewife sees that 315 or 400 stamps are needed.  She is frustrated and upset and comes to the conclusion that the whole thing was run to make money at her expense.  In so far as this Bill is going to put an end to that <Col N="1366" /> it is very welcome.  I say without hesitation that that section will be welcomed by people who like to indulge in this business of saving up stamps with a view to acquiring something that cannot be bought on the ordinary budget.</P>
    <P>There is another section in the Bill that appeals to me very strongly, and that is the one that prevents the big oil companies from coercing agents or retailers into running these stamps schemes for them.  It is a very nice provision in the Bill.  I am glad to see in the Minister's speech that that is to be stopped once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister said section 9 which was in the Dáil the subject of amendment makes obligatory the display of specified items of information which are considered to be those most fundamental to the shopper.  That is a good provision too.  It will do a lot to ensure that the whole business is run in a proper way. The Minister said that the use of deceptive claims should clearly be stopped and section 10 has been drafted for this purpose. It is a pity we do not have legislation to deal with advertisements in the same way.  Of course, it could be said against politicians that it might be invoked against the propaganda they put before the people at election times but, nevertheless, in so far as they refer to stamps it is right that deceptive claims should be stopped, and section 10 is a welcome inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in agreeing almost unreservedly with the Minister in what he says in the last paragraph.  It is a subject which may turn up when Senator Molony applies his talents and his legal training to Committee Stage.  There are good grounds for saying the Bill strikes the right balance between the regulation of stamp companies, the legitimate interests of retailers and the absolute right of consumers to get a fair deal.  I believe that in general the Bill does that, and for that reason I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. They are very welcome indeed <Col N="1367" /> and I suppose the history of the Bill which Senator Molony was anxious to know about, and about various incidents, are points which I think it is legitimate for anybody to make.  I think he has followed the most recent public debates in which the Minister, at that time Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, in her Dáil speech went into the background to the legislation.  It goes back to 1971 when the question of stamp trading was raised in a public inquiry by the then Fair Trade Commission, into grocery goods.  Though the Commission's report in July 1972 made no recommendation in the matter, they offered the view that trading stamps were an undesirable method of sales promotion and an unsatisfactory method of saving.  Then in their report of 1972 the NPC recommended that the Minister explore the possibility of legally prohibiting saving stamps.  The Prices Commission said that the stamps were an unsatisfactory method of saving and created difficulties for individual retailers and housewives.</P>
      <P>However, in their report of May 1973 the Prices Commission recognised the legal difficulties involved in introducing such legislation and recommended instead a higher cash redemption value for stamps and that advance notice be required of changes in the number of stamps needed for items in a gift catalogue.  All this was going on, which proves that people were involved and were talking about saving stamps.  Some people had reservations about them and there was a cross-section of opinion as to what should be done about them.  It was in that light that the Department and the Government had to make decisions and these are reflected in the Bill which we have here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Molony asked questions about who was involved and I would like to say that the Director of Consumer Affairs was consulted as was the National Consumers Advisory Council, who welcomed the terms of the Bill.  The Director of Consumer Affairs did not offer a view either for or against trading <Col N="1368" /> stamps, as such, but did give observations on the form of the Bill.  He generally welcomed it.  Senator Molony also mentioned that nobody would expect the trading stamps companies to have sought the Bill, so to speak, but they were consulted and they gave their views.  They are not unhappy about its provisions, which are reasonably balanced to provide adequate control and reasonable protection.  The Bill has got a fairly good general welcome from all sections of the community involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Molony also mentioned the director's functions.  The Senator is right when he says the Minister, by order and under the Consumer Information Act can give the Director of Consumer Affairs functions under which any piece of consumer legislation can be dealt with. The Senator's idea was a good one and I would be prepared to consider giving the director the function of overseeing the operation of this Bill.  That is something no one will object to.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of protecting users of trading stamps other than consumers.  We have not received any representations from any such interested group and I am not aware of any significant users other than individual consumers.  Since we did not receive any application to get involved in this matter there would be no point in discussing it.  Perhaps they will arrive at a later stage but I doubt it.  I have also noted everything Senator O'Brien said. He welcomed the Bill and he is probably right in saying we should not prohibit trading stamps, as such, but see that everything is right and above board, and that the consumer is protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two amendments of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968, are provided for under this Bill.  The maximum fine on summary conviction for offences under the 1968 Act will be increased to £500 and Rossaveal, County Galway, will be substituted for Galway in the schedule to the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968, as a harbour in relation to which a Fishery Harbour Centre Order may be made.</P>
      <P>When the parent Act was passed 12 years ago, the choice of Galway as the location of a fishery harbour centre on the west coast was supported by the Swedish Harbour Consultant, Mr. Carl G Bjuke.  He had been engaged by the Government to advise about the harbours most suitable for development as major fishery harbours.  Work on the establishment of a major fishery harbour adjacent to the commercial harbour at Galway began in 1969.  The work was suspended due to local objections and demands for additional works which would have substantially increased the cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Government then decided in 1972 to provide facilities at Rossaveal, County Galway, to meet the immediate needs of the fishing fleet on the west coast.  The facilities provided there included a new pier with a stormwall, an additional paved area adjoining the pier to accommodate various ancillary facilities, a causeway from the old to the new pier and dredging of the harbour and approach channel.  These facilities were completed by 1978 and, in addition, the approach road to the harbour was improved.  An ice-plant was also provided on the pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to improve the facilities at Rossaveal proved to be fully justified. Although these facilities are limited, landings of fish at Rossaveal have been so substantial during 1979 that fish <Col N="1373" /> landings there were the fifth highest of all the harbours in the country and were 76 per cent higher than the landings at Galway during the same period.  This is understandable in view of the saving of time and fuel oil by the trawlers in landing at Rossaveal instead of at Galway.</P>
    <P>The further development of Rossaveal Harbour can best be achieved by transferring responsibility for its development and management from Galway County Council to my Department and designating it as a major fishery harbour centre.  To do this, the harbour must be included in the schedule to the Fishery Harbour Act, 1968, as a harbour in relation to which a Fishery Harbour Centre Order may be made. This will, of course, entail dropping Galway from the harbours to be developed as fishery harbour centres. Under this amending legislation the harbours to be developed as fishery harbour centres will be Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Rossaveal.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, tá Ros an Mhíl i gceantar Ghaeltachta.

    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill. We have no objection to what is proposed in the Bill.  As the Minister said, there are two amendments to the Fishery Harbour Centres Act of 1968. <Col N="1374" /> The first one raises the fine on summary conviction to £500.  The major provision in the Bill is the substituting of Rossaveal Harbour for Galway Harbour.  I accept that there are considerable advantages in this proposal.  The Minister has indicated what some of these advantages are.  I am very happy to note that there was a substantial increase in the quantity of fish landed in Rossaveal during 1979, and I assume that trend is continuing into 1980.</P>
      <P>Coming from the west coast I can also appreciate the value of Rossaveal to the fishermen on the Aran Islands and the convenience of having that major fishery harbour at Rossaveal.  Before it became a designated centre the fishermen in the Aran Islands had to contend with the problem of travelling to Galway, coming in on an idle journey and perhaps returning on an idle journey.  Therefore Rossaveal is of considerable advantage to the fishermen on the islands and the fishermen on the west coast.</P>
      <P>I accept the necessity for developing these harbours.  Perhaps in the past we have not given to the development of our fishery harbours the measure of attention and the priority they deserved.</P>
      <P>We have a valuable resource off our coasts in terms of fishing grounds and, if our native fishermen are to be in a position to exploit and reap the benefits of this potential, obviously the facility of adequate harbours must be provided for them.  It is important that we assist our fishermen in every way in the development of this industry and that we recognise the potential there in jobs and in returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us the five principal harbours which have been designated under the Fishery Harbour Centres Bill.  They are located from Donegal to Galway to Cork, around the south-east, and up to Howth.  Nonetheless, it is right to question whether or not we should look at the location of these harbours and consider including in this designated or scheduled list others in Mayo, Kerry, and some other counties, which would save people from having <Col N="1375" /> to travel distances from their homes to five principal harbours.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to raise with the Minister.  I understand that a sum running into millions of pounds was designated for the development of these harbours.  How much of that sum&mdash;I gather it was in the region of £5 million&mdash;has been spent on the development of these harbours to date? When is it proposed that the developments that are in mind, and for which money has been provided, will be effected to ensure that the harbours are fully equipped and have all the facilities and services the fishermen who use them require?</P>

    <P>I see that the harbours to be developed as fisheries harbour centres are listed by the Minister as Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Rossaveal.  I would like publicly to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Dublin has waterways and water areas which might be useful for the fishery vessels.  I heard recently that a study was being carried out in relation to the area of Dublin near the Custom House and just beside there is an old dock which normally cannot be seen from the main road or from the <Col N="1377" /> street because it is surrounded by the ports and docks warehouses.  I heard in discussion that this report was being prepared by Litchfield who is talking about filling in that area.  It would be a crying shame to fill in something which was built at a tremendous cost many years ago.  I put forward the idea, the previous Minister was interested in it, that that area might be developed as a fisherman wharf type scheme as exists in San Francisco.  In that way we would bring into the inner city of Dublin the fishing operation and give it life, have the trawlers pulled into the area and surrounded by boutiques, shops, restaurants, something like the St. Margaret's scheme in London.</P>

      <P>I received notice from Senator Molony that on the motion for the Adjournment today, he proposes to raise the matter of the sanction of the Minister for the Environment for Puckane sewerage scheme in County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak in relation to something which is causing very great concern in North Tipperary and particularly amongst the members of North Tipperary County Council.  Although I am primarily concerned with the Department's sanction for Puckane sewerage scheme, so that the House will understand the difficulty and the urgency of the matter, it is necessary to give a very brief general background to the overall problem.  The level of capital allocation to North Tipperary County Council for sanitary service schemes and in other areas as well has been very low and completely inadequate to meet the genuine needs of the county.  I invite the <Col N="1378" /> Minister to compare the capital allocation to North Tipperary with other areas and particularly with our neighbouring county of Clare from which the Minister comes and he will readily see the different ways in which two areas, roughly similar in size and in the same region, have been treated through the years.  It may be because Clare has always boasted of some major names in Irish politics.  Be that as it may, the situation in North Tipperary is a very serious one now.  I am particularly concerned for reasons which will be apparent that this sewerage scheme will be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>In order to get over the general difficulty the council have in relation to capital allocation for sanitary services, they could not build houses in areas where a sewerage scheme was not available.  The only way over this problem, so that the council could fulfil their obligation and discharge their responsibility to provide houses was to build local authority houses in areas around the county which were serviced by communal septic tanks.  Unfortunately, experience from the employment of such a sewerage disposal device proved most unsatisfactory and has resulted in health hazards.  I will be referring to a particular health hazard that has resulted in Puckane, but there are other areas, including Borrisoleigh and Two-Mile Borris, where a very serious public health hazard was caused because of the inadequacy of communal septic tanks in servicing local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a considerable and significant cost involved in the removal of sludge from communal septic tanks where the council must employ contractors to empty tanks on a regular basis. Very wisely, the council have decided in future not to service local authority houses by means of communal septic tanks in order to dispose of the sewage. This means that North Tipperary County Council have had to alter their entire housing policy.  They simply do not have the money to establish the sewerage schemes that need to be established. Consequently, people are going <Col N="1379" /> to be forced to live in certain areas, and other areas&mdash;very desirable and pretty areas where people would like to live&mdash;will not benefit from the establishment of more houses simply because of the absence of sewerage schemes.  To give some idea to the House of the figures we are talking about, the allocation for sanitary service schemes in the administrative county of North Tipperary this year is £186,000.</P>
    <P>The council coming into this year had a debit balance on sanitary services capital account of £176,000, an amount just equal to what we received for all the work we were to do this year.  Our requirements for 1980, apart from the debit balance that we carried into this year, were £291,000.  Our total requirements therefore for 1980 amount to £466,000 of which we have been given £186,000.  This leaves us £280,000 short of our basic requirements.  The council had other commitments associated with sanitary sewerage works such as the purchase of land, consultancy fees and so on.  Our bill in this respect puts us in a situation this year where the council will be £50,000 short on their requirements just to do what they have planned.</P>
    <P>I understand the present economic difficulties. Given they are there after three years of this Government's administration, it is no credit to them that the situation in any county could be as bad as I have described.  I understand the necessity for public spending cuts.  I am not going to come to the Minister and ask for £50,000, which is what we need. This is something to which council have given serious consideration.  We have tried to narrow our concern to a specific scheme.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is the number one scheme on our priority list and, secondly&mdash;this is really what is important and why I want to refer to the Minister this evening&mdash;the fate of 33 jobs depends on this scheme going ahead.  Work for 33 men will disappear in August of this year.  The county council, through their secretary, wrote to the Minister a short time ago.  He explained the difficulties <Col N="1380" /> the council found themselves in and asked the Minister to consider sanctioning Puckane sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>At the last ordinary meeting of the county council the Minister's reply was read to the meeting and I can assure the Minister that the horror on all sides of the political divide with which his reply was received was evident by contributions of members from all sides in the debate that took place afterwards.  It was stated that:</P>
    <P>The question of approving the contract documents for Puckane sewerage scheme must be considered in the context of the overall level of resources available for the sanitary services programme and the number of schemes fully approved which are in progress or under construction and for which adequate finance must be provided.  In present circumstances the Department cannot indicate when sanction will be conveyed to the contract document for Puckane sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>For the past 12 months, on several occasions, requests have been made to the Minister to receive a delegation or a deputation from the council to explain what we see as problems that are peculiar and particular to us in relation to finance, finance relating to housing, roads and particularly in relation to sanitary services.  The Minister, for reasons best known to himself, has seen fit to refuse us the right of audience.  I regret that because I believe that if he was as familiar with the problems of the country as we are and with the problems that are being presented now in the context of being unable to proceed with the Puckane sewerage scheme, he would have a change of heart on the subject.</P>
    <P>Puckane is a very pretty village in the northern part of the North Tipperary administrative county.  It is a popular tourist area, an area in which people like to live.  At the moment Puckane has 22 local authority houses.  The sewage disposal from those houses is by way of communal septic tanks.  For several years now it has been apparent that those septic tanks cannot carry the load <Col N="1381" /> that they need to carry.  The result has been concern amongst local people about the health hazard.  Initially, and I suppose almost inevitably, bureaucracy did not accept this.  But it has now come to be recognised by the local authority, by the health board, that there is a public health hazard.  The Minister is aware of the views of the medical health officer in this respect.  The medical health officer told North Tipperary County Council that it was a very serious public health hazard and should be deal with as a matter of urgency and that an outbreak of fever in the locality could have far-reaching consequences for the county council in the locality and for the tourist trade in general.</P>
    <P>That is the position.  There is a public health hazard because of the absence of a sewerage scheme.  The sewerage scheme is first on North Tipperary County Council's list of priorities.  The cost of the scheme for this year is approximately £65,000, which is about 12 per cent of the half-million pounds that we have as a short-fall this year alone, so what I am looking for is merely a drop in the bucket.  It would not place any undue financial hardship on the Department of the Environment to accept that this is something that is needed and something that is desirable.  North Tipperary County Council have, for several years now, 33 men employed directly working on similar type sewerage schemes.  These men have experience and they are particularly good at their job.  They have been brought together to carry out certain functions.  Work for those men disappears in about August.  Puckane sewerage scheme needs to be done as there is a public health hazard there.</P>
    <P>We have work for the 33 men and we want them to go in and work.  Apart from the appalling position of 33 men joining the dole queues, we do not want to break up a good team who have proved themselves good at a job and we can carry out this function.  I appreciate that public spending cuts must be made but this is false economy.  If you add up the costs of cleaning out the septic tanks in Puckane it is about £8,000 a year.  The <Col N="1382" /> cost of making these men redundant&mdash;redundancy payments are a significant cost factor&mdash;the cost to the Exchequer of paying these people Department of Social Welfare money, unemployment benefit as they are entitled to, it becomes very false economics indeed and the Department can be accused of being penny wise and pound foolish in their approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>Those men want to work.  The work is there to be done.  It is work that needs to be done.  It needs to be done because there is a health hazard there; it needs to be done because it is a tourist area and as the medical health officer said, tourist facilities in the area are being affected. The attractiveness of the area is being affected. The local authority find themselves in a position where they cannot build more houses in an area where there is a need and where there is a housing queue.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider his position.  I also want to say that I think it was in the week we had the county council meeting at which this matter came up&mdash;I found it disturbing and hypocritcal on the part of the Taoiseach and his Government, to see in the national papers photographs of the Taoiseach with statements and great hullaballoo about what the Taoiseach was doing.  He was inviting together the chief executives and the chairmen of 21 State-sponsored bodies to discuss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is reluctant to interrupt the Senator but on a motion like this the terms are very narrow and the Chair would be grateful if you would relate all the remarks to the actual motion we have down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I most certainly propose relating these remarks because they are very relevant.  This is the way the ex-executives and the members of North Tipperary County Council feel about this.  The Taoiseach invited these men from 21 State-sponsored bodies to discuss economic growth and expansion of employment. I can tell you that 33 men in <Col N="1383" /> North Tipperary do not believe that the Government are concerned with expansion of employment when men in what would be regarded by most people as the most solid and secure of employment, employment by the county council&mdash;they are not casual labourers, these men have been there for years&mdash;are going to be let go because the Department refuse to sanction £65,000 which is what is required to put this scheme into operation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his position and to realise the difficulties that local authorities are faced with.  I accept that this has affected many county councils but in this instance there is urgent need, there is a public health hazard and 33 men are facing redundancy.  The matter is the first on the county council's list of priorities.  I ask the Minister, as a man from County Clare, to compare what County Clare has achieved by way of capital allocations and what North Tipperary has achieved by way of capital allocations.  I believe that he will readily accept that North Tipperary needs an extra boost.  I am not asking that we get all we looked for this year, I ask merely that we be given that one thing to solve the public health hazard and to retain 33 men in employment.  I do not know what will happen next year, perhaps economic times will improve, perhaps they will disimprove, but at least let us hold these men for the moment and let us try to improve an appalling situation that exist in a small village.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that, since I became Minister for the Environment, the total amount of money available has increased rapidly each year.  This year a total of £40 million has been made available for water and sewerage schemes as compared with £25 million which was made available in 1977&mdash;the last allocations from the National Coalition Government.  This has enabled me to make £550,000 available to North Tipperary in recent years, to go ahead with the sewerage <Col N="1384" /> schemes of Borrisoleigh and Borrisokane.  In March of this year&mdash;the figure given by the Senator is correct&mdash;£186,000 was allocated for major public water and sewerage schemes in North Tipperary.  It should also be understood that this was the maximum allocation that I could have made at that time as it represented virtually the entire undrawn balances of loans sanctioned for major schemes in North Tipperary and no further requests came to avail of loans until after the recent letter about the Puckane sewerage scheme.  That was the next request we got for further allocations of loans that had been sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The fault there rests squarely with North Tipperary County Council, not with me or my Department.  It is up to the Senator and his fellow councillors to make sure that these things are done on time.  I also allocated £75,000 to North Tipperary County Council for small sewerage schemes this year.  This is the sixth highest level of small schemes allocations made to individual sanitary authorities in 1980 and it is £15,000 higher than the last small schemes allocation made by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this month Tipperary North County Council made representations to my Department that 33 council workers now employed on four major sanitary services schemes which are nearing completion would have to be laid off unless new sewerage works were fully approved for execution at Thurles and Puckane.  My Department wrote to the council on 12 June pointing out that I had already given full approval and sanctioned loans for foul and storm water sewers to serve the new vocational school at Thurles.  The Senator did not refer to that letter.  Work on these sewers will re-employ 15 of the men which the council propose to lay off in August in the Thurles job.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Senator to decide whether it is true or <Col N="1385" /> not but that is the position.  I am happy to inform the Seanad that I have earlier this week released the Puckane sewerage scheme for commencement in 1980.  The total figure involved will be £175,000 for this scheme and it will absorb the remainder of the 33 workers, who the Senator says, are about to be laid off.</P>
