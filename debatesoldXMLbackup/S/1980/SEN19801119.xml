    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for a double week's payment in December 1980 to the recipients of long-term benefits and assistance under the social welfare code. It is the aim of the Government to improve and extend as far as possible social welfare schemes and payments. For example, recently it has been my privilege, as Minister for Social Welfare, to introduce a new national free fuel scheme and also to remove some of the restrictions on the free travel facilities for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned to ensure that long-term social welfare recipients &mdash; those who are affected by advancing years, chronic ill-health or the exceptional pressures of widowhood &mdash; can meet the <Col N="117" /> additional expenses which affect us all at this time of year. Accordingly, I am very happy that the Government, in the context of the second national understanding for economic and social development, undertook to provide these additional payments this year.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention, although it is not strictly relevant to this Bill, that a double week's payment is also being provided in the case of persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children, all of which are administered by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The people who, under this Bill, are being given the extra week's payment are those receiving old age pension, contributory and non-contributory, blind pension, widows' and orphans' pensions, contributory and non-contributory, retirement pension, invalidity pension, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers, prisioners' wives and single women, and occupational injuries disablement pension and death benefit by way of pension.</P>
    <P>The additional payment will generally be made at post offices on the appropriate day of payment of pensions and allowances in the second week of December 1980. Old age, blind, widows' and orphans' pensioners will be due payment on Friday, 12 December, the other categories on Thursday, 11 December.</P>
    <P>The additional sum to be paid will be equal to the face value of the weekly pension or allowance order and will include all increases in respect of adult and child dependants and any supplements which form part of the regular weekly payments. Certain long-term recipients of occupational injuries benefit by way of pension are paid by cheque monthly in advance. These will be issued with cheques for December at the equivalent of five weeks' payment instead of four.</P>
    <P>The numbers of people who will receive a double payment as a result of this Bill totals 345,000. These are made <Col N="118" /> up of 196,000 old age and blind pensioners, 81,000 widows, 1,000 orphans, 32,000 retirement pensioners, 16,000 invalidity pensioners, 6,000 deserted wives, 8,000 social assistance recipients and 5,000 occupational injuries pensioners.</P>
    <P>In addition, the increase payable in respect of a further 117,000 persons will also double for that week. The overall total of persons covered by the extra payment will therefore be 462,000.</P>
    <P>The cost of the additional payment is estimated at £8.76 million, comprising £5.35 million for contributory and £3.41 million for non-contributory payments.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that this Bill will commend itself to all Senators, and I ask for its early passage so as to ensure that the additional sums will be paid in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard:</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill and the provision of the double week's payment which will come to the categories of people listed in the Bill. These are the most deprived section of the community, the old, the sick, the needy and the unemployed, the people who have not the organisation, the muscle or the power to insist on obtaining a better slice of the national cake as other sections so often do. Because of the position of these people I hold strongly to the view that those of us who are in any position to assist their situation should consider it a duty and an obligation to do so. There is a category of people whose living standards are poor and, we must admit, are getting poorer day by day. We debated the Social Welfare Bill, 1980 some months ago but the increases provided therein have been eroded by circumstances such as inflation and so on. We welcome this meagre increase, this little boost to the spending power of these categories up to the Christmas period. It will, I hope represent some small measure of satisfaction to the people who receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to make one point to the Minister. I am aware, and I am sure many public representatives here and elsewhere are also aware, that there are people entitled to these payments who will not receive them because their claims and applications have been gathering <Col N="119" /> dust on Department's shelves. In one particular case I know there has been a delay of 13 months. I feel that these people deserve consideration. They deserve the right to have their applications dealt with speedily. To fail to do so is to inflict an injustice on them. I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that every possible effort would be made during the weeks between now and Christmas to deal with and decide on these payments and applications, some long outstanding. We support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for several reasons. The first reason is that, together with the 20 per cent increase which was given by the Government in the budget to old age pensioners, it shows the Government's concern for the more deprived sections of the community. These two measures show the Government's reaction to the effects of inflation on pensioners as being immediate, sensitive and effective. I welcome this Bill also because it is part of the national understanding and it shows that the concern of the trade union movement is with decent living standards for elderly people rather than with a wages free-for-all. Another reason I welcome it is that it permits one to comment in a necessarily brief way on certain aspects of the social welfare system as they affect the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare system is designed to help those in need over what has been described as the &ldquo;through&rdquo; in the poverty cycle. For most people this &ldquo;trough&rdquo; occurs in families when their children are young and there is only one breadwinner. They are helped through the social welfare system by family and children's allowances. At the other end of the scale there is a &ldquo;trough&rdquo; when the same children are grown up and have gone away from the family leaving elderly parents alone and often destitute. Our system of social welfare payments is based on a community care system and this is a very good thing. The community cares for the elderly and one can see this particularly in rural areas. It is very difficult for someone who is old and destitute to be in real want in a small country community. <Col N="120" /> There is always somebody to see that you have a meal or a fire; there is always somebody to go out for some wood. But what happens when the community in which you have lived all your life has gone, as has happened in the inner city area in Dublin? What happens to people who still cling to their homes? There is a very real need in this area and it has been illustrated by the reports of voluntary associations which have been formed to combat this need.</P>
    <P>I know a Government's choice of priorities in the social welfare system is dependent upon public support, dependent upon the public's willingness to pay. It is also dependent upon informed public opinion on what its priorities should be. I know that the system is not boundless, that there are people always on the periphery of the social welfare system. I know that the public purse is not bottomless but surely the burden of looking after people on the periphery should not be left to voluntary organisations. The role of the voluntary organisations is merely to inform the public and surely the elderly have a very special place in the Government's list of priorities.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to the Senator that the scope of this Bill is limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenCassidy" hpid="Mrs. Cassidy Mrs. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I take the point but surely the claim of a society to be regarded as civilised should be based upon awareness of the needs of the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson:</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour group also welcome this Bill. It is a small but nevertheless welcome measure for those who are recipients of long-term benefits and assistance who will have their benefits doubled for the week beginning 12 December. The Minister mentioned in introducing the Bill and Senator Cassidy also pointed out that it is something that was negotiated and agreed in the national understanding and therefore it is part of the Government's commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make two serious criticisms of unnecessary restrictions in the Bill and I would ask the Minister to respond to these in his concluding <Col N="121" /> speech. The first is a matter that was raised in the Dáil by my Labour colleague, Deputy John O'Connell, that is, that the Bill will only double the benefits of those who are in receipt of or are entitled to a particular benefit during the week beginning 12 December. If they were to become entitled on the day following the end of that week, on 20 or 25 December, Christmas Day, then they will not get the doubling up.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's first sentence in introducing it that the idea is to provide a double week's payment in December 1980 to recipients of long-term benefits and assistance under the social welfare code. If that is the intention, and I support that intention, is does seem to be unnecessarily restrictive and basically discriminatory and unfair to take a very narrow point of reference, a particular week, and therefore exclude those who would become eligible a week later or before the end of December.  The needs of these families, the needs of the old people concerned, if they were to become eligible after the week that the Minister has chosen in this Bill, are the same as those of any comparable families who will be getting the double benefit.  I understand that the Minister said he would consider and look into this point and I would be grateful, even at this stage, if he would be prepared to amend the Bill and extend the period to cover anybody who is either in receipt of or would become eligible for the particular benefit during the month of December.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this may be inconvenient, that it may cause problems for the bureaucracy, but I would submit that those problems although they might be inconvenient in so far as implementing this is concerned, do not weigh against, first of all, justice to recipients of the benefits in comparison to other recipients of benefits, or against the needs of the families or the old age pensioners or of these more deprived and more vulnerable sectors of the population.</P>
    <P>That is the first point on which I ask the Minister to comment.  The second one is an omission from the Bill which I feel is hard to justify and seems to me to <Col N="122" /> be unfair.  It is one that was brought to my attention by an individual constituent and also by a number of social workers who are very concerned about it.  The point is that unemployment assistance has been omitted.  Senator Howard referred to the hardship of the unemployed, and we do not need to emphasise it at any great length, but these are families for whom Christmas is a hard time, particularly with very sharply rising costs in general and which are aggravated around the Christmas period.  I appreciate that the scope and intent of the Bill is to cover long-term benefits and assistance, but a considerable number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance have been in receipt of it for a considerable time, sometimes in excess of two or three years.</P>
    <P>I would like to drive home the point on the actual example of a husband with a wife and five children who is getting unemployment assistance of £52.15 a week.  He has been on unemployment assistance certainly in excess of two years, possibly even longer than that. That is his only source of income and he will not get anything under this Bill; he will not get a doubling up at Christmas. If a deserted wife with five children got the deserted wife's allowance her take-home allowance would be £55.50 and she would get it doubled up for Christmas. That is not an artificially contrived example &mdash; it happens to be a real case &mdash; nor do I believe it is that unusual.  There are certain areas, particularly in certain housing estates, where there are a number of families whose only income is unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to confine the doubling up benefit to those on long-term benefits he can do this without excluding those on unemployment assistance.  I am not suggesting that it is necessary to limit it in this way but, for example, if he were to extend it to those drawing unemployment assistance who had already exhausted the period of unemployment benefit, it would then be clear that they were in fact in receipt of a longer term benefit or social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>There is really no distinction between the needs of those families and in the <Col N="123" /> actual amount that they are getting.  They can be worse off than some of the other recipients of benefits, for example, the deserted wife's allowance.  A deserted wife who is getting the deserted wife's allowance may be employed.  I am very much in favour of this benefit and I do not want to be thought critical of it.  The deserted wife's allowance may be subject to taxation but not to means testing and she will get a doubling up at Christmas. I am not arguing against that.  That is the case of somebody who is in a demonstrably better position to feed and clothe and provide for the needs of her family at Christmas than somebody on unemployment assistance for a considerable period.  In view of the very serious unemployment situation and the fact that there are people unemployed who have been drawing this benefit for a number of years, I would ask the Minister very seriously to reconsider the matter and to amend the Bill.  If necessary he should go back briefly to the Dáil with an amended Bill on those two issues, extending the period to cover the whole month of December so that people will not be discriminated against artificially by its present operation and extending it to those on unemployment assistance.  If he wishes there could be some kind of stipulation that they must have been on unemployment assistance for a certain period but the Bill should not seriously and harshly exclude some families who are in very real need of this kind of benefit.  Limited though it may be, it certainly would be a great help to these families around Christmas time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for Senators on both sides to support a measure of this kind because it has been provided for in the Estimate and it is part of the national understanding.  I agree entirely with the concept that the Minister is promoting here.  It is similar to the new national fuel scheme which he has recently introduced in order to make some additional means available for those in the category who badly need it. It is very easy for us on both sides to support such a measure because the necessary <Col N="124" /> budgetary means have been made available.  I suggest to the Minister that if it is possible for him to do so he should consider those who have recently become unemployed, perhaps for two or three months, as falling within the category. Although they are not long-term nevertheless anybody who has been in this position for a period of over three months is trying to adjust to a new situation for the time being.  It is a situation which would be intolerable to any individual with a wife and family.  Perhaps the Minister can manage to include that category for a double benefit at Christmas.  It would make a considerable addition to the general purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome this Bill.  It is obviously an imaginative and humane thing to make these extra payments coming up to Christmas. That is self-evidently benign and well judged.</P>
      <P>There are two points I want to make. The first is that the Bill dramatises the need, that Senator Cassidy raised, of people who are deprived in the community, particularly old and lonely people in the inner city and such places.  There are such people in certain areas of rural poverty also.  Some of the benefits mentioned here, like the fuel provisions, are sometimes negatived by the fact that the community has broken down and these old people are at the mercy of unscrupulous young delinquents, and sometimes old delinquents.  It draws our attention and, I hope, the Minister's attention, to the need for the increase in social services and social workers, people who can make these benefits flow uninterruptedly to the people for whom they are meant.  That is merely a point which I think is worth emphasising in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is, perhaps, a contradiction of the first.  It is a point on which I feel it is necessary to cast a cold eye.  I notice that the additional payment involved here is £8 million.  This is a lot of money and it is to be disbursed in this one week.  There is no doubt that the benefit is good and that the spirit of Christmas is behind it, but it makes one think about the wisdom of this kind of <Col N="125" /> seasonal, ephemeral and transitory improvement in the lives of people.  The sum of £8 million would build a good mental hospital somewhere.  Very recently our attention was drawn to the national scandal and disgrace of our mental hospitals throughout the country and notice has been served on the Government and on the Minister for Health to do something about that in a short space of time.  Whereas it would be heartless and Scrooge-like to say that this increased payment is not a good thing, on the other hand it is impossible not to think that £8 million could be put to something that is not as transitory and ephemeral as a one-week bonus in the course of one year.  With that reservation, which I throw out towards the Government benches because there are better heads there to decide on priorities than I would lay claim to, I congratulate the Minister and the people who framed the legislation.  Perhaps such matters as I have raised could be borne in mind when a benefit of this kind is contemplated at a future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the terms of this Bill because to some extent it helps those who are in most need.  Mention has been made of the ephemeral nature of this Bill, but anybody who lives close to an old person or a person who has not got the means to help himself will know that coming up to Christmas this person will watch other people getting benefits from their jobs and other payments.  Such people have to watch the shops getting brighter and brighter and they find that their houses are getting colder and colder.  It is very necessary at this time of the year that they should be helped.  People on long-term unemployment assistance might be brought into the scope of the Bill.  They are regarded as people who are eternally out of work and never look for it, but there are many people in that category who cannot get work and who definitely need the benefit of a Bill such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems I see about the Bill is that we are coming towards Christmas when there is maximum usage of the postal service and there will undoubtedly <Col N="126" /> be problems in regard to the receipt of this benefit by people in areas where there may be delays because of postal difficulties.  If they do not get the benefit in the week in which they are supposed to get it, it will cause a lot of people to make representations to public representatives.  The unfortunate part is that because of the over-burdening of the phones in the Department of Social Welfare it will be impossible for us to get through.  People will have to pay visits to Dublin and there will be a lot of problems for public representatives.  I do not know what the answer is.</P>
    <P>I suggested in the past that telex or computer terminals should be set up in various areas around the country so that public representatives and also the people who are in need of the benefit could go to a central point in a regional area and get the answer to their problem immediately.  The reservations I expressed here are because of the time of year and because of the problems of the postal service at this time.  The Bill undoubtedly will help many people.  Like many others here and in the other House I feel that everybody who is in receipt of social welfare benefit should have the advantage of the double week, not only at Christmas but at any other time of the year when money is available.  The Bill goes a long way towards helping people who need benefits.  I sincerely hope that in the future its scope can meet the needs of people who have not got the means to help themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long.  I feel obliged to say that people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance should certainly be included in the Bill.  In the part of the country where I come from a large number of people are elderly.  They may not be old age pensioners but they would certainly be in the 55-56 age bracket.  A large number of them are living alone or with nobody in the house but a husband or wife and I am disappointed that this category has not been taken into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like briefly to mention the <Col N="127" /> number of applications to the Department of Social Welfare, particularly for non-contributory pensions.  Recently I spoke with somebody who was inquiring about the delay in relation to an application for an old age pension which he applied for in July and he has not got any benefit yet.  That man may or may not be in receipt of his old age pension by the given time in the Bill and this means that he is going to be debarred from the benefit in the Bill.  I certainly think that the Minister should do something about the number of applications to the Department which have not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I would like to refer to the fuel scheme which is mentioned in the Minister's speech.  We clap ourselves on the back about this scheme but when we break it down it is not such a great scheme.  Naturally it is an improvement on the old scheme in some cases because a greater number of people qualify for benefit or fuel under it than did under the old one.  These people will get a voucher for £60 per year, that is for a period of 30 weeks.  That will give them half a stone, or a bit less, of coal per day, just enough to light the fire each morning for the 30 weeks.  If that is the best we can achieve with the free fuel scheme it is not a great achievement.  I certainly think that this whole free fuel scheme will have to be looked at again.  I am prepared to say that it is an improvement on the previous one but it certainly is no great achievement because the poorer people who were last year getting maybe three tons of coal per year are now down to the given amount of half a stone of coal per day.</P>

      <P>I will finish briefly.  I would not have taken the opportunity of <Col N="128" /> mentioning it if it had not been mentioned in the Minister's speech.  I am sorry if the Chair does not agree with me. I certainly think that this fuel scheme will have to be looked at because an old age non-contributory pensioner living alone is getting £21 per week and there is not enough in that to buy coal for the whole week and then he is given half a stone of coal per day which is of no use to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am very pleased that the Government are taking steps to implement this particular part of the non-wages elements of the national understanding.  I take it that we will receive an assurance of the Government's intention to implement the other provision relating to the social welfare recipient's family, the provision requiring the Government to keep all long-term benefits in line at least with the inflation rate over the past 12 months.  I wonder if we could have an assurance and a definite date in relation to the Government's intentions in that respect.</P>
      <P>I hope, too, that the Government will act with equal speed and determination in implementing the other non-wages elements in the national understanding, especially in regard to unemployment. The Government have a major responsibility in respect of the wages elements in the national understanding in so far as they relate to the public sector.  In this connection I am informed that many local authorities and State and semi-State companies are already in difficulty in that they have not received authorisation from the Government, or financial aid for that matter, to enable them to implement the national understanding.

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of the other Senators in relation to this Bill.  I welcome here today the Minister for Social Welfare who is a forward social thinker and whose <Col N="129" /> concern for the people in the welfare area has been evident over the period he has been in office.  The Minister, being a forward social thinker will take note of the grave and depressing problems that sometimes confront the people.  The Bill shows the Government's concern to meet their responsibility fully and effectively. The increases in the budget and the increases before us here are an indication of the Government's concern to deal with this problem in its entirety.  No matter what amount is made available I am sure that every Member of the House will say that it is not enough.  When we examine the situation and we see the way that half a million of the weaker section are being treated here we can see that the people who formulated the national understanding are concerned and are implementing it.</P>
      <P>But there is another side to the social welfare problem.  That is the abuse of the system that probably deprives these people of some additional benefits.  Indeed, many public representatives are assisting people in the abuse of the system.  On the day we can say that these abuses no longer continue to benefit the people who are abusing the system and depriving the weaker section of benefits, we will have done a good day's work.  I would like to know what is a deserted wife.  I have known deserted wives who while they were getting the deserted wife's allowance were not necessarily living apart from their husbands.</P>

      <P>Senator Brugha said the Bill is unusual in that it was being welcomed on all sides of the House, something that does not happen to too many Bills.  As to the level of welcome, I discern a slight difference in the amount of enthusiasm with which the Bill has been greeted.  Let me say straight away that my enthusiasm will not equal the enthusiastic reception on the other side of the House.  The Bill is welcome because it gives this section of the community extra money at an emotive time of the year; it gives one extra week's payment.  But what is really needed for these people is increases to keep their allowances in line with inflation.  I do not know if the increases which the Minister granted in the budget this year, which in any event did not come into effect until April after a quarter of the year had gone, kept in line with inflation.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister if the increases have matched inflation.  If not it would blunt my feeling that the Bill is less generous than it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned &mdash; and she was supported by Senator Reynolds, speaking from experience in his part of the country &mdash; the omission from the Bill of the persons getting unemployment assistance; they are numerous and often <Col N="131" /> living in conditions of real hardship.  I would like to support the pleas at this eleventh hour for their inclusion in the Bill.  I appreciate that there is a considerable number of people in that category. But having regard to the rather ruthless weeding-out that has been taking place among the recipients of unemployment assistance in the last year or so, I am quite certain that the numbers have dropped considerably and that the financial burden on the Exchequer is not beyond its capacity to bear.  The amount of relief that it would give to the people would be significant in their individual terms.</P>
    <P>There is another category of persons whose omission I find difficult to understand.  That is the people in receipt of the blind person's pension.  The Minister in his speech said that the objective of the Bill is to assist recipients of long-term benefits and assistance.  Obviously there is no person going to be in receipt of a longer-term benefit than the blind person who has to suffer that disability for a life time.  I am puzzled as to why the Minister has omitted blind persons because there is a means test and the rates are roughly equivalent to the old age non-contributory pension.  It would seem to be the type of benefit that the Minister meant to include.  I would be anxious to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I take back all I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would support the previous speaker in is the question of the delays in getting out payments from the Minister's Department.  I am quite certain that the Minister's machinery to pay the double week's benefit for the week of 12 December is well advanced.  I hope that the attention which that has to get, and properly get, has not compounded the arrears position within the Minister's Department because, like any other public representative, I am constantly getting complaints from members of the public entitled to benefits and allowances who are not getting them in a reasonable time.  It does confirm what many of us see from other areas of Government, <Col N="132" /> that there must be a cash shortage and it is being concealed by the Minister's inefficiency.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment of housing grants is scandalously slow.  Agricultural grants are a constant bone of contention to every representative from a rural constituency.  There seems to be a deliberate administrative delay in order to ease the Exchequer burden.  I hope that some steps will be taken and if steps cannot be taken, let us know that at least there is going to be delay.  Let us end the situation where people have expectations of getting grants and become disillusioned and frustrated with the public representatives and their whole contempt for the system grows.  If they were told that there is a cash crisis, that there is a cash shortage and that there will be delays in payment, it would be much healthier that people would know this, instead of the Government trying to conceal it by contrived administrative delay.  That would be a preferable position.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that the practice in the Department in relation to the means test has become significantly harsher.  I would not say that there is a witch hunt going on among recipients of non-contributory benefits of one kind or another but many people feel that it is approaching those proportions.  It is very difficult when there has been an alteration in somebody's means as a result of an investigation and a change in the level of benefit to get from the Department the precise figures on which the change has been made so that it can be argued as to whether it is just or valid.  I hope that that is not the spirit in which these people are being approached.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Dowling that there are abuses; there are unscrupulous people who undoubtedly abuse the system.  I do not think it is fair to say that they are assisted by Oireachtas Members.  To say that would be unfair and inaccurate because Oireachtas Members get lots of abuse from people who feel that the system is being abused and are being constantly asked what they are doing about it.  But, of course, when we ask the six mark question, &ldquo;Give us the <Col N="133" /> name and address of the person who is abusing it?&rdquo; they say &ldquo;Well, we would rather not do that&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reflecting on an earlier contribution.  To get back to the point I was making with regard to the recipients in the Bill, some of them will not get the benefit for a considerable time because their means may have been revised upwards so as to disqualify them and those means may be on appeal.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that, if there is an appeal against a revision of means, it is dealt with quickly and that the full information is made available in the first instance to whoever makes the inquiry. I welcome the Bill; everybody must welcome an extra week's payment for the categoties concerned.  I hope that in next year's budget it will be possible to provide for substantial improvements for all these people, not just for one week but for the entire year.</P>

It is a good development in the area of social services and, having regard to the fact that it had to be negotiated, one must take into consideration that the negotiators on both sides have to deal with the circumstances they find themselves in.  Had there been much more leverage on it, it would have yielded something better.  However, it is a good precedent in the area of social welfare.  I welcome the Bill and I hope we will see something in the same direction in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to those of the previous speakers. I also welcome the Bill.  I am sure the Minister had the best intentions in the world in trying to get it through for this Christmas.  I would suggest that he introduce legislation to ensure that in future years Governments will be found to make <Col N="134" /> these double week payments each Christmas.</P>
      <P>While I am on my feet I want to mention that I am very concerned about the delay in social welfare payments and the delay in taking decisions because of problems in relation to cases going for examination.  I would suggest that the Minister must have the machinery at his disposal to enable him to avoid these undue delays.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is welcome from the point of view of those who will get the extra week's pay or allowance I suggest to the Minister that there are certain categories, particularly the old age pensioners, who are very badly off.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand how old age pensioners can live today in any sort of decent circumstances on the allowances that are available to them.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might regularly review this position in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions and for the general welcome which this Bill has received.  I will deal with the individual points that were made.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard was concerned particularly about the delays.  A number of Senators instanced delays and were concerned about delays, particularly in relation to non-contributory pensions of one sort or another.  Of course some delay is inevitable there because there is a question of determining whether a person is eligible or not and the extent to which he or she is eligible.  That involves delay on both sides.  I can only say that I have taken some measures already this year to facilitate and speed up claims, in particular in relation to the transfer of lands, and these are working fairly smoothly at this stage; or so Deputies and Senators tell me.  I will do anything I can to facilitate that, but I would say that in relation to this measure it is important to be clear that anyone who is eligible at the time, even though his eligibility may not be finally determined, he will still be entitled to the increases.  There may be no fears in that respect because of assessments going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> Senator Cassidy spoke about the budget and she mentioned the 20 per cent &mdash; it was 25 per cent in the case of the long-term beneficiaries and 20 per cent for the short-term.  I noted a point which the Senator made and it was made again later, in congratulating both the Government and the unions on co-operating and agreeing to this as one of the measures to be included as part of the negotiations. Senator Harte brought that out again later.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised two points, firstly in connection with those who are eligible in the relevant week and asked what would be the position in relation to people who became entitled subsequently.  First and foremost, to be quite clear about the technicality, the national understanding is quite clear on that &mdash; it provides that additionally as a special measure, the Government will make a double payment for one week in December in weekly social welfare payments to long-term social welfare recipients.  I appreciate the problem raised by the Senator and by other Senators.  The number of recipients who would be affected in that way would be very small. There will be new beneficiaries but they would normally have come from a situation in which they would have had better benefits and they will be coming on to some long-term benefits.  They would not have been on it for any long term or medium term, they would be only commencing on it.  I said that if it is feasible, I would certainly subsequently consider any measure which might bring them in. Certainly in relation to this Bill I feel that to go back and amend it at this stage would be very difficult administratively.</P>
    <P>On this particular question, some of the very late claims will not be decided until well into next year in any event &mdash; into January.  Nevertheless, I will see if anything can be done in relation to this matter but it is very important to get this Bill through now without delay.  It is very urgent.  If it does not go through now, then the effects of that will be to delay the payments before Christmas, which I trust the Senators would not want.</P>
    <P>The question of omissions from the Bill <Col N="136" /> was mentioned.  There are no omissions from the Bill in relation to the undertaking that was given in the national understanding and that was that the long-term recipients would receive benefits.  To include unemployment assistance would add about 194,400 beneficiaries or 64,300 payees.  These have not been regarded to date as long-term.  I appreciate the points made by the Senators but the Bill is entirely in agreement with the arrangements which were made under the national understanding.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that some people were concerned about possible delays in paying this money.  In effect, the approach on this occasion in that people with existing pension books will be paid on the double &mdash; in other words, you just bring in your existing pension book and you are paid twice on the face value of the relevant payable voucher.  I can assure Senator Lanigan that there will be no postal delays in this case; postal cases will go out in late November and that should, hopefully, be an advantage to a small number that are involved in that area.</P>
    <P>These were references to the fuel scheme; it is important just to mention, very clearly, that the national fuel scheme does include an additional 26,000 people; it does represent approximately 70 per cent overall increase in expenditure in that area this year.  That is very substantial. I appreciate that some Senators said that they would like to see further improvements and certainly would like to see them in the future.  I note the point made by Senator Honan in relation to the handicapped and I thank her for the welcome which she has given me here.</P>
    <P>In relation to the consumer price index, it is fairly clear that the increases given in April of this year of 25 per cent are greater than the 18.85 per cent being the annual increase to August or, if you relate it to our total expenditure, you will find it very much greater in effect.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Senators that we will advertise this widely to make it known very clearly and implement it as expeditiously as possible.  I would hope that the Senators would facilitate me in getting it through the House.</P>

      <P>I was not quite clear from the Minister's reply as to the scope of the concept of eligibility in the Bill where a person becomes entitled.

      <P>If that is the case, would it not be relatively simple to provide that a person who did not happen to become eligible in that week beginning 12 December but would become eligible in the following week or the final week in December could similarly and subsequently receive the benefit?  It is clear that administratively the Minister is already paying a monthly cheque earlier to those who are paid by month; the norm of those who are eligible weekly on 12 December will be paid and then there are these other cases where the eligibility has not been finally determined who will subsequently get paid.  It seems to me to be a relatively small, but nevertheless for the families concerned, an important point.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1966 an order was made at the request of the Arts Council which enabled the council to create and administer a fund, Ciste Cholmcille, out of which grants and annuities were paid to creative artists who, by reason of age or ill-health, were unable to provide properly for themselves.  Under the 1966 order the fund was to be made up of subscriptions alone and the council's annual grant-in-aid could not be drawn on for the fund.  The council advised that the level of the fund was not sufficient to provide assistance to the extent they would wish and they asked that they be empowered to make an allocation from their annual grant to the fund.  The order proposes to do this, subject to a limitation to be decided by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the principle purpose of the order but the opportunity has been taken to make two other changes requested by the council.  The 1966 order restricted the council to investing the fund in Irish Government securities and to paying annuities or grants to the artists themselves and not to their dependants.  The council asked for the removal of these restrictions to enable them to invest the fund in securities which are authorised in respect of trust funds and other securities which may be approved by the Minister for Finance, and also to broaden the range of those who receive assistance from the fund to include the widows or widowers or other dependants of creative artists in cases where the council may deem it necessary.  On 3 September this year the Government made an order, the Arts Act, 1951 (Additional Function) (Amendment) Order, 1980, which was confirmed in Dáil Éireann and registered on 29 October 1980.  This amending order will permit the Arts Council to make the changes they have sought in the administration of this very useful fund.  I ask the House to endorse this worthy proposal. <Col N="140" />  I hope it will also help to bring to public notice the existence of such a fund and encourage subscriptions from firms and individuals.  I am sure Senators will join me in commending the Arts Council for the steps they have taken to improve the position of individual creative artists when circumstances require they should do so.</P>

      <P>Courtesy requires me to extend a welcome to the Taoiseach in the capacity in which he now comes to the Seanad and to express regret that various decisions do not require his attention in this House more often.  Interest in the debates would be increased for me and I would from time to time address myself to less agreeable topics than orders made under the Arts Act, 1951. On this occasion I will be courteous, I hope, and certainly orderly.  The order is welcome.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach had himself properly briefed for this debate, an inadequacy I would not have expected from him, but he should have explained to the House the important provision in section 547 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which provides for relief from income tax in all the cases of gifts made, where the gifts can be shown to relieve the Minister for Finance from sums which otherwise would fall for payment out of the public purse.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the fund which was established by the order of 1966 is that up to the time when this order now proposed is made, gifts given to that fund were not and are not deductible for the purposes of tax.  Accordingly, one of the effects of the order, whether the Taoiseach knew it or not &mdash; courtesy requires me to assume that he knew &mdash; is going to make gifts to the fund deductible whether they are made by business organisations or by anyone else.  With this addition for the provision of public funds this fund may receive gifts which can be demonstrably in relief of money that would otherwise come from the public purse.  The Taoiseach should have told us of the remarkable improvement which the order is going to make in the encouragement of the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One knows the section has been operated <Col N="141" /> with great discrimination and full understanding by the Revenue Commissioners during this year and with the full co-operation and understanding of the Arts Council.  The position up to this has been that if the Arts Council could nominate a body &mdash; any body involved in the Arts &mdash; as being a body to which they proposed to give £10,000 and if they told the Revenue Commissioners that they would be saved £10,000 if firm X made a gift of £10,000 in aid of the arts, that would have been a deductible expense for the company.  We should be aware that this is a provision of the income tax code.  The income tax code, as we all know, only applies to individuals.  There is a new corporation tax and I do not want to develop this into a lecture on tax law.  Senators would be interested to know if there is an equivalent provision in the corporation tax code giving corporation relief for gifts they may make under terms similar to those which can be made by payers of income tax under section 547 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  It would be useful if we had some indication of the status, as the Taoiseach understands it, of the gifts of companies to this body and to all similar bodies concerned with the advancement of the arts.  It is a great defect in our overall tax system that we, simply in a measure which was designed to establish the State's independence of the Church, amended our law some 20 years ago whereby we are in a curious position subject to those few exceptions which have been made specifically in the code over recent years that, unlike the United Kingdom, covenants by individuals for charitable purposes are not deductible whereas rich men can set up funds for their own glory and the glory of the arts.  The income from these funds is exempt from tax and the gifts can be made with appropriate reliefs on capital.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for individuals who wish to give encouragement to charitable purposes.  May it be extended beyond the range of this particular fund? In the matter of establishing the kind of values that the State would wish to declare in its legislation, there ought to be such provision.  I hope the Taoiseach will take my remarks in the spirit in which <Col N="142" /> they are genuinely directed and that in the next Finance Bill there will be a provision amending the general code on this point.  Admittedly, safeguards will have to be introduced to prevent the funds from being applied as they were in a kind of abuse when that amending statute was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lambert:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to support this amendment.  I was aware of this fund and I have subscribed to it.  It was very little known and I hope it will gain the recognition and publicity that is due, so that artists who have contributed so much to the community, and who suffer from poor health, can get the benefit of the fund subscribed.</P>
      <P>I support Senator FitzGerald's proposal that this should be extended because we must think of the younger artists who are endeavouring to make a living.  There are many people in the community who would be willing to sponsor an artist if they got some allowance against income tax.  It would help the artist to use his creative talents, unfettered by the problems of poverty and lack of materials.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said at the opening of Rosc, there is an opportunity for a renaissance for the arts in Ireland.  I hope that this fund will be applicable to artists of the European Community, including Northern Ireland &mdash; who come to live here.  I would like to be assured that the Arts Council would take into consideration those people who come to live in and contribute to our community.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the purpose of this order and join with Senator FitzGerald in welcoming the Taoiseach on his visit to this House for the purpose of the debate.  I am also grateful to Senator FitzGerald for referring to a provision of the Income Tax Act which I had not thought of as being relevant here.  He is making an important point. It increases my support and enthusiasm for the order.  I also support the broader point he makes of the need for tax relief on individual donations to charity, to make that possible under Irish law.  That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary in examining the <Col N="143" /> purpose of this order, and the effect it will have on the 1966 order, to appreciate that we are talking about a very small fund and up to now a rather little known fund.  This is not going to achieve a very important purpose sought by the Arts Council, which is, proper living conditions and benefits for artists.  This is a small, fire brigade measure &mdash; an emergency measure which is important.  I understand the present size of the fund is something like £18,000 and the only payment out that can be made is a payment out of the income invested in authorised securities.  The income from that fund at the moment is something in the region of £1,800 per annum.  This is divided among two, three or four artists in need who qualify under the 1966 order.  Let us not delude ourselves that we are doing what urgently needs to be done, which is, looking into the working conditions, benefits and social welfare conditions of our artists and the very real needs that a number of young artists have and the very worthwhile report that the Arts Council has brought out on this subject.  For a number of reasons, this order should be supported, although I have one serious reservation about it which I would like to ask the Taoiseach to elaborate on in his reply.</P>
    <P>First, there is no doubt that the 1966 order establishing the Ciste Cholmcille was too narrow and technical.  As I have already mentioned, the fund had to be subscribed to by private subscriptions and these could be from exhibitions run by artists who donated the fruits of these or charity shows or companies contributing without benefit of income tax relief, or individuals contributing without benefit of income tax relief on their donations.  I understand that during 1979 the contributions to this fund totalled £264. We are talking about a very modest fund and Senator Lambert is one of the few contributors to this fund.  It is a small but important additional function for the Arts Council to be able to use this fund.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the type of securities which could be invested in was too narrow and that is one of the additional amendments that will be made by this order, which will extend the range of securities.  Most <Col N="144" /> importantly, it will be possible for the Arts Council to use a portion of the grant-in-aid to the Arts Council and I want to come back to an element of that on which I have serious reservations.  The other amendment, which is important in its own way, is that it extends the beneficiary in appropriate cases to include the widow or widower of an artist or the dependants of an artist.  Would the Taoiseach in his reply clarify whether it includes the dependants of an artist who is not necessarily dead but in circumstances where the artist is unable for one reason or a another to look after a wife and children?  Can payments be made at the discretion of the Arts Council to the wife and children in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>I come now to a rather serious reservation about the way in which the Arts Council will come to allocate additional moneys out of its grant-in-aid because paragraph 4(e) of this order will substitute a new paragraph 6 to the 1966 order. This provides that the council may utilise for the purpose of the fund part of the grant and this provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council may utilise for the purpose of the fund part of the grant paid to the Council annually out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, provided that the money utilised under this paragraph shall not exceed in any particular year an amount approved of by the Taoiseach in relation to that year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to be an unusual kind of blanket discretion.  We do not know what the amount will be.  It requires the approval of the Taoiseach for the time being in the exercise of the discretion. The money will be used for what we all acknowledge to be important and legitimate purposes, to help particularly needy artists in urgent, emergency and fire brigade situations, but why is it that particular kind of mechanism?  Why is the Arts Council not the deciding body or why is an amount not allocated, either in the order itself or in a proportion of the grant-in-aid?  A lot of my reservations would be removed if the Taoiseach would spell out exactly how this will work.  For example, on the order as it stands, it <Col N="145" /> would be possibe for a Taoiseach, at some time in the future if he became aware himself, or representations were made to him that an artist was in need, to contact the Arts Council and say &ldquo;use £1,000 out of your grant-in-aid and give this artist the money&ldquo;.  That would not be desirable and I do not think that is the intention that the Taoiseach has but I would like to know what the parameters of this discretion are since the Taoiseach is seeking to get a discretion from this House by way of this order.  I am not in favour of blanket or vague discretions. When a Minister or the Taoiseach comes into this House looking for additional power to authorise, I like to know exactly what it means.</P>
    <P>The amount authorised by the Taoiseach relates to a particular year.  The fund provides an income of £1,800.  Let us be optimistic and hope that as a result of this order and the debate on it, additional publicity and additional support for it, the income of the fund goes up to £3,000.  And the Arts Council at the beginning of the year asked the Taoiseach to authorise a further £27,000 out of the grant-in-aid, bringing it up to a total of £30,000.  If that were done at the beginning of the year or at a specific period of the year by the Arts Council and the authorisation of the Taoiseach was merely a control over public funds then some, at least, of my hesitations about this kind of mechanism would be removed.  This needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The order itself does not specify how the power will be exercised.  I believe that the Arts Council must be the deciding body as to who are the artists in need, who should receive the benefits or, and I welcome this very much, the dependants of the artists who ought to receive a grant or annuity as a benefit.  Let us not delude ourselves that this is the major job that needs to be done for artists in Ireland.  They are a neglected section in their working conditions and, in particular, in their social welfare benefits.  This is a matter which I hope the Taoiseach or the Minister for Social Welfare, will bring before this House in a more major way, at the earliest opportunity, implementing <Col N="146" /> some of the broader requests and recommendations that have been made by the Arts Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson has said much that I wanted to say.  I want to re-echo one or two points which she made in her speech.  It is important to bear in mind that, if we are speaking about assistance for poor artists or their dependants, we are talking against a background in which to date out of Ciste Cholmcille fund, in the last years for which we have statistics available, a magnificent sum of £1,400 was paid in a given year out of that fund in an area with which this amendment of the order is concerned.  It is important to show the minimal extent to which there has been assistance in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to applaud the work of the Arts Council in recent years against very difficult circumstances, in a country which is interested in the arts with a limited budget, and I want to applaud in particular their activities in the provinces in ballet, theatre and the National Opera Company, all of which has been greatly to the benefit of the people.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a broader issue concerned with this amendment.  I am one of those who agree with the original genesis of the Arts Council in the sense that this fund relates directly to the Taoiseach rather than specifically to the Minister for Finance, giving it a certain aura that is apolitical to a degree and is very important.  Whilst there is a consensus that this order should be supported, and I am one of those who support the move to help the dependants of poor artists to a greater extent than we have been doing, we are playing with fire here to the extent that in the annual reports of the Arts Council there has been a repetition of the statement that they are not being funded to a fraction of the extent to which the Government should support them.  This is a criticism they have had of successive Governments and I am not attempting to score a political point here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1977 annual report &mdash; there are no doubt more up to date reports available but I expect the proportions are much the same &mdash; they speak of a commitment <Col N="147" /> by the State to the arts which works out on a per capita basis at 60p, as distinct from Scotland with a commitment in that year of £1.14p, or Wales with a commitment of £1.41p.  In other words, in both Scotland and Wales, there is a commitment by the State running at about double the rate here.  It is a bit premature to talk about a renaissance in so far as State assistance in the arts is concerned.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Taoiseach.  This is the first time I have seen him in the House.  There is a consensus that we should commit ourselves to a greater extent and under this new order we are allowing the Arts Council to fund assistance out of its annual grant, subject to the restrictions mentioned by Senator Robinson where the Taoiseach in any one year may approve.  Whether it is approval in advance or retrospectively is not spelt out here and there are areas that need clarification.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, if the Arts Council have an annual budget from the State and if the method of funding the poorer artists and their dependants is by allowing the Arts Council out of that annual budget to assist where they were not previously implicated, unless there is a commitment by Government to increase their commitments to the Arts Council over the level of inflation and over the present level of support to specifically allow the Arts Council to carry out this new duty, then the arts are going to suffer.  The Taoiseach has said in this House that it is his intention to see that in so far as the Arts Council will be dispensing some of its grant-in-aid for this new purpose, he will give effect to a position where they get an increase in their annual budget over and above inflation and the other needs of the arts specifically to allow them to do this without detriment to the main function of the Arts Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for its general welcome of this measure and I am glad to deal with the points raised by Senators and perhaps to give some reassurance.  I fully recognise the distinction there is between this measure <Col N="148" /> and indeed the fund to which it relates and a policy of support and encouragement for the arts generally.  This is a very strict and narrow field that we are dealing with here.  Senator Staunton mentioned, and I think Senator Robinson also, that the amounts paid put of this fund are minimal.  I recognise that.</P>
      <P>We would all wish that there was never any need to pay anything at all out of this fund, that, in fact, we would arrive at a situation in this country in which creative artists would be so fully supported by the community that they would not fall into the sort of situation in which they would have to have access to this fund.  That would be the ideal situation but I suppose it is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future.  While it is not likely to happen, therefore, we must make some provision for the unfortunate eventuality of some artists or their dependants falling on very hard times.  That is what this fund is there to cope with.  I suppose those who established the fund Ciste Cholmcille originally had high ideals or high hopes for it.  Their idea was that wealthy persons would make fairly large, if you like, once-off donations to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent the idea of allowability for income tax purposes was not considered when the fund was established because the concept was that perhaps persons would, in their wills or otherwise, make fairly substantial donations to the fund which would then become the capital of the fund and that that capital would earn annually enough to meet any demands that might be made on the fund. Unfortunately that just has not happened.  The great bulk of the contributions to the fund was made in the early days when it was set up and, to that extent, it has been largely moribund since, so that the Arts Council felt it necessary to do something about it.  It is hopefully a restricted area of operation for the Arts Council but nevertheless an important one, indeed, in any case, I suppose, a very humanitarian one.  The Arts Council hit on this idea that they would be permitted, out of their own grant, to make a contribution to this fund.  The system they propose and <Col N="149" /> enshrined in this measure is the best one we could come forward with.  There are many other ways of dealing with this problem but I think this is the one that offers most flexibility.  This is a situation which requires flexibility and a sympathetic and understanding approach.</P>
    <P>In response to the point made by Senator Robinson, there would be absolutely no question of the Taoiseach or indeed anybody in the Executive being involved in individual cases.  In fact I have made it my business not even to look at the names of those who have benefited from the fund to date.  I would always propose to continue to adopt that attitude, except, of course, in so far as any of us, as public representatives, might be approached from time to time in regard to a particular case.  In that way I would purport to behave just like any other Member of the Oireachtas or any other public representative in regard to that particular case, that is, to make representations to the Arts Council in the normal way.  Furthermore, the <i>modus operandi</i> would be that the Arts Council would suggest to the Taoiseach of the day, at the beginning of the year, what sum might be included in their grant for this Ciste Cholmcille.  That would normally be the end of the matter but one could visualise that, as the year progressed, it might be necessary from time to time to make additional provision.  The system that we propose gives the flexibility to do that.  For instance, tomorrow morning I will be bringing in a Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil for the Arts Council for this year, which indicates that it is not always possible at the beginning of the year to estimate precisely and exactly what the Arts Council will require for their purposes during the whole year.  The Supplementary Estimate I will bring in tomorrow will be somewhere around £300,000.  That gives an idea of the extent of the additional demands that may arise on the Arts Council during the course of a year.  I would visualise that the procedure would be that, at the beginning of the year, some sum would be fixed to be made available by the Arts Council to Ciste Cholmcille.  Here I want to make the point that this would almost certainly be <Col N="150" /> a capital sum.  My view would be that the Arts Council should continue to operate Ciste Cholmcille on the basis of a capital fund the proceeds of which would be available for its purposes during the year so that it would not be necessary in any year &mdash; I would hope that it would not be the case &mdash; that the grant for the Arts Council to Ciste Cholmcille would be the amount that they would foresee arising as having to be paid out during that year. Rather would I visualise that they would create a capital fund the proceeds of which would meet their purposes.  As to the Taoiseach being given the responsibility, I can think of no more worthy or suitable person to be given this responsibility.</P>

      <P>I am ready to believe that is a faint possibility, yes.  But I want to make the point that normally the constraint here is vested in the Minister for Finance.  We have I think built up a sort of happy tradition in this country that you take the arts away from this hard-featured, blunt-nosed &mdash; is that the word I am seeking?  &mdash; Minister for Finance and give it to the Taoiseach because theoretically at any rate he holds a much more flexible sympathetic sort of office than the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are just following through here.  I think the House would accept that there must be some restriction on the Arts Council and the amount they place to the credit of Ciste Cholmcille lest perhaps they go too far one way or another.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas would wish, as they must I think, to have some control of this perhaps the most flexible and sympathetic office through which to have this control exercised is that of the Taoiseach.  That is why it is the Taoiseach, and it is not for any other reason than that.  I would make the point again, and it is important in this connection, that the Taoiseach's power limitation would be directed more towards the <Col N="151" /> amount that can be put aside as a capital sum rather than immediate and direct control over the annual payments.</P>
      <P>Of course all this begs the very important question which was raised here, that is, the area of operation of Ciste Cholmcille in relation to the whole field of support for the arts and indeed the artist. Perhaps it is important that we should make that distinction between support for the arts and support for the artists.  As I hope many Senators would know, I have been giving a great deal of thought to this matter and I have spoken about it on a number of occasions, that, it is fairly easy to support the arts &mdash; in inverted commas &mdash; but it is not as easy to support the creative artist, particularly to support the creative artist in his creativity.  Thus the difficulty; it is very easy to give a particular sum of money to a particular organisation or institution, or to subsidise some public performance.  That does not present any Government, Minister or Taoiseach with any great problem.  But it is not the answer that we are seeking.  Senator Robinson spoke about this and about the report which the Arts Council has about the living and working conditions of artists.  I just want to assure the Senator that that matter is very actively under consideration at present. It is something that should be done side by side with Ciste Cholmcille but with totally different and separate funds. Indeed, if this policy and the other aspects that we are talking about are developed sufficiently it would, as I said at the beginning, render Ciste Cholmcille unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper functioning of an arts policy, whether public or private, would ensure that artists were properly rewarded for the valuable contribution they make to our society and to our community.  That is not at issue here today. I will, I hope, be coming back to the Oireachtas with a different set of proposals in that area arising out of the difficulty that we have in subsidising creativity, as such, in our community and in our society.  I would hope that the House would agree, that in trying to provide for artists and their dependants who are falling on <Col N="152" /> bad times, this Ciste Cholmcille, as now amended, will meet that limited area of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked me specifically about the question of a dependant of an artist who, as she put it rather quaintly was not necessarily dead.  There is I suppose a great tradition in the world of art that we do not honour people sufficiently until they are dead.  But there would be no such restriction.  The Arts Council will have whatever flexibility they need to cope with the sort of situation that Senator Robinson has in mind and adverted to.</P>
    <P>In reply to a specific point made by my good friend Senator Lambert, the order refers to &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo;.  I trust that answers his point in that regard.</P>
    <P>The question of the Revenue Commissioners raised by Senator FitzGerald is a very difficult and complex one.  Indeed I had hoped it would not arise in this context.  But briefly, in regard to Ciste Cholumcille, the situation would be that the Revenue Commissioners will rule in regard to any particular contribution as to its eligibility for relief under section 547.  The broader question is one which is tied up with the broader policy of support for the arts generally, namely, whether or not particular contributions for artistic, cultural purposes by individuals or corporations should have some benefit by way of income tax or corporation profits tax relief.  That is something I do not want to go into today because there is a lot to be said on both sides of that particular proposal.  Senator FitzGerald knows better than anybody else that the situation in some countries is not at all satisfactory, whereas ostensibly the arrangements are entirely beneficial from the point of view of the creative artist, in fact, they do not work out that way and they can be very gravely abused by individuals and corporations.  We do not want to fall into that particular trap in dealing with this matter, in other words, make some provision which on the face of it would be entirely beneficial from the point of view of the arts and our cultural situation generally but which, in fact, would not redound to that purpose at all in the end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> May I reiterate that this is a very limited area of operation that we are dealing with in this motion.  I recognise and understand that but nevertheless it is worth while doing for what it does and I trust I have reassured the Senators on the points which they have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I could put two brief questions to the Taoiseach arising from his reply which clarified a number of points.  As I understand it, the moneys which would be paid out of the grant-in-aid to the Arts Council would be a capital sum to be put then into Ciste Cholmcille.  That makes it all the more important that we understand how that will affect the present grant-in-aid to the Arts Council.  If it is a capital sum it will have to be, in crude terms, at least ten times greater than the income that it will provide to be paid out to the actual beneficiaries.  Therefore, as a capital sum, we would be talking in quite large figures I assume.  I am not asking the Taoiseach nor do I expect a specific figure, for example for 1981 or 1982, but what order of money are we talking about when we talk about capital sums to go into Ciste Cholmcille?  I think Senator Staunton raised this point.  We assume this will be in excess of the present budget of the Arts Council, which I think is not only fully taken up but requires a Supplementary Estimate this year, to which the Taoiseach referred.</P>
      <P>My second question is: given that a lot of us did not know very much about Ciste Cholmcille and how it is administered, is it going to be something that we will be informed about in this House?  How much money was placed from Government moneys into the fund of Ciste Cholumcille and what size is the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="An Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there is an account for Ciste Cholmcille attached to the annual report of the Arts Council. That practice will be continued.  Apart from that it is an area to which up to now, at any rate, there has not been any great wish on the part of the Arts Council to direct too much attention or publicity. The Senator will understand and appreciate the reasons for that.  I do not want <Col N="154" /> to be too dogmatic about it being all entirely capital.  That is the ideal that we should aim at, that the fund could be built up to a position where it would carry on on its own and meet whatever demands are made on it from its income.  But that might not be possible in circumstances in a particular year.  I do take the point that if we were to take any one particular year and provide enough for An Chiste Cholmcille to make it capital-proof for the future that might, in that particular year, make a particularly savage inroad into the general budget of the Arts Council. I can assure the House that that will not happen.  We will approach this with the maximum amount of flexibility and understanding and with the greatest possible degree of discussion with the Arts Council as to their view of what is likely to occur during the year and over a period of years.  It is a sensitive and human area. Therefore it will have to be dealt with by the Taoiseach of the day and by the Arts Council in a sympathetic, understanding and flexible manner.</P>

Phleámar an Bille i leith an fhorais i Luimneach go mion sa Dáil agus sa Teach seo.  Sna toscaí, tá suíl agam go mbeidh ar chumas an Tí seo glacadh leis <Col N="156" /> an mBille seo go fonnmhar.  Tá ag an Teach buntáiste na ndióspoíreachtaí a bhí againn cheana féin le linn don Bhille faoi Luimneach a bheith á phlé.</P>
    <P>Tá rian an Achta sin le feiceáil ar an mBille seo freisin agus measaim go luíonn sé le reásún go mbeadh na Billí don dá Fhoras ar an dul céanna;</P>
    <P>Measaim go mba chóir dom anois cuid bheag de dhúlra an scéil a thabhairt.  I 1969 iarradh ar an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas tairiscint a fuarthas ó Choiste Ghairm Oideachais Bhaile Átha Cliath maidir le bunú coláiste nua Teicneolaíochta agus Tráchtála i mBaile Munna a scrúdú agus moltaí ina leith a chur faoi bhráid an Aire Oideachais.  Sa tuarascáil ón Údarás um Ard-Oideachas, a cuireadh ar fáil i Mí na Nollag 1970 moladh go n-aithneófaí an géar-ghá a bhí le níos mó saoráidí oideachais den triú leibhéal i mBaile Átha Cliath, go mór mhór i limistéar na teicneolaíochta.</P>
    <P>Thaobhaigh an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas leis an dtairiscint go mbunófaí an coláiste nua i mBaile Munna dá mbeadh na hudaráis chuí go léir sásta nach raibh suíomh ní ba lárnaí ar fáil. Ghlac an tAire Oideachais leis na moltaí seo agus shíolraigh An Foras Náisiúnta um Ard-Oideachas i mBaile Átha Cliath as an mbreith sin.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition Government's decisions of 13 December 1974, in relation to higher education included the following in relation to the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin:</P>
    <P>(i)  The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin shall be a recognised college of either of the Dublin Universities with the capacity to evolve into a constituent college of one or other of the Dublin Universities or to become an autonomous degree-awarding institution</P>
    <P>(ii)  The majority of the members of the governing body of the NIHE, Dublin shall be nominated by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and shall include representatives from the trade unions, agriculture, business, industry and educational interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> (iii)  A Council for Technological Education (later re-styled National Council for Educational Awards) shall be established to plan and co-ordinate courses and to validate and award non-degree third-level qualifications in the NIHE Dublin (and other institutions).</P>
    <P>(iv)  The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin shall be a designated institution for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>(v)  The governing body of the NIHE Dublin shall consist of twenty-five members. </P>
    <P>On 5 March 1975 the Government approved a list of names of persons to be invited to act on the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  An acting director was appointed on 18 June 1975 and the first meeting of the governing body was held on 19 June 1975.  The terms of reference of the governing body included responsibility for the planning, in consultation with my Department, of the form and structure of the institute, the courses and staffing requirements, and all other details of the new institution, and for making recommendations to the Minister for Education consequent on these consultations.  The terms of office of this <i>ad hoc</i> governing body have been extended until the institute is established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I must record my appreciation of the work of the governing body.  It is a challenging task, but never simple, to oversee the establishment and development of a new institution, We were fortunate to have a group of people who were generous with their time and expertise.</P>
    <P>On 14 December 1976 the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, was designated by the then Minister for Education, as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>A director for the institute was appointed on a permanent basis and took up duty on 21 March 1977.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Education, one of my first actions as Minister <Col N="158" /> was to restore to the National Council for Educational Awards its degree-awarding function.  On 18 November 1977 I announced that the NCEA was to be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree level courses in the NIHE Dublin &mdash; and also in the NIHE Limerick, the Thomond College of Education and the Regional Technical Colleges.</P>
    <P>In May 1978 the Government decided that the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin would be a third level educational institution offering degree, diploma and certificate courses with a mainly technological bias and that the institute would cater for students in the Dublin area and the country generally. The Government authorised me to negotiate for the acquisition of the site at Ballymun and to invite tenders for the building of phase I of the institute &mdash; a college of commerce capable of accommodating 800 students.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in establishing a new institution of this type in the Dublin area, is the difficulty of obtaining a suitably located site big enough to provide adequately for the requirements of the institution.  The price of land in the Dublin area adds considerably to the cost of the project.  Before finally deciding on the Ballymun site a number of other possible locations were considered.  Either these were too small in area or they were too far out from the city centre and required vast investment in infrastructure &mdash; roads, water, sewage and other services.  The site at Ballymun was finally decided on as the most feasible site available.  It was purchased for a substantial sum.</P>
    <P>Renovation work on part of the existing Albert College buildings commenced in January 1980 and has only recently been completed, providing about 3000 square metres of accommodation.  Work on the new commerce building also commenced in January 1980 and it is expected that the commerce building will be ready for occupation in Autumn 1981.</P>
    <P>The commerce building will accommodate 800 students and the renovated part of the Albert College buildings will accommodate about 200.  The total cost <Col N="159" /> of site purchase, construction works, and equipping these two buildings will be in the region of £6½ million.</P>
    <P>Due to the delay in completing the renovation work at the Albert College buildings, it was not possible to admit the first group of students to the institute until 11 November 1980.  To compensate for this late opening the institute will continue its summer term into July 1981.</P>
    <P>The demand for places in the institute has been so high that the accommodation is being pushed to the limit and a bigger number of students will be admitted than originally intended with the limited facilities.</P>
    <P>About 240 students will be admitted to six degree courses &mdash; business studies, accounting and finance, computer applications, communications studies, analytical science and electronic engineering. The form of selection of students is based on leaving certificate results plus aptitude tests.</P>
    <P>About 55 per cent of students will come from outside Dublin city and county indicating that the institute is national in its appeal, and about 5 to 10 per cent of the students will be mature students, showing the institute's commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>The outline and structure of the courses have already been approved by the National Council for Educational Awards and the first two years &mdash; in some cases the entire four years &mdash; of each programme have been planned in detail by the institute and approved by the council.  The programme will be practically oriented and the institute will operate a system of monitored industrial placement.  The benefits for all concerned of this type of relevant practical work experience are incalculable.  Not only does the student gain useful experience and an advance insight into his eventual working environment but employers become familiar with the abilities and skills of the institutes' graduates and a very valuable feedback is provided between academics and employers as to the requirements of industry and the new and different skills available.</P>
    <P>The role of industrial liaison is most <Col N="160" /> important in any technological institute. The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, is already moving to implement this role in different ways.  In addition to the industrial placement element of courses, the institute is considering part-time courses for industry and business.  It has recently appointed a head of industrial liaison to develop and co-ordinate the institute's interaction with industry.  Many of the senior staff have come direct from industry, some of them Irish returning from abroad; and industrialists sit on academic selection boards.</P>
    <P>The institute has a firm commitment to new technology, and applied research programmes are being devised.  All staff have a proven record in research and a commitment to the development of research.  The institute has already begun its first research project in the applied physics area with a grant awarded by the National Board for Science and Technology.  This underlines the real commitment of the institute to applied research and is additionally significant in that it has been achieved before students arrive.</P>
    <P>The next phase of buildings will concentrate heavily on the provision of places for technology, science and engineering, and will provide 2,700 places.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are identical with the provisions of the National Institite for Higher Education, Limerick, Act, 1980, passed by both Houses earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the interpretation of the various terms used in the Bill. Section 2 establishes the institute which shall be known in the Irish language as An Foras Náisiúnta um Árd Oideachas, Baile Átha Cliath, and in the English language as the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  Section 3 defines what is meant by membership of the institute and section 4 provides for the functions of the institute.</P>
    <P>The functions are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide degree level courses, diploma level courses and certificate level courses and, subject to such conditions at the Minister may prescribe, such other courses, including post-graduate courses as <Col N="161" /> may seem appropriate to the governing body;</P>
    <P>(b)  to engage in research in such areas as the governing body may deem appropriate;</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás</P>
    <P>(i)  to buy and acquire lands or buildings,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to institute, and if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes and other awards.</P>
    <P>(d)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to maintain, manage, administer and invest all the money and assets of the institute.</P>
    <P>(e)  to accept from donors gifts of land, money, or other property upon such trusts and conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donor, provided always that nothing in any such trust or condition is contrary to the provisions of the Act;</P>
    <P>(f)  subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, to do all such acts and things may be necessary to further the objects and development of the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of a governing authority for the institute, to be known as the governing body, and prescribes its structure and functions.  More detailed provisions for the operation of the governing body are set out in the First Schedule.  The governing body are to consist of a chairman, the director and 23 ordinary members.  The chairman and the 23 ordinary members shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister. The manner of appointment of the 23 ordinary members is set out in section 5 (4) and is as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  Nine shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of section 5 (5), which draws particular attention to the need for adequate representation of industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and the professions;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> (b)  Three shall be appointed who shall be members of the academic staff of the institute who shall be chosen by the academic staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(c)  One shall be appointed who is a member of the non-academic staff of the institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(d)  Two shall be appointed who are fulltime students of the institute chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body;</P>
    <P>(e)  Three shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staffs of the colleges of technology managed by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee;</P>
    <P>(f)  Two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the teaching staff of regional technical colleges;</P>
    <P>(g)  Two shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister from members of the management boards of regional technical colleges; and</P>
    <P>(h)  One shall be appointed on the recommendation of the governing body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick. </P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the functions of the governing body.  The governing body shall manage and control all the affairs and property of the institute and shall perform all the functions conferred on the institute by this Act and shall have all such powers as may be necessary under this Act for this purpose.  The governing body may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks proper to assist it in such manner as the governing body shall direct and the governing body may assign to any committee so appointed such duties as it thinks fit. The acts of any such committee shall be subject to confirmation by the governing body unless the governing body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> Section 7 provides for a post of chief officer of the institute, to be known as the director.  The Second Schedule sets out the conditions governing the appointment of the director.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the establishment of an Academic Council for the institute and prescribes the functions of the council.  The academic council acts as specialist advisers to the governing body on academic matters.  Its functions relate to the planning, co-ordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the institute.  The membership and terms of office of the Academic Council are determined by regulations made by the governing body.  Section 8 (3) lists particular functions of the council as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  to design, develop and implement appropriate programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(b)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the establishment of appropriate structures to implement such programmes of study;</P>
    <P>(c)  to make recommendations to the governing body on programmes for the development of research;</P>
    <P>(d)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students generally;</P>
    <P>(e)  to make, subject to the approval of the governing body, and to implement the academic regulations of the institute;</P>
    <P>(f)  to propose to the governing body the form of regulations to be made by the governing body for the conduct of examinations and for the evaluation of academic progress;</P>
    <P>(g)  to make recommendations to the governing body for the award of fellowships, scholarships, bursaries, prizes or other awards;</P>
    <P>(h)  to make general arrangements for tutorial or other academic counselling;</P>
    <P>(i)  to exercise any other functions, <Col N="164" /> in accordance with the provisions of the Act, which may be delegated to it by the governing body; and</P>
    <P>(j)  to implement any regulations which may be made by the governing body concerning any of the matters aforesaid. </P>
    <P>With the approval of the governing body, the academic council may establish such and so many committees either consisting wholly or partly of persons who are not members of the institute as it thinks proper to assist the academic council in the performance of its functions and may determine the functions of any committee so established.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the staff serving in the <i>ad hoc</i> institute may be transferred to the service of the statutory body and protects the conditions of service, pay, and pension rights of the transferred staff, which will not be any less favourable than the conditions they enjoyed while serving as members of the staff of the <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
    <P>Section 11 places responsibility on the institute to prepare and submit to the Minister as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, a pension scheme for staff.  All provisions of any pension scheme submitted by the institute will be subject to the approval of the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service.  Every approved scheme will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution within twenty-one sitting days.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires the governing body to submit to the Minister annually a report of the work of the institute.  The section also provides that the institute will give the Minister any information about its operation that he may require from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that in each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by the Higher Education Authority to the institute, out of moneys received by the authority under section 12.1 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, a grant or grants or such amount or amounts as the authority thinks fit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> Section 14 requires the institute to keep accounts which must be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When the Institute receives the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts, it must submit this report, with the accounts, to the Minister.  The Minister will lay the accounts, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the institute to charge fees for admission to courses, lectures, examinations, exhibitions or any other event held by the institute or for admission to any event held at the institute.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is the usual provision that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the short title and the commencement date.</P>
    <P>The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin is being established statutorily at an earlier stage of its development than was the corresponding institution, the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  But developments since 1972, when the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, first opened its doors have not only proved the wisdom of the decision to establish one new third-level institution of this type, but have demonstrated clearly the necessity to establish at least one more such institution, which will concentrate on producing more graduates trained in the new technological skills for which there is such a demand.</P>
    <P>Now, an institution like the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, is not merely accepted, but widely welcomed.  Its advent could not be more opportune at a time when manpower requirements show how acute is our need for an increase in the supply of trained technologists.  The institute will contribute substantially to meeting this demand, with emphasis on the areas of electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, analytical science, biotechnology and computer applications.</P>
    <P>The institute completes the integrated, <Col N="166" /> complementary complex in the third-level non-university area, constituted by the RTCs, the colleges of technology, the NIHEs and the NCEA.  It will interact with the RTCs in the same way as the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.  The National Council for Education Awards will have an important co-ordinating role to play in approving credit for council-approved programmes in the various institutions.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been modelled on the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, Act, 1980, which was discussed in detail in this House earlier this year.  I would, therefore, expect a speedy passage for this Bill and likewise when the universities legislation comes, I hope to have the National University of Dublin Bill before the Oireachtas before very long followed by Cork, Galway and May-nooth.  I hope that dealing with one early on will expedite the handling of the others.</P>
    <P>Molaim mar sin an Bille don tSeanad mar thogra a bhfuil lán-mhuinín agam as ó taobh leas na tíre agus an oideachais.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald.</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is entirely right in saying that the institution to be established by this Bill when enacted is not merely accepted but widely welcomed.  In the economic situation in which we find ourselves it is literally true that lack of a sufficient number of skills of an appropriate nature actually reduces the number of people who can be employed.  At this moment we are involved, necessarily in the circumstances which arose, in a makeshift operation in the sense that it would be correct to say &mdash; the Minister may have said it here or in the other House &mdash; it was necessary to have a recruitment campaign abroad to get people with the skills so that others might get employment. That may have, and I think it has, moved to a lower key &mdash; if that is the correct expression &mdash; currently and it has, I think, always contained a bias in favour of Irish people living in Britain.  At the moment we are employing a sort of medium-term, makeshift of giving conversion courses to people coming out of the universities with primary degrees. <Col N="167" /> Again, to show the extent to which I agree with the general objective which the Minister is trying to achieve with this legislation and that relating to the Limerick Institute, it is worth noting that in the IDA plan 1978-82 for the achievement of 75,000 new jobs, the estimate was that 33,000 would be in engineering or in engineering related projects.  The present view, widely expressed, is that this is the kind of demand which is going to be increased if happly we continue with successful promotion in the hands of the IDA.  There will be continued emphasis on the creation of engineering and engineering related projects, whether mechanical, electrical or electronic.</P>
      <P>Oddly enough, I know something about this though I am no engineer, simply through my professionsl operations and I have learned a good deal about the way things are going in this area.  Therefore, in general I am very much in favour of this Bill.  I do not wish to engage in nay particular probe but simply to consider how we might structure these things for the future.  To what extent was everyone surprised that the IDA seem to have achieved their objective so far?  To what extent did our institutions of Government react on the assumption that there would be success in the achievement of these targets?  To what extent have we lost out through a certain degree of inflexibility in our institutions?  To what extent, for example, at this moment is the impact on the whole tone of Irish life being estimated by anybody at any level in terms of one authority's operations towards achieving an expansion of a particular type of industrial project?  To what extent is there in the thinking lying behind this and the other Bill, for example, any true consideration of, or is there even a sign of an arrangement to consider the social implications of these developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, if this resolution so to speak succeeeds at the rate it has succeeded in the last decade to what extent will there be much more leisure available?  To what extent is there in the thinking of those in charge of education consideration as to what ought to be done to <Col N="168" /> educate the people for the proper utilisation of that leisure?  I know that one of these frightful <i>ad hoc</i> phrases may immediateltly be applied to you if you start any of this kind of talk either on the basis that you are being paternalistic or that you are afraid that some other type of revolution is going to result.  I would be concerned if some other kind of revolution resulted.  I would be concerned, not perhaps for the reason Senator Murphy may think, but for the damaging effect on existing modes of life of any revolution&mdash;revolution as distinct from a gradual evolution, an adaptation to the institution.</P>
    <P>I know that the decision has been made and the Minister obviously gave great thought to this question of separating the degree-awarding business to these institutions from university education, for example.  I am concerned that in the Minister's statement in his comprehensive speech the six degree courses he listed are business studies, accountancy and finance, computer applications, communications studies and analytical science and electronic engineering.  Simply becaus Senator Murphy never did business studies, accountancy and finance, computer applications, communication studies and analytical science and electronic engineering he should not assume that that was necessarily a bad thing for Senator Murphy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy would be a better example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy may be able to contribute very much more to this because he did not have to spend five years engaged in computer applications, communications studies and even analytical science because I would take the view that Senator Murphy is making supervisor use of his intelligence in doing what he is doing at the university and the better he does this the better I would appreciate his doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a serious point to make here. The Minister is right in expecting a speedy passage for this Bill.  He might have saved himself some printing costs if he had put the two Bills into one, adding <Col N="169" /> Limerick to Dublin: I am applying the word generally to the two of them.  But I would not expect the Minister to get a speedy passage of his univarsity Bill through here.  I think that the introduction of that Bill ought to be assisted by the issue of a memorandum such as we get on these occasions and have got on this occasion.  i would like to see, not exactly a While Paper, but a very full account of the reasoning behind any of the decisions there may be embodied in that university Bill so that there would be a better debate and we would be able to focus our attention on the decesions instead of having to wait and react.  We all know where we would be on this Bill but we might have to be in the position here or in the other House to react on the spot to the real content which would be what the Minister would say in his speech rather than what could be discerned from study of the actual terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For example, one of the things that created a lot of trouble in the United States in 1968 was the general development of the charge that education was being given to the business of producing raw material, a labour force to be employed by capitalists and from which money would be exacted and which would be exploited.  This generally was a criticism.  I would be afraid of how these institutes might go if they were unwisely guided.  I am saying nothing very much but I read with apprehension from page one to whatever was the last page of a symposium which took place on the position in this country on the year 2000. The level of thinking demonstated in, I am bound to say, all of the contributions left me only throughly dismayed.  Really it is only one of the reasons why I am talking at all on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a kind of treason committed by persons who are aware of the value of pure research and of having a proper hierarchy of values applicable to the use of time.  There is an awful betrayal involved in not putting right at the top the pursuit of truth, which is obviously quite maintainable as an objective to be given priority in statutory positions in regard to technological <Col N="170" /> education of the kind we have here.  I am not any socialist but there might have been in the Minister's speech an indication that among the studies that would be made would be study of the processes of government, of how the affiars to this country ought to be administered.  There should be specific training given to people which would form the basis of further study at university level, people whose objective in life would not be to get hired in an electronics company and make £25,000 a year for ten years but whose ambition would be to play a part in the running of their country.</P>
    <P>We heard sounds coming in here earlier this afternoon and probably they will be foolowed by others.  I am not very surprised in view of the quality they are getting, either in terms of Bills introduced in Dáil Éireann, decisions made by the Government or the Opposition or in the level of debate that takes place in these Houses, in the lack of genuine truth in the administration of our affairs and in the expression of our situation to our people.</P>
    <P>In regard to governmental studies, there is the British tradition in the older universities but there is another important tradition.  I attach great importance to the value of academic independence. With the operation of technical academic indepedence, I am shocked at the degree of academic dependence that I find shown in this dear island.  the lack  of usage of the academic independence which the academics are given seems to me to be more a matter for worry than the existence of academic independence. I would like to see academic independence very much more enshrined and protected in these institutes than I thnk the structure provides.  That value is attached very particularly to the British universities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the last time I was roaming on this territory, corrected me and I acceted his correction.  I referred to the traditions in Germany and he added, of course, in France where there is centralised conduct of university affairs and we saw the awful collapse that resulted from that in 1932-33 when the academics just gave in.  I am not drawing any parallel <Col N="171" /> between Mr. de Valera and Adolf Hitler in any way, but whether they were out of their minds or not, at least the academics in Ireland in 1932 did not fall down before majority opinion; at least they maintained independence.  Some of it might have been bloody-mindedness.  The situation was able to produce that and create a good tension in the management of our affairs.  If one goes back to the German situation a little bit further, even as early as the 15th Centuary, one will find deliberate decisions to establish cameralistic institutions specifically designed by the prince and his advisers to produce people who would give him good advice.</P>
    <P>I saw an intervention by a member of the Labour Party in the Dáil, &ldquo;the Lord preserve us from lawyers.&rdquo;  I would like to suggest that you should not be looking to the Lord to do things that you could fo for yourself and I do not believe in the God of the gaps, incidentally.  If you want to be preserved from lawyers, get yourself lawyers, that is te only way.  It is a free activity, this business of preactising law.  It is a free activity telling citizens what their rights are and how to secure them and to be prepared to take on the blasted State if necessary.  it is an abysmally bad situation when I do not know of a Department State that is equipped with an adequate degree of legal skill.  As a result of that and the operation of the bias it reflects, there are defects in a lot of our legislation.</P>
    <P>There are defects in the conditions under which we borrow money, for example, and all sorts of ignorances which betray themselves.  This country will only be governed will if people get over their hang-up because they are used to a certain kind of gassy lawyer or wheeler-dealer attorney because they have a vision of this kind of stage character.  They must understand that the business of running society which is this free and should be determined to be free involves an understanding of what the law ought to be, as well as an application of the law that is.  This is much more important than some of the factors that are listed, that they may have the advantage of producing for companies the skills <Col N="172" /> they are looking for and, more important, other people can get employment because these skills are fed in.</P>
    <P>In our situation the whole industrial development drivehas been successful because it has been postured well with regard to tax relief and grants, presented well by the individuals involved, directed with an understanding of capitalist motivation, which is not to say anything about how the institution of capitalism works. That has been the main source of success. Admittedly in the last couple of years there has been a most welcome development in getting what would, in any case, come about, that is, the Irish supply side to these multi-national corporations. But we have a situation which is very likely to remain where we will have a predominately international flavour in our industry.  Somebody said that there is no stupidity greater than the stupidity of some peopleof sharp understanding and that is extremely true.  I see people with sharp understanding coming out of thes institutes&mdash;and indeed they are coming out of universities today&mdash;who because of that sharpness of understanding have not the patience to reflect on what life is about of what is the object of work, what kind of problems have to be solved for peace, order and good welfare of our people.</P>
    <P>The fact that there us a very strong foreign element likely to remain in our industry means that there is very likely to be reaction against it and that reaction could be extremely damaging to the people who do not really mind very much about the general social situation, provided they can look after their wives and children.  Most people are not too bothered about anything else.  That is all I am concerned with, these people who want to continually lead these kind of lives. What I am really trying to say in relation to all of this is that i am not entirely happy with the decision which seems to be there of the total separation of this system of technological education from the broader academic sphere.  I can see how this decision could hace been made because dealing with professors other than our friend here and trying to get quick decisions would drive you mad.</P>

      <P>I can understand that this is a quicker way to get people with skills than expecting governing bodies of the different colleges to adjust their courses to produce the skills that are necessary.  This is a matter that the Minister in his Department ought to be watching pretty carefully over the years.  It is what I call the &ldquo;cultural factor&rdquo;.  I do not know what are the functions of the Higher Education Authority, but one of them ought to be to direct the Government's attention to changing attitudes and what may be necessaty to make adjoustment to industrial change.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bil, appreciating the need and subject to the general criticism what I had about the Limerick Bill, that I see too much of the Government in it and that we are already too subject to Government in these matters.  i would wish to see more encouragement for freedom in the administration of these colleges and I would like to see their people coming out with as good a degree as it is possible to give them.  I would not like a prejudice to arise in these institutions in producing the kind of person who is good at doing sa job.</P>
      <P>I have been taking to a group who have set up in electronics.  I do not know whether they have actually opened their operations here, but they have been immensely successful in their firld.  This particular company remained ahead of all their competitors because of their design.  They remained ahead because of their design because they found the most able and imaginative employees could not be subject to the normal kind of work discipline and they arranged for an eye-shutting operation to take place with regard to these employees.  They might excuse themselves for this, that or the other reason, but after months of absence would come in, suddenly throw themselves into a frenzy and produce a new design which would put that company again ahead of its compatitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it interesting to discover that much of the success, even on the productivity <Col N="174" /> level, lay in the existence of imaginative people who were not too tied down in their daily operations.  There may be a moral in the tale, which I believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker:</NameTxt>
      <P>Guím rath ar an Institiúid nua seo do Bhaile Atha Cliath.  Is maith agus is mithid ann í.  Tá foireann teagaisc den chéad scoth aici.  An oiliúnt san teicneolaícht a thabharfar faoina scáth is deimhin go ndéanfaidh sí leas na tíre.  Níl rún agam móran moille a chur ar an Teach ná ar an Aire, but I would like to recall that when the prototype of this Bill, namely, the Bill establishing NIHE Limerick, was before the House last July, I spoke on the Second Stage and with the support of Senator West, I introduced amendments on the Committee Stage dealing with two points I considered to be of public interest in relation to third level institutions generally.  The principles which I feared then were not being adequately safeguarded were these. First, the disirability in the public interest of providing expressly in the statute for external participation in the academic posts, not just leaving this to good sense or custom or chance, and also providing for a preponderant weight to be given to the recommendations of assessment boards so constituted.  That is the first principle.  The second is the desirability in the public interest of providing expressly in the statute for periodic external confirmation that the standard attained in degree and diploma courses corresponds to that required for corresponding degrees and diplomas in other EEC countries.</P>
      <P>The amendments attracted some support from Senators on both sides of the House and they were not, indeed, opposed on grounds of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first point, the Minister, while accepting the importance of excellence in appointments and of impastiality in the procedure leading to appointments, indeed the desirability of the kind of assessment procedure recommended in the relevant amendment, saw no need to make mandatory what was already to a large extent being done voluntary in NIHE Limerick and in NUI.  As I said <Col N="175" /> then, and I am repeating it now, I am not persuaded that a matter so important as this should be left entirely to good behaviour.  Many less important matters are being specified and regulated in this governing legislation.  Why should the public interest not be expressly safeguarded in relation to appointment procedures as well?  This is precisely what governing legislation is for.</P>
    <P>As regards the second point I mentioned earlier, periodic advice on the adequacy of standards of degree and diploma courses, there was again general acceptance of the desirability of assuring adequacy of such standards.  The Minister argued that the National Council for Educational Awards could be relied upon to do this and, indeed, he pointed out that they were statutorily obliged to satisfy themselves that standards correspond or are analogous to those in force in &ldquo;universities&rdquo;.  The Minister went on to say that that word was to be read as meaning universities either in Ireland of elsewhere.  The Minister's reassurance on this point is acceptable as far as institutions under the auspices of the National Council for Educational Awards are concerned.  NIHE Dublin will receive its degree and diploma awards from the NCEA.  But there would still be cause for anxiety if the Minister were to follow the model of these NIHE Bills when he comes to introducing new university legislation.  Then at least he should provide expressly for an external check on degree standards.  This safeguard has existed in the case of the National University of Ireland for 72 years and, as I said in July, it has been necessary and has proved its worth.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his closing remarks that he would soon be introducing legislation dealing with the NUI and I am sure that not only will the House get notice of it, with an explanatory memorandum, as Senator FitzGerald requested, but that also the Chancellor and other officers of the University will receive notice of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I will end by drawing attention to section 9 of the Bill which is, I suppose inadvertently, the only section on which <Col N="176" /> the Minister did not comment in his opening remarks.  It is the section dealing with staff.  I argued regarding the corresponding section of the Limerick Bill that the prerogative of deciding initially how many and what kinds of staff they need should be left to the governing body of the institution, indeed generally to the boards of all State bodies, with provision for periodic <i>post factum</i> review of complements and grades.  The staffing provision in the Limerick and now in this Dublin Bill requires the approval of two Ministers for appointments, even though the financial case for staff has to be made to the Higher Education Authority.  This seems an unnecessarily restrictive provision and, as I pointed out before, is out of line with the more enlightened provisions of the Acts relating to the National Board for Science and Technology, An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talamhíochta and Bord na Gaeilge.  Again I earnestly hope that the Minister will not carry these restrictions into university legislation.</P>
    <P>This being said, I would like to express a very warm welcome for the arrival on the educational scene of NIHE, Dublin. It comes just in time to give a fillip to the technological development which is so vital to Ireland's future economic and social progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by congratulating Senator Alexis FitzGerald on a truly marvellous extempore contribution.  It seems to me that if Senator FitzGerald's speeches did not exist we would have to invent them.  May I congratulate you, Sir, for being so indulgent. I took great heart indeed from that same indulgence because it will be remembered in other cases where irrelevance may be alleged.  I sympathise with Senator FitzGerald on his constant timorousness about the possible revolution that is to come.  I understand the grounds for his concern and I pointed them out some years ago in correspondence I had with him but, since I like him, I can only hope it will not happen in his lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really do not understand why Senator FitzGerald kept on implying that institutions like the National Institute for Higher Education would, unless modified <Col N="177" /> in the direction of the humanities, turn out a kind of technological man who would be somewhat less than human.  In his very interesting speech he suggested, for example, that the students there should study government.  I am not so sure that they should.  Who among our governors has studied government?  You might well say that that is a great deficiency in their education.  In point of fact one of the important elements of education in NIHE and in similar colleges such as the polytechnics in Northern Ireland is a strong unit of communication studies. These afford, in an otherwise technological education, a great humane oasis of liberal education, I know many of the people working in these areas in places like the Ulster Polytechnic and indeed already in the up to now <i>ad hoc</i> national institute in Dublin.  I am very confident that this is one of the more successful areas in the NIHEs, if I may use that awful but useful abbreviation, in Dublin and Limerick.  I would not have the same grounds for misgiving as Senator FitzGerald seems to have.</P>
    <P>My misgivings about the Bill are quite other and I am glad that Senator Whitaker reminded us of the discussion we had here last summer.  He raised again the misgivings he had about the appointment system and the need there was to write into such Bills a firm structure of appointment with provisions for external assessors and so on.  Senator Whitaker also pointed to section 9, which deals with the recruitment of staff, and gave his opinion that just as in the case of Limerick, this puts one more ministerial stranglehold on the flexibility of the administration.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the Minister always in this House.  I think he likes coming to the Seanad.  It must sometimes be lonely out there in that sparsely populated wilderness, the intellectual wing of Fianna Fáil, so he is welcome here.  I hope the next time he comes it will be with the White Paper, one of the pieces to be salvaged, we hope, from that once imperishable but now sadly discarded and tattered document, the Fianna Fáil pre-election manifesto of 1977.  I am glad to see the Minister here and, like Senator <Col N="178" /> Whitaker, I welcome the Bill.  I understand the Minister's particular interest in this side of education.  There may be something of a paradox here that being himself in the traditional, not to say the classical, mould he is particularly anxious to see the technological side being developed.  I may confess to the same predilection.  In my case it is because, as I said on the Limerick occasion, we had the salutory experience in UCC of seeing how a traditional university is not fitted to supervise and to mother, so to speak, this new kind of institution.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need for these new structures.  Let us not, however, join in the now fashionable chorus of saying how useless arts graduates are.  I am very glad to be able to support what was said in recent weeks by the university heads in Dublin, Cork and Maynooth about the enduring value of the arts graduate. When one looks at him <i>en masse</i> on conferring days he is a depressing sight in his apparent uselessness.  Yet, there are very comforting studies which show that the unemployable nature of the arts graduate is more apparent and temporary than real.  So then, I welcome the National Institute of Higher Education Dublin in the sense that it is not connected with the traditional Universities, that it is autonomous at least in that sense of not having a big traditional academic brother.  We met some of the NIHE Dublin people here in Leinster House some months ago. They invited us to a conference at which they informed us about how they were setting themselves up and asked had we any questions and so on.  It was a most useful occasion and we were impressed very much by their dedication.  I also fully agree, unlike, I think, Deputy E, Collins in the other House, that the National Council for Educational Awards should be the sole validating body of this institution.</P>

      <Col N="180" /> That Seanad Éireann notes the significance of the report and recommendations of the Brandt Commission contained in &lsquo;North-South: A Programme For Survival&rsquo;, and calls on the Government to respond positively both through Ireland's own approach to North-South issues and also by promoting initiatives in the European Community and the United Nations along the lines recommended in that report.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Brandt report properly entitled &ldquo;North-South: A Programme For Survival&rdquo;.  I would like to thank the Leader of the House for arranging that the debate would take place in the Seanad this afternoon and for fixing a definite time for it so that the debate could take place in its entirely this evening between now and 8.30 p.m.  I welcome the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs here for the debate.  As a former Senator he is familiar with this House and possibly appreciates for that reason the usefulness of debates particularly on reports of this sort being held in the atmosphere of the Seanad, in particular because they are debates on the record.  This enables all of us to make the contribution which we feel the report warrants and to examine the implications for Ireland.  It also enables the Minister, speaking for the Government, to express a view on the Brandt report and, if he so wishes, to give us the Government view and hopefully a Government commitment on the implications of the report itself and indeed in the whole area of development aid and development co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak first of all to the initial part of the motion.  The motion notes the significance of the report and recommendations of the Brandt Commission contained in the report.  Then there is a second part which I will deal with in the second part of my contribution which calls on the Government to respond positively both through Ireland's own approach to this area of development and also by promoting initiatives in the European Community and in the United Nations along the lines recommended in that report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> I suggest to other Senators that these are two distinct aspects of the motion that are before us on which we should each contribute, first, the report itself and its significance and, second, the Irish responsibility, the implications for Ireland and Ireland's whole approach to development policy.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the first part of the motion, the significance of the Brandt report.  It was the result of a study by an independent commission established in 1977 under the chairmanship of Willy Brandt to examine and report to the Secretary General of the United Nations and to the world at large on the whole range of issues under the heading of North-South issues.  The report was completed in December 1979; it was presented to the Secretary General of the United Nations in February 1980; it was published in March 1980 and became available in this country, after some time lag, around about April or May 1980.  It is described by the chairman, Willy Brandt, in his introduction as not intended to be a technical document.  This is important to emphasise.  The members of the commission were not so much experts who had been involved directly in Third World issues for a number of years and who compiled the report out of that expertise, they were chosen more for their experience and their prestige as politicians.  A number of them were former Prime Ministers; a number of them were very significant people in the developing countries who lent their own names and reputations as well as their time and energy to being part of this independent study and part of the ultimate report which now bears the name of its chairman, Willy Brandt.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the proposals in the Brandt Report, criticisms that it is not innovatory, that it is not radically new in many of its recommendations, that it resembles the Pearson Report in 1969, and that even its more far-reaching proposals are matters that have already been the subject of discussion either in an agency of the United Nations or in some other forum.  Indeed, I took part in a very interesting and stimulating <Col N="182" /> meeting here in Dublin last night organised by Comhlámh on the Brandt report in which there was a criticism, for example, about the concept of &ldquo;mutuality of interest&rdquo; between the developed and developing countries, questioning some of the assumptions, questioning what precisely is meant by that mutuality of interest and is it perhaps more the self-interest of the developed world.  I welcome this criticism.  I think that criticism is an important part of the response to the Brandt Report.  It is not something that needs to be accepted in a blanket and unthinking way.</P>
    <P>But some of this criticism can tend to overlook what I believe is the first basic significance of the Brandt Report: that it constitutes on an authoritative document which any of us can purchase and read and, indeed, thanks to the good offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs, we have deposited about 20 copies so we have no excuse for not reading it.  We did not even in the end, have to put our hands in our pockets to purchase it! The first essential feature of the Brandt Report is that it is a process for creating awareness among all of us, politicians and people, of the order of magnitude of the problem of the relationship between developed and developing countries, of the issues of the Third World, of the order of magnitude of the steps that need to be taken to avoid the reality of catastrophe, of starvation on a massive scale, perhaps of ultimate war in the world.</P>
    <P>The first phase then is the analysis and report contained in this book.  It does not worry me that it is not terribly innovative because it is sometimes more possible to get political will to accept a report which is not too surprising and too completely different from what has gone before. That is not to say that the proposals in the Brandt Report are not extremely far-reaching in their thrust, and would not radically change the world as we know it if they were implemented, and do not involve a transfer of resources to the Third World of a kind and on a scale that has not been before.  It is extremely far-reaching in its implications.  Part of that process, then, is the raising of consciousness.  That is phase (1) of the <Col N="183" /> report.  But we have too often seen important reports only reach phase (1) and sit on a shelf, whether they be Irish reports by Irish expert bodies, for example, the Law Reform Commission, or international reports.</P>
    <P>What we must address ourselves to here in this debate is stage (2), the phase of implementation, of seeing how it is possible to move to concrete measures, in other words, the crunch.  Here it is fair to say that the Brandt Report has not been very helpful in itself.  It has not advocated or suggested the steps for implementation.  Indeed, the only references in the rather long and very interesting introduction by Willy Brandt to measures of implementation are his recommendations of the need for a summit for survival, a summit of a number of world leaders who would be representative of the developed and developing world, to discuss the issues as a matter of urgency and his personal appeal to a whole range of different audiences, to world leaders of specific, named countries like the United States, Russia, Japan and other European Community countries and also &mdash; and I think this is an important element in the report &mdash; an appeal to the public generally, to women, to youth, to the trade union movement, to individuals to read and reflect on the issues raised and to respond.</P>
    <P>Apart from addressing himself to these different audiences, neither the chairman nor the report itself gave a natural structure of implementation.  As a result of that, the response to the Brandt report since it was published last March has been rather unstructured, uneven and unpredictable.  Undoubtedly, at the international level, the most important step was the special session of the United Nations in New York in August where the Brandt report and its implications were discussed and where there appears to have been an encouraging measure of agreement on the need for a new international development strategy for the eighties.  I do not think there was formal agreement on this but there appears to have been a political concensus on it.  Perhaps inevitably the blockage or the problem occured when <Col N="184" /> it came to discussing the procedures necessary to launch global negotiations between developing and developed countries, and also on the issue of the role of the central body, the United Nations, and of the specialised financial agencies like the World Bank and the IMF.  As I understand it, the discussion on these issues has been postponed, possibly until January, when there will be further attempts to launch these vital global negotiations.</P>
    <P>What about the reception of and the consideration of the report here in Ireland?  I accept that there will be an inevitable time-lag between the publication of an international report of this kind, even in a Pan Paperback which is intended to be more accessible to the general readership.  But I also feel that this time-lag can be, and in this case should have been, shortened by Government action and leadership.  There should have been more concern by the Government to recognise the importance of this report and to create public awareness and debate on it.  I contrast the position of the Irish Government in this regard with the comparable position of the Dutch Government, because in the Netherlands, two months after the report was published, from the 15-18 may 1980, there was an extremely important symposium held in The Hague.  It was sponsored and promoted by the Netherlands Government and the Netherlands Minister for Development took part, also the Chairman of the Brandt Commission Willy Brandt himself, and the majority of members of the Brandt Commission participated.  So also did leaders of political parties &mdash; Joop den Uyl spoke for the socialist group; leaders of the trade union movement, of the employers, leaders of the Churches and 2,000 members of the public out of 8,000 who wanted to come, because they could accommodate only 2,000 people.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that by the 19 May 1980, it would have been difficult for anybody who was following current affairs matters to be unaware that there was a Brandt report, what it dealt with, what the Netherlands Government thought of it &mdash; because an official reaction <Col N="185" /> of the Netherlands Government was given &mdash; what sectors of industry thought of it, what the ppolitical parties thought of it, what the Church leaders thought of it.</P>
    <P>I have here a summary of that Netherlands symposium and some of the remarks were critical.  It is possibly more difficult to be critical to commissioners to their faces, as the Dutch were to Willy Brandt and his team, but they were very constructive and very worthwhile criticisms.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that, in contrast, here in Ireland the information and the lobby, such as it is, drawing attention to this Brandt Report has really been those involved in Third World agencies, those involved in working, whether researching or actively working in the field for developing countries, bodies such as Congood which has produced an excellent summary of the Brandt report which has been circulated to Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; indeed it was specially prepared for the information of Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; Comhlámh, who organised that meeting last night and who have had others and will be having a public seminar shortly involving representatives of the political parties on the Brandt report, and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace whose report on Ireland's performance in the Third World, a study of Irish Government aid which I will be referring to later, have been responsible for raising public consciousness.  But there has been an absence until now of formal Government response, and that is why I particularly welcome the presence here of the Minister this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the substantive issues in the report I turn now to the rather sharper may be and less comfortable subject of Ireland's record on official development aid.  I would like to begin by contrasting with the official record the response by individual Irish people and by voluntary groups, and communities, in Ireland to appeals for subscriptions for aid for developing countries whether it be in the aftermath of some particularly <Col N="186" /> severe famine or drought or flood in a particular country or whether it be, over time, the consistent appeals for voluntary subscriptions from the large number of agencies which deal with these bodies. There is always a generous response.  It has been surprising to see the figures that have come in that way from Ireland to be transferred to Third World countries, We also have a record that we can be proud of in voluntary service overseas through various agencies.  This is something that Irish people are proud of.  But the problem is that this is allowed to blur the harsh fact that our official aid, our politically structured aid, if I can put it that way, has never been adequate and has now begun to be cut back in a manner which has been described elsewhere, and I repeat that description, as shameful.</P>
    <P>If we look at the figures &mdash; and I am going to look at them now &mdash; there is no other word that can be used.  There is something very Irish about this.  We are generous in a voluntary emotional <i>ad hoc</i> way.  We do not think things through. But development aid requires a structured political response; it requires a development policy; it requires a carryover from year to year and it cannot be one of the first things cut during a particularly harsh year.  If we do nothing else this afternoon, we should address ourselves to the need for more emphasis on the structured political response by this country in terms of its official aid, whether it is bilateral or multilateral, to developing countries.  We must not feel comfortable or complacent about our voluntary contribution.  That is no substitute; it is a very important addition and I do not wish in any way either to denigrate or undermine it; it is very important that there should always be this parallel, voluntary response and voluntary commitment and voluntary work done as we would expect from our record down the years and as we will expect into the future.  But it is no substitute for what is done in the name of the state by the Government for the time being on behalf of the citizens of the State.  In that respect I do not believe that our record is distinguished or even reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> I would like to refer the House to very clear and depressing documentation of Ireland's poor performance contained in this publication prepared by the development research unit of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and entitled &ldquo;Ireland in the Third World: a Study of Government Aid&rdquo;.  A copy of this was sent to Senators and is certainly available in the Library of the Oireachtas. This report documents and details, particularly from pages ten to 12, year by year, the amount of official aid in the budgetary allocations.  I should not start, as I was going to do with the present Government's performance, the post-June 1977 Government.  I will go back to the Coalition era where clearly the figures show that the Coalition Government reneged on promises to achieve half the United Nations official target of aid.</P>
    <P>The official target of the United Nations is .7 per cent of GNP and the Coalition Government committed themselves to reach .35 per cent by the end of 1979.  It was clear in the latter part of the term of office of the Coalition Government that they were falling behind on that, that they were cutting the contribution; that it was becoming more difficult for that target to be reached.  That has to be faced up to by the parties that were in the Coalition.  However, during that period official targets had been properly fixed for the first time.  That is something that credit can be given for.</P>
    <P>Since 1977, since the present Government took office, the picture becomes even more bleak.  It is interesting to tabulate in particular the statements made by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, during 1978, concerning the United Nations target and the aim to achieve 0.35 per cent by 1979 or 1980, and then to note the gradual forgetting of that target, even though it had been set &ldquo;regardless of budgetary considerations&rdquo;.  That is very well tabulated.  Then there is a heading on page 14 which is under a question: &ldquo;What remains of the target for Irish official development assistance?&rdquo; This paragraph summarises the thrust of the very detailed, very particular, very <Col N="188" /> embarrassing figures of Ireland's promise through its Government for the time and failing to meet that promise in its budgetary allocation.  It says that, beginning in the '70's, without any target whatsoever, the financial year 1973-74 saw the initiation of a development co-operation programme paralleled by the enunciation of its specific aid target; that the next six years, 1974-80 were years of making and breaking promises by politicians, of restating and reformulating commitments and because of or in spite of this, official development aid did increase in an erratic, unplanned way by a factor of five when expressed as a percentage of GNP from the very low base of the early 1970s. It says that what has become perfectly clear in the last ten years is the absolute necessity of an unambiguous and clearcut development assistance target formulation combined with appropriate institutional arrangements which would ensure that the target would automatically be complied with from year to year.  That is a point I made earlier.  It is a vital point in assessing Ireland's approach to development aid.  We cannot afford to continue on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from year to year because of the pressures that are there. The Minister may refer to these pressures.  We do have economic recession; we have very high unemployment; we have very high inflation.  As is clearly demonstrated elsewhere in this valuable analysis, a great deal of Ireland's aid of an official sort is first of all obligatory &mdash; 65 per cent is obligatory through our membership of the EEC, of the United Nations and of the International Development Authority.  As far as bilateral aid is concerned a great deal of it is tied aid. It is tied to the purchase of services or the purchase of materials from Ireland.  The real cost to Ireland is much less than the apparent statistical cost.  So we are meaner than we appear, if one looks at the overall statistics.  Yet we have been cutting down in real terms on the allocations and we are further away now from achieving the minimum standard which the United Nations have set as a target for 1990.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider briefly the question: why should Ireland, after all, <Col N="189" /> one of the poorer countries of the European Community and in some ways a developing country, want to set a target to achieve the minimum which the United Nations feels is morally required from developed, industrial countries to developing poor Third World countries? That is worth considering because Ireland likes to exert a moral influence in this area.  Irish Ministers when they go to the United Nations like to speak for developing countries and to say that, as a former colony, Ireland seeks justice and fairness and peace in the world. Within the European Community Irish Ministers would like to exert a moral influence.  Also the Irish people want their Ministers to exert a moral influence in these areas, want Ireland to play a role, albeit as a small country, but nevertheless a role of setting values.  The problem is that we do not have the legitimacy or authority at the moment to play that role.  We have not put our own house in order.  Our own record of official development aid does not entitle us to lecture others and I do not think lecturing is really what we are talking about.  What we are talking about is moral persuasion, persuading the developed world to assume the responsibilities and even the commitment necessary for the survival of the world itself for future generations.</P>
    <P>If the Irish people fully understood how inadequate we are in our official development aid they would be critical of successive Governments for not giving leadership in this respect, of not being willing, even in a way that may hurt, to ensure that we reached the minimum target.  That target has been exceeded by some of the European Community countries, certainly by the Netherlands and by Denmark.</P>
    <P>I have spent a good deal of time talking about the importance of the Brandt Report as a process of creating awareness.  I have not dealt at this stage in detail with the recommendations of the report.  I hope that the Minister will comment in some detail on them because they include extremely far-reaching recommendations for an emergency programme, an action programme for the poor countries; for financial mechanisms <Col N="190" /> which could be very significant in ensuring the transfer of resources; for an order of magnitude of response by the developed world which is somewhat equivalent in a rough way to a Marshall plan, following the second world war, that the United States implemented in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is different from the Marshall Plan in that it is meant to be a very interdependent approach where the countries of the south would bear a major responsibility, have a major role to play and a major voice in it.  They would not be the recipients of some kind of charity but rather work in mutual co-operation on the basis of this mutuality of interest.  I hope the Minister will say, first of all, what Ireland's response is to the Brandt report generally, to the detailed recommendations of the Brandt report and, secondly, how is this response to be matched, first of all in putting our own house in order in regard to development aid and, secondly, in trying to further, if we accept them, some of the approaches and recommendations of the Brandt report.</P>

      <P>Very often when we look at very disturbing sights on television, people who are in a very advanced stage of malnutrition, or read about it in newspapers, we are inclined to get very, very emotional.  Unfortunately, once the film is over or we have laid down the paper, emotion dries up and we subconsciously wish the problem would go away or at least not disturb or annoy us too much.</P>
      <P>The Brandt Commission has painted a picture, not only of the problems of malnutrition but also of what our own behaviour pattern does to us and to other members of the world, north and south.  It paints that picture in a way that demands that we give immediate detailed consideration, not only to the question of malnutrition but to the whole question of social, political and economic inter-dependence.  It goes on to suggest courses of action, maybe not always directly, but indirectly, that need to be undertaken in a lot of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We very often hear great criticism of the trade union movement, and a lot of it is justified, but I am proud to say on <Col N="191" /> this occasion, as a trade unionist, that the trade union movement has taken the Brandt Commission Report very, very seriously.  The World Trade Union Movement have a member on the commission, Mr. Joe Morris of the Canadian Trade Union Congress.  He is a worker representative on the Council of the ILO. We also had a commitment from the World Trade Union Movement and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions had a seminar on the Brandt Commission Report, which was held in Johnstown Castle not long ago.</P>
    <P>The Irish Trade Union Congress has established a working party on third world development.  It is a clear indication that they are seriously concerned about this problem.  It is particularly encouraging to see organised groups reacting to the needs of countries, north and south.  I hope, because of the attitude of the Trade Union Congress, who are often criticised in other areas, that other organised groups who have not yet done so might take the question seriously by getting down to cases on the programme for survival.  The report stresses how important it is that we demonstrate our concern, not only by reading the report but by taking effective action.  We should try to change our behaviour patterns, having regard to the whole question of the inter-dependence of north and south.</P>
    <P>In his introductions to the Commission Report, Mr. Willy Brandt makes a plea for changes in attitudes and behaviour patterns and for peace, justice and jobs. Mr. Brandt's plea has raised hopes of being listened to because, from my reading anyway, the report makes it inevitable for any responsible body or any responsible country to take courses of action that will avoid a disaster that could be worse than Hiroshima, and to draw up short-term objectives which would be designed to realise the long-term goal of living in peace with each other.  This is not sufficient in itself, it is also necessary to think about this great inter-dependence between north and south and to realise that there are no soft options and that we have got to face up to an awful lot of things.  Everybody in responsible <Col N="192" /> positions, north and south, and also Governments, organised groups and so on, should commit themselves to their children and grandchildren so that we can avoid the disaster that can come about if we do not combat causes such as malnutrition.</P>
    <P>We must develop world-wide moral values.  It is not an easy task but the commission urges us in that direction, in the interest of our own survival.  Mutual interests are very strongly spoken of in the report and they have been discussed at great length.  For example, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation had negotiations for about 18 months in Paris prior to the issue of the Brandt Commission Report and running concurrently with those discussions there were world-wide conferences on food, agriculture, population, environment, industrialisation, and so on.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to those negotiations and conferences a brain-storming development and co-operation symposium, jointly organised by the Council of Europe and the OECD, took place in Paris.  Speaking at that symposium, the Pakistani Ambassador to France noted that three years after the CIEC negotiations and world-wide discussions, the balance sheet, in terms of concrete action and progress in negotiations, appeared disappointing.  He said that CIEC was a failure, all the greater because so much effort went into those negotiations which, furthermore, were conducted at a very high level of technical expertise and political authority.  The present position is that negotiations on most issues are deadlocked or marking time.  According to the Brandt Commission Report, we cannot afford the luxury of failure any longer.  It is not a question of negotiations or conferences where entrenched attitudes or political expediency will predominate which can only result in broken promises. The world, north and south, is in a decline.  We have to think seriously what we are going to do about it.  There has been a real decline in the transfer of resources to developing countries despite those negotiations.  The reform of the international monetory system is not finalised.  It is stalemated.  Maybe somebody <Col N="193" /> with more experience in this area might comment on the monetary system.</P>
    <P>Despite the promises that emerged from the CIEC negotiations there are no signs of any real change for the better in the general economic situation.  Low growth rates are still prevalent and there are high levels of unemployment.  The Brandt Commission Report says that if we are serious about the type of world we have a vision of or that we lay claim to have a vision of by the end of this century, we must heed this unique, independent investigation.  It stresses the need for major international initiatives.  I urge that we listen to the cry for help from the hundreds of millions of people who are starving in a world of plenty and who are living in conditions of absolute poverty and misery.  If we listen, we will be motivated to move to the fullest possible extent of our own capacity to do so.  It might be argued that it is unrealistic to suggest that the problems might be solved by the end of the century.  It can be done. If we can get the political commitment, the political will and if we get it into our minds that we must start now, we will have gone a long way towards achieving those necessary goals.</P>
    <P>There are considerably more people living in poverty today than there were 20 years ago.  It is a sad thing to say in a world of plenty.  It might be different if it was done on a percentage basis but more people are suffering from malnutrition. For example, in 1975, 15.5 million children of four years or less died.  Of the 15 million who died in the developing countries, half died from causes linked to hunger and malnutrition.  That is a serious indictment of our general behaviour north and south in the world.  If we command the moral strength, as the report urges, it will be possible to overcome the worst aspects, not all the poverty but certainly the worst aspects of it, by the end of this century.</P>
    <P>We must first of all realise that global inder-dependence is a reality.  We must recognise its implications and we must act upon this inter-dependence, not only from the north but from the south as well. We must act on the international scene <Col N="194" /> and also on the question of domestic policies.  A speaker &mdash; I cannot recall the name &mdash; in that symposium in Paris in 1978 urged some measures that would help or start work in the direction of the long-term goals.  He suggested that there would have to be a serious look at the question of an increase in the gross national contribution.  I cannot recall the way he put it but he urged the conclusion of international agreements on commodities, ensuring stable and remunerative prices.  He also spoke about a transfer of technology and urged that the developing countries would be encouraged to come into all international discussions on international negotiations.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the report demands that as Christmas and as responsible politicians we must quickly take initiatives and encourage all organised groups in the country.  I am prepared to make those suggestions, not only here, but in the trade union forum.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the western world, or the north, as the term is used in the Brandt report, towards the Third World was initially one of exploitation and colonisation.  In recent years it has tended to be a more humanitarian approach.  Ireland, which never attempted to exploit the Third World, hopefully because it did not desire to do so, but in any event because it did not have the ability to do so, has always had a humanitarian and a missionary approach to the Third World.  This has been expressed and implemented by individuals, by religious orders and by various organisations and institutions for well over a century.  We can say that during that time we, as individuals, organisations and so on, did play a meritorious part in attempting to help those in need in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brandt report is of particular importance and use in emphasising the fact that, even if we have no humanitarian interest, no humanitarian instincts, in regard to the Third World, that from the purely selfish and materialistic point of view, it is essential that there should be help given to the Third World.  We should ensure that there are acceptable trading <Col N="195" /> arrangements between the north and south.  It points out that this is essential from the economic point of view, the point of view of preserving world trade. It points out also that unless we accept that point of view and act to ensure that there is an acceptable trade between the two parts of the world the consequences from the political point of view could be catastrophic and would lead to war and global disintegration.</P>
    <P>The report points out that a very high proportion of western exports go to the Third World.  Unless a certain level of economic prosperity, although prosperity is an extreme word for many countries in the Third World, unless a certain minimum stability of the economic system in these worlds is maintained exports will suffer and in the end the north would suffer and follow the south to economic disintegration.  The north cannot ignore this message.  We, in Ireland, cannot ignore it; we are more dependent on exports, on international trade, than any other country in the north because we export almost half our GNP.  We must be concerned with this conclusion of the report and by the implications of a failure to look to the connection between north and south.  If we do not do so, we, as well as the south, will suffer very seriously indeed.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the ultimate result which is mentioned in the report.  We would be affected by the probability of international disorder more than most countries.  We would be vulnerable and unable to deal with it.  The message of the Brandt report is that no country, whether small like ourselves, or even the very biggest country, is now in complete control of its economic survival.  All the countries in the north are dependent on the south and other parts of the world for raw materials, energy and for trade in general.  It is only if there is an acceptable pattern of trade between the north and the south, and an acceptable two-way trade between the north and south, that the trade of the world can continue in an orderly, successful and prosperous way. This must not be merely a question of taking raw materials from the Third <Col N="196" /> World but taking their manufactured goods as well when these are available.</P>
    <P>Frequently complaints have been made about the unfair competition from Third World countries.  This refers in particular to textiles and the allegation is made that these are the products of cheap labour and cheap overheads.  It is suggested that there should be some kind of embargo or tariff on manufactured goods from the Third World because they are affecting the manufacturing industries in the north.  There have been a number of reports on this point.  Recent statistics show that Third World manufactured goods account for less than 2 per cent of goods consumed in the industrial countries as a whole.  <i>The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit recently reported on this allegation and said that the success, so far as there was success within a very limited sphere, of manufactured goods from the Third World countries was due to stronger labour discipline, higher productivity and more up-to-date plants. Many of these countries that have begun to manufacture goods have very up-to-date plants usually supplied by the north and have greater adaptability to new products.</P>
    <P>Another report by the United Kingdom Foreign Office surveyed 24 industries which were alleged to have been affected by imports from Third World countries between the years 1970 and 1975.  This report concluded that imports from these countries were responsible for displacing approximately only 2 per cent of the jobs in that area.  It pointed out that 75 per cent of United Kingdom textile imports came from non-Third World countries.  It pointed out that 10 per cent of manufactured goods imported by the UK came from Third World countries but that 28 per cent of the United Kingdom exports were to Third World countries, showing a trade surplus of £6.1 billion.</P>
    <P>It proves that this complaint about the danger of imports from the Third World countries is completely exaggerated, certainly to be considered, but not to be taken too seriously having regard to the fact that it is essential that there be a two-way trade in manufactured goods as well <Col N="197" /> as in raw materials and in other goods.</P>
    <P>The report that I referred to showed that of the decrease in 428,000 jobs, 52,000 were due to a fall in home demand, 214,000 were due to rising productivity at home, 20,000 were due to falling exports to non-Third World countries, 92,000 were due to rising imports from non-Third World countries, 800 were due to falling exports to Third World countries and 47,000 were due to rising imports from Third World countries.  These figures put into perspective the threat in so far as there is a threat, from the imported goods from Third World countries.  It emphasises the necessity of encouraging imports from these countries because it is essential to their economy to be allowed to export not only raw materials but manufactured goods of all kinds.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson is right in saying that the facts and recommendations in the report are not startling in the sense of being very original or new but that they are none the worse for that.  The facts are conclusive.  The conclusions are coercive. They show that the north must reconsider its whole attitude to the south.  There must be a new arrangement and a new order in respect of trade and general relations between the two parts of the world.  There must be increased trade, increased aid at all times and a massive increase in the help and understanding of the problems of the south.  This must be done very soon.</P>
    <P>The only startling things are the conclusions that are reached as to what will happen, both to the north and the south, if the recommendations are not accepted. We must try in this country, and in the north in general, to implement these recommendations.  We can play a part using such influence as we have in the EEC and in the United Nations but that is, perhaps, the least important thing we can do.  If we are convinced that the Brandt report is correct and that it must be acted upon, we must start by implementing at home, as far as possible, the recommendations of the report.  If we do that we will certainly follow on by playing our part in the EEC and in the United <Col N="198" /> Nations in so far as we can in those areas. But nobody who reads this report can be unaffected by it or fail to realise that unless it is implemented very soon the consequences spelled out in the report will take place.</P>

      <P>I should very sincerely like to compliment Senator Robinson and Senator Harte on tabling this motion and thereby focussing attention on a very pressing problem worldwide and one that people must surely take note of.  At the same time, when we talk about the North-South, people seeing this paperback report on the bookshelves could be pardoned for thinking at first glance that it had something to do with the North and South in an Irish context.  We have the problem also of enthusing the Irish population.  While we are discussing this North-South dialogue which is, in effect, the interaction between the rich and poor countries in the world, there are several thousand young farmers outside the gates of this House drawing attention to a crisis in their agricultural industry.  That should not take from the problem we are discussing.  We will have an opportunity of discussing problems on the home front at another appropriate time.</P>
      <P>We, as a small Christian country &mdash; I do not say we are developed but let us hope we are developing &mdash; have a great role to play in ensuring a more equitable distribution of wealth and perhaps a more acceptable standard for people throughout the world.  I have had the great experience over a seven-year period of working on the executive committee of the Lomé Convention, before that on the Yaoundé Agreement of visiting many of the underdeveloped and developing countries in Africa, in the Middle East and America.  One has to see at first-hand the problems of the two-tier society to be moved by them.  One cannot but appreciate the tremendous work carried out over a long number of years by the people who have served on the missions and indeed by the volunteer corps nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be useful very briefly to give the background to the setting up of the Brandt Commission.  Following the adjournment in April 1975 of the preparatory <Col N="199" /> meeting of the International Energy Conference the President of the French Republic invited Ministers, in September 1975, or those people who had participated in the earlier meetings, with a view to reaching agreement on holding a conference on international and economic co-operation.  Officially they commenced this work at ministerial level in December 1975, which meeting was attended by 27 countries, including nine developing countries.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation was to organise international economic relations on a more equitable basis by reducing imbalances between developing countries and industrialised countries, between producer countries and consumer countries.  This is a huge task. When we listen to some of the figures that Senator Harte mentioned we realise the problems there are.  Those participants included 19 developing countries and eight industrialised countries.  The House might be interested to know that they were: Australia, Canada &mdash; the EEC was represented by a single delegation comprising the President of the Council and the Commission of the European Communities, speaking with a single voice &mdash; Spain, the United States, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland.  At that meeting we were well represented.  Therefore it is appropriate that we discuss this report seeing that we were represented there very strongly from the beginning.  Discussion took place within four commissions &mdash; a Raw Materials Commission, an Energy Commission, a Development Commission and a Finance Commission. This was the organisation which Willy Brandt was asked to Chair and which, I think we all agree, carried out its task admirably.  This commission at least have focused the attention of the world on a great problem nobody dare sweep under the carpet.</P>
    <P>On the Raw Materials Commission it is true to say that agreements were reached on the principle of establishing a common raw materials stabilisation fund, measures for international co-operation in the field of marketing and distribution <Col N="200" /> of raw materials, measures to develop and diversify the natural resources of developing countries.  As regards trade, there was determination on the part of the participating countries to make substantial progress in the key areas of the Tokyo Round, the improvement by the industrialised countries of the generalised system of preferences, the promotion of exchanges of views with a view to enabling developing countries to enjoy better tariff preferences and the finding of a rapid solution to the problem of the multi-fibre agreement.  We come across these objections at international conferences.  There are so many abbreviations and so many conferences going on it is hard to keep track of them all.  Nevertheless, in that area alone considerable progress was made, despite the fact that they were unable to reach agreement on protection of the purchasing power of the developing countries, export earnings, the measures related to compensatory financing, various measures relating to world trade production control for synthetics &mdash; the competitive problems affecting us all &mdash; and investment in the field of raw materials. Tremendous work was done by this commission.  The very high-powered people who devoted their time and energy to it and their back-up teams have certainly recognised and isolated many of the problems.  I suppose it is not possible to hope that the solutions will be found in the short term for all of these problems. However at least we should be aware of them and endeavour to work towards their solution.</P>
    <P>On the Sub-Committee on Energy agreement was reached on the supply, conservation and exploration, the utilisation of traditional energy resources and the need to develop new energy resources in the developing countries.  On the Development Commission there was agreement on the launching of a special one billion action programme to meet the immediate needs of the low income developing countries, with the EEC agreeing to a contribution of 385 million units of account and commitment to greater official development assistance, assistance to infrastructural development, <Col N="201" /> particularly in Africa, and measures relating to agricultural development and food.</P>
    <P>In that respect it is useful to note that the common fund has not been set up but the special action will be implemented when negotiations on the renewal of the Multifibre Agreement have been concluded.  Another point that is worth noting &mdash; and I should like the Minister to indicate to the House the view of the Irish Government on the subject &mdash; is that Germany, Canada, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland have cancelled debts of the 29 poorest developing countries to the tune of 6,200 million dollars.  In the present international economic climate that is something that would be of great assistance to the poorer countries who surely must be experiencing great difficulty in balancing their books.  Given a chance, Irish people as a whole, who traditionally have been great supporters of the work of those who dedicate their lives to improving the living and working conditions of people in the developing countries would make an extra sacrifice, if the problems of many of those unfortunate countries were explained to them.</P>
    <P>We do not know what poverty is until we see the conditions in which people live in cities like Kinshasa, or in any of the towns or cities in Chad or Niger, in countries where people have absolutely nothing in the line of wordly goods, where even inexpensive medication would prove beneficial and helpful.  Here we should be looking to our people for a Christian response to the problems of those people.  Their position can be improved dramatically.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Ireland's development aid to overseas this year has been reduced somewhat.  Nevertheless, I hope the target of half of .7 per cent will be reached.  In the non-governmental aid section it would be a tremendous help to many of our people, whether they be actively engaged on the missions or in the volunteer corps, of the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; who have a section dealing with this and who have made such a tremendous contribution in countries like Lesotho and Swaziland, in places <Col N="202" /> where they have concentrated some of their aid &mdash; continued to enlist Irish people on the spot to ensure that the meagre resources we have provided are spent to the very best advantage.  Where co-operative projects have been established they have proved successful and beneficial to the local population.  We should double our efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>ILO estimate that there are over 700 million people who are destitute in the world, that is, people with absolutely nothing, hardly having clothes to wear. The World Bank puts the figure a little higher, at almost 800 million people. These kinds of figures, coupled with the figures Senator Harte gave the House, will perhaps make us realise that we need to make greater efforts in this country where, despite the ups and downs of the economy, in the main we are sheltered, have food and clothing.  We should, as a Christian society, make a greater contribution.  At the same time we would expect that the Government, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, would blaze a trail and perhaps redress the cutback made by the Minister for Finance in our contribution to the Third World this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this motion, clearly a most important one.  In effect we are talking about the management of the world.  Some figures have already been given to the House which do not do credit to the more powerful nations, particularly those that have been categorised as north or south.  My interest in this derives from a number of sources but particularly my chairmanship of the Sub-Committee on Economic and Industrial Affairs of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  Periodically we have looked at subjects which perhaps overlapped those of the Brandt report.  I am thinking of areas like energy, the European approach to energy, monetary policy.  That is one of my sources of interest. The other source arises in my capacity as a Lecturer in Business Administration.  I visit some of the south or developing countries, the less developed countries, periodically.  I will be spending next week <Col N="203" /> in Tanzania on a training programme for the heads of the semi-State bodies there. Therefore I have an involvement which allows me to see things at ground level.</P>
      <P>Because of that I intend to deal with one or two specific points.  One of the dangers in looking for a new socio-economic order &mdash; it is not just an economic order; it is a socio-economic order &mdash; is that one tries to tackle too much.  Most of the progress made and action taken on these matters is done not on an international basis but on a bilateral basis.  There are countries who for their self-interest will make arrangements with other countries.  In my view, the EEC is the only place where some attempt is made to find a community of interest which transcends the bilateral principle and where there is a tendency to have something which is a bit more international.  A few strains will appear on it.  For instance, strains can be observed in terms of the enlargement of the EEC, with Greece, Spain and possibly Portugal joining.  Arrangements made with Arab countries like Algeria, Tunisia and what are known as the Magreb countries for the export of their agricultural products, citrus products and so on will come under strain because once Spain and Greece join the EEC they will be entitled to the special privileges of membership.  At a conference I attended recently on this subject some representatives of those countries feared a drop of as much as 30 or 40 per cent in their exports to the EEC.  These are the kinds of problems that the future holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is: do we have the decision-making machinery internationally that is capable of dealing with it?  This is really what the Brandt report is about, amongst other things.  It speaks in very high-flown language about moral values, about economic order; it deals with a notion of equality, it deals with self-determination, all the good things.  But it is interesting, when you get down to a simple matter like the one example I have just given, that those Arab countries are going to be in a position in which they would lose 30 to 40 per cent of their exports, and most of their exports are agricultural.  How is that going to be dealt <Col N="204" /> with while we talk about settling all the problems of the world?  The only place where this will be sorted out is in the countries that have clout, and the countries that have clout are the countries that have oil.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the figures one finds that countries like Saudi Arabia have bilateral agreements with Belgium for the delivery of 400,000 barrels of oil a day, with France for 240,000 and West Germany, 186,000.  They will not have much difficulty.  But, as that goes on and as these countries develop, particularly the Arab countries, we are going to have a situation in which they will start to process their own feed-stock.  Instead of the petro-chemical industries operating in Europe and in the EEC on feedstock emanating from the Arab countries they will start to make bilateral deals.  They will say: we will give you 400,000 barrels of oil a day if you establish a petro-chemical complex of X size in our place and, when they do then the EEC industrial base begins to get a thump.  Without wanting to be too pessimistic, there are a lot of problems ahead.  It seems to me that it will be essential to start with a very clear-cut EEC policy on these matters. Obviously one solution is to get the energy policy right and I do not think it is right yet.  At present we are considering the energy policy in the Joint EEC Committee.  I hope that we will put forward a report which will allow us to debate this aspect of it later when perhaps the Minister might be able to take it as well.  That is just a specific example of a problem.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I was not here to hear Senator Robinson's opening speech on the motion.  It could be that we would concentrate a lot on the amount of money spent on overseas development aid and say that a country should spend more.  It is not just really a matter of the amount that is spent but rather of the approach that is going to be taken.  It is the decision-making structure, the institutional structure, the structure for co-operation and for consultation that are going to emerge that matter.  I think the money will flow then because the need will be clear.  For instance, the fact that the overseas development aid from the USA has been cut <Col N="205" /> back is a manifestation of a lack of understanding of the issues.  When one thinks that a jet fighter costs $20 million and that would supply 40,000 village pharmacies; when one thinks that in 1978 more than 12 million children under the age of five died of hunger; when one thinks that between 500 million and 1,000 million people are under-nourished, one realises that these problems are so immense that it is not just a question of the amount of money.  It is a question of the approach.</P>
    <P>The Brandt report has challenged our values and the approach of the main power groups.  The proof of that is that Willy Brandt himself was the Leader of the German nation and Edward Heath was the Leader of the UK.  When they were leaders what were they able to do about it?  Brandt admits in his report that his attitudes have changed, that he sees fundamental matters in a different light as a result of this report.  This is one of the main lessons to be learned, that the great leaders, when they had the power, did not know the problems and that they realised them when they examined them in this context.</P>
    <P>It is too big a subject in a short time to undertake the type of analysis I would normally like to undertake.  However, I thought I would throw up those few points as a contribution.</P>

      <P>Senator Mulcahy is right, of course: it is so big a topic that one feels very inadequate sitting in this House and presuming to make any real contribution to it.  Nevertheless, I want to add my voice and support this very praiseworthy motion.  Whether or not Senator Mulcahy is right, that the Brandt report is a real contribution, or whether in the rather startling interpretation last night, it is a great diversion from what should be done, according to Mr. Richard Gott, is debatable.  I want simply to confine my remarks to one point.  It is taking up what Senator Mulcahy touched on briefly, that is, that the whole question of disarmament is linked integrally with the question of a new economic order.  It is rather surprising that the Brandt report itself pays relatively little attention to this.  On page 8 of the report there is a <Col N="206" /> brief reference to the amount of money being devoted annually to military arms expenditure, pointing out, for example, that half a day's military expenditure could finance the entire malaria eradication programme of the World Health Organisation.  There are other equivalents attempted there and Senator Mulcahy mentioned another one.  Indeed in the bulletin of the Department of Foreign Affairs, &ldquo;<i>Ireland Today</i>&rdquo; of October 1980 in a long and very useful article on disarmament it is mentioned that over 1,000 million people lack adequate housing, 25,000 people a day die from waterborne diseases and in some countries the average family pays more in taxes to maintain the arms race than to educate their children.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is a syndicated article somewhat along the same lines citing a source called &ldquo;Third World media&rdquo; and mentioning that while there are astronomical sums being spent on military power 660 million people cannot afford the basic necessities of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The central point I <Col N="207" /> was making is that the armaments race, apart from its intrinsic obscenity, prevents in a very real way progress towards a proper world economic order.  I am not just talking about the incredible sums which the superpowers spend on armaments; I am talking about the way in which the developed countries cynically exploit the armaments markets and themselves shore up armaments by creating patron-client relationships with countries in the developing world.  Our European partners are pre-eminently guilty in this respect.  I am talking most of all about the way in which developing countries spend increasingly enormous sums on military pursuits in the face of the continued poverty of their own people.  The Iran-Iraq war is an obvious example of this, two countries who could spend their time more appropriately in building up their economies than in this drain of military energies and lives and resources in this regrettable war.</P>
      <P>Since 1960 military expenditure of developing nations has risen four-fold. There seems to be no halting this process. The point is, what can we do in terms of the motion to play our part?  The motion calls on the Government to respond positively both through Ireland's own approach to north-south issues and by promoting issues within the European Community and the United Nations along the lines recommended in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, first of all, that in pursuing our increasingly firm policy on disarmanent we are already making a contribution to building a new world economic order. The Minister has made clear his own personal commitment in recent times and our ambassador at the United Nations has also done so.  Another thing we could do is to help to discourage our EEC partners from pursuing the insanity of the arms race themselves &mdash; the United Kingdom and France are two obvious examples here &mdash; and if the Reagan directive is going to be observed there is going to be further waste of money on armaments. We could also attempt to use European meetings and assemblies in the broad sense to try to dissuade our partners from <Col N="208" /> exporting warlike material to developing countries.  Admittedly this is a crime which can be laid at the door of superpowers on both sides of the ideological divide.  The United States is No. 1 in the arms export market, the Soviet Union is No. 2, and Britain and France take up the next places.  At an Ireland-U.S.S.R. Society meeting at Liberty Hall about a week ago, I was glad to make this precise point, that the Soviet Union is equally guilty in the arms race and in its exploitation of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>This is something which comprises a very positive initiative.  It involves no more on our part than the integrity of our own commitment to disarmament and of course it goes without saying that since all this hangs together of a piece there can never be any question of this country committing itself or making its own contribution to the armaments race.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Brandt report shows us clearly how badly divided the world is.  &ldquo;North&rdquo; in the title of the report is synonymous with rich, &ldquo;South&rdquo; with poor.  The &ldquo;North&rdquo;, which includes all the highly industrialised countries, manufacturing over 90 per cent of the world's products, has a quarter of the world's population, but four-fifths of its income. The &ldquo;South&rdquo;, which covers all the less developed countries ranging from giant entities of great potential, like China and Brazil, to the smallest and poorest countries, contains three-quarters of the world's population, some three billion people, and only one-fifth of its income. Half the vast population of the &ldquo;South&rdquo; is illiterate.  There is a difference of at least 20 years on average between life expectancy in &ldquo;North&rdquo; and &ldquo;South&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and probably the most important and abiding purpose of the Brandt report is to carry forward the educative, evangelical work of the Pearson Commission, Robert McNamara's addresses and the reports of the World Bank, UNCTAD and many other agencies, in bringing forcefully to the notice of open-minded and reasonable people, particularly decision makers, that both justice and peace in this shrinking interdependent world require that we recognise and take urgent <Col N="209" /> action to ease the grave problems posed by the poverty, ill-health, squalor and hopelessness in which the lives of hundreds of millions of mankind are cast.</P>
    <P>In relation to health alone the report reminds us of some horrifying facts which I mentioned here before.  Amongst them are these.  There are still countries in Africa where one child in four does not survive to its first birthday.  Of the 20 million to 25 million children under five who die every year in developing countries one-third die from diarrhoea caught from polluted water.  Millions of children, through protein deficiency, fairly easily remediable, suffer an irreversible and permanent stunting of their mental as well as their physical development.  Others have mentioned the vast numbers who are undernourished and hungry.</P>
    <P>If these facts were more widely known I believe the response of the Irish public would be such that the Government would be strongly pressed to go steadily forward towards the present United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official aid.  We are less than half way there yet.  What is more important, the Government would be helped to do so by public acquiesence in the taxation necessary to make these transfers.  This year's cut back in official aid was very greatly regretted and the generous public response to voluntary appeals such as those by Trócaire should, I think, encourage the Government to renew and press forward with their commitments.  I may say, incidentally, that the Minister's decision to ease the severe restriction on APSO's funds this year by releasing an extra £100,000 was very welcome.</P>
    <P>I am sure that nobody in Ireland will be misled by the eccentric and extreme views presented in Dublin yesterday by Mr. Richard Gott of <i>The Guardian</i> and already referred to here tonight.  He was for destroying the whole international economic system, for letting the poorer countries hoist themselves by their own bootstraps inside their own frontiers, on the basis that aid from the richer countries was another form of imperialism and that we were imposing our own questionable patterns of development on them <Col N="210" /> when indigenous autarchy would be a saner and better solution.</P>
    <P>In my view this is nonsense.  Imagine the cruelty of leaving Bangladesh or Lesotho or Tanzania to fend for themselves forever forward.  It is a completely invalid argument as far as Ireland's motivation and operations in relation to overseas development co-operation are concerned.  Imperalism is no part of our motivation nor do we impose on any government in the Third World our views as to the pattern of development policy they should follow.  In our bilateral operations we are in those countries at their invitation and with their goodwill, to help through personal service or through specific projects.  We are cooperating with them, not imposing spurious recipes upon them.  The great merit of the bilateral programme is that we can make a contribution of lasting value, through education, through training in skills, improvement of irrigation, increase of food output, disease elimination and so on, a contribution compatible with the country's own assessment of its development needs and not confined to any élite but the fruits of which will be widely shared amongst the inhabitants.</P>
    <P>The Brandt report also put particular emphasis on the mutuality or interest between developed and developing countries.  They have a close common interest in the expansion of trade between them. We need the Third World at least as much as it needs us.  Senator Eoin Ryan a while ago stressed this point.  Already one-third of the manufactured exports of the EEC, the United States and Japan are going to the Third World and the proportion is rising.  I have spoken previously in this House and written in the press on this topic and all I need say now is that adjustment to the implications of a liberal and expansionist trading policy will not be easy, To maintain progress in living standards and job numbers here, or in other more developed countries, we cannot cling to out-moded and non-competitive forms of production.  We must keep moving up the scale in terms of quality, design and the amount of value added in the production process if we are to maintain or improve living standards <Col N="211" /> and provide sufficient jobs.  This will mean constant improvements in technology, retraining, up-grading of skills, adaptation, re-equipment.</P>
    <P>The Brandt report also deals with the need for the conservation of energy and for a global energy strategy which would substitute predictable for abrupt changes in the price of oil and also would provide for an orderly reduction in dependence on non-renewable sources of energy.  On out last sitting day I was making the case that it would be in our best interests and indeed of the world generally, if the major oil users and OPEC were to agree on a policy of maintaining the real price of oil in relation to other commodities.</P>
    <P>Everyone will pick out special points of interest from this wide-ranging report which deals also with disarmament, on which Senator Murphy spoke, on commodity price supports, as mentioned by Senator McDonald, on the international monetary system and various institutional matters, but all the discussion leads up to the report's unanimous recommendations for immediate action to achieve a substantial increase in the transfer of resources to developing countries and at the same time to make this transfer less discretionary, better underpinned financially, more automatic than at present.</P>
    <P>Differences of view or reservations about the specific merit or practicability of various proposals in the report must not be allowed to cloud its main message about the urgent need for action to ease the problems of the Third World.  The report rests on a strong intertwined foundation of humanitarianism and self-interest.  At the same time it stresses the essential responsibility of Third World countries to help themselves.  It encourages self-reliance.  It stresses the need for these countries to make social and economic reforms at the national level so that the poor will gain directly from growth and participate fully in the development process.  I think it is evident to us all that in many of these countries basic political and social reforms, including rearrangement of land ownership, for example, are needed and that radical improvements in administrative and <Col N="212" /> educational systems are at least as urgent and necessary as the receipt of aid or technical advice.</P>
    <P>The report is not entirely starry-eyed, evangelical or altruistic.  In his introduction Brandt says:</P>
    <P>Waste and corruption, oppression and violence, are unfortunately to be found in many parts of the world.  The work for a new international order cannot wait until these and other evils have been overcome.  We in the South <i>and</i> the North should frankly discuss abuses of power by élites, the outburst of fanaticism, the misery of millions of refugees, or other violations of human rights which harm the cause of justice and solidarity at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>There is one thought which this report should leave with us in Ireland &mdash; a determination steadily to strengthen the selective, well-planned co-operative contributions we make to the development of less fortunate peoples.  I would hope that his work would not be regarded as being done for charity or for self-interest as much as for our own moral development as a community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish briefly to add my voice to the comments that have already been made in this debate on the motion submitted by Senators Robinson and Harte <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Brandt report.  I am glad to see the Minister spending all of his time with us in this House.  I will start by congratulating him on his successful lobbying for the present Irish place on the Security Council of the United Nations and I suggest to him that his next mission might relate to the activity or lack of activity which we are discussing in this debate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many reasons why this is a very important matter for our country.  We are a small country, an independent country with a colonial background.  We are a country that has been relatively poor and which is much wealthier today than it has been.  We are a country that claims to have had a missionary spirit since the early centuries and an interest, perhaps sometimes hypocritical, in matters of the spirit, and for all <Col N="213" /> of these reasons any topic that relates to humanity, peace, an attack on poverty injustice or inequity in this world should be of paramount interest to this country and specifically to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In a spiritual sense it must be of interest if we are to be consistent with the history of this country and even in self-interest terms because we are a nation which carries the begging bowl occasionally to the EEC or to other world agencies and in the European context like to paint the picture of relative poverty.  We are a country that is based totally on an open economy and the notion of free trade.  For all of these reasons it even makes economic sense, apart altogether from the moral issue, to be in the forefront of these nations in the western world seeking equity in world affairs in this particular area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately when the chips are down the commitment here is not as it should be and, despite the moralising speeches of all of us in this debate this evening, the record of Governments in this country is poor and this year has been described as shameful.  I might be tempted to score political points from the benches of which I am speaking, but I will resist the temptation and follow in the apolitical tone of Senator Robinson by being critical of successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Against a United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP and a commitment within this country of two successive Governments to 0.35, we are talking this evening, against the background of moralising speeches, of a present position in which the Irish commitment is under 0.2 per cent, about £16.25 million, which is not satisfactory.  I know there are political realities.  I know it is said that there are no votes in foreign aid to the Third World.  I know that cynicism may be abroad to a degree in areas such as this. I take up the statement made by Senator Ryan that if we are convinced then this sincerity and conviction should start at home.  In the very simplest of terms, of course, bilateral aid, bilateral education facilities and training of management people in the Third World are important. Assistance in irrigation and in the agricultural world is immensely important, as <Col N="214" /> are lobbying in the EEC and the UN. Fundamentally, the extent to which an Irish Government are committed in this particular area will be measured in the first instance by the extent of their monetary commitment.  In this country of relative wealth &mdash; total wealth in comparison to the Third World &mdash; the commitment is not sufficient and we are in the middle of a recession.  It is probably the worst recession which has hit this country since the thirties and there are immense problems in business, in the agricultural community, and affecting the trade unions.</P>
    <P>However, I must advert to the commitment of Deputy O'Kennedy about two years ago when, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he spoke of the commitment by this country irrespective of financial pressures or trading pressures.  This commitment is in a totally different area; it has to be.  The commitment is not sufficient and I call on the Minister to lobby the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for a much stronger commitment which I believe will have the support of the people.  We witness the excellent work being done by the voluntary agencies and the money which they collect in voluntary contributions.  Their interest is obvious from the significant presence of a number of these people at this debate here this evening.  I am glad to see them here and welcome them.</P>
    <P>Brandt, in his introduction to this report, says very simply that the report is based on what appears to be the simplest common interest, that mankind wants to survive and has the moral obligation to survive.  He says that if reduced to a single denominator this report deals with peace. I agree completely with this synopsis.  It is too easy and too facile in the narrowest of terms to talk of the problems which may result to this country from an open policy.  It is too easy to point to the problems in the textile industry, the footwear industry, to look to the problems hitting specific industries.  Of course that is part of it and one has to be concerned.  On the other hand, as previous speakers have pointed out, immense benefits flow to the western world through a strong southern hemisphere in terms of trade, the extent <Col N="215" /> of exports to the western world and the spin-off in other more modern industries and technology such as in the microchip, electronics and other fields.</P>
    <P>Getting away completely from issues relating to trade, the central issue, as Brandt points out, is peace.  I am one who distrusts totally the Russian aims in the world.  I believe in a strong policy in the west against Soviet imperialism.  Having said that, I was in Beirut last January as guest of the Palestine Liberation Organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Without apology, Senator.  I was the leader of a delegation which met Mr. Arafat and we spoke about issues that affect Palestine and Palestinians.  We went as the devil's advocates and tackled him about issues which would disturb the western world and a country such as this and we spoke to him specifically about apparent rapport between the Palestinians and Russia.  He quoted Churchill back to us.  In one phrase he said &ldquo;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&rdquo;.  The single <i>rationale</i> for Palestinian rapport with Russia was on the basis that their perception of the world today was that their enemy number one, for very good reason, was the United States of America because of the American pandering to successive governments and the obsene pandering to the same Zionist elements in the recent United States Presidential campaign by all three candidates.  This obsenity put them into the opposite camp so that the enemy of their enemy was their friend.</P>
      <P>That is the <i>rationale:</i> if you are being victimised, if you are under the boot, if you are in poverty, if you are under an imperialist yoke, you are going to react very viciously.  If there is to be exploitation of the impoverishment of the southern hemisphere, if there is to be exploitatation of the inequity going back to colonial rule and if there is to be a continuing inequitable policy, then the southern hemisphere is ripe for exploitation by those in the eastern bloc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons what we are coming back to is not an issue of whether there <Col N="216" /> are going to be textile jobs in Ballyfermot or in Cork in a narrow economic context. What we are simply talking about is whether there is going to be a spill-over through this inequity into global conflict. There is a necessity for a sense of a mission today which is a parallel with the political missions within nations in the past.  There were substantial inequities within nations in the past, many of which have been removed, and there was a sense of political mission.  It took different forms; in some political parties it took the form of nationalism and in others it took the form of socialism or social democracy.  In other countries enlightened conservatism seemed to work.  I am not concerned about the labels but there was significant political progress within nation states to abolish inequity.</P>
    <P>The parallel today is that we have gone past the age of the nation state; the world is now very small.  It is a world where balance has certainly reached the point of there no longer being massive American dominance which could assure continuity along such lines.  The military position is absolutely perilous.  The world is becoming smaller and must be run on the basis of interdependence.  Interdependence in the world transfers the social conflict from issues within member states to issues with which Brandt deals.  The report is an extremely important document.  If nations do not respond to it revolutionary situations could result and one would not wish to contemplate the possible holocaust.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his recent success, but I stress to him that the report is taken extremely seriously in this House and this nation as we see it has a role to play.  The commitment of this country will be judged in monetary terms and I will applaud the Minister if he manages to get from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance a significantly increased commitment in the budget which we will be discussing in January and February of the coming year.  Of course, there must be a continuation of the bilateral arrangements and influence through moral leadership.  We cannot begin to adopt a moral stance in the European Economic Community or in <Col N="217" /> the United Nations unless we behave morally at home.  In that sense I would urge him to get into the forefront of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs at the EEC sources and initially in the United Nations.  That will reflect to the benefit of this country and we will be seen to play the very significant and enlightened part which we should be playing in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking in Seanad Éireann on this very important report.  Indeed, the description of it as a programme for survival is not in my view inappropriate.  It is probably the most important report that has come to hand in our time as far as every country in the world is concerned.  In my view it should be compulsory reading for every intelligent citizen in every state in the world.  It touches on the basics and the fundamental fact that in the modern world we are all interdependent and, apart from the moral aspect, the mutuality of interest involved makes it imperative that all parts of the globe grow apace in terms of standard of living and prosperity.  There is a sharing which ensures that this growth takes place throughout the world in a balanced manner.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the authors of the report, not just Herr Brandt but a number of other prominent statesmen, politicians and public figures from both the developed and the developing countries who came together independently, not under government instructions, and devoted their time to producing this non-technical report setting out in layman's language what exactly should be done in the whole area of the development of the world at the present time.  A tribute is due to the chairman, Willy Brandt, but I want to emphasise that there were gathered together on this commission a number of very enlightened people in various areas of public service who thought out, in my view, a very valuable and basic work which must be taken heed of.  For that reason I am very grateful to the Seanad and to the proposer and to the seconder of the motion for an opportunity to have an enlightened debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> A great array of developmental problems for the next two decades are tackled in the report, including the whole question of interdependence and mutuality of interest, food and hunger, economic co-operation in the south, energy, industrialisation, world trade and the world monetary order.  Highlighting current problems to be tackled urgently, it recommends an emergency programme for the next five years which would be an interlocking programme requiring undertakings by all parties and which would bring benefits to all.</P>
    <P>There are four principal elements envisaged in this.  One, a large scale transfer of resources to developing countries, secondly, an international energy strategy, thirdly, a global food programme and, finally, the start of some major reforms in the international economic and financial system.  The report provides a fresh global perspective of developing problems and underlines the interdependence between the developed and the developing countries and, of course, the relationship between development and world peace.  This has been referred to by Senator Staunton.</P>
    <P>Unless this whole area is tackled along the lines of the Brandt report one is laying the seeds for serious tensions, conflicts and disruptions, the sort of scene that can cause serious disruption of world peace and something more cataclysmic and horrific.  It is a very useful catalyst in my view in the important discussions to come in the north-south dialogue, and in particular in the view of global negotiations on economic co-operation for development which are expected to begin next year. The Brandt report fits into a situation where now within the UN there is a realisation of the importance of coming to grips with the global approach to this whole problem of economic and social development throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal at this stage with the proposed global negotiations.  We had discussions at the 34th session of the United Nations General Assembly and a resolution was adopted which decided that a round of global negotiations for development should be launched at a special session which just recently has been <Col N="219" /> held.  The inclusion of energy which is of paramount importance in the economies of both developed and developing countries is now recognised as part of the overall discussions.  The resolution adopted provided that the proposed negotiations should not only contribute to the solution of international economic problems and to steady global economic development but should reflect the mutual benefit, the common interest and the responsibilities of the parties concerned, taking into account the general economic capability of each country.  We had an initial discussion on this whole aspect at the UN special session from 25 August to 15 September 1980.  A number of north-south matters were discussed including the global negotiations.  It was not possible to reach agreement, but at the current session, having got over some procedural difficulties, it looks as if a wide measure of agreement is now about to be reached.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult area involving the status and competence of various specialised bodies in the international economic and financial spheres.  Here again there is some disagreement on how these bodies should be worked into the overall strategy so as to ensure that there is the required financial back-up for what is proposed.  However, it is hoped that by the end of this year we will, through the United Nations, have reached some finality on how to proceed on the whole aspect on a global basis.  It is all important to ensure that the UN and world financial institutions are brought in on whatever is proposed.  That is the important element at the moment which is to be settled.</P>
    <P>However, whatever the difficulties&mdash; and there are institutional and financial difficulties&mdash;the significant thing at this stage is that the international community has now decided to continue the north-south dialogue, to raise it on to a new level and settle the institutional and financial aspects that are outstanding. The principle that the whole matter must be treated on the basis of a global economy has been acknowledged.  The whole emphasis will be on the special problems in developing countries but also on the <Col N="220" /> aspect which has been referred to here by a number of speakers, that is, the aspect of mutuality involved.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of aid for developing countries, it is a matter of survival as far as the developed world is concerned.  This is the real aspect that is of tremendous importance and I was very glad to hear in the Seanad that emphasis was placed by Senator Robinson and a number of other speakers on this mutuality of involvement as far as the developed and developing countries are concerned. This is one of the key aspects in the Brandt report, this emphasis on the mutuality of interest and the interdependence of north and south.  Both sides in the dialogue stand to gain from a policy of co-operation.  The importance of economic growth in the north to economic development in the south is now fully recognised and it helps to provide expanding markets for the products of the south.  But now there is a further recognition, as far as the north is concerned, that the expanding markets in Third World countries are particularly important as far as the north and south are concerned.  The mutuality is quite clear as between north and south, each needs the other as far as markets and investments are concerned.  Indeed, the Foreign Ministers of the member states of OECD at a meeting in Paris last June, at which I was present, stressed the importance of constructive co-operation with the developing countries in the forthcoming international negotiations, to which I have just referred, with the aim of restructuring international economic relations in order to improve the functioning of the interdependent world economy and to help developing countries to achieve rapid economic and social development.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects I would like to refer to which add a certain gloss to what I have said and what has been said in the debate.  It is not a simplistic matter between north and south, between developed and developing countries.  It is impossible to regard the developing countries as a homogeneous group and I need hardly point out that there are real distinctions and differences between the <Col N="221" /> problems of semi-industrialised medium level income countries like Brazil, Singapore and Korea, and their problems are vastly different from those facing countries like Lesotho, Tanzania, Bangladesh and the Sudan.</P>
    <P>This is a cautionary note that I would like to sound in regard to the south itself. The Brandt report does point out that it is the governments and people of the south who have the primary responsibility for solving many of their own problems.  Ample opportunity exists, and it should be encouraged by the international community, for more co-operation at many levels between the countries of the south itself or within the southern area.  We have certain examples of that in ASEAN, for instance, where the southeast Asian nations have come together and the north and south American nations have come together in the Andean Pact.  There is a situation where in many countries of the south, the really least developed countries, no matter what is done in the way of development assistance, which is mainly coming from the north, from developed countries, it is of very little value unless there is a certain recognition and consideration adopted by some Third World southern countries towards their own neighbours.</P>
    <P>For this very reason Ireland has in its bilateral aid programme taken a very proper stand.  We have concentrated our programme on the very least developed countries.  Out bilateral programme is entirely concentrated on Lesotho, Tanzania and the Sudan, to mention three examples.  There are also further programmes envisaged in Rwanda and Burundi, the least developed of the south Third World countries, which are suffering themselves by reason of the behaviour and the attitudes of other Third World countries.  These are countries that do not have the energy and the oil resources that other Third World southern countries have.  I intend to continue this policy of concentrating, as far as our bilateral aid is concerned, on countries of this kind that really need help, particularly in the technical, advisory and professional areas.</P>
    <P>The United Nations itself has recognised <Col N="222" /> the point that I am making.  We are not talking about a Third World so much as a Fourth World.  We are talking about the part of the Third World that is lagging further and further behind its neighbours in the Third World who happen to be lucky in having basic resources such as energy and other commodity resources. The United Nations has recognised this and proposes to have next year in 1981 a major conference on the problem of the least developed countries.  This will afford the international community an opportunity of focussing on the problems of these countries and developing a particular strategy for them.  The Brandt report rightly highlights this problem of what one might call the poorest countries, and there is a special chapter devoted to them, and it advocates a particular action programme in their respect.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell over much on energy problems but the fact is that soaring oil prices, caused to some extent by Third World countries in the southern part of the world, have caused more serious problems for their own neighbouring poor countries who do not have the resources than they have caused for the industrialised countries.  They have posed problems for the industrialised countries and for the developed countries, but the problems they pose for their own neighbours who do not have these resources are infinitely more serious. However, as I have mentioned, energy is included on the agenda for the forthcoming global negotiations and it is very important that whatever arrangements are worked out, oil producers, many of them in the south, must have regard for the oil importing developing countries, their poor neighbours who obtain about two-thirds of their commercial energy from oil, an even higher proportion than the OECD countries themselves in the developed world.  These countries will remain particularly vulnerable to oil price increases from their neighbours.  For them the benefits of much growth in their economies can be wiped out by oil import costs.</P>
    <P>Some developing countries, indeed some of our Third World countries&mdash; again part of the cautionary aspect of <Col N="223" /> what I propose to say&mdash;have now got substantial surplus accounts by reason of oil revenues.  The recycling of these surpluses is an issue which must be tackled if conditions for stable growth are to be restored and maintained.  At the special session of the UN in August at which I spoke I mentioned that in my view a solution to this question of the recycling of oil revenues is an essential requirement and to be effective it must take an account of the interests of all parties.  The Brandt report points in this direction when it says that for the future:</P>
    <P>an accommodation must be sought between oil producers and consumers which will inevitably have to go beyond the question of oil prices alone.</P>
    <P>The report has been published at a most opportune time, in my view, when people are generally conscious of the essential nature of interdependence between nations, regions, peoples.  The fact that we are one global village certainly has been brought home to mankind as a whole arising out of the problems and the difficulties of the seventies.  To that extent some good has been done in that there is a greater awareness now that growth is not just something automatic, that expectations cannot be automatically raised or continued, that we are all depending on each other.  The whole debate here has been very much on those lines.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one or two aspects that arose out of the debate. There was the emphasis on the mutuality of interest.  In that respect I feel that we in Ireland, coming back to our own particular contribution in this respect, can best help in the whole area of enhancement of skills, for want of a better phrase; in so far as we can help, it is in promoting skills.  We are acceptable to people in the Third World; we are liked.  We have had problems ourselves as a growing nation; we have skills to pass on; we have engineers, teachers, doctors.  We can organise peat works; we can organise electricity stations and distribution applied to electricity.  We can advise on management in <Col N="224" /> setting up co-operatives.  We can give an impulse in many of these areas.  That is where we can contribute best and maximise what limited resources we have in making our contribution.  I feel very strongly that that is Ireland's particular role in our own small way, in how we can help.  I hope to spell that out in greater degree and get the necessary funds to emphasise that aspect of our contribution in relation to what financial help we can give, be it under APSO or bilateral aid or through the multilateral areas.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which is important and was referred to during the debate is the aspect of trade.  Trade is more important to these countries than aid.  Let us examine our conscience fully in this respect.  I agree fully with what Senator Whitaker said in this respect.  Because of our educational and training systems we must be going upwards in regard to our approach to industrialisation.  There are other primary areas of industrialisation that inevitably are being done and will be done by Third World countries, whether they be countries who are signatories to the Lomé Convention, countries who are part of the overall GATT operation, countries who are allowed trading concessions by us through our membership of the EEC and our membership of GATT.  Let us remember that if we embark on any campaign of protectionism <i>vis-á-vis</i> these countries we are doing them serious harm.</P>
    <P>Let us have no ambivalence about this. It is far more important to these countries that they trade rather than that we spend some money on them in some charitable guise or charitable way.  If they want, through their own self-reliance and their own self-help, to trade, then the very least we can do is allow them to trade freely.  It is nothing short of hypocrisy to talk about granting them extra money in the way of bilateral or other aid and at the same time seeking in any way to deny them the trade outlets for their reasonable industrial developments.  I say that because sometimes people can be ambivalent in that area.  As far as the Third World is concerned, trade is much more important than aid, and freedom in regard to trade.  We should not retreat <Col N="225" /> into any sort of woolly obscurantist protectionism and think that that is a way for helping ourselves temporarily.  That is all it is.  It is not a real way to help ourselves. The real way to help ourselves is to make use of and develop the more advanced specialised industries and technologies for which our education and training systems have been geared.</P>
    <P>There were a number of very good points made in regard to armaments.  It is horrific to think of the amount of money that is being spent at present on armaments.  The excellent summary that is being prepared by Congood on the Brandt report, which is being circulated to every Member of the Oireachtas emphasises this.  It says that money spent on development is extremely cheap compared to that expanded on, for instance, armaments.  It says that as Brandt points out the world's annual military bill now approaches 450 billion US dollars while official development aid accounts for less than 5 per cent of this figure and that half a day's military expenditure would finance the entire malaria eradication programme of the World Health Organisation, while the cost of one modern tank would finance storage facilities for rice which would save 4,000 tons each year and that the same amount of money would provide 1,000 classrooms for 13,000 children.</P>
    <P>We are talking in terms of a society in which a tank can be blown up in the desert in Iran at a cost of £1 million or a jet can crash into the desert in Iran or Iraq at a cost of £10 million.  This is the sort of counter-distinction and conflict of values that we have at present.  This must be tackled because it leads me to the conclusion that I would like to make. Unfortunately this report, while excellent, came at a difficult time as far as the world's economic and financial situations are concerned and there are budgetary restrictions and restraints placed on every economy in the world, particularly in the developing world.  Those are facts. Things have levelled out or down according to how one looks at it.  So where is the money to come from, where is the transfer of resources to come from as <Col N="226" /> envisaged in this report?  The only area from which it can come is the one obvious area of growth over expenditure existing in western societies as a whole.  It is only through there that one is going to get the transfer of resources required really to implement this report.  I do not see the substantial transfer of resources that is required to implement this report coming about unless there is something seriously done about the armaments race and the advancing cost investment in regard to armaments as far as the developed world is concerned.  That is the big area of over-expenditure, the big area of over-cost and the big area where a real transfer of resources should take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  That is a matter for the Estimate and the budget and I have to argue out my particular case.  This year there was an increase of 22 per cent on the previous year, compared to the figure allocated for the previous year in development aid.  I agree that we need to do better, that we have committed ourselves within the UN to the UN target of 7 per cent of GNP to be achieved by the end of the eighties. All of the developed countries and the developing countries came together and the reached agreement.  That was part of the negotiations that I was talking about which took place in September and that agreement has been reached.  At the moment we stand at 2 per cent and we hope to achieve 7 per cent of GNP by the end of this decade.  At that we are playing our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some countries who play no part at all in this.  Some countries within the United Nations say that development aid is a matter for the ex-colonial countries and that they have no particular responsibility, or conscience to salve, or contributions to make in this respect at all, good, bad or indifferent.  Let us be frank about it, these are the countries in the eastern European world; Soviet Russia and some other countries take that view.  It is salutary and necessary to say from time to time that this particular can <Col N="227" /> is being carried almost to a total extent by the democratic countries of the free world.  That is a very sad and a hard thing to say but let us say it and let us have it out here.  Frankly, that is what any debate is about.  The Soviet Union and a number of other countries choose not to participate in this area of activity at all.  It is a salutary point.</P>
    <P>One other way in which funds could be increased would be in the recycling of funds.  I referred to this earlier on.  If we can get the finance institutions of the United Nations working in such a way that oil revenues can be re-cycled to a greater and more efficient degree to the countries that require them, that would be one area of potential financial investment to implement the Brandt report. The other area which I have mentioned is substantial multilateral agreement on the reduction of expenditure on armaments.  Those are the two areas from which funds can be obtained.  Other than that, due to the financial constraints of the moment, I do not see any other areas where one can obtain the necessary finance to effect the transfer of resources required to implement what is a monumental, constructive, responsible report, one of the great reports of our time. Unless we implement it, however we must do it, there we are into serious trouble as a world.  I have just advanced two areas in which we can secure the funds to implement the report.  One is the recycling of oil revenues and the other is the reduction in the armaments race.  Unless those two areas are tackled I do not see any other way, in the embattled state of the free world's economies at the present time, in which the transfer of resources to implement the excellent recommendations there can be effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who participated and the Minister who sat throughout the debate and also participated.  However, I would like to tell the Minister, as politely as possible, at the end of the debate that I <Col N="228" /> am very disappointed with his contribution.  I feel we were entitled to have some expectation of what the Government were going to do as a consequence of appreciating the magnitude of the problem outlined in the Brandt report. Indeed, if I were Minister for Foreign Affairs and had listened to this debate I could only be encouraged by the response.  On all sides of the House there was a shared appreciation of the depth of the problem, of the human misery and suffering which occur throughout the world and of the need for urgent action. The Minister could know that we would welcome any proposals that he was prepared to make, and support any initiatives that he himself would like to take, whether these would ultimately get through the Government and bureaucratic machine.  But we have not heard that at all.  I wonder would the Minister like to come back on that?  He said that Irish aid had been increased by 22 per cent over the figure for 1979 and he waved the Congood analysis of the Brandt report liberally at us.  Let me refer to a paragraph in page 9 of that analysis where under the heading &ldquo;Implications for Ireland of the Financing and Costings of the Brandt Report&rdquo;, this Congood summary puts the matter very clearly.  It says that the Brandt report was published in the spring of 1980; that almost simultaneously with its publication Irish bilateral aid was cut by almost 40 per cent by the Government, thus reversing what had been a growing programme for development assistance to the Third World based on, it had appeared, a predictable annual increase towards the UN 0.7 per cent of GNP target.  On this subject I have already referred to the more detailed breakdown of the figures in the study produced by the Irish Commission on Justice and Peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is at least addressing himself to the figures because this is a very essential part of what we are discussing.  The Brandt report will lose a great deal of impact in Ireland if the Government do not use it to promote the need for greater official support from Ireland to match what has been well tabulated as a willingness, even in times of economic recession and hardship, for voluntary contributions to increase when an appeal is put out and when the urgency of the needs is seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would contribute to the debate by giving this kind of leadership here in the House and by showing that the Government intend to use the Brandt report and other resources to bring home the importance of Ireland's contribution being increased both in the bilaterial and multilateral aid programmes.  Indeed, the bilateral aid must also be more visibly based on developmental principles and not as tied as some aspects of the bilateral aid are at the moment.  Our bilateral programme is rightly concentrating on the so-called Fourth World, on the least advantaged countries.  But I think we can do more on basic development lines in our bilateral aid.  A lot of our multinational aid is obligatory.  We have to contribute because of our membership of the EEC, the United Nations and the International Development Authority.  There is not the time now, nor an adequate opportunity to develop more fully the reasons for my disappointment at the lack of more specific commitment &mdash; or even willingness to work for that commitment &mdash; by the Minister speaking on behalf of the Government.  I hope that he will be influenced by this debate and by further debates in <Col N="230" /> the next few weeks on the Brandt report and on the critical analysis of Ireland's attitude towards the Third World.</P>
    <P>I would find it impossible to try to summarise the contributions by individual Senators.  They covered a wide range. A number of important areas were discussed and a number of important points were made on those areas.  Many Senators felt a constraint that I felt myself, that it is very difficult in the course of a three-hour debate to cover adequately the large number of issues and problems and challenges in this whole area that are covered by the Brandt report.  This leads me to suggest that there is a need &mdash; I know that I am not the only one who feels it; it is increasingly recognised by individuals in the political parties, by Members of this House and the other House&mdash;for an Oireachtas committee, preferably a formal joint committee, on development aid and co-operation. There is a need to establish through motions in both Houses a committee of Members representative of the political parties and independent Members who could, over a longer period, both acquire expertise themselves and have a back-up and continuity of information.  Apart from the need for this from the point of view of educating individual Members and giving us a better opportunity in a more structured way to deal with these problems.  I would very much agree with the argument put forward both in the report of the Irish Commission on Justice and Peace, &ldquo;Ireland in the Third World; A Study of Government Aid&rdquo; and in this Congood report, that unless we move, at least to some extent, in all-party way it is going to be difficult to finance the kind of moral commitment and goodwill which we would like, or indeed to take the tough decisions in relation to trade with developing countries; allowing access to our markets; not using our position in the EEC to try to close off the access to those markets of Third World countries and to be able to have a more structured approach to our development aid so that we do achieve the official UN target.  It was the one commitment the Minister did make; he referred to the fact that it was &ldquo;hoped&rdquo; to reach the target of <Col N="231" /> .7 per cent of GNP by the end of this decade.  But we are not beginning to take steps to do that and the longer we wait the more difficult it is going to be actually the move towards achieving it, to get halfway there, and then to get all the way there.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy, and one or two other Senators, tried to place the emphasis less on the money or the transfer of resources from Ireland to developing countries, and more on other approaches, and the Minister mentioned the importance of the transfer of skilled people and skills as part of the contribution we can make.  I do not think we can evade the issue like that.  The Minister talked about some countries, particularly eastern bloc countries which have not made any contribution at all, who are outside this.  But the United Nations have set down a minimum target for official aid.  Other western European countries, for example, the Netherlands and Denmark, have already reached that target.  It is not a very high target, it is not pitched at a level that the developed countries could not possibly reach.  It is a minimum set down by the United Nations if we are to begin to meet the responsibility on us.  Therefore, I was disappointed on that score that the Minister was not more specific.</P>
    <P>This is not something that we can adequately discuss and debate in a three hour session in this House, and I would hope that the Minister would support the idea of the establishment of a joint committee on development co-operation so that that committee would have the possibility of availing of the resources of voluntary organisations and having meeting with members of voluntary organisations, using the resources of his Department and of other Departments involved in specific issues, for example, the Department of Energy on energy problems and the Department of Industry Commerce and Tourism on trade problems and in this way we could build up a much more structured response.</P>
    <P>Another issue which surfaced a number of times in the debate, and which cannot be emphasised enough, is the need for a structured policy carrying over <Col N="232" /> from year to year in relation to our approach to development.  Again I had hoped the Minister might give us some indication of present Government thinking on this.  He spoke about financial constraints and financial difficulties and he said that Irish aid would be a matter that he would have to fight for in terms of the Irish budget.  But it is precisely to prevent that being a vulnerable question every year that one would look to the Minister for the kind of initiative which will give us a genuine policy and strategy so that the matter will roll over from year to year on the basis of a planned approach and that we can then go on from there.</P>
    <P>There is just one final matter because this has been a long debate and a number of Senators have sat here throughout it and I do not want to delay the House.  A number of Senators mentioned the importance of education to promote an understanding of the interdependence of the world, of the acuteness of the problem, which is perhaps particularly necessary for those of us who have not had the first-hand experience of the sort that Senator McDonald and Senator Mulcachy described, of visiting and seeing the completely different world in which so many families and children grow up&mdash;or sadly do not grow up &mdash; who die or live in malnutrition and such situations of unacceptable deprivation.  I believe that education about development issues is extremely important and that we can do far more along those lines, where Government money would be very well spent.</P>
    <P>We are doing a little at the moment and we can extend that.  I would like to see it extended right down to the primary schools.  I would like to see children in primary schools getting a perception of development issues and seeing the world as a small interdependent world, so that as they grow older it will be much easier for them to relate the needs and accept the hard issues about increased taxation because of an understanding of their own relationship with peoples and with communities in other countries.  I would like to see some evidence of strong Government support for education on development issues and for the research and initiatives that are going on in this area.  I <Col N="233" /> know there are very important initiatives being taken.  I do not think the overall budgetary expenditure would be all that great; we would not be talking about very large amounts but the money would be extremely important and very well spent. Indeed, I would view the proposed Oireachtas joint committee on development issues as being part of our education as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I felt that the Minister in addressing himself to the issues raised in the Brandt report spoke too much about the responsibility on the world and on world leaders of the developed countries, and did not discuss the issues from the perspective of looking at what we can do in Ireland: what we are doing and what we can do radiating out from there.  I had hoped, for example, that as a member now of the Security Council he might have been able to tell us whether this will improve the possibility of furthering initiatives and of drawing attention to the urgency of even, for example, disarmament, the issue which the Minister supported strongly and that Senator Murphy raised.  Are there ways in which Ireland can raise this more directly in the Security Council now that we are a member? However, these are now matters that we will have to leave for another day.</P>
    <P>I will end by once again thanking the Leader of the House for arranging a fixed time for this debate.  That has been very helpful to all of us who wanted to participate.  I thank the Minister for attending throughout the debate and speaking during <Col N="234" /> it and the other Members of the House for what I think was a very thought provoking debate.  We certainly have not solved or resolved any of these issues in the course of the last three hours, but I think we have improved our own understanding and hopefully strengthened our commitment to play a part both individually and as a country in trying to meet what I believe, and what the Minister made clear, is the most fundamental issue of our time.  I would agree with the Minister that this is one of the most important reports or our time and we must all reflect on it further and seek to implement its recommendations.</P>
